These are one of a kind, and only one for each demon will be made.  See below for scroll details.\n BUCKSKIN SCROLLS NOW UNLOCKED!!! See below for description.  THESE ARE AN ADD ON OPTION. \n As of the creation of this campaign, the page count is well over 200 pages. \nBUCKSKIN SUMMONING SCROLLS ARE NOW UNLOCKED!\nPLEASE KEEP READING, ALL WILL BE EXPLAINED...\nPLAY\n\n\n\nI started gaming in the early 80's, and I'm pretty sure I started at a way too early age. By the time my friends and I got a handle on how to actually play the game of D&D, the Satanic Panic had hit.  And so like a lot of young players, into a box in the basement my books went, for fear that I might make a pact with the devil with just a simple roll of a D20.\nThe fan-art based books that I create are the types of tomes that I would have loved to have had as peripherals as a young player, and even now more than ever.  I want to create something that makes the game more immersive and cater to the individual player, such as the illustrated spellbooks that are almost at completion for the 8 schools of magic.  (Back issues can be found here -  PhilStoneIllustrations )\nWhich brings me to The Demonology of Lire Goest. \nArtistically, this grimoire is modeled after several books from the past, most notably, The Demonology of King James the 1st (who actually coined the term Demonology), The Grand Grimoire, and The Lesser Keys of Solomon.\nThere are 3 to 5 pages for each named demon or creature complete with stats from either 3.5 or 5e.  There is also a summoning spell and sigil should the Dungeon Master or player decide to make things more interesting during the game.  A personal grimoire is added at the back for your own inscriptions and conversions.\nLire Goest was evil to the point of insanity.  His personal recordings while travelling through the abyss have been recorded on the living skins of the residents of Eastbourne, only to be flayed off the carcass to be used as summoning scrolls for later use.  Lire Goest desired power and infamy.  This is the one and only recorded tome of his existence, his interplanar travels, and his diabolical magic.  It has been so extensive, that two volumes had to be created.\nWHAT IS THIS BOOK, AND WHY IS THERE NO PDF??????\nNo, there is no PDF version of this book.  It is not formatted as a quick reference piece.  It is a grimoire to haunt your bookshelf.  Although there are stats and what not for each summoned demon,  it is not like my spellbooks (which will always have a PDF) where one can pull up something on the fly.  No, I want you to be able to touch it, peruse it, experience it.  This is how I always wanted a Necromantic tome to be.  I want you to hold it, show it off.  I started these projects as immersive peripheral props to be the character that you play.  There are summoning circles, protection wards for those who are summoned, and one hell of a backstory to the most infamous necromancer who started this grimoire.  \nThe Demon List for Vol. 1\nAdaru, Alkilith, Armanite, Babau, Balor, Baphomet, Barlgura, Bebilith, Bulezau, Carnage, Charon, Chasme, Demogorgon, Demonthorn Mandrake, Destrachan, Draegloth, Draudnu, Dretch, Evistro, Fraz-urb'luu, Gadaacro, Glabrezu, Goristro, Graz'zt, Hezrou\n\nSUMMONING SCROLLS\nAt 5k I will unlock the ability to pledge for the one of a kind buckskin scrolls.  These are one of a kind and only ONE will be made by CaveGeekArt for each demon.\nAbout CaveGeekArt work:\n            Cave Geek Art creates unique, handmade artwork using ancient materials and techniques combined with pyrography. By burning designs into traditional brain-tanned buckskin, he sculpts the leather into a three-dimensional relief that brings the images to life! Any color added is done with natural pigments, applied with bone tools.\nScrolls:\nSize- The scrolls are roughly 11x17\u201d in size, but may vary depending on the specific design. Each is one-of-a-kind, and some may have additional pieces attached to them.\nWeight- Roughly 4oz\nTurnaround- Assuming all materials are on hand (quality buckskin can be difficult to acquire), a scroll can take many hours to create, and probably up to 2 weeks per scroll.\nPrice- Each scroll is a 450.00 pledge plus shipping.\nThe scrolls WILL NOT go into production until the money has been collected from Kickstarter. Regular updates will be given as scroll production is ongoing.\nPLAY\n\nAt 10k, we will unlock PRINTS of the scrolls.\nScroll prints are 11 x 17\nEach print is a 20.00 pledge plus shipping\nExample of scroll print", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenge is not being funded\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Hardcover Leatherette copy of the book", "descp": "Get a hardcover, leatherette bound, and foil stamped cover version of the Demonology Grimoire.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["138 backers", "Add-ons"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Enchantment spellbook is live and more!", "update_content": "The feedback through messages and comments for this book have been amazing, and for that I want to thank you all!

They can easily be adapted to most fantasy role-playing games, including the Advanced 2nd edition game, the Original game, the B/X or BECMI (\u201cBasic\u201d) games, old-school renaissance (OSR) role-playing systems, and most other FRPG game systems. All DGG products are designed to evoke the look and feel of the classic D&D modules of the early and mid-1980s. These adventures have minimal plots that allows you to easily fit them into any campaign world.\n\nBoth modules will be available in print and eBook PDF versions. The print versions feature the classic module format with stapled booklet and a removable two- or three-panel cardstock cover. The maps are printed in classic dungeon blue on cover's inside for that genuine old-school gaming feel. As with all DDG products, creating a module of quality production, artwork, and printing is the paramount goal of this project. \n\nYour support of this Kickstarter ensures the production of more fantastic classic-style adventures from Dungeoneers Guild Games in the future, and helps keep old-school dungeoneering alive and vibrant for years to come.\nRumors speak of a mysterious silver tower that shines like a polished mirror that has recently appeared out of thin air. Bizarre creatures believed to have emerged from the tower roam the land. The few learned sages that know of it suggest that the tower is really a dimension-hopping fortress. Possibly some adventurers could go to the tower to find out why it has come here?\n\nDD4 Secret of the Silver Spire is a 52-page module for characters levels 3 to 7. In this adventure, the player characters explore an outlandish citadel inhabited by strange creatures, such as the barzani ape-men, modrons of many types, and three-faced golden sentinels. The enigmatic overlords are the \"silver masters\" \u2014 alien beings  made of pure energy. The tower is a maze of rooms stuffed with strange equipment and curious items these creatures have collected from all over the multiverse.\n\nArtwork\nThe module contains eighteen original black-and-white illustrations by Ryan Jack Allred, Jonathan Bingham, Jeff Laubenstein, Bradley K. McDevitt, Stefan Poag, and Peter Saga. Russ Nicholson (of Fiend Folio fame) created the outstanding and colorful cover art featuring the Spire and its alien inhabitants.\n\nFeatures\nA 52-page saddle-stitched booklet printed in black-and-white.\nA removable, two-panel cardstock cover printed in color.\nEight level maps.\n153 numbered encounter areas, adventure background for the GM, and scenario hook suggestions.\nSix new monsters: barzani, flame harlequin, flying bloodworm, golden sentinel, silver master, and tselmoi.\nSixteen new magi-tech items.\n\nStefan Poag's illustration of some of the inhabitants of the Spire.\nSome rogue modrons undergoing \"reeducation\".

No one knows what exactly lies behind its mudbrick walls. Surely vast treasures fill its fresco-lined chambers, and doubtlessly terrible guardians keep the unworthy from claiming them.\n\nDDS1 The Sacred Temple of Erwadu is a 36-page module with a world-generic setting for characters levels 7 to 10. In this adventure, inspired by the mythology and culture of the ancient Sumerians, the players explore a ziggurat located in marshy river delta. The characters must survive the four deadly levels of the temple to escape its mudbrick walls. This adventure contains background notes, a cutaway map of the temple, five new monsters, and six variable endings. Additionally, this special module contains original thirteen illustrations to show the players. The referee can opt to play this module one of two ways \u2014 as a \u2018Living\u2019 or, \u2018Lost\u2019 temple.\n\nArtwork\nThe module contains twenty-two original black-and-white illustrations by Jonathan Bingham, Darlene (ex-TSR), Earl Geier, Jeff Laubenstein, Mark Lyons, and Frank Scacalossi.

All that is needed is a group of inquisitive adventurers to investigate the veracity of these claims. Foul sorcery, evil doings, and horrid beings from the blackest pits stand to thwart the meddlesome heroes. An adventure for characters levels 5-8.\n\nDD2: DUNGEONS OF THE DREAD WYRM: No one has seen the wicked red dragon, Felmurnuzza, ravager of the northlands, for decades. Some believe that she has perished, while others believe that she sleeps away the years ensconced in her fortress-like lair. Rumors suggest that over the centuries she has amassed a vast hoard of treasure that is second to none. Cunning traps, devious tricks, and powerful guardians defend the dragon\u2019s dungeons from would-be looters. This challenging adventure is for characters levels 10-15.\n\nDD3: THE MISTY HALLS OF KAL\u00c1VORKA: A lost vale located in a high mountain range is home to a clan of mysterious giants. Sages believe the giants have strange powers that no other of their kind possesses. Yet, no one has heard anything from these giants in decades. Do they still dwell in their misty fastness? Do they really possess these reputed powers, and if they do, what are they? Crafty giants, evil gnomes, and a weird guardian await any adventurers who go seeking the lost halls. An adventure for characters levels 5-7.\nDUNGEON DELVE SIDE QUEST 1: SHIPWRECK AT HAR\u2019S POINT: Nothing much usually happens in the sleepy fishing hamlet of Har\u2019s Point. Recently, however, a ship has crashed on the rocks outside of town. Now rumors concerning treasure it supposedly carried are running rife amongst the fisherfolk. Some of these rumors hint that dead sailors from the ship are now walking the nearby beaches at night. Even more concerning, a mysterious stranger has been spotted around town. A few inquisitive adventurers might be able to discover what exactly is going on in Har\u2019s Point. An adventure for characters levels 1-3.\nAbout the Project Designer\nMy name is R. Nelson Bailey. My start with playing role-playing games began with Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in 1983 and has never stopped. For the last 18 years, I have run a weekly AD&D game with a group of dedicated players. As with many kids of the day, I dreamed of having TSR publish one of my modules. Now I am doing that with Dungeoneers Guild Games. DD4 Secret of the Silver Spire and DDS1 The Sacred Temple of Erwadu are part line of classic-style adventure modules. The fifth Dungeoneers Guild Games project will come out later in 2021.

Every other Monday night we got together at Garret's house and had a ball role-playing into the early hours of the morning.  After COVID, the group dispersed.  We tried to transition online but couldn\u2019t recreate the in-person magic.  Meanwhile, I was DMing a game for my family online.  It was a great way to spend time with my brother and cousins who live in another state, but the role-playing wasn't as engaging as Garret's in-person campaign.  So during this last year of social distancing I've thought a lot about using digital tools to create great role-playing experiences online.  This project implements ways to engage players online including beautiful battle maps, short videos and narrated box text.  \nELEMENTS OF A 5E NATIONAL PARK\nBelow are the elements of a 5E national park.  These come as a coherent pdf.  For example, there is a picture of the battle map that has \"room numbers\" overlaid on it. Then there is \"box text\" that describes those \"rooms\".  Finally, the box text has an embedded audio file so that when you click on it the pdf reads the box text.  \n\nAdditionally, all the digital files also come separate from the pdf so that you can easily upload the maps, monsters, video and audio into your favorite virtual table top or creatively incorporate them as separate elements into your in-person campaign.\nBattle Map\nA 40 x 30 battle map that is 162 pixels per square.  It comes in a simple sketch version (great for a player handout), detailed black and white version, full color gridded (square), full color gridded (hex) and full color ungridded (clean) versions.  \nPhotos \nFive real world photographs of the national park.  These photos are used by the cartographer and point of view artist to inspire their work.  Specific features from the photos are incorporated into the battle map.  For example, look at the dark crevices in the photograph of the cliff below (no, they are not caves in the real world).   These feature prominently on the battle map and in the point of view art.  In your campaign they might be caves!  The pictures are fun for general inspiration and as player handouts.   \nPoint of View Art\nThe point of view art corresponds to a specific location on the battle map.  It is drawn to represent the field of view of a character standing at that point.  \nMonsters\nEach monster comes with a picture, token, and 5E stat block.  The monsters may be 5E OGL or custom monsters. Regardless of origin, they fit thematically with the national park, and may be inspired by real world animals, such as the Dire Big Horn Sheep that TPK\u2019d my test party in the Badlands. \nVoice Acting\nThe box text from each national park is read by a professional voice actor.  DMs can click on the box text in the pdf to play the audio.  Each national park comes with 200 words of voice acting.  Click on \"Play\" below to check it out!\nPLAY\n\nMovie\nThe movie introduces the 5E national park.  It incorporates some of the voice acting, photography and potentially the point of view art.  It is one minute long. \nPLAY\n\nSHARD TABLETOP\nAll Rewards (minus the $1 fan & map only) come with the 5E National Park also delivered as a Shard Package.   This is in addition to the pdf and other digital files. \nSOCIAL GOALS\nThe 5E Inspired by The National Parks Facebook Group is this project's social media focal point.  Social goals are unlocked when people join the facebook group - so please join it and invite your friends who would enjoy this digital content to join it! \nIn the facebook group you can vote on which national parks should inspire this content, provide feedback on concept art and enjoy a fun community!\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$4,500:  Overland Map\nOne overland map for each park based on the real world topography and scaled to 1 hex = 1 mile.\n$6,000:  Battle Map\nAn additional Battle Map for every 5E National Park!  Along with the overland map, this second battle map allows each park to become a mini-adventure.\n$7,500:  Battle Map\nAn additional Battle Map for every 5E National Park!\n$9,000:  Additional National Park!\nThe base Park Package plus all unlocked social and stretch goals.\n$10,500:  GIFs!\nEach 5E National Park will include a monster GIF!  These are fun to play when a monster makes a critical hit or does its signature attack.  \nADD ONS", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk is that I am the driving force behind The Basement War Room.

Perhaps I should be saying this to my Kickstarters Anonymous group, but whatever.  We're here, we love games, let's do this!\nBefore I forget, here's my blog:  Venger's Old School Gaming Blog. \nSince creating Cha'alt and Cha'alt: Fuchsia Malaise (I'll put some review links in the FAQ area), I've been writing adventures for my eldritch, gonzo, science-fantasy, post-apocalyptic campaign setting.  Before releasing Book III in the trilogy (hopefully 2022), I want to get these short scenarios out there.\nAlso, I need to sell more luxury hardcovers of the first two books before embarking on the third.  A lot of my money is tied up in inventory. More on that later.\nBelow are some WIP maps I've drawn during my pandemic downtime...\nWhat kind of adventures are we talking about here?  Low to mid-level, sword & sorcery with lasers.  These will be 10-page one-shot scenarios that both expand the world and drill deeper into what makes a Venger Satanis adventure - weird, grindhouse, pop-culture, mash-up that's both humorous and deadly!\nIf that sounds like your cup of tea, please back this project.  And tell others - that's important.\nThe first adventure is titled Six Hours To Save Cha'alt.  It's about a meteor on a collision course with the planet.  Only the PCs can avert disaster.  They have to venture inside a sleeping spawn of an Old One in order to find the tech that can save Cha'alt.\nThe second adventure is about a man with a crazy scarf whose death leads the PCs to guarding the Federation President before their starship plummets into Sanz Egra'as - a maximum security prison zone on Cha'alt.  Yeah, that's going to be fun for the whole family!\nWe're talking eccentric NPCs, new monsters, awesome locations, weird artifacts, maps, artwork, strange and familiar ties to this campaign world (along with various other things I've written along the way... Islands of Purple-Haunted Putrescence, Liberation of the Demon Slayer, Alpha Blue, Dead God Excavation, etc.), and your favorite - RANDOM TABLES.  It's going to be insane.\nI've got ideas for the third adventure (coming up with stuff has never been a problem for me), but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  This thing has to fund before we get into stretch goals...\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$2,000 - Two Adventures\n$3,000 - Three Adventures\n$4,000 - Four Adventures\n$5,000 - Five Adventures\n$6,000 - Six Adventures\n$7,000 - Seven Adventures [7 sweet-ass scenarios for $5?  Are you for serious?  That's better than the party's assassin murdering the party's bard before reaching the dungeon!]\nOk, you may be wondering why I'm selling more Cha'alt books when it's already sold out.  Last year, a friend of mine bought up 500 of the initial print run at a discount to both help me out (I was in debt) and sell them at a future date at a much higher price. \nHe's agreed to sell me back (for what he paid) as many Cha'alt hardcovers as I need to successfully fulfill this Kickstarter.  \nI know a lot of Cha'alt fans wish they could still get the first printing hardcover, so now you can!\nThe PDFs will be fulfilled by DriveThruRPG.

Complete list of announced Stretch Goals can be found below.\nAre you a gamemaster looking for a fun and challenging adventure to add to your ongoing campaign? Or maybe you just want a scenario you can run for your players that can be completed in one or two sessions? In either case, I have just what you want\u2026 Wyrmkeep Dungeons TZ3: The Forbidden Isle is a fantasy role-playing-game adventure module designed for a band of 4-8 5e DnD characters of 4th to 6th level.\nA renown rogue has stolen an heirloom from a powerful family and fled to a little-visited island. There he waits for news from those who have offered to fence the item. A party of adventurers is being sought to both hunt the criminal down before he can escape the island, and return the treasure to its rightful owners. Unfortunately, there are complications.\nThe Forbidden Isle is surrounded by foreboding magic, has some very strange geography, and is inhabited by dangerous creatures including the mysterious humanoids known as \"Icylanders.\" A final concern is that more than one group may be competing to win the bounty being offered! Can the adventurers beat the clock and their opponents?\nThe author of this module is Joe Pearce, who has been running and writing RPG adventures for over 20 years. This is his seventh fantasy RPG funding drive, the first six being the successfully funded and shipped Temple of the Dragon Kin, Befouled Maze of the Demi-Lich, The Beast Below, Raiders of the Cloud Castle, Curse of the Desert Outpost and Maps #1: Buildings, Castles and Dungeons. Joe is also a video game developer and writes a webcomic.\nAn abridged version of The Forbidden Isle was run at Gateway 2019, and all that is needed to complete the module is to fill-in a few additional encounters, write final monster stat blocks, and commission some more illustrations. I expect it should be available for delivery to backers by the late Summer 2020.\nThere are some of the artists that will appear in the module (based on availability): Jacob Blackmon, Brian Brinlee, Joshua LH Burnett , Ed Lacabanne, Mark Lyons, Brian McCranie, and Phil Stone\nThe module will have the following features as a base goal:\n20-24 pages in length\nOver two dozen encounter areas\n4 black & white interior illustrations\nColor cover artwork\nAt least one new monster available as Open Game Content\nMaps of the island and all significant locations\nAlthough written for 5th Edition, the module should be easily adaptable to other fantasy RPG systems!\n Once the base goal is reached, I would like to make The Forbidden Isle even better by adding more content! You must back at a $6 or above pledge level to receive Stretch Goal rewards.\nShe's falling for you!\n You can include additional items in your rewards by increasing your pledge total above the base for the tier you selected. Just include the additional amount(s) listed below.

If you would like to purchase a copy of the module, please visit http://wyrmkeep.com/dragonkin for production status and ordering information.\nThank you again backers!\nThe Project\nAre you a game master looking for an interesting and challenging adventure for your players that can be completed in one session? Well, I believe I have just what you want: Temple of the Dragon Kin is a mini-adventure module designed for a band of 5-8 5e DnD characters of 6th to 8th level.\nA party of stalwart adventurers is being sought by the learned sage, Gaspar Uberbellum. He wishes to hire the group to find and explore a lost temple dedicated to the veneration of dragons and their humanoid children, the dragon born. Within this temple is supposedly a powerful magic item that Gaspar covets: the Helm of the Dragon Lord.\nThe party will be paid handsomely for successfully locating, extracting, and returning the Helm to the sage. And unusual for agreements of this kind, the party\u2019s employer does not desire a cut of any other valuables discovered \u2014 the party can keep random loot they acquire along the way!\nSounds like a great deal! Simple really.\nWell, one should expect to encounter deadly traps, inscrutable puzzles, and powerful guardians along the way. Nothing a strong and resourceful group of adventurers can\u2019t overcome!\nAlthough they might want to worry about the dragons.\nThe Details\nThis project is a special All in 1 Kickstarter, which among other things means that the funding drive only has a duration of one week. Back it now because there is not much time for procrastination!\nThe author of the module is Joe Pearce, who has been running and writing RPG adventures for over 20 years. He is also a video game developer and writes a webcomic.\nThe module has a complete design and only needs expanded descriptions of the encounters, playtesting, and artwork for it to be finished. I expect it should be available for delivery to backers by May of this year (2017).\nThe module will have the following features:\n12-16 pages in length\n10-14 encounter areas\n4 original, to-be-commissioned, black & white illustrations\n2 new monsters available as Open Gaming Content\nMap of the Temple of the Dragon Kin\nAn adventurer encounters something shocking!\nRewards\nThis is a nice, short Kickstarter and has a corresponding small set of rewards.\n$3 / PDF Module: You receive Temple of the Dragon Kin in PDF format, and your name will appear in the Special Thanks section of the module.\n$10 / Printed Module: You receive Temple of the Dragon Kin in both printed and PDF format, and your name will appear in the Special Thanks section of the module.\n$30 / Name an NPC: You will get the opportunity to name an NPC! (Name must be approved by Joe.) You receive Temple of the Dragon Kin in printed and PDF format, and your name will appear in the Special Thanks section of the module. The reward has a limited number of backers!\n$100 / \u201cI Funded This\u201d: A singular backer will earn the right to claim they truly funded this Kickstarter -- you will be listed as Executive Producer in the main credits! You also get to add a message to one plot-significant item. (Message must be approved by Joe.) You receive two printed copies of Temple of the Dragon Kin (one signed by Joe if you wish) and a copy of the module in PDF format. The reward is limited to one backer!\nAdd-On\n$10 / Extra Printed Copy of Module: If you are backing at the Printed Module reward level or higher, you can purchase an additional copy of the module for $10. Just add this amount to your pledge. Joe will sign the extra copy too!\nStretch Goals\nOnce the base goal is reached, I would like to make Temple of the Dragon Kin even better by adding more content!\n$250: Splash of Color! The module gets a color illustration for the cover. UNLOCKED.\n$500: Bigger Is Better! A full-page illustration is added to the module. UNLOCKED.\n$1000: Invitation from the Past! You receive a facsimile of an invitation to join the secret society behind the Temple of the Dragon Kin, just like one that appears in the module! The document features a new piece of artwork and is provided as a printed letter (on parchment-like paper) for those backers receiving a printed copy of the module, while others receive a PDF of the letter. Show it to your players during the game for extra realism! LOCKED.\n$1500: To be revealed once previous stretch goal unlocked. The goal will include Kickstarter exclusive content! LOCKED.\nFinal Words\nThanks for your interest in this project. I hope you will become a backer and help make Temple of the Dragon Kin a reality for gamers to enjoy. Regardless if you can donate, please share a link to this project with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or any other forum that you think people would like the module.\nLink to this project: http://wyrmkeep.com/dragonkin\nOne final note: As a backer of Kickstarter projects myself, I have one request for you: even if you don\u2019t support this project, please find another project today and donate at least $1 to them. That way they will be excited, you will feel great, and it will help us further everyone's creative and artistic goals on this site.\n-- Joe Pearce", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe project risks are pretty minimal for such a basic RPG module.

Incidentally, the main picture above is from a previous blue map of his.  \nThis one is going to be in the \"middle ground\" between standard dungeon and mega-dungeon.  Not too busy, but lots going on... and huge!  Each quadrant of this map will be created by Glynn so they can be printed out as one big map or used separately as 4 smaller maps (individual dropbox links will be provided for everything), arranged as you like.  And if this goes well, it's possible we'll immediately have bonus quadrants or giant maps available to us.  See stretch goals below.\nYou may have a reservation about using a map big enough for all the players to see what's going on.  Well, if it's a trade off, I suppose.  If the GM presents the entire map all at once, a fraction of the mystery is gone.  However, it saves everyone at the table the trouble of taking time out to map what the GM sees in his book.  I don't know about you, but my spur of the moment mapping sucks compared to what's in my module.  \nWhat about the secret stuff GM maps contain?  All that's being left out of the map... but not left out of the adventure!\nThe map will also come with a 5 - 7 page PDF.  This document will contain a brief history of the dungeon, as well as, various random tables for helping the GM spontaneously come up with content, description, rumors, factions, and encounters (including traps, monsters, NPCs, weird stuff, etc.) so that each adventure into the S'rulyan Vault can be unique.  \nThis map, in conjunction with the PDF, is perfect for sparking the imagination and fostering improvisation - something the O5R needs more of, in my opinion.  Although, there's nothing to stop a GM from creating his own room key ahead of time, either based on my notes and suggestions or as developed from his own imagination or published modules.\nWhen finished, the entire map can be printed out at 34\" x 44\" from your local copy/print shop without any loss in clarity, as Glynn is making it high-resolution 600dpi (similar to the Alpha Blue space station map). Although, the maps could just as easily be printed off yourself at 8.5\" x 11\".  The files will look just like the inside cover of a module from 1983... or (see stretch goals) like the example below, also by Glynn Seal.\nFor those curious, The S'rulyan Vault random tables will contain minimum gonzo and science-fantasy... but those aspects shall be present to some degree.\nStretch Goals\n$1,000  :::  If this project reaches $1,000, then the map files will not only be available in blue and white but a bloody, stained, and wrinkled extremely realistic parchment and black ink (see example above).\n$1,500 ::: I'm going to have James V West illustrate a custom-made fantasy RPG character sheet attached to the PDF.  Scroll down below for a sample of James' work.  It will be similar aesthetically to his \"demon idol\" character sheet... yet generic enough for compatibility with most O5R fantasy roleplaying games (such as Crimson Dragon Slayer).\n$2,000  :::   If the project reaches this mark, Glynn will create a whole set of additional four quadrants that can be used separately or together to form a second mega-map!  These new dropbox files will also be in blue/white and virtual parchment and black ink.\n$3,000  :::  If this project reaches $3,000 (tentacles crossed), then all files (including the corresponding PDF will be available to the entire world... for FREE!!!\n ________\nWhat else have I done?\nWell, as High Priest of Kort'thalis Publishing, I've created the following: Liberation of the Demon Slayer, The Islands of Purple-Haunted Putrescence, Revelry in Torth, How to Game Master like a Fucking Boss, Crimson Dragon Slayer, The Outer Presence, Alpha Blue, and Girls Gone Rogue.\nClick on the DTRPG button below to see everything available for purchase (usually PDF and print).\nClick me!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt will take Glynn approximately 3 weeks to finish the map files and I should have the PDF finished by then, as well. \n\nThe completion date of \"July 2016\" is for the stretch goals and just in case one or both of us are delayed by illness or some other catastrophe (Dread Cthulhu forbid!)... however, as of today (4/19/16), it looks like everything will be done and in backers' hands by June 1st.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Gamma Turquoise Kickstarter!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Volume II is finally starting!", "update_content": "Yes, after an awful long wait...

Do you like the idea of mixing things up by confronting your players with villains none will expect? Is a fun and challenging encounter something your gaming friends will appreciate? Would you like to glean game-mastering knowledge from someone who has been running super-powered battles for decades?\nAh, I see you answered, \"YES PLEASE!\" Well then, you are ready for Heroic Havoc\u2122 #1: Instant Circus Is Going to Get You!\u2122\nThe circus has come to town, but it's not the kind anyone should attend! A troop of super-powered villains have been hired to put on a show as a cover to test a powerful new crowd-control agent. Unfortunately, the citizens of your fair city are the guineas pigs. Maybe they'll literally become guineas pigs -- you never know with foes like these!\nThe questions is, will this instant circus get you too?!\nHeroic Havoc #1: Instant Circus Is Going to Get You! is a scenario for 4-6 novice super-powered heroes. This 12-16 page module will include write-ups of the villains (with illustrations), maps of the encounter areas, introductory material to assist in getting the heroes to the site of the circus, and suggestions for follow-up adventures. There will even be a section explaining the motivations of the villains! (Hey, you may want some of them to show-up again to annoy and confound your players!)\nThe module will be written for D20 Hero system (the Open Game License version of Mutants and Masterminds) but can be easily adapted for ICON, FATE\u2122 or other game systems.\nThe number of pages in the module will increase as various stretch goals are achieved!\nThey are here to entertain -- mainly themselves!!\nThe heroes opponents include:\nMaster of Ceremonies - the charismatic and literal ringmaster of the group. He has light control powers with some technological augmentation.\nIvan the Strongman - a super-strong and resilient bruiser who like to wield a barbell as a weapon.\nThe Flying Winona - graceful and acrobatic, she is a experienced unarmed combatant with wind powers. Her trapeze act is partially a cheat as she can really fly!\nCalamity Clown - the leader of the clown henchmen. He is a devotee of chaos gods who, he says, have granted him powers both funny and fundamentally annoying.\nJorge - a former human cannonball, he now has the ability to being unnoticed. Which can be more dangerous then you might think!\nHello, all! My name is Joe Pearce, and I am a professional computer game designer and programmer. Although that is important information, it is not as critical as knowing that I have been creating and game-mastering original RPG adventures since the '80s!\nAlthough it is great to have friends who enjoy my games, once a scenario is run, that is the last that anyone sees of it-- until now. Via the power of Kickstarter, I can spread the fun to every GM and player who wants to get in on the action.

The Folio\u2019s goal is to insure that, and always give folks the very best quality \u2018lean and mean\u2019 adventures we can.\nSo my hope is this, that you will all share this project with others and help us create a continuing line that can be easily played and remembered fondly just like the modules of old.\nOld School 'wrap' removable cover design to double as DM Screen!\nMy Project: The Folio will be a bi-monthly [every two months] adventure module subscription that will hit on all genres of gaming using 5th Edition mechanics and expanding on them as we move from genre to genre.It will be produced as an 8x11\u201d, removable cover [11x17\" once removed], module with mostly b/w interior artwork and typically come in around thirty pages in length.\nWho\u2019s it for? ALL gamers, both new gamers and old gamers as it is easily expandable or playable as is.The concept is to allow gamers a starting point for adventure that can be modified to their liking while providing excellent reference content and frameworks.The base mechanic will be for 5th Edition, but I\u2019ve designed it to be readily modified to any fantasy game.\nWhat\u2019s in it? All original content.It has been written by Scott Taylor and Mark Timm, with incredible cover art from old school masters and interior artwork by skilled black and white illustrators Travis Hanson and Michael Wilson, and even a bit of Jim Holloway because I can never get enough Holloway.We are intent on providing what we refer to as neo-retro, a polished and modern design with creatively nostalgic content that transcends a particular age.All modules in The Folio series will contain 3-D maps, a Gazetteer, a monster section, a new monster unique to the setting, DM\u2019s notes and guides, and a full adventure.  And don't forget, for all you AotG readers out there, each Folio will come with an illustrated short story in PDF form to continue our tradition of fleshing out the Nameless Realm's world!\nIncredible interior artwork that comes in two stand alone booklets!\nWhy? Because I\u2019ve played and written about these games for more than thirty years at companies like TSR, Wizards of the Coast, White Wolf, and Privateer Press. After so many licensed projects, I feel it is time I put out something that is unique to my own creativity under my Art of the Genre brand. The corporate mentality and \u2018the man\u2019 often modify inspirations so fundamentally that the finished product is never what the author originally dreamed.In this case, The Folio is exactly the product I\u2019ve been looking to release for years.\nWhen? The initial module is complete, we only need to be funding so we can begin the full printing process.  This means that PDFs of the the first Folio will go out after the campaign wraps, and the physical copies should be to you no later than December! Also, concerning the later modules, we've already begun work on them, as you can see from the various previews of already secured cover artwork.\nI can\u2019t do this without you: Art of the Genre needs your help, that is why we are here.$15,000 is our goal.This covers the printing, shipping, design, writing, mapping, and the incredible story telling artwork we\u2019ll be using in these adventures.We have already devoted countless hours to seeing this product come together, but to make it \u2018real\u2019 and available to all players, we need your help.We believe in this dream, and we hope you do too!\nWhat happens if we pass the goal? If we pass the goal, it will allow us to begin production of the next adventure in the series, and our hope is to find enough support along the way to complete the entire six part campaign.Bottom line, our goal is to make a truly fantastic and age-defying piece of gaming history, each penny we receive goes toward that.This \u2018put everything into the product\u2019 mentality is why this Kickstarter is so think on \u2018rewards\u2019, as SWAG steals from everyone, the project, the product, and the backers.I firmly believe that backers want great product, not coins, bookmarks, post cards, prints, or T-shirts, and so this Kickstarter campaign is designed to put everything into The Folio to make sure everyone gets a product they will never forget and be proud to own.\nFull Campaign Modules featuring artwork by Daniel Horne, Jim Holloway, Jeff Laubenstein, Jeff Dee, and David Martin!\nCan this be easily played without using the 5th Edition mechanic? Yes, I\u2019ve gone to great lengths to set the story, the pacing, and the place, but I\u2019ve also separated the monsters into a bestiary so that ANY system \u2018monster book\u2019 may be employed with the proper use of monsters supplements to that system.The only other in depth change needed would be the dungeon master\u2019s understanding of the mechanics of invisibility, stealth, and traps.\n3-D mapping as well as standard hex maps!\nBacker Levels\nStretch Goals!\n*Trademark Disclaimer\n\"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"3E\" are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast, LLC.

The best parts of a bad decade.\nSpirit of 77 is an over-the-top, pedal-to-the-metal, nitro-burning, action adventure role playing game about an alternate history 1977. Richard Nixon has made a deal with aliens, and is still in the White House; renegade rock gods from another galaxy have shared with us the power of Glam; kung-fu bad-asses wander the city streets righting wrongs, and everyone is trying to stick it to The Man.\nSpirit of 77 is about recreating all the classic action and adventure TV shows, movies, and comic books of the 1970's. It draws inspiration from movies like Shaft, Smokey and the Bandit, The Warriors, Barbarella, Rocky, and Enter the Dragon; TV shows like The Dukes of Hazzard, The Six Million Dollar Man, The Rockford Files, and Charlie's Angels; and music like James Brown, KISS, David Bowie, Jerry Reed, and Isaac Hayes. \nPowered by the Apocalypse\nSpirit of 77 uses the Apocalypse World engine created by D. Vincent Baker, like a classic hot-rod we've made a number of modifications to amp up the horsepower. The basic mechanics consist of rolling two six sided dice adding a modifier and then narrating the success or failure.\nEasy to pick up for novice role players, and with plenty of options for the experienced, the rules of Spirit of 77 are geared towards encouraging over-the-top, pedal-to-the-metal action. You know the type: leaping cars, swinging from rooftops, blowing up tanker trucks, and punching bigfoot right in his hairy face.\nLook at him, he's totally asking for it.\nStory, Role, and Buzz\nCharacters in Spirit of 77 are made up of three basic components: Story, Role, and Buzz.\nYour Story describes where you're from. It's the source of your abilities. Stories can include things like being a War Vet, a Former Badge, or having a touch of the Glam.\nYour Role describes what you do. It covers how you interact with the world around you. Roles include things like hard hitting Tough Guys, funky Rockers, and fast driving Good Old Boys. \nYour Buzz describes your motivation. It's why you're out fighting the good fight. Buzz includes things like seeking Vengeance, looking for Love, or just being out for the Thrills\nThis system lets you describe nearly every classic character from 70's cinema and TV, such as:\nBilly Jack is a Tough Guy and Former Vet, looking for Peace of Mind.\nFoxy Brown is a Vigilante who's One Bad Mother, looking for Payback.\nThe Baseball Furies are Boppers with Glam, looking for Respect.\nJim Rockford is a Sleuth who's an Ex-Con, looking for Cold, Hard Cash.\nThe Bandit is a Good Old Boy with Humble Beginnings, looking for Fame and Glory.\nMock ups of the Core Book and the Expansion - Subject to change.\nThe Core Book and the Expansion\nThis Kickstarter is to fund the printing of our core rulebook and first expansion.\nThe Core book will be a digest sized (6in x 9in) softcover, 250-300 pages, with full color cover and black and white interiors.  The Core book will cover everything you need to play the game, rules, character creation, and setting information. Post Kickstarter the core book will retail for $30.\nThe Expansion (final name to be determined) will be a digest sized (6in x 9in) softcover, approximately 120 pages, with full color cover and black and white interiors.  The Expansion will include additional character stories, character roles, custom moves, and three complete adventures. Post Kickstarter the expansion book will retail for $20.\nStill not convinced?

Fortunately, between us, we've got a lot of experience delivering professional projects, and we've got a lot of friends who have experience with successful Kickstarters who've offered their help and advice. We've left ourselves reasonable margins of error in our budget, and have planned out every detail possible.\n\nCompletion - The writing for the core book is finished and ready to go to our editor. The expansion book is currently being written. Additional stretch goals will require additional writing. We're confident that we'll be able to complete all of these by our shipping date.\n\nShipping - Shipping prices have skyrocketed in the last few years. While we have a good idea as to how much it'll cost in the near future, there's always a chance that things will change drastically. To account for any unforeseen price changes, we have intentionally over-estimated our shipping costs.\n\nCommunication - We realize that post-funding communication to our backers is very important. We will be committing to providing bi-monthly updates both here on Kickstarter and through our social media presence (Facebook, Twitter).\n\nEvents Outside Our Control - Monkeyfun is a two-man operation. If one of us gets hit by a bus, the other will be able to carry on and complete the project (after seeking street vengeance against the bus). If both of us get hit by a bus, things might be in trouble, and this is why we only ever meet in secret locations at unannounced times under heavy guard.

This particular Kickstarter project is not the current funding drive for the game. Please visit the funding status page for up-to-date information!\nInherit the Earth\u2122 is a point-and-click adventure game and webcomic series set on a future Earth where humans have mysteriously disappeared and the dominate inhabitants are tribes of anthropomorphic animals or Morph, as they call themselves.\nThe primary hero of Inherit the Earth is Rif, a young Fox, who is a quick-witted, puzzle solver. Such skills come in handy as Rif tends to be thrust into dangerous missions involving righting wrongs and saving his friends.\nThe project being funded by this Kickstarter is Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows, a video game sequel to the original Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb. The game will be available for Windows, Mac, and other platforms.\nLike the original game, the sequel's story can be enjoyed by adults, teens and pre-teens. It will be an enchanting and thrilling adventure for all to enjoy, with subtleties and hidden depths that can be appreciated by older players.\nWhat's an Adventure Game? An adventure game is best described as a story-based puzzle-solving entertainment experience. The game\u2019s protagonist attempts to complete a series of goals by talking with characters encountered in different locations and using the clues learned to resolve problems blocking the path to success. In many situations this involves collecting items to trade or use.\nWhat about Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb? In the first game Rif the Fox is accused of stealing an ancient human relic, but is able to convince the authorities that he has the skills to find the actual thief of the Orb of Storms. Two guards are assigned to accompany Rif on his quest to ensure it is completed. There is the added incentive of rescuing his friend Rhene who is being held hostage by the Boar Tribe. Rif is eventually able to prove his innocence, but at the apparent loss of the Orb.\nA free trial version of the first game is available for desktop platforms. You can view a video of the game's intro below:\nInherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows takes place after both the original game and the webcomic story Little Wolf Lost. The Morph Tribes of the Known Lands continue their efforts to live with the loss of the Orb, which they used to predict the weather. There are rumors of the artifact\u2019s survival, but none are credible. Even Rif, who feels some regret in not being able to retrieve the Orb, discounts these rumors. The arrival of a chieftess\u2019 daughter, with a startling revelation, leads to Rif embarking on a new adventure to learn the truth \u2013 assuming he can avoid the doubts of friends, threats of foes, and the ravages of a great drought.\nYou can view a video of some scenes from the game prototype below.\nPLAY\n\nAs the developers on Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows know, funding an adventure game through the usual channels is extremely difficult at this time. Adventure games are not the type of game most big companies are looking to publish or even know how to market.\nThere is an alternate in the 21st Century: crowd-funding through Kickstarter gives a game like ours a chance to find its own players and supporters. Honestly, we would prefer this method of funding as it allows us the freedom to create the game we believe our segment of the gaming world is seeking.\nHelp us make this game a reality!\nAnd now what many of you have been waiting to know the answer to: \"What do I receive as a backer of this funding drive?\" The rewards you can receive are listed below and include such goodies as a copy of the game, a book of artwork, credit for your sponsorship, your avatar appearing in-game, and even a trip to the launch party.\nSome reward artwork may be preliminary or placeholders for final art.\nInherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows is being developed by The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. and produced by a team of experienced professionals, including excellent artists, writers, voice actors, audio techs and programmers. Many of these individuals were involved in the creation of the original game. Key developers include:\nJoe Pearce - Designer, programmer, and company owner. Joe has been a professional game developer for 28 years with over 20 game and application titles to his credit. He was one the original designers of Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb and the primary force in making the sequel possible by acquiring the rights to the original game.\nEd Lacabanne - Artist. Ed was one of the background artists for the original game. He has worked on a dozen other projects including titles based on Star Wars, Dungeons and Dragons, and Fallout.\nJulie Butler- Artist. Julie Butler has been the illustrator for the Inherit the Earth webcomic for the last couple of years.\nAllison Hershey - Additional design. Allison, a designer and art director for the original game, has provided assistance in the design for the new game. She was also the first illustrator for the webcomic.\nWe expect development will take approximately nine months from the date the project is successfully funded. The game will be released in English plus other languages based on Stretch Goals met (see below).\nDifferent tribes of the Morph\nYou can stay in touch with the folks involved in this project through the following:\nOfficial Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows website\nThe Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. website\nOfficial Wyrmkeep Entertainment Twitter\nOfficial Inherit the Earth Facebook group\nInherit the Earth webcomic site\nInherit the Earth webcomic tumblr\nI hope you are ready to join us in the process of making a great sequel to a classic game.

WE DIDN'T REACH OUR GOAL, BUT IF YOU'RE STILL INTERESTED IN SEEING THIS FILM GET MADE, AND IF YOU WANT TO HELP MAKE IT, GO TO http://cassavafilms.com/contact AND LET'S TALK!\nThis funny, fast-paced 2-minute animated pitch will give you a taste of this (live action) film's dark humor, and it lays out the first half of the story as well:\nWHAT IS THIS MOVIE?\nIt's a feature-length thriller - with black comedy and horror elements - about a smart young woman named Robin who accepts an under-the-table temporary position at a tech company in suburban California. She has just days to find out that the charming man who runs the company likes to hunt down and murder his temps - and that she's the next target on his list.\n\"Office Space meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" is not a bad jumping-off point for describing this film.\nWHY DOES IT NEED TO BE MADE?\nBecause I love suspense. I love the tension in shows like Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and Hannibal, and yet I don't find this tension in many feature films today. DIAL 9 TO GET OUT will be one of those rare films.\nThere also aren't enough thrillers out there with truly interesting characters - especially female characters - and I want this to be one of those too.\nBut mostly I just want to glue you to the edge of your seat for an hour and a half. When you watch this movie, I want you to be able to say, \"Well, that was awesome.\"\nDIAL 9 TO GET OUT is funny, scary, smart, unpredictable, a little thought-provoking, and definitely popcorn-friendly. I want it to do for working late at the office what Jaws did for going to the beach.\nSO IS THIS OR IS THIS NOT A HORROR FLICK?\nOkay, yes, there's a maniac in a mask who goes around stabbing people. But it's about the tension, not the gore, so DIAL 9 TO GET OUT is more for the Breaking Bad crowd than for the You're Next crowd (though I hope the You're Next crowd likes it too). The emphasis is on a tight story, crisp dialogue, and rich suspense.\nIf I do sell this movie to a distributor, they might market it as horror, which is what happened when Lionsgate released my second feature Claustrophobia (which they retitled \"Serial Slayer\" for the English language market).\nBut between you and me and the blood-spattered water cooler, this is a thriller.\nStory is everything, and DIAL 9 TO GET OUT has a great one. Now that we're at the end of the campaign, I've posted pages 1-67 of the full 105 page screenplay for all to read. You can read it here.\nIf you want to know how the movie ends, you'll have to get it funded!\nFrom left: Mark, Meta, Scott, Christopher, William\nMARK TAPIO KINES, Writer/Director. I've made two feature films. Foreign Correspondents (1999) was the first movie to be crowdfunded online. It starred Melanie Lynskey (Heavenly Creatures, Up in the Air), Wil Wheaton (Big Bang Theory, Star Trek: TNG), Corin Nemec (Stargate SG-1, Parker Lewis Can't Lose), Lisa LoCicero (General Hospital), and other fine folks. Claustrophobia (2003) also starred Ms. Lynskey, as well as Mary Lynn Rajskub (24), Sheeri Rappaport (NYPD Blue), and Judy O'Dea (the original Night of the Living Dead). I've also made a number of short films, I authored a screenwriting course on Lynda.com, and I sometimes write for Indiewire. More about me here.\nMETA VALENTIC, Producer. Meta has produced a number of independent features, including Sundance favorite Urbania, Hunting of Man, Ladr\u00f3n que roba a ladr\u00f3n, and several shorts. In her TV life, she's worked on hit shows such as Castle (we shot my talking head in the DIAL 9 intro video on the Castle set), Bones, and Lost.\nSCOTT SPEARS, Director of Photography. Scott's got more than 45 credits as DP and cameraman. Among his accomplishments: winning an Emmy for the short film The Birthmark and shooting Richard Hatch's 1999 Battlestar Galactica trailer, which revived interest in the show and led to the reboot. Scott was the DP for Foreign Correspondents and I'm happy to work with him again. He shot the creepy office building footage in the DIAL 9 intro video.\nCHRISTOPHER FARRELL, Composer. The extremely gifted Mr. Farrell wrote the scores for my first two features Foreign Correspondents and Claustrophobia (as well as several of my shorts, including A Trophy). He's also scored a ton of genre pictures with great titles such as Dead Scared, Nightmare Man, and House of the Witchdoctor. That's his music you hear in the intro video.\nWILLIAM LEBEDA, Titles Designer/Visual Effects Supervisor. William did the amazing title work on the intro video as well as my first two features. As Creative Director of Picture Mill, William has designed the title sequences for a slew of major Hollywood releases, most famously for David Fincher's Panic Room, but also for Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell, Jason Bateman's Bad Words, War of the Worlds, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Signs, Anchorman, and many others.\nWHAT ABOUT THE CAST? ANY CELEBRITIES?\nWe're casting this movie the old-fashioned way: by holding auditions and hiring the very best actor for each role.\nBack when Meta and I were trying to raise a million bucks from Hollywood types, they kept saying, \"You need to cast bankable names so we can sell the picture to foreign territories.\" Yes, even if an actor is not right for the part or is impossible to work with. And of course, said actor's salary would eat up half the budget. A gloomy proposition.\nOne of the great things about crowdfunding this film is that there's no pressure to be \"bankable\". We can cast who we want. So if a complete unknown is better for a particular part than someone who was on a semi-popular TV show 15 years ago, we're going to cast that unknown.\n\nThat said, we're not dumb. If Jennifer Lawrence wants to star in this movie, she's gonna star in this movie. And in fact I have a good track record with casting well-known actors: I got Wil Wheaton and Mary Lynn Rajskub to star in my first two features, with little money and no industry connections. DIAL 9 will be a SAG-AFTRA signatory production, allowing us access to the best talent, so I will do everything in my power to land some recognizable actors.\nMARK, ARE YOU REALLY THE FIRST PERSON TO EVER CROWDFUND A MOVIE?\nYes! I earned this claim to fame in 1998, when I raised $150,000 in finishing funds for Foreign Correspondents through my website for it. (Warning: ancient site.)\n1999 newspaper articles, from left: The Boston Globe, The Chicago Tribune, The San Jose Mercury\nAnd here's an interview I did for a PBS show called \"Net Cafe\" in the summer of 1999. Dig that long hair! Ah, the '90s.\nIf you need further proof, you can read scans of all the newspaper articles on this page. Or check out the 1999 Chicago Tribune article, which is still online in digital format.\nHOW DOES THAT $120,000 GET SPENT?\nWe're all about transparency here at the DIAL 9 Kickstarter page. So here are preliminary figures, based on a 12-day shooting schedule, with 3-4 weeks of pre-production and 2-3 months of post-production.\n$12,000 goes back to Kickstarter and Amazon for their commissions.\n$8,000 goes back to YOU - in the form of all those DVDs, Blu-rays, T-shirts, flash drives, shipping, etc.\n$5,000 for pre-production (office space for auditions and meetings, salaries for casting director, production staff, etc.).\n$30,000 for production crew salaries (based on 20 full-time crew members).\n$8,000 for cast salaries (based on the SAG-AFTRA Ultra-Low Budget rate of $100 a day per actor, plus agency commissions and SAG-AFTRA pension & health fees).\n$3,000 for 2 weeks digital camera package rental.\n$20,000 for lighting/grip/electric rentals, costumes, props, and set dressing.\n$3,000 for production insurance (required).\n$10,000 for main location rental (suburban office building) for 10 shooting days. The other 2 shooting days will be at (hopefully free) private homes.\n$7,000 for meals and craft services.\n$10,000 for post-production (editing, sound editing, music composition, titles).\n$4,000 for final sound mix and digital mastering.\nIf we can score any deals and use some of that money for higher production values, we will. (Anybody got an office building that we can shoot in?)\nHere's a trailer for my newest short A Trophy. Everybody who backs the DIAL 9 campaign at $9 or more gets to see this short in its entirety. While I am exceedingly proud of this dark little film, its visual style is completely different from DIAL 9 TO GET OUT.\nBelow are the two different T-shirt designs that you can choose from. After the end of the campaign, we will contact you about your preference and size.\n THIS COULD BE YOU:\nI am modeling both shirts. These are mockups; nothing's been printed yet.\nIf enough people ask nicely at the end of the campaign, we will also print style #2 (the shirt on the right) as a white graphic on a black T-shirt.\nAside from making movies, I'm also the author and host of Screenwriting Fundamentals, a tutorial on Lynda.com. Here's a sample:\nI've gotten a lot of requests from people who want me to critique their screenplays. I have always told them no. But for 10 screenwriters who back DIAL 9 TO GET OUT at the $450 level, I will say yes! This won't be just a perfunctory glance, either. I will really spend time with your script, pointing out what works and suggesting fixes for what doesn't.\nThese make great holiday cards, \"save the date\" announcements, direct mailers for your business, etc. You send me the background artwork, and I'll do the magic. I spend hours making these things, so it's worth your pledge.\nHere are two examples, using graphics from the DIAL 9 Kickstarter campaign. (They're heavily Photoshopped: the hallways were in Columbus, Ohio, and I was in my bathroom in L.A.!) Your cards don't need to be this creepy. Unless you want them to be.\n(Please note: I may ham it up in these photos, but I am NOT an actor, and I will NOT be starring in DIAL 9 TO GET OUT.)\nA lot of filmmakers offer speaking parts as a reward, but isn't it weird that they won't tell you up front what you're going to say? If you're going to cough up $1,100, you should know what you're in for.\nBelow are the lines for \"GARY\" (the male character) and \"MELISSA\" (the female character). They're not Shakespearean monologues. But you will come off well, and the audience will enjoy your little moment. I promise.\nYes, Melissa has a little more dialogue than Gary. But whoever plays Gary gets to work with the movie's leading lady, which will make up for it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is where I have to say that there are plenty of things that could derail this production. An earthquake could hit us in the middle of the shoot, or our leading lady could run off with the Hare Krishnas.\n\nBut I have already written and directed two independent features. Each production had its share of challenges (my favorite might be the Claustrophobia production sound recordist having to get his wisdom teeth removed on the first day of the shoot), but there was nothing that couldn't be overcome. In the end, I finished both films and I sold them. The fact that I'm coming back for a third feature tells you how committed I am to making movies. It's hard work, but I finish every film I start.\n\nForeign Correspondents was shot on 35mm, filmed all over California, and cost $500,000 to make. Claustrophobia was shot on SD consumer video, mostly in one house, and cost $60,000 to make. DIAL 9 TO GET OUT has a budget, scope, and shooting schedule right in between those two. We do have some particular challenges: There will be tricky stuntwork. There will be messy practical effects (blood). We're going to have to make every penny of our budget count. But with a solid cast and crew - and lots and lots and lots of planning - I know we can handle it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Mark Tapio Kines\nFirst created \u00b7 27 backed\nI'm the first person to ever crowdfund a film.

By using a sophisticated parts system and web UI, we're bringing the flexibility, ease, and control of a robust video game character creator to the tabletop. \nAs we add new parts, the number of potential combinations will grow exponentially! We can't wait to see what people create!\nChoose your race, your gender, your build, and your facial expression. Select and swap individual armor pieces, weapons, adventuring equipment, hairstyles, and faces. Choose your pose and watch all of the dynamically rigged parts and attributes conform to fit your selection. Choose the scale of your mini, and even the material it's printed in. We're bringing a high-tech update to a classic analog hobby and giving you the opportunity to breathe your vision and creativity into your miniature.\nYour equipment selections are dynamically rigged to conform to your choice in pose and character. These three 30mm scale minis have the same equipment but are in different poses. Click for video!\nAnd a close-up. 3D printing allows us to capture incredibly fine detail, even at 30mm scale, like the engraving on the chest piece.\nWhether you want to create stranger fare (good luck finding a dual-wielding halfling barbarian mini), capture key details (no one should be forced to make compromises on their dwarf\u2019s beard style), or simply have more say in your mini than just the paint job, Hero Forge is for you! \nWe've built a team uniquely qualified to bring this project to life. We invite you to get to know us:\nThere are many advantages to using 3D printing and digital models over the more traditional injection mold and sculpting techniques. Printing from digital models means we can easily scale our models up or down. Want 6 inch display versions of your party to immortalize their heroic deeds? Can do. Playing a niche tabletop game that uses a larger or smaller scale? No problem. And that's not all: our character builder will let you save high resolution screenshots of your model for your character sheet and overhead views for your favorite virtual tabletop program. You can even save your mini and edit it later so it can grow and change as your character does!\nPrint on demand means you're not limited to what big companies think have the broadest appeal, and we don't have to exclude poses, equipment, or designs simply because they can't be made with injection molds. This means more freedom for you. Interior or recessed detail, which is notoriously difficult for injection molds, is easy with 3D printing. We can also offers certain novel options like printing segmented chains or swinging lanterns with articulated parts, no assembly required.\nSomething as simple as a mini with swords crossed in front of him would be impossible with injection molds.\nWe believe that this is the next step in miniatures and a fantastic application of new, exciting technologies. We'd love to be another example that tabletop gaming is alive, well, and just getting started!\n3D printed plastics are easy to paint, too! Here are a few minis we designed, 3D printed, and painted ourselves. Click for video!\n                                                                                               We've come as far as we can on our own, but it is your support that will allow us to see this project through. Backing will go towards turning our concept art into one of the coolest, most diverse digital armories on the internet, and further developing/polishing our web UI to provide the smoothest experience possible. We can't wait to start our next campaign where every player is using a custom, bespoke mini that they designed themselves. We invite you to help make that happen!\nWe need the funding and support of backers to help us turn our library of concept art into a library of fully rigged, 3D parts. Backer's funding will also go towards developing our web UI so we can give you unparalleled flexibility and control while building your character. With a wide range of 3D parts and a perfected web app, users will have the tools to build truly unique, distinctive, interesting minis.\nAdditionally, Kickstarter offers the ability to go beyond basic funding, to reach exciting stretch goals so we can implement some of our big plans even earlier! In short, the more funding we receive, the more we can offer at launch!\nBeyond giving us the ability to fully fund this project, Kickstarter lets us connect with you. Many of our limited reward tiers offer you the opportunity to make your voice heard, working with our artists and modelers to make armor, weapons, items, and poses YOU want to see included. We wanted to give the community a voice in our product\u2019s creation, and Kickstarter seemed like the perfect way to do that.\nOur concept artists have earned their stripes in the tabletop and video game industries, and they know what makes a character truly exciting. We can't wait to see what they come up with next! Here are some of the designs they've turned out already.\nBy breaking all of our armor down into multiple parts we can generate an incredible amount of variety. Even with the limited pool of parts and poses we have now, our in-depth parts system can generate millions of variations, each with subtle differences. But that isn't enough for us.\nWe want enough variety that one could randomize our parts for years and still never arrive at the same mini! To that end, we are focusing on designing armor sets that have distinctive motifs, themes, and profiles, that will really come to life when you log in and combine the parts in exciting ways to create a truly unique look, distinctive to your character.\nArmor pieces will automatically fit your race, gender, and pose!\nWe've highlighted the customizability of our armor, but we aren't neglecting weapons and adventuring equipment either. Not only do we want everyone to be able select exactly the weapons they have listed on their character sheet, but to also be able to choose from multiple motifs, looks, and styles. When your character upgrades from a regular long sword to a masterfully crafted +3 long sword we want you to be able to have that reflected in your miniature. Hero Forge will make that a simple proposition.\nWith our initial funding goal, we'll be starting with fantasy-themed figures with an eye on expanding. Sci-fi, steampunk, cyberpunk, Victorian era, historical military outfits and weaponry, pulp, western, superheroes--the possibilities are endless, and some may even be revealed as stretch goals. Our in-depth parts system makes mixing and matching genres easy! As new parts are released you will be able to add a robotic arm to your knight, or give your cowboy a samurai sword. \nAfter setting aside the manufacturing costs of our physical rewards, the majority of the funding will go towards building 3D models and finishing the development of our web UI. When we reach base funding, we plan to have five races available at launch: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, and Half-Orc, and we will expand over time! With a successful funding campaign from Kickstarter we aim to have our full-featured mini-builder off the ground this year with new batches of parts hot on the heels of release.\nOur initial five fantasy races, with more coming as our first stretch goal!\nIf we exceed our base funding goal, we will have more resources to produce more parts and features faster. For example, here are a couple features we hope to add. You can help us add them sooner by helping us meet our stretch goals!\nWe've got many other big things in mind, including more genres, nudity options, color, wings/horns/tails, multi-figure poses, and more!\nMeet our All-Star team:\nBuilding the right team takes careful planning, an eye for talent, and a guiding passion. Joshua Bennett is that jack-of-all-trades. Having worked as a freelance artist, writer, editor, and project coordinator from L.A. to Hong Kong, he has been embedded in the tabletop RPG community for years. His work has appeared in Wayfinder Magazine, on paizo.com, and in dozens of online shops and indie RPG releases.\nCreating a character customizing UI is a complex endeavor. There are website limitations to work within, quality and quantity of art to consider, not to mention making sure that all parts are compatible with each other. As Technical Art Director for the video game studio Naughty Dog, Teagan Morrison has been dealing with digital resource management and character customizers for critically acclaimed games like the Uncharted series for years.\nThe fantasy genre is rich with traditions, tropes, and distinctive styles. Freelance artist Nicole Cardiff lives and breathes fantasy art and provides an insider\u2019s understanding of what people want when it comes to their fantastic heroes. Her work has appeared in Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition materials and the reboot of Tomb of Horrors, in Warhammer, Call of Cthulhu, and Game of Thrones cards for Fantasy Flight Games, and on the covers of fantasy novels.\nCreating designs that are iconic and integrate well into a parts system is no easy task, but expert concept artist Molly Maloney is uniquely suited for it. Currently working as a concept artist for Telltale Games, Molly is skilled at creating gorgeous concept art with an eye on its future digitalization.\nModeling characters for miniature, 3D printing, and a parts system requires a number of considerations that would make some 3D artists balk. With a masterful understanding of proportion, and a keen understanding of the medium, Margaret Dost is the perfect artist for the job. An expert 3D modeler who has worked on everything from blockbuster films like Pacific Rim, videogames like Mortal Kombat vs. DC, commercials, and cinematics, Margaret has the skills to guide our transition from concept art to 3D models.\nWith Hero Forge, customization is king. This is built on a complex and in-depth part system which requires extremely clever, dynamic rigging, and a balance between creativity, efficiency, and a keen artistic eye. Beverly Sage excels at all of these things and has earned her stripes working as a freelance rigger and technical artist in the videogame industry on games like The Last of Us. She currently works for Nickelodeon Animation Studios as a technical character artist.\nMaking a part system that just works, plug-in free, in your web browser involves a lot of pipeline challenges, as does getting a customized 3D model into a data format that can then be 3D printed. David Lenna has been dealing with pipeline as South Park studio's Chief Technical Officer for years and is uniquely equipped to make the right decisions.\nAll that to say: We have an amazing team with passion, big ideas, and the technical chops and experience to back it up. We can't wait to make Hero Forge a reality!\nThere are technologies available now that would have made this project impossible even a year ago, and further improvements in this already groundbreaking tech are right around the corner.\n3D printing\nWhile injection mold minis are not likely to see any revolutions in their production process any time soon, 3D printing is evolving at a blistering pace. While current printing technology allows us to capture detail comparable to current minis, our character and object models are sculpted at remarkably high detail, so you can look forward to fidelity improving as printing technology does!\nWe've chosen to use Shapeways for our 3D printing needs. They recently released a developer API which allows small businesses, independent sculptors, and start-ups like us to take advantage of the latest in commercial 3D printing technology. By using the Shapeways developer API, we can evolve and grow as new materials and printing options are added.  As new features like color printing or improved materials are released, upgrading will be easy. This frees us to focus on what we're really excited about: making high-quality models. We're happy to have manufacturing handled by one of the leading names in the 3D printing industry.\nAt the moment, there are two main materials that we are interested in releasing at launch. The first is an 'ultra-detail plastic' material which is slightly translucent (before priming), highly detailed, and is fantastic for painting--very suitable as a high quality display piece. The majority of the miniatures we show here are printed in this material. The second is a lower cost, albeit lower detail material which is very durable and flexible. This 'strong plastic' It is opaque white, and has a rougher finish that makes it less suitable for painting. As in all other aspects of Hero Forge, We wanted to offer users as many choices as possible, so a cheaper, but still entirely customizable option just made sense. Note that the \"patron\" and \"novice party\" tiers are both available only in the latter 'strong plastic' material. Keep in mind that, by the time we launch, there may be exciting new material options available!\nWebGL\nWebGL, the new web standard for 3D, allows video game-quality graphics right in your web browser. This has allowed us to build an interactive 3D interface that lets you easily and quickly design miniatures without downloading plugins. See beautiful, interactive models as you design, pose, and build them. Gone are the days of browsing low-rez photo galleries or rooting through poorly stocked shelves. You'll be able to see your mini in crisp 3D long before it arrives in your hands. \nWebGL also allows us to add fun, free features that we believe people will enjoy: whether you're buying our minis or not, you will be able to export high resolution screenshots of your unique character. Use it for your character sheet, as a keepsake, or for a 'wanted sign' player handout. Export an overhead views for your favorite virtual tabletop program. Save a character to edit later, or get a head start designing your next one. Here is a video highlighting some of the features that we will be including!\nWe believe our WebGL character builder will be a fun and amazingly useful tool. We just can't stop thinking of new uses for this technology, and we're sure you'll have some great ideas too! \nPledge tiers $20 and up may add individual miniatures and statuettes to their order!\nClick for instructions!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n---While we want to offer as many options as possible, we also want to ensure that we have the absolute best base product we can before sticking baseball cards in the spokes and painting flames on it. Some of the more ambitious customization options may have to be prioritized or wait for things like print technology to catch up.\n\n----3D printing tech is rapidly improving, but just as the injection mold production process has its challenges and problems (flash or mold lines, limited shapes, etc.) so does 3D printing. Current print technology still has some disadvantages that it is working to address. For example, the strong material is not especially detailed, and the detailed material is not very strong. Another example: we've pointed out that the sandpapery texture of the 'strong plastic' material is not especially suitable for painting (paint sticks just fine, it just is harder to layer on). And the ultra-detail plastic is not as durable as most plastic miniatures. Much like a resin model or miniature, if you drop one from high up, it very well may break.\n\n---The ultra detail material can also come with some visual artifacts in the plastic's consistency. This is different than the \"stair-stepping\" effect of earlier 3D printing. In most cases it is a primarily a visual quirk rather than a physical one--and will be undetectable once a figure is sprayed with primer.\n\nOf course, these are challenges that are actively being researched and addressed. We are especially excited about new material offerings that are stronger, more detailed, and even allow for fine color application. These are advances we hope, and expect, to see in the very near future.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Your Alpha Access to Color Tools and \u201cSuper Backer\u201d Rewards", "update_content": "Hello again, Hero Forge Fans!

Experience 30 years of gaming evolution, from the early pong days to the modern games of today. Attend midnight game launches or test your skills in competitive in-game tournaments. Read in-game magazines for tips, tricks and reviews, or for the latest rumors about the new Gametron 9000 XZ.\n\nMy childhood consisted of a pure diet of EGM, Nintendo Power and every video game I could get my hands on. Weekends meant all night gaming marathons with friends and swapping NES games with kids on your street was part of daily life. You never had to worry about DRM, constant online connections or bricking your console with a firmware update. Things were wonderfully simple. It was a time when a new console generation meant taking a giant leap into the future of gaming. You never could have mistaken an SNES/Genesis game for an NES title, even if your parents thought it all looked the same. We didn't have E3, we had CES and gaming publications would trickle out screen shots from the event for months. Release dates were ambiguous at best, which meant you had to call your local store every single day throughout the summer to see if Zelda II was available (sorry store guy). This was growing up with video games in the 80's and this is where Retro World comes from.\n\nRetro World will be available on Windows,Mac and Linux platforms.\n You've just moved to a new town where the video game craze has taken the town folks by storm. Unfortunately this newly favored past time comes with more than the people of Frankton had bargained for. Extended periods of play have resulted in strange phenomenon from disappearing children to sightings of spooky creatures. It's up to you and your newly found friends to get to the bottom of this bizarre mystery.\nA few of the characters you'll meet.\n You basically play the part of a young boy who's just moved to a new town where video games have just starter to become a popular past time. You eventually realize that some of these games are not what they seem. Some games will actually leak some of their characters and themes into the real world or even absorb some of your friends right into the TV. It's up to you to use your knowledge acquired from the retro game play and gaming magazines to solve their problems and push the game worlds back where they belong. The main overarching goal is solving why these games are coming to life.\nThe game segments can be broken down into four phases:\n1) The Hype - In anticipation of a release the town folks will talk about the upcoming titles expressing their likes or dislikes. You'll see prominent billboards advertising each game using various colorful marketing strategies as well as special features in magazines. After properly researching your game you'll make your choice determining how much cash you'll need to earn. \n2) Earning some cash - Games don't come cheap. It's up to you to gather enough money before the game's release. For this you'll do all sorts of chores for your parents, neighbors and even strangers you meet. Cutting the lawn and making deliveries are just typical things you'll do to earn your money. There's still always a chance a distant relative will send you a gift through the mail. \n3) Getting the game - Getting the hottest new game can sometimes be difficult. Stores having limited stock was a common occurrence back in the day and in Retro World things are no different. You'll have to track down your games by calling specialty shops, department stores and then get there before it sells out. In some cases finding a game can be a quest in itself taking you to some of the more seedy parts of Frankton.\n4) Playing the game - Now that you've got your game it's time to play it. Finishing games to 100% completion advances the story to the next Hype phase. \nBeing just a kid means you won't be able to buy everything available on release day. You'll have to rely on your friends to play everything. But once a game gets old you can always find it in a bargain bin or a second hand store.\nWe've teamed up with members of one of the biggest names in adventure games, LucasArts!\n\"Unfortunately for LucasArts, the company was shut down back in April by Disney. Thankfully for Francois, however, since the shutdown the members of the LucasArts audio team - one of the most highly regarded and awarded audio teams in the game industry - have all gone freelance and we've talked about bringing the same sparkle of AAA quality adventure game audio to the world of Retro World. With team members who have worked on the Special Edition Monkey Island titles, as well as The Dig and Grim Fandango, we know adventure games and we know that we will do a great job with audio for Retro World.\" -Jesse Harlin former Staff Composer for LucasArts currently wielding his talents from dunderpatemusic.com.\nIf you've played a LucasArts game in the last ten years chances are you've heard Jesse's incredible work. \nWe also have on board the great musical talents of Clark Aboud (responsible for the trailer's soundtrack) who will also be contributing to the game's soundtrack.\nYou can sample Clark's previous works on his SoundCloud page.      \n\nWe have Mathieu Galarneau as our resident web master & graphic designer. Mathieu has done some incredible character pixel art and animation for us.\n\nAnd finally myself Francois Grenier, lead designer and developer, responsible for the environment art as well as character art and animations.  \nsome games might be too controversial and result in protests from the town folk.\nMany of our features are still in the early stages of development and are simply too raw to show. Here's what we can tell you. You'll take on game challenges on and off screen as the game worlds and main world collide. You'll use your wit as well as retro play styles from inner games to solve real world problem situations. At it's core Retro World is an Action/Adventure/RPG but you'll find just about every type of game available throughout the four console generations.\nExperience a wacky retelling of the video game industry while uncovering the mystery of why games are coming to life.\nExplore a 3D stylized open world with various seasons, weather effects as well as night and day transitions.\nInteract with colorful characters from gamers to folks simply enjoying small town life.\nPlay arcade and console games with your friends. (Some games feature real life multi-player options for up to 4 players.)\nSome later gen games feature real Stereoscopic 3D, permitting you have the necessary hardware in your home. (3D types supported include Side by Side and Top and Bottom). Note that 3D viewing is not required to play these titles and is simply used for show.\nDefend yourself using real-time combat in the over world using a variety of weapons taken from the environment as well a from the video games you play.\nSome game worlds will collide with the real world making town life a little difficult.\nI've always enjoyed the tongue and cheekiness of discovering games within games. But what if the idea could be pushed to the point where the player begins to question what is real and what is game? So I decided to take the concept to the next level , while telling a relatable story to gamers like myself and yet interesting enough for new gamers that weren't around in the 80's. I've never seen anything of this scale before, so this presented a great opportunity to create something different.\nPlay classic shooters like Planet Defence.\nExperience the zany adventures of Suitman through a series of games.\nWe have a few interesting game mechanics we have yet to reveal as doing so would spoil some of the fun.\nDreaming big comes at a price. There is no way a single person could deliver a fully flushed out game of this magnitude without additional help. Kickstarter can supply me with the needed additional resources required to deliver this vision without sacrificing anything that makes this game special. The $175k will allow me and my artist to take this on full time as well as pay for an additional developer and animator to join our efforts. This also has to pay for our talented sound guys and any additional cost incurred by legal fees, Kickstarter fees etc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorking on a project of this scale can be quite daunting. But not all is grim as we have three elements working in our favor: \n\nThe first is the target platforms. We are only shipping on Windows, Mac and Linux, on which the game already runs without any issues. \n\nThe second is the fact that we already have a head start on the project. The main framework of the game is almost complete with a little over a year's worth of coding already done (weekends and evenings). The in-game games are running on smaller modularized engines that can easily be morphed into any retro game style imaginable. We already have side scrollers, shooters, adventure and puzzle games in various stages of development representing every gaming era within our 30 year scope. \n\nThe third is our completely digital reward tiers. This ensures that every penny is strictly spent on the game development. We're not printing T-shirts or full sized posters that must be shipped around the world. All funds are strictly to going to towards the completion of this project.\n \nEven with all of these elements already in place there is still much to be done . We still need to fully complete and polish the world map, interior spaces, code additional features as well as animate our full cast of characters. It's not going to be easy but nothing worthwhile ever is.\n\n\n\nShould we exceed our funding goal, I ensure you that the surplus amount will be completely reinvested into the project to improve the the quality of the product beyond your expectations.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Francois Grenier\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nA gamer since the age of four, I first toyed with the idea of making games during my first programming class in high school at the age of...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Thank you for all of your generosity and support.", "update_content": "I would like to thank all of the backers for believing in our project.

BUT...\nIf you missed the Kickstarter campaign, you can still help get to the next stretch goal (and get Obduction and more) at obductiongame.com! \n Ob`duc\u00b4tion, n.1. The act of drawing or laying over, as a covering. \nObduction is an all-new, real-time, first-person adventure that harkens back to the spirit of Cyan\u2019s earlier games Myst and Riven. Obduction resurrects that incredible feeling of suddenly finding yourself in the middle of a new world to explore, discover, solve, and become part of.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of Myst, one of the best-selling computer games in history. Myst was an exploration through a landscape of dramatically realistic images (rendered in Strata - check out the new Strata reward tier!) tied together to create an experience that was described as \u201cbecoming your world.\u201d The Myst name is widely recognized as uniquely defining a new kind of gaming - amazingly immersive worlds where the point is to understand your environment rather than test your reflexes. The Obduction project will take what Cyan knows about creating deeply immersive worlds and apply it to an entirely new game with fantastic scenery, incredible architecture, compelling story, and exceptional challenges.\nObduction will be built with the same framework that made Cyan's earlier games such a wonderful experience: stunning landscapes, deep storyline, engaging characters, dramatic soundscapes, and challenging yet intuitive puzzles. Obduction is an entirely new property, delivered using one of the most powerful game development technologies available today. Obduction is an adventure game for the new millennium that stays true to the concepts that made the genre great.\nAt the base funding level, Obduction will be developed for both Windows and MacOS, with a targeted release of mid-to-late 2015.\nThe game is being designed with a flexible scope in mind, so that as the budget grows, the game grows. More places; more puzzles; more mystery; more complexity; more adventure!\nWith the generalities out of the way, it's time to dig a bit deeper into specifics. If you know anything about Cyan's worlds, you know that you don't want to know too much ahead of time. We'll try our best to whet your appetite, without giving away too many spoilers.\nStory\nObduction's experience supplies what every good storyteller does: a very personal window into a much larger world. Obduction begins with... well\u2026 an abduction - your abduction. On a crystal clear, moon-lit night, a curious, organic artifact drops from the sky and inexplicably whisks you away across the universes to who-knows-where (or when, or why).\nAnd, as anyone who ever played Myst or Riven knows, exploring everything around you allows you to read between the lines and to begin to answer your questions. Why is there an old, abandoned farmhouse - complete with white picket fence - in the middle of an alien landscape? You'll find out. From this point on the story becomes your story. \nGame Design\nObduction has a few game design elements in common with Myst and Riven, and it skews into new areas as well. Cyan's basic design philosophy is simple:\nBuild every element of the experience to make you, the player, feel like this virtual world has become your world.\nThe interface should be intuitive and transparent.\nThe story should be revealed through exploration and not necessarily shoveled out in cinematic form.\nThe puzzles should range from easy to difficult, but even the toughest puzzles should be designed so that you know that all the pieces to solve it are there in front of you.\nThe sound and music should be balanced; they should add emotion but not become distracting or annoying.\nEnvironmental Immersion\nCyan has a proven history of delivering visually stunning environments that immerse players in our games. We plan to continue that tradition, leveraging Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4. Today's modern realtime engines have plenty of horse-power to produce zillions of bullets per second, but they can also be used to make remarkable landscapes and architecture that approach and even surpass the pre-rendered days of Riven. Unreal 4 is an amazing resource that enables us to build a world that you can lose yourself in.\nClick here for more info regarding the Unreal Engine 4...\nWe\u2019ve got add-ons. Three to be precise - add on a digital game, a boxed game, or a t-shirt. Here\u2019s how it works: Increase your pledge by the cost of the desired add-on(s) without changing your selected reward tier. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you\u2019ll receive a survey where you can confirm which add-on(s) you wanted. (Note that shipping is included in the amount of the add-on.)\nWe'll be excited to reach our target goal and make an amazing experience. But we're also anticipating what it means to move beyond that goal. Kickstarter funding over the base level would be used to make Obduction bigger and better - adding such stretch goals as new places to explore, additional platforms, localization, technological bells and whistles, and more.\nVery simple: It's what we love!\nWe love the wonder of having an entirely new world at our fingertips. We love the twisted unraveling of an unexpected storyline. We love the satisfying \"Aha! moment\" of solving a particularly perplexing puzzle. We love the rush of revelation when we find out what's around the next corner. We love the twinge of emotion entering a dimly lit room because we feel like this place has become our world.\nAnd we hear from more and more people who love all of those things, too. We'd love to make it for you!\nCyan has done it all. We started with self-publishing, hand-stuffing 3.5-inch floppies into boxes. We've done full-blown publisher models, where they get 88%. And we've even done all kinds of hybrid publishing models between the two. \nCurrently, we are independent, and it feels right. It's not the Myst heyday - money has come and gone, but we've managed to stay alive as a small, independent studio through times when indie studios were falling by the wayside. And now it seems that times have changed, and indie studios are making a comeback thanks to some interesting new publishing platforms and models - including Kickstarter.\n\nSimply put, Kickstarter is a way for us to deliver a stunning experience that doesn't empty your pocketbook, while keeping us independent enough to make choices that a publisher might not understand. (Like we did with Myst 20 years ago.)\n\nInstead of a detached, corporate marketing department guaranteeing to upper management how many units they will sell to justify a budget, we'll be relying on excited fans, family, friends, and even strangers who love what we're doing and want to be part of it. The funding and the budget become part of the development process instead of being coldly handed down from an accounting officer who doesn't even know the name of the product - let alone the names of any of the real people who will be making it.\nIn addition to regular Kickstarter updates, we will be making our development process transparent and accessible to our supporters in the form of exclusive backer forums. You'll be able to interact directly with the creators, read behind-the-scenes blog posts about the ins and outs of the game's development, and stay current with our overall progress. Don't worry, we'll do our best to keep the information spoiler-free, so that you still have a rich and surprising game to explore, even if you are an avid process junkie!\nThe funding will be spent solely on Obduction. It's very straightforward: we'll spend the funds that you invest on making Obduction the best possible experience.\nWe already have a team here - a few who've been here since the Myst days, and some who are more recent. We'll be adding to the team after we get funding, so we can flesh out our design and then get started on all the new art, modeling, texturing, sounds, music, lighting, characters, interface, technology, and more.\nWe don't want that team to be too large. One thing we've learned over the years is that it can be much more efficient and satisfying to have a smaller team that works closely together. We want everyone on the team to have ownership as we design and build this experience together. And we'll make sure you know who is on the team and how things are going. \nWe've done quite a few updates since we started. Here's a list that summarizes and links to a few of the more important updates.

Learn more!\nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. They released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. It was well received by children of all ages. The brothers followed up with Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx - two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. \n\nIn 1991, Cyan began work on Myst, a project that would take everything they had learned about making worlds and use it to create a truly unique experience for an older, more sophisticated audience. Myst was about finding yourself lost in a world and simply exploring, understanding and becoming part of the story - and the public response was nothing short of phenomenal. Sales for Myst and its sequel Riven have exceeded 12 million units worldwide - which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. \nAfter five products in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, new kind of Myst game, a never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst (Myst Online). It spawned a thriving, dedicated community and is still available to explore for free.\nCyan continues to draw on our past as we dream into the future. We are looking forward to creating more exciting worlds that move yet again away from the standard fare - to something unexpected.\n\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet.\n ...And a team of other amazing and talented individuals.\n                                     *Special thanks to Strata for their generous support of the Obduction Kickstarter campaign. \n*Special thanks to Robyn Miller for use of the Myst Soundtrack music used in our video.

ColecoVision is Back.\nColecoVision is a classic retro games console from the early 1980s. And we're trying to bring it back! We're planning on creating an app - as a starter on iOS, but if we get the backing also on Android, Mac, PC and Vita. Way more than just 'an emulator' we want to create something that showcases the ColecoVision, including:\nBeautiful, graphical, intuitive user interface (see some ideas below)\nCompetitive scoring \nChallenges \nAchievements \nBox art & instructions \nHistory of ColecoVision \nAround 20 original fully licensed games and now homebrew titles too.\n$250,000!! What are you spending the money on?!?\nWe hear you internet! Lots of you have been asking for a breakdown of where the money is going - so here we go!:\n- Licensing costs \nYes, there are free emulators out there which work to varying degrees, and that is GREAT! But we are delivering a fully branded (It's a proper 'ColecoVision'!), fully licensed set of original games. That means it is 100% legal, totally official, no grey areas. This is the ONLY way you are going to see a collection like this for sale.\n- Rewards costs and other fees (Kickstarter/Amazon). \nUnlike some Kickstarter campaigns where the 'physical' rewards kick in at $100+, we start ours at just $45 for a custom T-shirt or poster. We feel strongly that we want our backers to get a LOT for their money. We deliberately pitched our 'core' reward at a super-low $10 so that as many retro fans as possible could get something without breaking the bank. Of course, by pitching physical rewards at a lower price, that means our margin on those pledges is reduced - and the amount that goes into the actual delivery is lower too.\n- The remainder\nIn total (it's impossible to be precise because we get different margins on different rewards) we are going to be left with around $130-140k after the licensing, rewards and fees. This money is all going to go on actually executing the project. This means paying for: \nGraphics Designer \nUser Interface & User Experience Specialist \n3D Modeller \nDevelopers\nRemember we are absolutely not just building \"an emulator\" here. It's going to take about 5 months to complete the project, and we're creating a beautiful, unique, graphical, intuitive user-interface including competitive scoring, challenges, achievements, box art, instructions and history of ColecoVision.\nPress Coverage\nWe've received some great press coverage so far from some of the biggest gaming and tech websites around!\n\"Rantmedia Games has a knack for rekindling childhood gaming memories -- see its uncannily accurate Vectrex Regeneration as proof.\" - Engadget\nWe've got some great ideas and would love to find out what you think. It's going to be slick, polished and beautiful. You can check out the concept art below too, and see where we're heading with it.\nWe really like the idea of re-creating a living or family room with a ColecoVision console right in the center. We want people to be reminded of the original system, to see what it looked like. We're thinking atmospheric lighting - the glow of the TV, lighting the room and then to the left, we're imagining your stack of games.\nSwipe or tap, and the games all fly up and assemble in a line so you can swipe left and right through your library - accessing box-art, instructions and the ROM cartridge. Choosing to play a game will drop the cartridge into the console, and then zoom you into the TV and you'll be playing full screen.\nTo the right, we're thinking it would be cool to have a trophy cabinet. Only, instead of it containing football or athletics trophies, this one will slowly fill up as you get scores and achievements in the games. You'll be able to send challenges to friends, and see how you shape up on global leader boards.\nUltimately, it's all about the details, the little touches, the polish and the delivery of the most authentic experience possible.\nUpdate 10th October: Some fresh new renders!\nWe've got the rights to a huge list of games that we're going to include in the initial release including:\nAntarctic Adventure \u2022 BlackJack/Poker \u2022 Bump 'n' Jump \u2022 Brain Strainers \u2022 Destructor \u2022 Fortune Builder \u2022 Frenzy \u2022 Jumpman \u2022 Jumpman Junior \u2022 Jungle Hunt \u2022 Ms. Space Fury \u2022 Pepper II \u2022 Space Fury \u2022 Super Action Boxing \u2022 Super Action Football \u2022 Super Action Baseball \u2022 Super Action Soccer \u2022 Zaxxon\nWe're hoping that more can be added later on and we're also hoping to support homebrew games. That's a lot of games!\nInitially we're planning to launch on iOS, but we're also very keen to get this onto other platforms too. So it really depends on your enthusiasm - hopefully you can help us make this happen.\nWe know that everyone has their favorite platform, and we have ambitions to also launch onto Android, Mac, PC and even hardware like PS Vita. But we wanted to start simple, and then get feedback on what you'd like us to support.\nWe are excited to announce our first stretch goal!\n\n $300,000 = Android\nSomething for everyone hopefully! Depending on the amount you pledge you will get a selection of amazing rewards that include:\nWe're a small team, but we're experienced and we know what we're doing. We're the guys who bought you 'Vectrex Regeneration' - launched onto the App Store at the end of last year - bringing back the classic Vectrex experience to a whole new audience.\nIt got some great reviews from people who really know what they are talking about - like Classic Game Room, Kotaku, TUAW, Joystiq, ArsTechnica, Engadget and Touch Arcade. Lots of people called it the best emulator on the App Store, where we got featured by Apple in 141 countries!\nIt's pretty much like this: we love those classic games of the 80's and early 90's which are SO addictive and yet so simple. I guess that means you could call us 'retro enthusiasts'!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe wouldn't be pitching this if we weren't supremely confident we could deliver big time on our vision. We believe we've covered just about everything to nail this, from the design, development and delivery of the game to the logistics (and costs) of shipping the T-Shirts! We've got the rights and licenses already in place, and we've got track record of delivering this kind of thing successfully.\n\nThat of course doesn't mean it's going to be plain sailing - any game that is meaningful has the tendency to cause you pain when you least expect it, but we're confident we can deal with just about anything that comes our way.

We\u2019ve added over 200 new models to the Bones range, and we\u2019ve discovered that these products are monstrously popular. You wanted more! More monsters! More Demons! More Dragons! More characters! More variety and more amazing new models!\nYou're in luck! We haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. We have many more models that we think deserve to be added to Bones - new sculpts and classic favorites from our metal lines! We\u2019d like to see if you think so, too!\nBones are still really expensive to produce, and we still need your help to expand the line. Your support makes the molds that we need to produce the figures, and in exchange you get the first crack at these figures for a fantastic deal!\nWhat's in it for me?\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot since we fulfilled our first Bones Kickstarter project, so you won\u2019t find as many pledge levels. Turns out that most of you just wanted the core set with the potential to expand over time. What this Kickstarter will do is add 30 more models: character models, new sculpts, and monsters. After we hit our goal, we have plans to make the value of your pledge grow.\nAll we need is your support.\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nWhat?! You're a gamer, right? Are you still living under a rock? Bones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change one.\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed one massive Kickstarter and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of a Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our first Kickstarter. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2012 longshoreman strike that delayed two of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in the model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for a buy in level model. This event did not occur in our previous Kickstarter but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount for the model. Also we reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

Scavenge for supplies, find survivors, and deal with massive hordes of classic-style zombies. Recruit up to five survivors with their own random names, appearances, personalities, and quirks that can both help and hinder your journey to safety. This unique blend is wrapped in a colorful game world that doesn't take itself dark-and-gritty seriously.\nTons of replay value. Every game is different. Randomized cities, different survivors to recruit, different events. We will have a big focus on rare events and Easter Eggs.\nVaried and robust Interactive Fiction style decision making. The traits, personalities, and status of your group members influence the choices you can make and their results.\nSurvivors keep track of how they feel about other members of the group. It's up to you to keep your everyone together or at least mostly alive in the middle of bickering, personality conflicts, despair, rage, and/or insanity.\nWe have the rarely seen classic \"death metaphor\" style of zombie. They're slow, they're stupid, there's up to 200 onscreen at once, and they'll never stop chasing you. They form a shambling wall of inevitable death that will drag you down.\nRarer survivors called Uniques, that have their own special events, appearance, and dialogue.\nFind a dog, teach it to drive. Have all the humans in your party die. Make the dog recruit other dogs until your band of survivors consists of 5 dogs driving a muscle car.\nDeath Road to Canada is coming out around the end of Fall 2013. We want it have as much content as possible, and we want it our PC/Mac/Linux launch to go smoothly. Your support means we can put extra resources into accomplishing these goals, especially the \"more content\" part.\nFunds are specifically going to:\nMORE ART: We throw more money at our artist and he magically converts it to new graphics. Even more survivor and zombie variety! More city variety! New special locations! More dog types!\nMORE RARE EVENTS: Paul, our programmer, has four kids to feed. Some extra money to feed his five kids would give him the peace of mind he needs to work on extra fun stuff. Rare events! Rare weapons! Rare characters! Easter Eggs!\nMORE PROMOTION: I want to show the game off at festivals, as doing so really helps getting the word out. Travel costs, much less booth costs, are really expensive. A small portion of your support will go towards this, but not much because I don't want to be responsible for taking food from Paul's six kids.\nMORE FLEXIBILITY: Funding would give us the option of hiring a part-time programmer to help out. Or a part-time writer/designer to help make more Interactive Fiction scenarios and decisions. Your support would help us hire any extra help we end up needing.\n(IF WE GO OVER) MORE FREE UPDATES: If we exceed $25,000, we want to avoid Stretch Goals that will increase the complexity of the project and the time it takes to make the game. This is known to game developers as Kickstarter's Folly. Instead, we will put extra money into providing post-release content. This will be a mixture of extra content and feature requests from the community!\nHere's some details on what you can get for backing Death Road to Canada. All rewards are cumulative, you get all the lower tier rewards if you pledge to a higher tier.\nThe Game ($10) - A copy of the game when it releases, on PC, Linux, and Mac! Mobile versions aren't included, as the Android port will take longer and iOS codes are generally limited to 50 or so. You'll also get access to news updates exclusive to Kickstarter, including exclusive polls about game content!\nSoundtrack and Manual PDF ($25) - We'll be making a cool instruction manual in PDF format. It'll have tips, art, a strategy section, and various fun stuff. You'll also get all the music used in the game.\nEarly Access ($30) - Play the PC, Mac, or Linux version of the game about a month before it's out to the public! You'll be given access to a forum where you can send feedback directly to the developers of the game. Help us make the game even better.\nStarter Pet Option ($50) - Only available to Kickstarter backers of this tier or higher, you get the option to start the game with a kitten or puppy. They take extra food, but provide a morale boost and grow into a full sized cat or dog.\nSpecial Thanks ($75) - Everyone who pledges at this tier or above will have their names put in a Special Thanks section of the game's credits. Your first name will also be added to the big list of names that randomly generated survivors may use.\nOfficial Death Road to Canada T-Shirt ($100) - Designed by the game's artist. May or may not unlock hidden secrets if you play the game while wearing the shirt.\nGraffiti Message ($250) - Write a short message and we'll put it in the game for other players to find at random. We'll work with you so it fits within the game. Size would be about 200 characters big, maximum. $150 if you get it through the limited Early Bird tier.\nPut Your Pet in the Game ($500) - Take a picture or video of your pet, write a description of it along with its name. We'll make it so that other players can randomly find and recruit your pet into their party. Unusual pets are ok, put your ferret in the game. We'll work with you so it fits within the game design.\nAbandoned Journal ($1000) - Players can find small, abandoned journals to read that tells the story about the person that wrote them. Write a story, write poetry, write crazy top 10 lists. We'll work with you on having it fit the tone of the game. Size would be about 1200 characters big, maximum.\nDesign a Recruitable Character ($2000) - The big one! Put a version of yourself in the game, or dream up an all new character. Other players may rarely find and recruit your character into their groups. You specify your character's appearance and possible special traits. We'll work with you on having it be a good fit in the game world, and also include your character in some of the dialogue and events.\nKepa Auwae is the lead designer of Rocketcat Games, makers of Mage Gauntlet, Hook Champ, Punch Quest (a collaboration with Madgarden), and more.

With future ports to iOS, Android and Blackberry planned.\nThe story revolves around Reemus, a medieval exterminator and his loyal sidekick Liam the purple bear as they battle giant insects in a quest to legitimize \"extermination\" as a heroic career path.\n\nSound ridiculous? Well it is, but don't take my word for it. You can try the earlier games for yourself right now, for free! Just click this link, don't worry I'll be here when you get back.\n UPDATE** We're 100% Funded and we've hit every stretch goal!! Take a bow everyone, we did it!

To celebrate their arrival into the Reemus universe I've been drawing them early, click here to see all the \"Zeebarfed\" characters.\nThis new game will be the 7th outing for Reemus and Liam and the 2nd in the \"Ballads of Reemus\" series. If there's one thing I'm good at, it's milking an idea for all it's worth!\nThe original \"The Several Journeys of Reemus\" series of point and click adventure games have floated around the internet as free to play browser games since 2008. With five chapters in the series, each garnering an award nomination, they've been played millions of time on sites like Kongregate.com and Newgrounds.com. If you still haven't clicked the link to try them, click and play now! Seriously, they're free to play! \nIn 2012, Reemus made the leap into a full commercial game with a new title called \"The Ballads of Reemus\". Featuring a new, longer story, more puzzles and full voice acting. It received an award for \"Best Story\" at the Casual Connect Indie Prize 2013 last month and just because I like you, I'll let you sample that game for free too, here's a link. Click and enjoy, you can thank me later.\nSo now that you've experienced what the world of Reemus has to offer, I know what you're thinking.\n\"Jay, that Death Slug storyline was nutty. When are you going to finish it?\".\n\nWell my friends, you are in luck! That's what this Kickstarter is all about. I want to finally finish what I started in 2008 and tell the complete saga of the Death Slugs. My plan is to take the first five chapters from the \"Several Journeys\" series and reboot them, touching on some of the major story elements but with all new puzzles, full voice acting and longer gameplay. The final game will be a shiny stand alone commercial version that tells the full story from beginning to end. \n\nTHE STORY SO FAR...\nWhen Reemus the Exterminator\u2019s main competitor Pest-Go reduces pest control to a skill anyone can do with a squirt bottle, Reemus fears his chances of having a truly heroic ballad written about him are over.That is until he stumbles upon an invasion of killer Death Slugs that has all the makings of the greatest quest of all time, one that can not only restore extermination to its former glory but finally put Reemus on the map as a true hero. Now the only question remains, will Reemus and his sidekick Liam defeat the insidious Death Slugs, or will they be the ones exterminated?\nWILL THIS BE A FLASH GAME? \nNo, this time around I'm using a brand new engine. The VISIONAIRE adventure engine is tailor made for creating adventure games. The team at Daedalic games used it for \"Deponia\" and \"Whispered World\" among others and if it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me! \nHOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS BY YOURSELF?\nCan I really juggle that many balls at once? Well I was worried at first, so to set my mind at ease I created a prototype just to make sure the engine could do what I wanted and that I could actually handle programming it. \nTurns out it's really intuitive and because it's focused on adventure games it really has all the tools I need to create the game I want. \nIf you're interested in checking out what I made, click the link below. It's super short and missing a lot of key elements, like voice acting and Liam! Hopefully it's enough to whet your appetite for a full game and showcase a bit of what you'll be in store for.\n\nPLAY THE PROTOTYPE!\nPLEASE NOTE *This build is PC Only, the Mac and Linux version will have to wait a bit longer until Visionaire officially releases their porting tools. Don't worry, the full game will be available for all three! \n\nLets keep this free train rolling, click for another free shot of Reemus. This one is just a tiny morsel. Don't worry it won't ruin your appetite.\nReemus will have to deal with such quests as breaking up a Stag Beetle stag party\n$15k you say? That's barely enough for groceries, never mind padding the budget to go on an extravagant trip! Well, that's how I roll. My passion runs deep for this project, so I'm not looking to retire on kickstarter money. I just want enough to cover my living expenses so I can focus all my energy into the game.\n\nI've also managed to guilt some of my friends into investing into the project, with that I've been able to lay the ground work for the game. Writing, design and art have already begun. So I just need another hot cash injection to pull it over the finish line.\nOkay, we both knew this rain of freebies would end. It's time to ask for some money but to ease the pain I've created a bunch of cool rewards for you. Check them out...\nIf I manage to exceed my goal, all money will be re-invested back into the game in the form of:\nAdded Production Value (Extra music & animation)\nIncreased Marketing Budget\nFRIGS language translation\nPizza\n\n\nIf I completely shatter my goal, I would like to expand on the content by including some new, optional side quests. \nI have some ideas for small Reemus quests that could be expanded into optional bonus stories that don't affect the main storyline.  I've also always wanted to create new content by telling stories with secondary characters. \nFor instance if Reemus visits a honey bee in the main storyline, I'd like to add content that involves controlling that same honey bee and telling a bit of the story from his perspective. By doing this I can add new puzzles and story without having to create a whole new set of art assets which, because of the time consuming nature of art production, is what would cause delays in the schedule. Also by telling other stories within the game, the main story line doesn't get padded with filler and the original vision stays intact. \nBut for now I'd rather just promise to make the best game I possibly can with my current design document. \nWHAT PLATFORMS WILL IT BE FOR?\nVisionaire will support PC, Mac and Linux. I also have plans to port the game to all mobile devices. \nWHEN CAN WE PLAY IT?\nI'd like to launch the game by June 2014.\nWILL IT BE ON STEAM?\nI'm actively working on getting the first \"Ballads of Reemus\" game on Steam. So we'll see what happens but I'm definitely trying to get it on there. In the meantime you can vote for the first game on Steam Greenlight right now!\n\nWhile you're there, show some love for The Ballads of Reemus 2 concept page!\nHOW WILL IT BE DISTRIBUTED?\nIt will be available as a DRM-Free digital download from my site, www.Zeebarf.com.\nMy name is Jay Ziebarth aka \"Zeebarf\".

The risk is always one aspect of the game will be much harder than anticipated to complete and as such requires more than the allotted time to finish. This usually starts a chain reaction and before you know it your deadline whizzes past you.\n\nHaving already tackled a full commercial game as well as a large scale iOS project, I feel I've gained enough experience to accurately predict how long each step of the process is going to take and have allocated the appropriate amount of time for each stage.\n\nUsing an existing engine will dramatically cut down on development time as most of the heavy lifting has already been worked out.

The kickstarter funding has successfully concluded ... but the journey of our game is only beginning! Come visit our website and see how you can become part of Sojourner Tales!\nIf they combined the power of tablets, smart phones and ebook readers...with the joy of storytelling and board games.\nWelcome to Sojourner! I'm Tracy Hickman. I'm an International and New York Times Best Selling author and game designer. For over thirty years, my wife Laura and I have been writing novels and designing games ('Dragonlance', 'Wayne of Gotham', 'Ravenloft', 'Dragon's Bard'). Now we're thrilled to invite you on our latest adventure: to bring interactive adventure storytelling to families and hobbyists alike. \nIn Sojourner Tales, you will use strategy and wits as you discover and collect the pieces of your mysterious story as you strive to be the first to complete the epic adventure. The tale is different every time you play ... or you can download new Sojourner Tales to explore from our website!\nNumber of Players: 2-6\nPlaying Time: 60-90 minutes\nAge of Players: 12+ (requires minimum reading skills)\nSetup time: 5-7 minutes\nTeach the rules: 3-5 minutes\nAlmost everything you need to know in order to play the game is contained in our basic game play video right here. \nCan I play without electricity?\nAbsolutely! The Sojourner Story books are designed so that you can use either a print version of the adventures or the e-book version although the electronic versions make the game faster and easier to play.\nWINNING\nThe first person to collect all five of their Chapter Disks and fulfill the final win condition of the story wins that game!\nThere are other rules clarifying the random setup of the board and when you turn over a face-down Chapter Disk but you already know enough rules right here to play the game.\nWe've created a board game like no other: the first to integrate download content for tablets such as iPads, smart phones and e-reader devices such as Kindles, Nooks and Kobos.\nUnique Ebook Story Modules: The story told in every Sojourner Tale is designed to be contained entirely in the electronic mobi or epub files. You also have the option to download the adventure in PDF format to print out and use with the game if you do not have a tablet or other device that supports the electronic book formats. However, the use of any touch-screen device provides a magical experience in storytelling and helps the game move faster.\nAdaptable Design: The game components that come in the box and the rules of the game itself are specifically designed to be adaptive to a broad spectrum of storytelling. Each Sojourner Story Module contains information on which location tiles are to be used on the board with that particular story, thereby changing the look of the game board depending on the story being told. All of the flavor, setting, characters and narrative of the adventure are contained in the downloaded module ... meaning the game can adapt to any story you want to live.\nInnovative Storytelling System: The board keeps track of your location in the epic story, making certain that the game flows back and forth between the board and the ebook with the story continuity left intact. For random encounters, an innovative 'Twisted Tales' system lets the players draw two twisted cards and one tales card and then 'stack' them in such a way as to make a phrase -- a phrase which takes them to a specific adventure entry for that combination of cards. \nGrass-roots Licensing: We want YOU to write adventures for our game and so we are even providing you with a 'grass-roots licensing option whereby you can not only create your own Sojourner Tales games but (with our license) also sell those adventures on our official website.\n\nAnything is possible! Since the story and complexity of the game is designed to be contained entirely in the Sojourner Story Module, it is entirely up to the module designer.\nThe book contains our 'secret recipe': a matrix of entries designed specifically to interface with the game. You play the game under the same basic rules but once you enter the book, whatever the story's author creates will plunge you into that story.  Some stories are simple and created for quick play and families. Others may be complex, intended for more serious hobby gamers.\nOur stretch goals list two additional modes of play: Improv and Theater play. Improv is a way of using the game to make up the story collectively as you play.  Sojourner Theater  play has each person at the table downloading the same book ... but with each player taking a different speaking part as the game progresses.\nIn our initial release of the game, we will include components for six genres of story:\nFantasy\nScience-fiction\nHorror\nRomance/Steampunk\nMystery\nHoliday\nAdditional themed components representing further genres are certainly possible. What would you like to see?\nWe're packing a lot of awesome in every box.\n1 Gameboard\n50 'Twisted' Cards\n50 'Tales' Cards\n36 'Destiny' Cards\n6 Player Tokens\n6 Six-sided Dice\n1 'Lead Player' Marker\n1 'Chapter' Marker\n1 'Scene' Marker\n32 Story Disks (6 each in 6 colors)\n6 Journal Display Boards\n15 Location Tiles (creates 6 unique board configurations supporting fantasy, sci-fi, horror, mystery, romance/steampunk, superhero and holiday themes)\n1 Sojourner Story Module (print edition with additional access instructions for downloading PDF, Kindle Mobi or iPad epub files)\n1 Rules Book\nOriginal Cover Design\nCould you write a game just for your son's birthday? Maybe a game specifically for your parent's anniversary?  What if you want to write fan-fiction Sojourner Story Modules of your own?\nGreat! We want to help you!\nWe will be providing through our website tools to help you create your own Sojourner Tales adventures for your own, personal -- as in non-commercial -- use.\nBut what if you want to SELL that amazing Sojourner Story Module that you polished to perfection?\nGreat! We want to help you do that, too!\nWe will sell you a license to produce official and sanctioned Sojourner Tales adventures which you can sell with our blessing. The license initially will be for from one to two years. Anything you produce during the period of the license that meets our standards, is licensed for five years after the end of the license. You should notice that there are Backer levels which include this license. You'll need to adhere to our standards policies regarding content and quality.

The campaign is now over, which means Kickstarter has frozen this page and it can never be updated.  Which means that everything here is absolutely, 100% guaranteed to be hopelessly and comically out of date.  The actual Robot Turtles activity is now happening at www.RobotTurtles.com, where you should proceed immediately (after watching my adorable children in the video above). \nThank you so very, very much for your support.\n-- Dan Shapiro\nRobot Turtles Forever!\nAnd now, the campaign that started it all...\nRobot Turtles is a board game for kids ages 3-8. It takes seconds to learn, minutes to play, and will keep them learning for hours. Kids won't know it but while they're playing, they're learning the fundamentals of programming.\nI'm a father of four year old twins.  Teaching them to program a computer is the single greatest superpower I can give them. I made Robot Turtles so that my kids could learn programming basics without needing a computer. In fact, they don't even need to be able to read!\nI've been told that this would never sell in the toy aisle.  I've shown it to board game designers and manufacturers; they told me this would never work on store shelves. Learning programming just sounds too complicated.\nBut I disagree.  I think programming can be as simple as playing with these four turtles.\nThat's why I'm here on Kickstarter.  If there are a thousand of us, we can do this.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in believing that programming literacy is going to be key to our children\u2019s future. How many of us are there?\nI\u2019m a software guy who\u2019s been programming since I was 7 years old.  I invented Robot Turtles as I pondered these questions in the shower one morning:\n1) Why are kid games either pure luck (Candyland) or a frustrating exercise in trying to lose on purpose, without the child noticing (Tic-Tac-Toe)?\n2) How old does a child need to be to learn to program? (Do they even need to read?)\n3) What's something cool I can do with my kids this afternoon?\nI got out of the shower, printed out some generic robot clip art, and told my 4-year-old twins that I had a new game for us to play.  We started experimenting with the rules, and the kids couldn't get enough of it.\nI got so excited about this game that I took a leave of absence from my job at Google and spent the summer working full time to develop it.\nNow I just need to find homes for 1,000 copies so I can meet the factory minimum order!\nOne of the unique things about Robot Turtles is that only one person (the \u201cTurtle Mover\u201d) needs to read the rules. That means the kids can just start playing!  Here\u2019s how it unfolds.\nFirst, put away the Laser and Function Frog cards.  They'll get to unlock these later!\nEvery player (\u201cTurtle Master\u201d) gets to pick a turtle and gets a matching deck of cards.  \nStack the cards on the table, in piles, face up, and build a maze for each player out of walls and a jewel.\nThen read these three rules out loud to your turtle masters:\nThe youngest turtle master goes first.  They put their first card down and you move the turtle accordingly.\nIt might help to point out that the purple card turns the turtle toward the purple flower, the yellow card toward the yellow flower, etc.\nAs they progress, they build their program up on the table. If they make a mistake, they can shout \"Bug!\" and debug it.\nPretty soon your kids will figure out the secret of Robot Turtles: it lets the kids control the grownups!  The little programmers put instruction cards down, driving the turtles through the maze, but the grownup is the computer, executing commands on the board.  At its heart, Robot Turtles is a game about bossing around adults. Just like programming is about bossing around computers.\nKids love unlocking new features of Robot Turtles, like powerups in a video game.  Each unlockable changes the game to make it more challenging, so Robot Turtles can grow with your children.\nIt may not look like it, but Robot Turtles is a very simple programming language.  It drew its inspiration from Logo, the first programming language I learned as a kid (and the first programming language to prominently feature a turtle).  \nWhile the Robot Turtles programming language isn\u2019t Turing complete, it prepares kids with the skills they\u2019ll need to learn to love programming as they grow up:\nExperiential learning. Kids start the game the same way they start programming \u2013 at the command line. Every instruction they issue is executed immediately. They quickly discover that they can learn by trying things out.\nDebugging. The \u201cBug\u201d undo feature offers the simple confidence that they can try anything. If it doesn\u2019t work out, they know they can back up and try again. For new computer learners, discovering that there\u2019s no cost for being wrong is essential to their growth.\nLimited syntax. Computer programming is about expressing complicated ideas with just a few simple building blocks. The first time they play, kids will want to tell you what to do, or point the cards sideways to make them do something different. Learning Robot Turtles is a process of learning to use a new, simple language to express complicated thoughts.\nOrder of operations. It\u2019s quickly apparent that \u201cforward, forward, right\u201d is very different from \u201cright, forward, forward\u201d.\nPlanning a program. There\u2019s nothing more cool then when kids graduate to \u201cPlay 3\u201d and \u201cWrite Program\u201d and you see them planning out the whole course in their heads. Just like real programmers, they mentally run their code and debug it. Then they get frustrated and just try it to see what happens\u2026 also like real programmers.\nFunctions and optimizations. Although the youngest turtle masters may not be old enough for Write Program and Function Frog, this offers slightly older kids a level of abstraction and challenge on par with \u201creal\u201d programming. Yes, kindergartners can refactor code!\nComputers work for you. Somewhere along the line, programmers learn that writing code isn\u2019t like doing your homework \u2013 it\u2019s like ordering around a devoted (if not very bright) servant. Guess what? You are the computer and they get to order you around. (That\u2019s why kids love this game!)\nMade in America\nI spent a lot of time figuring out the best manufacturer for Robot Turtles, but in the end the decision was easy.  Delano Service is based in Battle Creek, Michigan.  They're over a century old and manufacture fantastic games like Anomia and Fluxx. Their CEO, Kim Drayer, is wicked sharp and a pleasure to work with.  And while we live in an international economy, I'm particularly proud to be able to send your family something that was made entirely in the country in which I live.  No matter where you may be! Which takes us to...\nInternational Backers\nRobot Turtles has the most amazing backers imaginable. 47 volunteer translators have already offered their services to help localize the Robot Turtles instructions in to 21 languages.  The game has no text except the instructions and the box art, so it's perfect for audiences around the world.  So far, backers plan to have the instructions available in the following languages:\nAfrikaans , Catalan, Chinese (Simplified) , Danish, Dutch, Australian English, UK English, Finnish, French , German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian , Polish, Portuguese , Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.\nIf you would like to help, please sign up!\nRobot Turtles is available internationally for a single, fixed shipping price. All tiers except the early bird pricing tier (read why) are available to international backers, including the 3-pack and 10-pack discount tiers.\nI can't believe you made it this far.\nBut if you did, you must be terribly interested in what kind of turtle experiences are available!  I will try not to disappoint.  If anything's unclear, let me know and I will clarify.  It's frustrating when you can't figure out what's in a pledge level and what isn't, so I tried to summarize each one below for you.\nThank you ($1)\nThank you for your support! Every dollar helps bring these adorable robotic terrapins in to existence. \nSummary:\nMy thanks, transmitted psychically and through email\nEarly Turtle: Full Game with Discount ($29) \nSmall print runs of games are extremely expensive - most of the cost comes from set up, so the first thousand copies are the most expensive. Still, I want to get Robot Turtles in as many hands as possible. So the first people to pledge get robot turtles for just $29, including free shipping in the US. Unfortunately this tier is not available internationally (read why). \nIncluded in the box, you get:\n1 quad fold game board (20\" x 20\" heavy duty chipboard)\n1 full-color set of rules\n4 robot turtle tiles (all tiles are 2\" x 2\" heavy chipboard)\n4 decks of cards (one for each turtle player) - 36 poker-sized cards each\n14 stone wall tiles and 10 ice wall tiles\n4 robot gem tiles\nand an incomparably good time with the kids!\nUpdate: the incredible backers of this project have enabled me to make the game even better! More cards, more tiles, and more fun.  See the updates section for details.\nSummary:\n1 game\nRobot Turtle: Full Game ($40)\nIf you pledge at this level, you'll get the same as the Early Turtle tier. Unlike the Early Turtle tier, this one can be shipped internationally (and so can all the tiers below).\nSummary:\n1 game\nThank-you Turtle: Letter & Game ($60) \nYour kid is going to be very happy: in addition to the full game, your child(ren) get a full-color letter, addressed to them by name, with an inked turtle-foot signature on the bottom. You get to choose which turtle sends it, too. And inside the game box? Their name is in the credits in the manual! This tier includes one letter with up to four children's names on it.  Note that an email will be sent asking for your children's names on Sept 27, and you must reply within three days of the project's closing (by midnight PST on September 30th) in order for them to be included in the manual.  You also get a digital printable version of award-winning illustrator Matthew Cordell's \"Turtles Playing Turtles\".\nUpdate: Because of your incredible support, a full color pick-your-own-path 32-page ebook will be included at this tier!  It's a fantastic tale where kids make decisions at each page that guide the story. It tells how Beep the turtle learns how to work with his new friend the Function Frog.  \nHere's a draft of the first of the 16 amazing illustrations in the book.  It's going to be something else. \nSummary:\n1 game\nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook\nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n1 thank-you letter\nThank-you in the manual\nTriple Turtles: Holiday Shopping 3-pack ($80) \nNot one, not two, but three teams of turtles will march their way to your door.

This level doesn't include the letter or the recognition in the manual.\nSummary:\nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook\nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n3 games\nLaser Turtles: Extraordinary 3D Edition ($200)\nAs terrific as Robot Turtles is, I have been itching to make something truly unique. Something gorgeous. Something 3D.\nSomething that gave me an excuse to spend some quality time with a 100-watt CO2 laser cutter.\nAfter evaluating miniatures (big minimum order), 3D printing (ugly plastic and too expensive), and various handmade options (I have no artistic skill whatsoever), I settled on laser turtles - a special edition where all the tiles are upgraded to pure laser-made awesomeness.  \nEach one of these is made by hand, probably by me although I'm still entertaining fantasies of recruiting someone's teenager to babysit the lasercutter. They are labeled for ages 12+ (not for little ones) because they absolutely cannot go in little mouths.  But damn, do these make the game amazing!  (This tier also comes with the standard game, which you'll need for the board and cards, plus you can play it with younger ones). And you get the Thank-You Turtle.\nHere are the current prototypes. I'm going to keep experimenting with methods and materials to make this as fantastic as it can possibly be!\nIt is awesome.\nIf you want the laser turtles AND another tier, see the FAQ entry for \"How do I get two rewards?\"  \nSummary:  \nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook  \nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n1 thank-you letter\nThank-you in the manual\n1 game\n1 Laser Turtles upgrade pack\nTen Turtles: School-size Deca-pack ($240) \nA very noble cause.

Your support was spectacular. We did it. Production art is starting; the game is going to go to press. WOOHOO!\nMore early birds.  My $40 price was based around a 1,000 unit minimum order.  I had no idea there was going to be this kind of excitement. That means I get to place a bigger order, which means I get to make more units available at a discount!  (Note that, because international shipping is already discounted, I can't offer it as an option for Early Bird, so the best value for international backers is the 3- and 10-packs). \nInstant coloring sheets thank-you. For hitting (and then blasting through) the $60k stretch goal, Backers at the $1 level and up can go here and download a PDF of six coloring sheets. This is completely free, with no DRM, and available immediately.  \nRobot Turtles in the news. You can read about the project all over the tech news.  Here's the list of articles. \nRobot Turtles: Galapagos Rules.  Us old codgers can enjoy Robot Turtles too!  Raising $150,000 has unlocked a new set of rules that allows older kids (8+) and grownups to play after the kids go to sleep.  It's incredibly fun!\nCommunity website. Raising $200,000 has unlocked a community site to collaborate on new game ideas, translations of the manual, share pictures, and more.\nDouble-sided tiles. Raising $250,000 has unlocked tiles printed on both sides, so when your kid melts ice walls, you flip them over to reveal puddles!\nMulticolor jewels.  Instead of just having green robot jewel tiles, the four jewels will come in four colors: sapphire, amathyst, ruby, and emerald.  \nLimited edition print. Award-winning children's artist Matthew Cordell has created a limited edition of 25 prints, \"Turtles playing turtles\", that are available at two pledge levels, signed and personalized by the artist. \nPrintable \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" For those of you who don't get the collectible limited edition print, all pledges at $60 or higher will get a digital, printable version of the print. \nPick your own path book. All backers at the $1 level and up get the text; backers at the \"Thank-you Turtle ($60)\" and up levels get a full-color ebook! This is shaping up to be an amazing 32-page book, illustrated in a style similar to the box cover, where kids get to decide at each page what to do next.\n50% more tiles. The original design had 32 tiles, which was plenty for basic play but could run a little shy if you really wanted to build something incredible. Every copy of the game now comes with extra walls for a total of a ridiculous 48 tiles, enough for mazes that would make a minotaur marvel. \nWe found a bug. Every game now comes with four unique bug cards, one in each deck, that kids can point to when they find a problem with their program.\nMore cards. Each deck has been upgraded from 36 to 45 cards, for bigger mazes and more turtle goodness!\nThanks so much for making it all the way to the bottom.  This project has been amazing because of people like you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first time delivering a board game. I've spent months learning everything I can about the process and interviewing some of the greatest game developers around. I've been cataloging a huge litany of problems and mistakes, and making plans to avoid them. Here's what I've come up with.\n\nI'm working with Delano Services, a major game publisher in Battle Creek, MI, that's been in business for over a century. I've quoted every aspect of the process so I know the costs and materials used. I've talked to the CEO, who fully supports the project, and has agreed to let me fly in for the initial print run to inspect the results (and to package up the collector's edition boxes and ship them immediately). \n\nBecause Delano is in the US, I can and will hop on a plane if something goes wrong. Since Robot Turtles uses standard cardboard parts, the risks of unforeseen production difficulties are minimal (but not zero). \n\nShipping is something that trips up many Kickstarters, so I've been working on that for a while. It's insanely expensive. If I took delivery of a pallet of games to my basement and shipped them out to you via UPS ground, it would cost me more to ship the game than it would to manufacture it! So instead, I'm shipping the games to Amazon and using their third party fulfillment services, which saves cost (and my basement, and my sanity). \n\nBut that adds another level of complexity. So I've spent some time working with an ex-Amazon consultant to do my best to ensure that everything goes smoothly. \n\nMy biggest concern isn't actually getting you the game. It's getting you the game in time for Christmas. I've reviewed the schedule with Delano, and everyone's confident that they can do it. But in the unlikely event that something holds up production of the game - natural disaster, turtle rebellion - I will get all the backers a print-and-play PDF version, then ship the games ASAP. I don't think it'll come to that, but that's the backup plan.\n\nInternational backers have additional uncertainty. It is more likely that shipments may miss the holidays because of shipping delays, customs holdups, or border gremlins. I don't know the taxes, duties, or tariffs you may owe when the game arrives. \n\nIt's possible that, if problems occur, I may not be able to fix them to your liking. My options to make things better will be limited to refunds and, if extra inventory is still available, replacements. If extra inventory isn't available (or if there's a problem that can't be fixed, like a special reward that can't be delivered), then you're going to be stuck with a refund instead of a game.\n\nBut I'm deeply committed to getting this product in to your hands, and the hands of your kids, as quickly as possible. Whatever comes up, I will keep you posted, step by step.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Robot Turtles latest: Target in Fargo, and why that matters", "update_content": "I can't believe it's been more than a year since the crazy Robot Turtles adventure started. All sorts of amazing things have been happening, but let me tell you the part I'm most excited about.\nWhen I was two years old, our family moved to Fargo, North Dakota. I lived there until I was 12. I've been asked, \"What brings a family to Fargo, ND?\" It's the answer to this riddle: \"Where can two newly-minted professors (my parents) get a decent job at the same place and same time?\" NDSU was hiring. \nSo I grew up in the midwest, the land of the Frozen Chosen. Wonderful people, winters that would send a polar bear looking for a space heater. There weren't many options for things: ethnic food meant the chinese place on the overpass. \"The Mall\" meant West Acres, a place where people occasionally died of hypothermia in the parking lot in the winter.

Completely synchronized cutting-edge video screen visuals, state-of-the-art lighting and special fx, stage show production and special on-stage interactive segments with the audience dazzle crowds of all ages \u2013 gamers and non-gamers alike.\nThe Kickstarter campaign will help us raise the funds to create and produce our third album which we have titled \"Level 3\". This will be a studio recording (not a live recording).  Our hope is to be able to obtain funding for our stretch goals so we can produce a full length live concert motion picture as well.  Over the past decade Video Games Live has helped to legitimize video game music and has shown the world the creative, cultural and artistic side of gaming. Although VGL has obtained a lot of accolades and success, the music industry and record companies are VERY different and no music or record company is willing to invest the budget needed to accomplish our goals and put out a top quality product that we and the entire game industry can be proud of. They don't believe in the culturally artistic significance of video game music and they don't believe that people are interested in listening after the game is turned off.  And that's where YOU come in!\n\nThis project is open for funding for EVERYWHERE AND EVERYONE in the world!  We will ship anywhere and there will be absolutely no region coding, etc.  PAL versions of the DVD/Blu-Ray will be made.\nVideo Games Live: Level 3 will be the 3rd album of symphonic & rock video game music from the award winning 10 year+ world touring Video Games Live concert series.\n\nThe album will be recorded in a world famous recording studio with a 60 - 72+ piece orchestra, 60+ person choir and full rock band consisting of world famous game composers from around the world.\n\nEach music segment in Video Games Live is personally arranged and orchestrated by the original composers and also uses input from the actual game designers & producers and game developers & publishers.\n\nThe album track list will consist of NEVER BEFORE RELEASED Video Games Live music arrangements from potential game franchises such as Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger/Cross, Shadow of the Colossus, Skyrim, Journey, Monkey Island, Destiny, DOTA, Assassin's Creed, Earthworm Jim, Silent Hill, Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, Super Smash Bros., Metroid, Donkey Kong Country, Mass Effect, Katamari Damacy, World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, BioShock, Beyond Good & Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Street Fighter II, Uncharted, Portal, Tetris, Red Dead Redemption, Devil May Cry, Megaman, Soul Calibur, Resident Evil, Pac-Man AND MORE! (final setlist to be contingent on game publisher approval). The goal is to have between 15 - 18 tracks on the album.

Here is just a small sampling of some of the people whose work will be featured on VIDEO GAMES LIVE: LEVEL 3!\n\nWe want to film the new Blu-Ray/DVD/motion picture in Latin America during our big tour beginning at the end of September (Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Mexico City).  The fans in Latin America are VERY loud, VERY excited and VERY passionate about Video Games Live.  Here is just a small taste of what it is like at a Video Games Live show in Latin America!\nWHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?\nThe album will take at least 2 full studio days to record.  An orchestral recording of this nature is based on 3 hour sessions.  We will need a total of FOUR 3 hour sessions (12 hours total).  Salary costs for top of the line highly skilled orchestra musicians range between $350 - $500 per person per 3 hour session.  For a 72 piece orchestra the cost for a 2 day session (just for the musicians) can easily reach $125,000 - $150,000.  Choir is another big consideration and choir budgets can widely vary anywhere from a few thousand dollars to $20,000.  A top-of-the-line recording studio (including ALL costs) will be approximately $5,000 per day ($10,000 total).  Mixing with a top Hollywood film (& game) audio engineer (one week including studio and assistants) = approximately $15,000.  Mastering will take place at the most famous Mastering Studio in Hollywood (Bernie Grundman's) by one of the most highly regarded mastering engineers in the business... Patricia Sullivan. Patricia has personally worked with and mastered films by John Williams (including Star Wars & Indiana Jones films), James Newton Howard, James Horner, Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, John Powell and Mark Isham.  Mastering budget for this type of project could go upwards to $7,500.  Other parts of the budget will include things like Album Art ($5,000), CD manufacturing based on 7,500 initial units ($5,000), Music Licensing/Mechanical Licensing to the Game Publishers, composers, right holders, etc. based on 7,500 initial units ($15,000), Kickstarter & Amazon fees (10% = $25,000), hiring of a PR firm in both North America and Europe, Shipping & Handling of goods, added physical products at certain tier levels, etc.\n\nMusicians (symphony & choir) = $130,000 - $160,000\nRecording Studio = $10,000\nMixing = $15,000\nMastering = $7,500\nAlbum Art/Liner Notes = $5,000\nCD Manufacturing = $5,000\nMusic Licensing/Publishing/Mechanicals = $15,000\nKickstarter/Amazon fees = $25,000\nProject PR (Worldwide) & Marketing (Advertising) = $15,000\nDomestic U.S. Shipping & Handling of Rewards = $5,000\nPhysical Reward products (hats, print-outs, keychains, etc.) = $12,500\nLocation Rental & Celebration Events = $5,000\nTOTAL = Approximately $275,000\n\nVideo Games Live is not making any money from this project.  Our goal is to continue doing what we love and bringing it to the people who care (as well as introducing game music to people who don't!)  In fact, Video Games Live and Tommy Tallarico will be personally helping to fund the project outside of the Kickstarter campaign.  The initial $250,000 does NOT cover all of the expenses associated with the project.\nVideo Games Live has produced 2 highly successful and Top 10 Billboard ranked albums in the past as well as a Top 10 worldwide released PBS Special and DVD/Blu-Ray.  Tommy Tallarico was the very first video game composer EVER to release a worldwide video game soundtrack album (back in 1994 with Capitol Records) and has composed and produced 10 highly acclaimed albums since.  This project will NOT go over budget and WILL be delivered on time!\nThe main idea behind our project is to give back as much as possible to donors by AT LEAST QUADRUPLING THE VALUE of the amount pledged!  You can also view our epically long REWARDS VIDEO below that details, shows and explains all of the different Tiers (Reward video does not include the ALL DIGITAL tiers as they were not available when the video was created).\n\nRewards Video:\nNOTE: Reward video does not include the ALL DIGITAL tiers or the STAGE 1-3 tier or WARP ZONE 2 as they were not available when the video was created.\n\nHere's a handy text based matrix for all the Reward Tiers!

Upon funding of this goal, EVERYONE who pledges will get a special and exclusive digital version of this documentary (we ask our fans to please NOT publish this publicly out of respect for the people who backed the project).\n  $750,000 - A live full length feature film and documentary of the music, making-of, interviews with composers/designers, history of game music, etc. to be recorded during the upcoming Video Games Live Latin America tour taking place this fall.  If we hit the $750,000 stretch goal then all tiers from $25 and up will receive a digital version of the film and all tiers from $40 and up will include a physical Blu-Ray/DVD combo of the movie!\n\nTO BE CLEAR... The VIDEO GAMES LIVE: LEVEL 3 album will be a studio recording and NOT a live recording.  The movie on the other hand WILL be a live video recording (and documentary) of a number of shows filmed in Latin America.  Depending on funding and stretch goals, we may include a special download album of the live recordings from the film as well.\nThe main goal of Tommy Tallarico (23 year video game composer veteran and creator/producer of Video Games Live\u2122) has always been to prove to the world how culturally significant and artistic video games have become as well as helping to usher in a whole new generation of people to appreciate the arts.\n\nPlease watch this very informative and important video that will give you incredible insight as to what goes on in creating such an event and the passion behind it (courtesy of Game Informer).\nIncorporated in 2002, Video Games Live\u2122 is the first and most successful video game touring concert in the world having already performed over 275 shows in 27 countries on 5 continents. Over 1 million people have experienced the show live. Video Games Live\u2122 has previously released 2 albums worldwide (both of which debuted in the Billboard Top 10) as well as an award winning full length feature DVD/Blu-Ray. In 2010 the show aired nationally on PBS and quickly became one of the top rated PBS Specials of all time. Video Games Live\u2122 continues to break new ground and thrill audiences worldwide with brand new content each year.\nPress Quotes\n\"Captivating!

As one of the most successful video game composers in history, he has helped revolutionize the gaming world, creating unique audio landscapes that enhance the video gaming experience.  He is considered the person most instrumental in changing the game industry from bleeps & bloops to real music now appreciated worldwide by tens of millions of fans.  As a well-recognized on-air television personality, live performer and composer, Tommy brings his in-depth knowledge, years of experience, and love of cutting edge multimedia and video games to the masses.  Tommy has worked in the gaming industry as a designer, product manager, producer, writer, games tester and heads of both music and video departments.\n\nAn accomplished musician, Tallarico has been writing music for video games for more than 23 years.  He has won over 50 industry awards and has worked on more than 300 game titles; to date, they total sales of more than 100 million units and over four billion dollars in revenue.  No one in the history of the video game industry has ever worked on more titles and projects.  In 2008, he was enshrined in the Guinness Book of World Records with a two page feature article and interview and currently holds 3 Guinness World Records including the person who has worked on the most commercially released video games.  In 2012 during the Game Developers Conference he received a Lifetime Achievement Award and is also in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. for his contributions to the game industry.  In 1994, he founded Tommy Tallarico Studios, the multimedia industry's largest audio production house.    Tommy is a cousin of rock star legend Steven Tyler (nee Tallarico) and in 2002 Tallarico\u2019s music was used as the opening song for Aerosmiths' \u201cGirls of Summer\u201d world tour.  His top titles include Earthworm Jim, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Disney\u2019s Aladdin, Spider-Man and Metroid Prime as well as top selling popular game franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac-Man, Madden Football, Mortal Kombat, Time Crisis, Unreal, Lineage, James Bond, Blitz Football, Knockout Kings, Test Drive, Scooby Doo, WWE & Twisted Metal. His score for Advent Rising has been noted as \"one of the greatest musical scores of all time\" by websites such as Yahoo, Gamespot and others.\n\nTallarico has been featured on numerous national and international television shows, appearing repeatedly on CNN, FOX and MTV.  Tommy hosted, wrote and co-produced the top rated and very popular Reviews on the Run/Judgment Day television show as well as the longest running award-winning video game television show, The Electric Playground (www.elecplay.com), which has been on the air since 1997.  The show is syndicated worldwide and airs daily in prime-time.  The Electric Playground won the 2001 Telly Award for \u201cBest Entertainment Cable Program\u201d.  In 2006, Tommy hosted and helped to launch the worldwide Championship Gaming Series for DirecTV.  His national television debut came in 1994 when he was featured and asked to guest host ABC's \"In Concert\" television program which included artists Peter Gabriel and Todd Rundgren.  From 1991 to 1994, he headed Virgin Interactive\u2019s music and video division, and executive produced numerous video game green screen shoots for films including \u201cDemolition Man\u201d where he worked with Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes and Hollywood producer Joel Silver.\n\nIn 2002, Tallarico created the critically acclaimed Video Games Live (www.videogameslive.com), an immersive, audio and video concert experience celebrating video games.  Video Games Live features music from the greatest video games performed by top orchestras and choirs around the world combined with synchronized video footage, lasers, lights, special effects, interactivity and live action to create an explosive and unique one-of-a-kind entertainment experience.  Video Games Live is the first and most successful video game touring concert in the world having performed over 250 shows in 25 countries on 5 continents.  The debut performance was launched on July 6th, 2005 at the world famous Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles with the LA Philharmonic.  Over 11,000 people attended making it the biggest video game concert in the world at that time (since then they have performed to over 40,000 people in places like Taiwan and China).  Most of the game music played during the initial launch of the show (Halo, Sonic, Warcraft, Tomb Raider, Myst, Kingdom Hearts, Tron, Advent Rising, etc.) had never been performed live anywhere in the world.  Since then over 1 million people have experienced the show live.  On October 30, 2005 they broke new ground once again by putting on the very first video game concert in Canada (Vancouver).  They followed with groundbreaking first ever game concert performances in countries such as Brazil, New Zealand, Spain, Mexico, England, Chile, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Scotland, Ireland, Portugal, Poland, Wales, United Arab Emirates & France.  Video Games Live was also the very first American video game concert to perform in Asia (Korea) and the first non-Japanese game concert to perform in Japan.  In 2007 they were recipients of a major industry award in Brazil for \"Special Breakthrough Achievement\" following their performances in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo the year before.  Also in 2007 they helped to launch the $1.8 billion LA Live Nokia Theatre in downtown Los Angeles and had their national television debut on Spike TV.  In 2008 they released the highly anticipated album entitled Video Games Live - Volume One, recorded at the world famous Abbey Road Studios in London, the album debuted at #10 on the Billboard charts.  It was the first video game compilation album to ever be released worldwide and won BEST SOUNDTRACK ALBUM awards from IGN.com and the Game Audio Network Guild.  In 2010 a 90 minute national PBS Special was aired in over 90 million households across America.  A Blu-Ray, DVD and album were released.  It was the first time that music from franchises such as Mario, Zelda, Sonic and Megaman were released outside of Japan.  The second album (entitled Video Games Live - Level Two) debuted at #8 on the Billboard Charts.  With literally 100\u2019s of ticket buyer reviews on Ticketmaster.com, Video Games Live boasts an impressive and outstanding 4.6 (out of 5) rating.   There are currently over 30,000 unique videos of Video Games Live performances on YouTube which total over 100 million views.  Sponsored and endorsed by some of the top corporations in the world, the Video Games Live concert event continues to tour the world, break new ground and thrill audiences worldwide with brand new content each year.\n\nTallarico was the first musician to release a video game soundtrack worldwide (Tommy Tallarico\u2019s Greatest Hits Vol. 1 \u2013 Capitol Records).  He has released over ten video game soundtrack albums since, including the highly acclaimed James Bond Tomorrow Never Dies, MDK and award-winning Advent Rising and Earthworm Jim Anthology.  Tommy was one of the first musicians to ever use live guitar and 3-D audio in a video game (The Terminator), and was instrumental in bringing true digital interactive multi-channel 5.1 surround to the gaming world.  He has performed and sold out shows on the biggest and most prestigious stages in the world including London's Royal Festival Hall and Hammersmith Apollo, the Olympic Park Stadium in Korea, the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., WolfTrap, Hard Rock Live in Orlando, Pan-Chiao Stadium in Taipei, the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas and multiple shows at the Hollywood Bowl attended by tens of thousands of fans.  In 2004 he performed the grand finale music act on national and worldwide television (E! Entertainment, G4TV) with BT & Mobius 8 for the G-Phoria awards show.  In 2007 he performed along with Kid Rock and the Foo Fighters during the nationally televised Spike TV Video Game Awards show.\n\nTommy is the founder, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.), which is a non-profit organization educating and heightening the awareness of audio for the interactive world (www.audiogang.org).  With over 2,500 members representing over 35 countries since its inception in 2002, G.A.N.G. has quickly become known as one of the strongest and best examples of helping the game industry community.  Tommy is an Advisory Board member for the Game Developers Conference, a Governor for the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS/GRAMMY's), a spokesperson for the Entertainment Consumers Association, a proud member of the International Game Developers Association and a nominating peer panel leader for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\n\nTommy is involved in many community, non-profit, scholastic and charitable organizations which include the Hollywood Arts and GRAMMY In The Schools.  In 2007, Tommy's many charitable works were recognized by the Hollywood Arts organization when they chose him as the first honoree and recipient for their now annual Dream Awards.  The IDG video game industry white paper mentions Tommy (along with Bill Gates) as one of the people who contributed the most to the advancement and growth of the industry in 2003.  In 2009, he received the prestigious \"Ambassador Award\" during the Game Developers Choice Awards which was only the 2nd time the award had ever been bestowed.  That same year he was chosen as one of the Top 50 Game Industry People by Game Developers Magazine.\n\nBorn February 18, 1968 and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, he moved to Southern California on his own at age 21 to pursue a career in entertainment.  Homeless with no means of financial support, Tommy was discovered in a music store and started working in the video game industry within 3 days of arriving in California.  All 4 of his grandparents came to America from Italy in the early 1900's and instilled a great sense of hard work, compassion, appreciation, passion, dreaming, creativity, sense of accomplishment and love for others that he has carried with him his entire life.  Tommy is a proud vegan and has been a spokesperson, supporter and contributor for many animal rights organizations.  In his spare time he enjoys nature, photography, traveling, cooking, video games, comic books, backgammon, being a kid and meeting new people.  His popular website www.tallarico.com has received over 250 million hits by more than 10 million unique users.\nHere is the video of Tommy's recent TED talk explaining the cultural significance of video games and they're importance as art.\nTommy playing Intellivision circa 1982", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideo Games Live has produced 2 highly successful and Top 10 Billboard ranked albums in the past as well as a Top 10 worldwide released award winning PBS Special and DVD/Blu-Ray. Tommy Tallarico was the very first video game composer EVER to release a worldwide video game soundtrack album (back in 1994) and has composed and produced 10 highly acclaimed albums since. This project will NOT go over budget and WILL be delivered on time!\n\nBecause we have done this same kind of project multiple times in the past, we know exactly what the challenges for this project are (and how to overcome them). The toughest part in doing the project will be to get the game publishers approvals for the project. That being said, Video Games Live was the FIRST in the world to officially perform music from game franchises such as Kingdom Hearts, Halo, Warcraft, Sonic, Myst, Tron, Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider, StarCraft, Diablo, Civilization, God of War, Skyrim, BioShock, Mass Effect, Silent Hill, Shadow of the Colossus, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, Street Fighter, Megaman, Resident Evil, Tetris, Earthworm Jim, Journey, DOTA, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny, Monkey Island and MANY MORE! Video Games Live was also the FIRST to license music and synchronized video for an album and DVD/Blu-Ray release outside of Japan from companies such as Nintendo, Capcom, Sony, Konami and Sega!\n \nVideo Games Live creator/producer Tommy Tallarico has been in the industry for over 23 years and has worked on over 300 video games (a Guinness World Record!). He has worked with and created games with every major publisher and game developer over the years. This is one of the main reasons why Video Games Live is able to get so many approvals and why it is the only show in the world with so many different games by so many different publishers and developers. But it is still a long process that has many time challenges. In order to get the album/motion picture out within the targeted time-frame (February 18, 2014) sacrifices to the preferred setlist may need to be made. This is part of the reason why ALL of the tracks listed in the description section will be sought after.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "LEVEL 6 Album finished!

Strongman is my all-new creator-owned adventure series that tells two-fisted tales of an original pulp hero, whose exploits stretch from the Gilded Age of Teddy Roosevelt and Nikola Tesla, through the Roaring 20s, into the Dust-Bowl 30s, and beyond. This project will take the form of an anthology of legends, each revolving around circus athlete and adventurer Bronislav \u201cBron\u201d Bellman \u2014 a Depression-era strongman who doubles as a pulp hero. Bron travels the world with his companions in the Strange Bros. Circus, righting wrongs, and defending the downtrodden against all sorts of foes \u2014 from the criminal, to the supernatural. Tonally, Strongman draws on some of our favorite stories and characters for inspiration. It blends light-hearted action and globe-trotting adventure with vintage pulp crime drama, and gothic, mystical horror. Fans of H.P. Lovecraft, Lester Dent\u2019s Doc Savage, Jack Kirby\u2019s In The Days Of The Mob, Windsor McKay\u2019s Little Nemo, Todd Browning\u2019s Freaks, and Siegel and Shuster\u2019s Superman, will all find something new to love in Strongman.\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es Strongman?\n\u00a1Hola, soy Jon Bogdanove! Strongman es mi propia serie totalmente nueva que cuenta las aventuras a pu\u00f1o limpio de un original h\u00e9roe sensacionalista, cuyas haza\u00f1as van desde la Edad Dorada de Teddy Roosevelt y Nikola Tesla, a trav\u00e9s de los fabulosos 20\u2019s, pasando por los \u00e1ridos 30\u2019s, y m\u00e1s all\u00e1. Este proyecto tendr\u00e1 la forma de una antolog\u00eda de leyendas, cada una girando en torno al atleta y aventurero de circo, Bronislav \u201cBron\u201d Bellman \u2013 un fortach\u00f3n de la era de la Depresi\u00f3n que tiene una doble vida como h\u00e9roe sensacionalista. Bron viaja alrededor del mundo con sus compa\u00f1eros en el Circo \u201cHermanos Bizarro\u201d, defendiendo a los oprimidos ante todo tipo de enemigos/maleantes \u2013 desde los criminales hasta los supernaturales. Tem\u00e1ticamente, Strongman recuerda algunas de nuestras historias favoritas y personajes que nos han inspirado. Mezcla acci\u00f3n ligera, con aventuras errantes, drama criminal cl\u00e1sico, y horror m\u00edstico y g\u00f3tico. Los fans de H.P. Lovecraft, Doc Savage de Lester Dent, En Los D\u00edas De La Mafia de Jack Kirby, El peque\u00f1o Nemo en el Pa\u00eds de los sue\u00f1os de Windsor McKay, Fen\u00f3menos de Todd Browning, y el Superman de Siegel y Shuster; encontrar\u00e1n algo nuevo que amar en Strongman. \nA sample page in various stages: from thumbnail to ink wash before color and lettering is applied.\nI\u2019m very grateful for DC and Marvel. It was an immense honor and my lifelong dream to contribute to Superman. I was also blessed to work at Marvel in a time of tremendous freedom and creativity. But the stakes were low in the comics business when I first started. It still felt like it did when I was a kid. There was a closer connection between fans and creators. It felt like we were all in it together. I want to bring this new project to Kickstarter because I believe in the direct relationship between readers and authors. That's what Kickstarter offers and that's what appeals to me the most. There's total creative freedom to explore and experiment with new ideas, but the comics won\u2019t happen unless fans want it to. The readers are literally invested in the creativity. It is the purest, most democratic hope for new concepts and enterprises. We can go right to the readers and fans, and say 'Hey guys, this is what we want to do.' And if people are excited, they can make it a reality in a very direct way \u2014 person to person.\n\u00bfPorqu\u00e9 Kickstarter?\nKickstarter es una forma segura de financiamiento para que los artistas saquen adelante sus proyectos. Sabemos que muchas personas tienen miedo de comprar por internet o s\u00f3lo quieren saber que pasa si el proyecto no llega a la meta. Aqu\u00ed entra el encanto de Kickstarter. Si el proyecto alcanza la cantidad deseada para hacerse realidad, se cobra la cantidad exacta que donaste a trav\u00e9s de Amazon Payments (\u00a1Totalmente seguro!). Si desafortunadamente no se llega a esto, a ti no se te cobra ni un centavo, es decir, \u00a1no hay manera de perder!\nLe estoy muy agradecido a DC y a Marvel. Fue un inmenso honor y el sue\u00f1o de toda mi vida contribuir en Superman. Tambi\u00e9n fui bendecido al trabajar para Marvel en una \u00e9poca de tremenda libertad y creatividad. Pero hab\u00eda poco en riesgo cuando yo estaba empezando, todav\u00eda se sent\u00eda como cuando yo era ni\u00f1o. Hab\u00eda una conexi\u00f3n m\u00e1s cercana entre fans y creadores, se sent\u00eda como si estuvi\u00e9ramos juntos en esto. Quiero traer este nuevo proyecto a Kickstarter porque creo en la relaci\u00f3n directa entre lectores y autores. Eso es lo que ofrece Kickstarter y lo que m\u00e1s me atrae. Hay una total libertad creativa para explorar y experimentar con nuevas ideas, pero los comics no van a existir a menos que lo quieran los fans. Los lectores est\u00e1n literalmente invirtiendo en la creatividad. Es la esperanza m\u00e1s pura y democr\u00e1tica para nuevos conceptos e iniciativas. Podemos ir directo con los lectores y fans y decir \u201cHola chicos, esto es lo que queremos hacer\u201d. Y si a la gente le emociona, pueden hacerlo realidad de manera directa, de persona a persona.\nLa meta final es tener 200,000 d\u00f3lares para poder cumplir este proyecto de principio a fin. Para poder llegar a esto, necesitamos aproximadamente a 4000 personas alrededor del mundo. Necesitamos toda la ayuda que sea posible. Incluso si no puedes cooperar, \u00a1corre la voz! \u00a1Tal vez alguien que t\u00fa conozcas pueda!\nThe Characters of Strongman: (from left to right) \u2014 Bella \"The Ball\" Akiyama / Rolly \"Tynamo\" Beaudine / Luminitsa \"The Flaming Angel\" Angelo / Adelita \"The Wolf Girl\" Aceves / Woolcott \"The Mammoth\" / and Bronislav \"Kettle\" Bellman - A.K.A Strongman\nIt is very important for us to be able to pay our awesome colorist, letterer, and background assistants a professional living wage, comparable with what Marvel or DC would pay them for their time \u2014 to help support livable rates for working artists everywhere. Plus, we want to create 150 entirely new pages of comics \u2014 which include all new characters based on the likenesses of our backers!  From start to finish, Strongman will take about a year to complete, with everyone working full time. We are relying on your support to raise enough money to keep us employed for the time it will take to produce this amazing collection. Plus, a large portion will go towards the costly printing and distribution of the final graphic novel, and the other awesome rewards! Strongman will take everything we've got!\n\u00bfA d\u00f3nde ir\u00e1 el financiamiento?\nEs muy importante para nosotros el poder pagarle a nuestro asombroso colorista, al letrista, y a los asistentes de fondo un pago profesional decente, comparable con lo que DC o Marvel les pagar\u00eda por su tiempo; para apoyar un sueldo justo para artistas trabajando en cualquier parte. Adem\u00e1s, queremos crear 150 p\u00e1ginas de comic completamente nuevas \u2013 \u00a1que incluyen personajes nuevos basados en la imagen de nuestros patrocinadores!

Unlike our work on Superman and other similar franchises, this project does not come with a rich existing canon, or ready fan recognition to fall back on. Instead we're creating a mythos and a cast of characters whole-cloth. Each creative decision will have far-reaching implications to the characters and the world. The consequences of taking a misstep are greater. However, if we communicate frequently with our backers throughout the process, we can get direct feedback from readers in a way that is not possible in mainstream comics.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Fancif Arts\nFirst created \u00b7 4 backed\nFancif Arts is a creative collaboration between comic book artist/writer Jon Bogdanove, writer/producer Chris Faiella, and writer/director...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Results of The La Mole Promotional Are In!", "update_content": "Swing on over to www.facebook.com/StrongmanComic to find out who gets a custom figure!\nBest,\nJ,C, and K"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Thanks and Next Steps", "update_content": "Hello Stalwart Backers!\nFirst off, thank you to everyone who has supported this project so far!

Personally, my introduction was from the classic Disney animated movie.  Most of us have seen the Kevin Costner or Russell Crowe versions as well, but I realized that I have never seen an updated version: a modern-day Robin Hood, where he doesn't exactly \"rob from the rich to give to the poor,\" as the saying goes, but he instead steals medical supplies and gives them to those in need, or those who can't afford them or have no health insurance.  I am sure a lot of people can identify with how expensive health care is in the U.S. these days, and this comic book is a commentary on this, and other, issues.  But don't be fooled, it's also a straight-up adventure story that, hopefully, captures the spirit of the Robin of old.\nCreating comics is a costly venture these days. I wrote the words, but the true masters bring it to life; the artists, letterers, colorists, and cover artists (industry stalwarts Jason Baroody and Mark McKenna) all did amazing work on the book, and should be paid accordingly.  In fact, here's a tasty preview of the cover to issue #1, done by Baroody and McKenna and colored by John Hunt:\nCover art for issue #1\nThere are also printing, distribution, production and other assorted costs  That is where you come in!  If this Kickstarter project is funded, I will pay the creators, and hopefully earn enough to create future issues.  If that happens, then the next goal is a four-issue series which can be collected into a trade paperback edition.  Beyond that?  Hopefully many, many more adventures for Robin Hood and his modern-day merry men.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I said above, I wrote the words to the comic, but that is just step one. There are many cogs in the wheel, and not just involving the creative process. There are printing delays, production issues, promoting the book, and many more obstacles that can get in the way. If issues do arise, the simple thing would be to say, \"Stick with it.\" But that goes without saying, as I have been working on this for four years now. But there real solution is to find another way. Use the web to promote your book (I have a comic book podcast that may come in handy!), find another printer, or another colorist, whatever it takes.

For those who are unaware (and until last week, I could count myself in that group), a black & white comic, which this is, still needs a colorist to add grey tones to it, to give it body.

For every pledge, share and simple video watch you have helped us reach our goal.\nChaos Hour is a non-profit Geek Lifestyle e-zine based out of South Wales in the United Kingdom. \nWe specialize in Video Game, Film, Comic Book, Sci-Fi & Fantasy Literature and Hardware News, Reviews and Articles. Conceptualized by Padraig Balch in 2010, Chaos Hour has gone from strength to strength since its launch in March of 2011 at Cardiff Comic and Animation Expo.\nReaching a worldwide audience of 1500 - 5000 unique visitors every day, Chaos Hour is committed to bringing unique content, entertainment and informative articles to its loyal fan base.\nHowever, in order to continue to grow as both an online community and centre for geek related entertainment and information, Chaos Hour need to improve their website. \nAnd this is where we need you...\nWith your help and financial support we will be able to advance Chaos Hour into a much more user friendly website; advancing our search system, tagging and organization as well as fixing numerous issues from image uploading and site customization to additional pages and formatting. The advanced site structure will allow us more time to focus on gaining unique content, supporting our writing team and of course creating more of those competitions our fans have learned to love so much.\nSo where would your money go?\nTaking Care Of Business\nWhen Chaos Hour began it was very much a bedroom project and while it may look professional at the moment, much of the back end of the website is still very much unfinished making even the simplest of tasks such as tagging, editing, image uploading and formatting, very difficult if not impossible. With your support we will be able to improve the website to an organized and structured professional standard making it much more user friendly for the staff and audience alike.\nPromoting Independent Projects\nChaos Hour are avid supporters of independent film, publishing and video game projects; championing crowd funded campaigns such as Afterlife Inc, Melksham Comic Con and Stiffs among many others; having written detailed features on their projects at the time of fundraising, theming the site around their project and creating banner ads for them.\nWith an improved layout and image uploading system we will be better able to advertise and promote fellow independent projects through graphics, banner ads, illustrated articles and even a \u2018Supporting\u2019 feature - showing a project Chaos Hour are currently supporting via crowd funding who we believe you should support in turn.\nEntertainment\nSince founding our Twitch project earlier in the year, Chaos Hour have finally found an outlet for their need to entertain. While the website has been host to many competitions and giveaways, we would like to advance our entertaining reach to YouTube videos and programming, Podcasts and online comics. With your support we will be able to integrate more advanced image uploading onto our site allowing us the ability to publish online comic strips and fan art competitions. If we reach an amount over our target goal, we will be able to afford better audio and video recording equipment and editing software so that we can better improve our YouTube channel branching out into weekly talk shows, live interviews and even sketch shows.\nSocial Media Integration\nWhile we have managed to create a thriving Facebook, Twitter and Twitch community, it is hardly evident on our site. With your help we will be able to better intergrate our social media accounts into our website making us able to better promote our writers, articles, competitions and giveaways.\nTwitch Stream\nAs well as the website itself, Chaos Hour have recently branched out into Live Streaming on Twitch.TV and, since launching the CH Stream in April of this year, have grown a loyal fan base of over 1,800 followers, over 200,000 page views, and an average viewership of 100 people per night. If we go over our target goal, subsequent funding will go towards improving our Twitch stream with better audio and visual equipment as well as editing programs to make better video adverts which you can utilize in our advertisers packages to help promote your business; and we can use to help promote the content on the website.\nCompetitions\nFor the last two years Chaos Hour has been funding all of its competitions out of its own pocket without any income for the site itself. This has included giving away free video games, DVDs, tickets to events, DLC codes, Exclusive Game Content and even Riot Points and In Game currency for MMORPGs. Overall this has cost Chaos Hour over \u00a32500 With your support we will be able to boost our website Search Engine Optimization as well as offering banner advertisements and advertising packages to our audience, which will help the website fund itself. This money would be able to go straight back into funding our competitions and giveaways, benefiting you - the Chaos Hour audience.\nA Site Built By Writers For Writers\nWorking with new and emerging writers, Chaos Hour gives budding journalists the chance to see their work published on a professional site while reaching a high viewership. With your help we will be able to implement a better search and tagging system allowing our writers to better show off their work via their own personal \u2018Writer\u2019s Page\u2019 or portfolio of work. Writers for the site will also be given \u2018achievement\u2019 style rewards for writing a certain amount of articles/on a certain day of the year, etc... While the site remains a voluntary project for our writers, this will make it much more fun and rewarding for them.\nFINAL HOURS EXCLUSIVE REWARDS\nGENERAL REWARDS & PERKS\nThis project was helped by www.kickingitforward.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re confident that should our Kickstarter project get funded, we\u2019ll be able to significantly improve our website almost immediately.

As Chaos Hour is already live, any changes that will be made to the site will be visible to the backers almost immediately. We will also be communicating heavily with our funders to let them know exactly where their contributions are being spent.\n\nIn regards to rewards featuring the work of artists, crafters and independent business (such as comic books, films etc) and items which need to be signed, we will endeavor to get these out to backers as soon as they are available to us from the various individuals. However, we will be attempting to collect all items at least a week before the funding deadline (if it looks like we will be successful, of course) so that we can try to get them out to our backers ASAP.\n\nIf your reward package calls for a custom made item, i.e. an art commission or sketch card, these will take a little bit longer to get to you as we will be waiting on the artist. However, we plan to get these out as quickly as we can.\n\nAdvertising packages will be available as soon as the new and improved website is up and running and we have communicated with the backers to discuss their objectives and received their graphics. If they wish to use their packages at a later date (E.g. If some one has purchased a month\u2019s worth of the site theme and wish to use it the month that their book/film/comic/game is coming out, we will be happy to delay your request until that time.)

Sixcess Core was previously kickstarted and is debuting at Gen Con this year. (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1299187159/sixcess-core-rulebook) Promised Sands utilizes the Sixcess rules, but is easily converted to other game systems.\n\u201cA lot of fun. Interesting settings and this was my first D6 based game. I enjoyed it immensely.\u201d Glen Elliott, GenCon 2012\nThe World at a Glance: Promised Sands\nPromised Sands is a dark, desert fantasy with post-apocalyptic overtones. The world is called \"T'nah\" by the peoples who live there. T\u2019nah is a harsh, intense place. It is not for the faint of heart.\nHundreds of years ago, the great, globe spanning Renizant empire faded into obscurity. It endured for over 2500 years. Nearly all living memory of the Renizant empire has faded, yet there are still vestiges of its power and peoples in the wastelands. Their Trade Guild holds tenaciously to the fading power of the Renizant.\nSince the fading of the Renizant, many have attempted to fill the vacuum of power, managing some regional success. The Ch'ak - fierce warriors who carved out an empire - have receded back to their Citadel since they fell into the worship of the Troog. The religion of the Troog has blunted their advancement, but has not dulled their ferocity.\nThe Skulae, passive \"rulers\" of the wasteland, have a trading \"empire\" that rivals the Trade Guild. Where the Guild exerts force and domination to achive their ends, the Skulae exercise freedom and anarchy - where no law constrains trade or social expression.\nThe Andw'ahr farmers and field workers, toiling in the shadow of the mighty Drachen-riders, whose famed beasts appear as both creature and machine. The Jaan and Aij'ak, locked in their perpetual dance in the skies keep to the glacial wastes, yet they, too, feel the calling of the vacuum of power.\nSylvan in their rumored forests surrounding vast water riches and the Ebon Syl in their caves yearn to expand and control. While the ubiquitous Rolen build, wander and entertain for any who have the 'quid.\nAnd the Dry Denizens, who have colonized the western shores, explore the lands \u2013 reporting back their findings (but to whom?). They have an insatiable desire to collect otec from every corner of the world \u2013 and they understrand it! But strangest of all their tales are those of the people in the domed cities under the sea, whom they call the \"Wet Denizens\".\nThe Troog are a peaceful, peace-loving, diminutive race, distantly related to the fierce and ferocious Sylvan.\nIt is not just the racial divides that exist in Promised Sands, but the cultural diversity within each of the races that defines a character.\nWhether a wandering Skulae who accepts everyone - or a determined and bigotted Ch'ak who refuses any who are not of their breed - or a Sylvan who would just as soon run an arrow through a non-Sylvan as she would a maridh.\nInto this mix, toss in ancient technologies, blood feuds between the horse-like Loshad and the cat-like Myrlihk and the rise of the supposed and presumptuous \"ancient ones\" who have established colonies on the western shores.\nThere are two types of magic and technology that spans the stone-age to firearms (though centered firmly in the archaic iron-age). It is a world in need of rebuilding.  The crumbling glory of ancient cultures who survived the Scourge, who rose form the ashes fo the Maroc Wars, who tamed the devastated globe - and then faded away.\nThis is a world where alliances shift with the sands and if you have access to water, you guard it jealously.\nThere is also a secret to the world - a history that is long forgotten. A time before even the great Renizant empire.\nBefore the Maroc wars...\nBefore the Scourge...\nPromised Sands is a rich tableau of cultural, racial, technological diversity upon which to feast. It is foreign and unique, a world unlike any you have ever seen. A place where the familiar blends with the unfamiliar and the alien to produce a unique setting.\nPromised Sands uses the Sixcess system as it's gaming core - but is easily adapted to other game systems.\nBased on the Sixcess Core System\nPromised Sands is a gameworld, not a system. It showcases the might and majesty, the beauty and darkness, the societies and the cultures \u2013 and the dark, shadowy underbelly \u2013 of T'nah. The world is rich and full of life, and all the things that prey upon that life. T'nah is a place of warring cultures, vying for control in the vacuum of an ancient empire that spanned thousands of years.  Yet beneath that civilization are the remnants of even older cultures lost in the ancient histories and legends.\nWe used the Sixcess system to bring this world to life. Although stats and mechanical references tie it to the Sixcess system, it is easily converted to any system. The system does not define the world. Rather, Promised Sands breathes life into whatever game system is used.\nWe offer the Sixcess system as an option in the Tiers if you would like to play Promised Sands in its native system. \nOur intent is to provide online support allowing Promised Sands to be used by whatever system you prefer. Just remember that we are not experts in every system and are not intent on perfectly emulating Sixcess in conversions. Each system that uses Promised Sands should have its own flavor in how the world is experienced.\nIf you want to try Promised Sands in its native mechanic, however, we\u2019re more than happy to help you out!\nHow does Sixcess play?\nThe Sixcess (6S) is a universal system for role playing games of any genre. It is a d6 dice-pool system. Typically dice-pools range from 4-10 dice\u2014it is rare for more than 10 dice to be tossed in a single roll. It is easy to learn for all ages, for new and experienced role-players. Sixcess plays quickly to allow for maximum role-playing story elements, and yet is nuanced enough to satisfy the crunchiest of dice crunchers out there.\nSixcess is based around a pairing of Attribute and Skill ranks to provide the dice-pool. Each die that meets or beats a defined Target Number is considered a \u201cSixcess\u201d. Sixcesses are broken into two types: Ticks and Marks. Marks are the best results and provide an extra (or \u201cexploding\u201d) die to be added to the test. This allows for even the lowest skills and weakest attributes to have a chance for glorious success. It also means that pushover opponents can become lethal assailants with the toss of a die!\nSixcess also incorporates a system for the players to take over the action from the GM to craft and mold the world in their own way. This is called \u201cDissonance\u201d and every player has a \u201cDISk\u201d to activate this capability. Some of the Tiers provide official DISks for you and your players to use.\n\u201cExtremely easy to pick up and play.\u201d Gregory S. Stines, GenCon 2012\n\u201cIt was really simple to learn, so we could jump right into things.\u201d Jeremiah Heady, GenCon 2012\n\"Sixcess is the most fun game I've ever played!\" Vera Moore, GenCon 2012\nIs it better for small or large groups?\nSixcess scales nicely to any size group. Smaller groups that stick together tend to play a little faster\u2014but this is true of nearly any gaming experience. Larger groups can accomplish more and give a larger, more \u201cepic\u201d feel, but they don\u2019t hamper gameplay at all nor overbalance the mechanic.\nFlexibility\nOne of the hallmarks of the Promised Sands (and the Sixcess system) is the flexibility. Players can use and manipulate the world (and the rules of the mechanic) to give their characters bonuses. You are not constrained to a narrowly defined corridor of character development. You can grow and enhance your character in any way that you choose.\nCharacters can be made in any combination of abilities that are desired. There are no classes and no levels. Gameworld-specific details may provide Backgrounds, Edges, Flaws or Qualities that nuance your choices, but there are no mechanical restrictions. If you want to play a Sylvan raised by Dry Denizens, you can. Exotic backgrounds are entirely feasible.\nSixcess provides a plethora of Backgrounds, Edges, Flaws and Qualities to breathe life into the character. Some have a mechanical effect; some simply enhance the roleplaying of the character. It\u2019s completely open-ended and up to the GM and players to use as they see fit.\nFormats\nWe\u2019re targeting the 8.5x11 inch \u201ctraditional\u201d book size \u2013 however, there was a lot of interest in a 6x9 version of Sixcess and we\u2019re working toward making all our books available in this format (which seems to work a little better on e-readers and mobile devices).\nPromised Sands is initially targeted as a 160-200 page gameworld with beautiful illustration. As additional stretch goals are reached, the page count grows\u2014so does the number and quality of the illustrations.\nWhat are the Backer Levels?\nNOTE: All levels from Comrade and higher receive an electronic copy of the Promised Sands GM Screen.\nA NOTE ABOUT COVER ART\nThere are four covers for two different products available.\n1) The Softback Promised Sands cover -- A painted cover that shows an action scene from the world of Promised Sands. (We have some character sketches of some of the figures who appear on this cover and a general idea of what it needs to look like, but it hasn't been commissioned, yet.)\n2) The Limited Edition Hardback Promised Sands Cover -- A minimalist cover that uses iconic imagery to capture the essence of the world. We have only a sketch of the cover at this point. *THIS IS A KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE COVER.*\n3) The Gen Con Participant Limited Edition Hardback Promised Sands Cover -- Also a minimalist cover, but thematically designed to compliment the Gen Con Participant Limited Edition Hardback Sixcess Core (below).

You are specifically credited in the book for your creation.\nAre you considering this as a gift for Christmas/Hannukah/Yule/Saturnalia/Kwanzaa/Festivus/Holiday?\nWe had originally intended to fulfill this project by early December, so we could have it available for the holiday gift-giving season. However, due to unexpected delays in our previous project, we thought to extend the deadline by a couple months. \nWith this in mind, we are focusing on delivering by Christmas \u2013 but that is a \"stretch goal\" in itself. \nWe shall provide a certificate to anyone who would like to give Promised Sands as a holiday gift.  Just message us and let us know and we'll send out a certificate to you detailing the Backer level and Add-Ons that you selected for your gift.  Since this is a custom process, we can customize the message of the certificate. \nJust be sure to send us a message so we can get the process rolling with enough time for you to receive the certificate and wrap it up. \nWhat are the Stretch Goals?\nWe plan to reveal the stretch goals as we get closer and closer to the goal. \nThe first few stretch goals include new adventures, new characters and fiction by some familiar names in the gaming industry. As we get higher in the goals, we're planning to expand the game system to include a life-path character creation method, additional rules for Qai (one of the forms of magic) and an Otec Compendium. Other stretch goals include upgrading all printed copies to color, all printed copies to hardback and other niceties.\nHere are the first few planned Stretch Goals: \nFunding  Stretch Goal Unlocked\n4500       New characters and fiction by Todd Liukart\n5000       Adventure by Joseph Wolf\n5300       New Djezinti tribes by Brian Engard\n5500       Adventure by Cynthia Celeste Miller\n6000       Scorchlands expanded by Eddy Webb\n6500       Additional color artwork\n7000       Zombies by John Goff\nWe're also working on some stretch goals for the number of backers, but we'll announce those as we get closer to the goals. \nHow Far Along is Promised Sands?\nPromised Sands is coming out. That\u2019s all there is to it. It was extremely well-received in demos at various conventions. We ran 46 events at Gen Con 2012 \u2013 and are running 75 events at Gen Con 2013 for Sixcess (in various gameworlds, of which Promised Sands is featured).\nPromised Sands, as a world, was complete 10 years ago (2003).  You can find quite a few reviews for it online. Most of the reviews were extremely positive about the rich, interesting world and any issues centered on the complexities of the original game system.  Those are easily fixed with the new game system.  We're also taking to heart the points brought up about some of the complexities of the lingo for items in the world.\nThe writing for Promised Sands is completed except for some stretch goal material.  It was converted to Sixcess and playtested over the last year. We need to flesh out a few details, smoothe over the rough spots, re-edit the manuscript and include the artwork that brings it to life.\nWe've already engaged several artists to commission some new artwork for the book, but would like to expand in order to offer even more visually stunning images to bring Promised Sands alive. You can see some of the examples here, on our website and on our Facebook page. These are just the tip of the sand dune! We\u2019ve already talked to the artists who are on board and some others. As the stretch goals are reached, we shall commission more artwork (and more detailed artwork) to bring Promised Sands alive visually.\nThere are many unexplored places in Promised Sands \u2013 ancient civilizations that have faded long ago, seas that have yet to be sailed, coasts that have yet to be mapped.\nHow Can You Help?\nObviously, support the Kickstarter. If you want to do more, then spread the word. Share your interest in this vibrant world with others. Get them involved and supporting it. You can even talk to the developers about becoming a playtester, freelance writer or freelance artist.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur last project suffered delays because we didn't understand all the ramifications of the layout and design stage, nor the printing requirements of our printer. These delays can certainly be shortened, if not completely averted, with Promised Sands. \n\nThe manuscript is complete, but needs a re-edit -- which is in progress. \n\nThe project *will* happen -- it's only a question of time. We originally thought we could fulfill by December 2013 -- and we are striving toward that end.

We hope you find our new, improved, retooled campaign worthy of your support once again. \nIf you're new to The Last West, here's the deal in a nutshell:\nEvan Young and Lou Iovino, guys who write stories and love comic books, want to create a new comic. It's called The Last West and it's about all technological and social advancement having stopped in 1945, and one man's quest to discover why.\nIt's what would happen if you put Chinatown and Lost together and made the result into a Vertigo-type comic book. It's a smart and fun bit of alternate history noir, and we need your support to finish it.\nWant more details about the story?\nWatch the video, we explain it all!\nWant a sneak peek of the opening scene?\nKeep scrolling!\nWant to know our STRETCH GOALS?\nKeep scrolling! They're under the rewards!\nThis Kickstarter campaign will help us get the funds we need to wrap up Volume One, which encompasses the first 5 issues of this planned 10-issue series. Your funding will go to the art team for their roughs, pencils, inks, colors, and letters.\nYou may have noticed that this is indeed our second go-around on Kickstarter since we canceled our first drive a few months ago. So, what's new and what's different?\n- We've got a publisher now! We didn't when we started our first campaign, which is why we canceled it and restarted this one. It's Alterna Comics.\n- We have a schedule now! We didn't before. We start with the digital release of issue 1 in November.\nLike last time, we've got rewards that let you join in the fun of our project. The rewards are described on the right and below, so find one you like and please consider lending us your support. You can contribute $5 for a print copy of the first issue, or $35 for the Absolute Last West Volume One, or $350 for an original board, or... really, it's whatever you choose!\nFor more details about the art team, the rewards, and a sneak peek at the story, read on.\nAnd if you'd like even more details, check out our previous Kickstarter campaign here.

Rest assured that every one of us is fully committed to this project, and it's only the most dramatic unforeseen acts of nature that will get in our way.\n\nComics take work, and one of the risks of creating comics with a team of specialists is that delays at any one step in the process have a knock-on affect downstream. A delay in roughs will push back the pencils, which pushes back the inks, then the colors, and so on. Delays happen throughout the world of comics, and we will do everything we can to try to avoid them.

Ehart, Mile High Comics\nGreetings!\nI am so grateful for all the support for Mythica! The adventure that is Mythica is coming to life and everyone who supports this project isn\u2019t just helping to create the first 6-issues, but is helping me get to the ultimate goal of 36 to 40 books! Supporting Mythica means your helping create more books, greater distribution, increasing the fan base, creating more merchandise, and of course, increasing the speed that I can get the books into your waiting hands!\nThanks for being a part of my dream!\nMatt Campbell\nMythica issue 2\n\nStretch Reward!!-If we make it to $3500 everyone who pledged $40 or more will receive a copy of Mythica issue 4!!\nMythica is a comic book that I started brainstorming about ten years ago.  I had an idea for the story line, the characters, and the look I wanted for the book.  However, doing the pencils, colors, and writing is too much for one person so three years ago I partnered with writer, William Tooker.  William's descriptive horror writing has helped Mythica to become the more intricate story it is today, and has allowed me to focus more on what I truly love; the art.  I have been consistently working on Mythica ever since, and we have just completed our third issue.\n\nThere is so much more to getting a comic out there than writing it and drawing pictures and that's where my good friend McLain McGuire stepped in. McLain is the Editor in Chief of CCP comics in Austin, TX. I have worked on various projects with CCP over the last few years and when I told McLain what i was working on he was more than eager to help. Although CCP is still a young publishing company they have over a dozen different titles and now they are publishing Mythica. McLain also does the lettering (aka the word bubbles) for Mythica so you will see his name on the credits. Lastly, he is an awesome musician and, along with drummer Jason Boiling, created the music for the above video.\n So what is Mythica about you say?\nMythica follows the journeys of an eclectic group of strangers, who find themselves facing a demonic invasion during WWI; doubling the horrors of war.  At the heart of the story is how these individuals come together, become a family, and face incredible odds to save mankind.\n\nLike HBO or Showtime shows such as Spartacus or Game of Thrones, Mythica is rated for mature audiences due to not only the horrors of war but the even greater horrors that come with a demon invasion.\n\n\nKimberly Bradshaw\n\nThe story begins with a young Belgian girl named Kimberly Bradshaw.  As her country is being invaded, and her fiancee volunteers for the Red Cross, she finds herself dreaming of a golden-haired, Scottish warrior; Magnus MacDracken.  In Kim's dreams, Magnus and his Black Watch team find themselves facing terrible nightmarish creatures that have Kim screaming, and shaken when she awakes.  Her nightmares soon begin to invade her reality when people in her small town of Jabekke, are found mysteriously, and gruesomely murdered.\n\nMagnus MacDracken, is the captain of the Scottish Black Watch regiment.  In sneaking behind enemy lines, Captain MacDracken, and his crew suddenly come across a demonic beast that is unbelievably strong, and seemingly impossible to kill.  Magnus, determined to save his men, is finally able to slay the beast, but not before his entire regiment is slaughtered.  Distraught and alone, Magnus is left wondering why he survived unscathed; as if on cue an angelic being appears to answer his questions.\n\nLittle is known about Soradees, other than he is seen in Kimberly's dreams, coming to Magnus and telling him that he is the key to stopping the demonic invasion.  Soradees, needing Magnus to see the bigger picture, presents Magnus with a vision of a possible future, should he refuse the call. \n\nWWI wasn't just fought on the front lines; there was espionage, intrigue and spies. One of the first MI6 agents, Riley Scott; feisty, red-headed, and Irish, is among the best.  She's on a mission to find a genealogist named Gerbstad; who is believed to have been captured by the Germans.  Working with her partner, Rutherford, they soon find themselves in a Transylvanian castle, and discover an evil much more threatening than Germans.\nRiley Scott of Mythica\nWHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR?\nWe've been working on this project now for several years, and so far everything we've done has been out of our pocket, from sitting down and working out scripts to making the art.\nNow it's time to take it to the next level.

For now we are focusing on the production of the first six issues.\nWe're working to raise money to print the first three issues and help start the production of the next three. \nOur ultimate goal is to see Mythica nationally distributed and in stores all across the country and then around the world!

PLEASE READ THIS ARTICLE!\nhttp://mobile.thewrap.com/thewrap/db_/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=F6UyWtws&full=true#display\nSections: WINNER: Horror & WINNER: China\nChina film market is not the next big thing\u2026it's already big! Last years box office was close to $3 Billion! Pledges to our project will join us as we first go to Taiwan, then try to get our film distributed in China. If the Hollywood studios are bending over backwards to get into China, then independent filmmakers also need to start thinking about China. Join us and learn!\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\"Dolls\" is similar in style and feel to \"The Shining\", which is arguably one of the scariest films ever made. Yes, there was blood\u2026a lot of it, but the scenes that really made your skin crawl, were like when Danny (the kid) is playing with his toys in the middle of the hallway, and the ball rolls into view. That was creepy\u2026but then he slowly walks down the hallway to Room 237\u2026music builds as he slowly reaches for the door handle, then suddenly, BANG! He changes his mind, and walks away. The build up in that scene keeps you right at the edge of your seat the whole time. This is \"Dolls\" in a nut shell. A terrifying horror film, that will keep you on the edge of your seat\u2026with a touch of evil.\nThe money we're asking for is the minimum amount we need to shoot the whole film in Taiwan. If we get more, we're just going to make it all that much better, with more dolly and special effects shots. Everything will be shot on the ARRI ALEXA in 4k. Just because it's a low budget film, doesn't mean we're going to skimp on the quality.\nRob Lee worked in entertainment advertising for 15 years in Hollywood, on print campaigns for over 100 feature films\u2026mainly on movie posters. His clients included Warner Bros, Columbia Pictures, Disney, Fox, and Universal Pictures. He's lived in China for the past 10 years working as an independent in the film industry. Rob has been in the film industry for a total of 25 years, so you can count on him as a professional, to get the project done.\nSHORT SYNOPSIS \nYang Yang, a new graduate, and her boyfriend Jin, move to the city from a small town, so that Jin can pursue his dream of being an actor. They quickly move into an unbelievably cheap, furnished apartment, which comes with only one catch\u2026nothing can be moved out. Jin finds two other tenants for the other rooms to help with the rent, Yin, a college student, and Xiao Liu, a young, hot girl, who's out drinking most nights. Soon after they move in, strange things begin to happen...all centered around a weird looking doll that Yang Yang discovers in the living room cabinet. The situation gets worse, as Yang Yang and Yin realize that the tattoo on the landlord's arm resembles an ancient Satanic symbol...\nCURRENT CAST\nVIVY YU\nOn July 14, 2013 Vivy Yu won first place in the Ms China World contest! She will represent China, in a major beauty contest later this year! Vivy is from Ankang in Shanxi Province, China. Ankang is near Xian, where the famous Terracotta soldiers were discovered. She began modeling at age 24, after attending college. Vivy just finished shooting scenes for her very first film, which was shot in Beijing, China. Before that, Vivy had also appeared in plays in China. She plays the drums, piano and flute, and paints in her spare time. She super talented!\nAt this time, Vivy is still confirmed to play one of the lead roles in \"Dolls\", but she may have to cancel later due to obligations for a major beauty contest in September, where she will represent China. We'll keep you posted!\nWHY SHOOT IN TAIWAN?\nThe goal of most filmmakers is to see their film on the big screen, but this is rarely the case. Many films go straight to video, or nowhere at all, and with HD cameras getting cheaper to rent and buy, the U.S. market is flooded with independent films.\n\nBy filming in Taiwan, we are almost assured of getting the film distributed, because of the director's distribution connections there, but it also opens up the opportunity to get into China. In recent years, China has become the second largest market in the world, but because of it's quota system, it's largely inaccessible to foreign films. As of now, only 34 foreign films are allowed into the market, unless the foreign company has a co-production deal with a local Chinese production company, which means they actually have to shoot part of their film in China. The exception to this rule is Taiwan. Taiwan production companies have no limit on the amount of films they export into China. Rob Lee also has distribution connections in Korea and Hong Kong. Our Kickstarter pledges will see the whole process! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks in making a film, even on the big budget films. The way that we plan to minimize our risks, is to keep our production simple and straight forward. A lot of mistakes happen because of location changes and set-ups. 90% of our film will be shot in just two apartments, very similar to the \"Paranormal Activity\" series. We'll also take approx. 28 days for the shoot, which is far more time than we need, so that we can stay well-organized.\n\nThe director has been a professional in the industry for 25 yrs, and is passionate about his work\u2026he's reliable and knows how to get the job done. His dream is to make a film, just like many others on Kickstarter\u2026so you can believe that he'll do whatever it takes to make it happen.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Robert A.

It also toppled Universal's Fast & Furious 6 from the top spot at the Chinese box office and boasted the second-highest opening day of the year for a Hollywood title after Iron Man 3.

It also has to open in Japan, Brazil and Spain. Pacific Rim has grossed roughly $240 million to date worldwide, a soft number considering its $200 production budget and likely $175 million global marketing spend. Legendary Pictures took the lead on the project, including putting up much of the money, and is still considering a sequel, although sources say WB won't be involved with a follow-up. (Legendary leaves the studio at the end of the year for its new co-financing and co-producing deal with Universal.)

We still have the freedom to make the film we want. And make the film that you guys want as well. \n\nOur goal is get back into pre-production mode, shoot the film in October, so we can have the film ready for distribution and in a theater near you in 2014. \n\nI've been working on this project for the pass two years, we've encounter a lot of obstacles along the way. But through out each of these hurdles that we've come across the cast, crew and Production team have not faltered. We have an amazing and talented team of Professionals on this film, a group of men and woman that I'm very honored to be working with. \n\nIf there are any delays in our schedule, because of scheduling of actors, permits to shoot in Austin - or the slightest little thing that may arise. We PROMISE from the bottom of our BLOODY HEARTS that YOU will be the FIRST to know. \n\nAll of your BLOODY goodies will be out to you by the dates that we have posted. If there was something that comes up that we couldn't meet a deadline that is listed, then we will let you know in advance on the delay. Which we hope doesn't happen. \n\nIf you're coming to visit us on set, we will keep you up to date on the schedule of the film, and coordinate a date and time for you to be there with us. If you're coming to an advance screening, we'll keep you in the loop for the actual date that it will happen.

Every layer of our production, from the music to the artwork, is held in accountability to one word: WONDER.\nWho We Are\nOur innovative team of artists and filmmakers includes animator Greg Peters who has worked on classics for Disney, Warner Bros., and Hannah-Barbera for nearly three decades. Writer/Director Jonathan Hal Reynolds is helming the team, and has invited longtime collaborator J.R. Fleming to create the background art for the film. British composer, Andy Dollerson, has scored the project, and voice artist Terry Anderson is serving as narrator.\nPre-Production Meeting for IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE? - Greg Peters, J.R. Fleming, and Jonathan Hal Reynolds (left to right)\nProject Status\nThe score for Is There Anyone Out There? has already been recorded by British composer Andy Dollerson and the Tosca String quartet, and the narration has been completed by voice artist Terry Anderson who has invented a wonderful narrator for our tale. You can listen to the entire narration and score here:\nTosca String Quartet recording the score for IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE?\nWe are currently polishing up character designs and storyboards, and are revving up to begin work on the background art and character animation. Because we are using traditional 2D animation at 24 frames per second (e.g., Disney's Pinnochio, Don Bluth's Secret Of Nimh), our film will require over 4,300 frames of hand-drawn artwork. This will take our team an entire year to complete. \nPreliminary character design - IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE?\nInvitation To Join Our Team\nWe invite you to be a part of our adventure in animation by supporting our project.

MORE COOL STUFF! As the final hour nears, here are some brand new prizes you might want to grab before it's too late:\nBehind the scenes documentary on Super 8 film! My creative collaborator Ross Meckfessel will be capturing the production of Uzi's Party in the most thematically appropriate way possible - experimentally, on small gauge film! Donors who pledge $5 will get a private link to stream the documentary.\nPossession Scenes risograph prints! I have a small run of 11x17 blow-up prints of the original drawings from Possession Scenes issues 1-3! Donors who pledge $20 may receive a set of three in the mail, hand-numbered and extra disturbing.\nRoommate's Guilty Rainbow LP with Plastic Crimewave screen print! I have been granted a few copies of one of my favorite albums to pass on to lucky donors! People who pledge $30 will receive this full-length LP, complete with a limited-edition silkscreened print by Steve Krakow (AKA Plastic Crimewave) and a link to digitally download the album in the format of your choice.\nUzi's Party is a film about a sleepover, a s\u00e9ance, and the singular aesthetic capabilities of 16mm film.\nFive girls gather to hang out and commune with a Ouija board. The host, Uzi (short for Fairuza) tries to keep things in order while her party goes awry. After a short session with the Ouija board, one of the girls is no longer herself - or is she?\nThe girls in Uzi's Party will all be played by the same actress. And the footage will be shot in-camera, via matting, multiple exposure, and body doubles. What will begin as a stylized, strange (and funny) teen drama will eventually become a disturbing, complex inquiry into possession, identity, and the psychology of young women. As the story progresses, the visual logic will slowly fall apart until you, like the girls in the film, are no longer sure what's real and what's not.\nI want to shoot Uzi's Party on 16mm because I love film, I am comfortable working with film, and because the restrictions inherent to shooting film are key in creating the right atmosphere. The unavoidable imprecision of in-camera techniques (not to mention natural grain and sensitivity to color) give film footage a vitality impossible to achieve in a digital environment, where everything is under control.\nMy sister, Johanna Hill, an experienced stage actress, has been my co-writer for this project and will star in all five roles. We've been talking about this movie for three years, and now is our chance to make it happen.\nTo get a better idea of my previous work and personal aesthetic, check out these clips from my films House Fuck and The Mystic, and the entirety of this intensive in-camera Super8 film: Untitled (Times For).\nWHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?\nA lot people are working on this movie for free: the actress, crew members, and the wonderful family whose home, for three weeks, will double as the film's location. I'd also like to thank Jeff Perlman, Ryan Gleeson, and Aren Zolninger for shooting my Kickstarter video, Tyson Torstensen for mixing sound, and Christy LeMaster along with everyone at the Nightingale for the generous use of their space.\nBut film is expensive! By far the largest slice of the handy pie chart below goes towards film stock, film processing, film printing, and film shipping. I'll be cutting and conforming Uzi's Party myself, but there are some steps that require a laboratory touch for best results.\nThe second largest slice will go towards feeding my cast and crew during production. They might be working for free, but I'm not going to let them starve. I know from experience that a well stocked, quality kitchen is the best way to keep a team upbeat and in good form.\nThe rest of the pie chart is split between costumes and props, transportation, Kickstarter fees, donor incentives, and air fare to fly Jojo, the star of Uzi's Party, from California to Chicago.\nWHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?\nAside from the satisfaction of supporting really, really independent cinema, a donation to Uzi's Party can get you any number of comics, prints, movies, music, and magical objects. (If you're into living free from material possessions, you can also donate without reciprocation.)\nThe film, of course, is also included! Starting at the $25 level, donors will receive a private link to stream Uzi's Party, and donors at the $50 level and above will receive a DVD in the mail. Especially generous supporters may sign up to receive a film print of the finished product. Additional awards include:\n$20: Possession Scenes, issues 1-3\nThis is a series of mini-comics I started as research for Uzi's Party. Each issue encapsulates a possession scene from a different film or television series. Issues 1-3 are, in order: The Excorcist, Twin Peaks, and Possession. At the same donation level, you may instead receive a self-published, instructional zine on pinhole motion photography by experimental documentarian Thomas Comerford.\n$30: Limited edition prints by Lyra Hill and Krystal DiFronzo\nYou may receive one of three limited edition prints: a three-color offset print called Motion Sickness, a one-color screen print called Mr. Square at the Pit of Despair (not pictured, graphic content), or one of two Wile E. Coyote prints by cartoonist Krystal DiFronzo.\n$35: Self-published books, comics, and cassettes\nYou can choose between a cassette recording and accompanying booklet of Halle Butler's The Restaurant Business, donated by Dikarya Productions and Jenna Caravello; a book of short stories and illustrations by Chicago artist Mike Lopez; or Compiled, a collection of my short comics from 2008-2010.\n$40: Independent feature films on DVD\nYou may choose between a DVD of The Indian Boundary Line, an experimental documentary about the border between Chicago and Evanston by Thomas Comerford, or a DVD of the first feature film by Jerzy Rose, Some Girls Never Learn, an adventure comedy about a psychic veterinarian who follows his girlfriend to the Underworld.\n$45: Here Come the Wild Waves LP + booster pack\nTyson Torstensen, who will be scoring Uzi's Party, has generously donated several full-length LPs of Here Come the Wild Waves, by his band Magical Beautiful. This perk comes with a poster, pin, MP3 download and an EP CD release of earlier work.\n$60: 2012 CUFF poster, 3D glasses, and pin\nAt this level you will receive a limited-edition, four-color, giant screen print of the poster I designed for the 2012 Chicago Underground Film Festival. This perk comes with a homemade pair of 3D glasses and a pin featuring the design. When you look through the glasses, the cave pops out and the crystal confounds your vision.\n$80: Year pass to Brain Frame + any two posters\nBrain Frame is a performative comix reading series that happens every two months in Chicago. It's really fun. If you donate at this level you'll receive free admission to Brain Frame from this September to July 2014 (in the coming year, I'll be touring around the country - so even if you don't live in Chicago you may be able to redeem your entry!) as well as any two screen printed posters from BF5 to BF12. Each of these posters is a limited-edition, high-quality, three-color screen print designed by myself and a different artist.\n$200: Sacred objects made by Pagan priestesses\nI am blessed to have grown up in a tradition that worships the Earth and the Divine Feminine, and even luckier to have this community donate artwork to Uzi's Party, my own mystical project. You may choose either a necklace featuring a silver Hand of Fatima protection charm, surrounded by amethyst, aquamarine, pearls, and laboradite, created in sacred space by a Pagan priestess skilled in the art of spellwork for protection, or one of two mosaic candleholders, meant to focus intention, call in allies and elements to manifest our greatest hopes and desires, and to strengthen our affirmations and resolve.\n$300: I will draw you something\nI used to work as a fine portrait artist at conventions. This is a portrait I drew of my sister Jojo (star of Uzi's Party) in 2008. If you donate at this level, I will draw a black and white 8x10 portrait of you, or anything else for which you have a photo reference.\nAND BEYOND\nIf this campaign succeeds beyond my goal, the funds will help make this project even better. With extra resources, I'll be able to design and print a poster for Uzi's Party. I'll have more time to spend on the edit, color, and sound. I will be able to print multiple distribution copies and apply to film festivals (see below). I might even be able to treat my crew to a wrap party.\nA film print is a physical object, and like any thing often handled, it suffers wear and tear. I've budgeted to produce three prints (not including the prints for donors) - one for myself, one to distribute, and one back up in case of damage. If I raise enough funds, I will be able to produce more, which means:\nI can send the film out to different locations at similar times. (This is huge.)\nI can apply for my film to be included in print libraries, like Canyon Cinema.\nI can apply to festivals including the Images Festival, the Ann Arbor Film Festival, and the Rotterdam International Film Festival.\nI have shown films before at Antimatter, the Alchemy Film and Moving Image Festival, and the Milwaukee Underground Film Festival, so application to these festivals will cost nothing - but I'll still need resources to ship my prints, should Uzi's Party be accepted.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery film production is prone to setbacks. And there are unique challenges that come with making a 16mm film. Film stock is expensive and I will have a limited quantity. Equipment is cumbersome, and I'm borrowing mine from a lot of different places. I won't be able to view my footage until I send the negative to the lab and wait for a return print, so reshoots, if necessary, will be delayed.\n\nI have taken these factors into consideration while preparing the budget and schedule for my film. I have enough footage for a 4:1 shooting ratio. I will send my negative out as I shoot the film, so I'll be able to view the results before production wraps and Jojo flies back to California. I have reached out to multiple resources for similar equipment, so I will have back up if something fails or is unavailable.\n\nMore than anything, I trust myself as an organizer. I orchestrate complicated productions involving myriad technologies and lots of people all the time. I have an eagle's eye for details and a strong, orderly mind. I am not afraid of double- and triple-checking enormous lists. I can do this, and I will - with your help.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Prizes on their way // Behind-the-scenes footage", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nI am proud and relieved to confirm that prizes are on their way!

Art Fans! Story Fans! ... THANK YOU SO MUCH for helping us fully fund this project. We're a team now... you're in, you signed up, welcome!!! We are going to make a great film, and we're so glad you're a part of it. -- Chuck & Aaron\n\nPlease check out The Art Story website at:  www.artstoryfilm.com\n******************************************************\nWhat is Art Story?\n... the start of a very special, unique animated film.  Aaron and I saw all the exciting things happening online through crowd funding and thought, we've got a great film that SHOULD BE MADE and we could use some help -- so dang it, let's try Kickstarter\nSo, what's the story?  \nIt's a story about an 11-year-old, meticulous boy, WALT, and his crazy, loopy GRANDPA -- two complete opposites -- who get stuck in a vast, imaginative WORLD OF PAINTINGS.  Inside, they cross paths with a ruthless painted character determined to make it into our world.  In order to get home and stop the villain, Walt and Grandpa have to set aside their differences, work together and navigate worlds where the rules can change around every corner.  \nWalt being pulled into a painting! (concept painting)\nIt's structured like a hilarious, character-driven, buddy picture (\"Planes, Trains & Automobiles,\" \"I Love You, Man\" etc.), but takes place INSIDE THE WORLD OF SOME OF THE GREAT MASTER PAINTINGS OF ALL TIME ... where the characters change their appearance to match the style of each painting -- and meet lots of wildly entertaining characters.  It also explores and was inspired by that special relationship between a grandchild and their grandparent -- not something you see often in films nowadays.\nWalt and Grandpa photo bomb \"American Gothic.\" (Concept painting only)\nYeaahhh... paintings? Sounds sort of \"high brow\"\nOH CONTRAIRE mon frere!  Our number-one focus is to make an entertaining, compelling story with characters you love and who propel you through the film.  This one is for the whole family -- funny, emotional, and thrilling.  AND, believe me, we'll stay away from the low hanging fruit of crass gastronomical jokes and sexual innuendo (not our style).  \nAnd, BONUS, YES!! the film is set in some of the greatest master paintings of all time!  We believe this is an AMAZING WORLD to explore in a story, AND ALSO what a fantastic way to expose young kids (and some adults) to some of the most famous works of art of all time!!!  There's a reason these paintings and painters are so celebrated -- they're imaginative, engaging, spiritual, and, well, just astounding images and worlds.  \nLook, Aaron and I both have kids AND we love art of all sorts.  But how do we get our kids interested in this type of art?  \"It's boring dad.\"  We believe if you FIRST, TELL A GREAT, FUNNY, COMPELLING STORY; and second, set it in this world -- kids will be head over heels for it all.   We've all seen the success of fish, toys, bugs, dragons and monsters -- well, how about art?  The worlds of paintings are endless -- and the technology is available now to take us all into them and explore them in this unique way.  \nWalt chatting with Christina in Andrew Wyeth's \"Christina's World\" (concept painting only)\nWho are you guys? \nAaron and I are two passionate, experienced animation filmmakers who created this project and want to see it made.  We're both Disney feature animation film veterans, working at Disney for 21 years each on many of the recent classics -- Lion King, Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin, Pocahontas. We also produced and co-directed the Academy Award nominated Brother Bear.  (See more the in the biography section.)  \nGrandpa and Walt sneak by Degas's strict dance instructor (concept painting)\nAbove all, Aaron and I want to make films that stick with you.  Stories that are wildly entertaining, but also enrich the lives of their audiences -- films that have something to say.  We've helped create these kind of films in the past and are ready to do it again. \nWhat will you do with the money?\nWe'll use the money to create a script, a children's book ready for publication, killer artwork and a video presentation of the whole film.  It takes teams of people working 5 or 6 months to ready a film like this for production.  Along with a A LOT OF BACKERS  (really critical to show there's an audience for a film like this) and these items, we think we'll have a slam-dunk to get the film fully funded.  \nWill this film get made? \nNot without YOU.  Seriously, you, the person reading this right now.  This is a grassroots approach to making a film.  Help us send a message. YOU pledging now means there's another person who wants to see this film.  The money we raise here will get us started and is only a fraction of what the whole effort will take.  Any studio, any company or individual who wants to fund it will want to know there's an audience for this kind of film.  You backing us now, with whatever you can give, means there is someone else who wants to see it.  We need lots of backers.  It takes many raindrops to fill up a bucket.  \nWalt with Grandpa freaking out in a Picasso-esque cubist world.\nWhy not wait and just see the movie when it comes out?\nYes, we want you to see the movie when it comes out, take the whole famly.  But it may not come out at all without your help.  The studios are interested in BIG sequels, films from books or fairy tales that already have a following.   It's very hard to get an original film made unless you're already in a studio OR there's a proven, existing audience.  \nWe're 1000% confident this will be a sure-fire hit -- but we need YOU to support it and to show that it can have a big following!  With lots of backers and the entire package we'll create with the money, we're sure we'll have the momentum we'll need to get the film made.  \nOK, looks fun... how can I help?\nTo become one of our backers, just click on the big green button to the right of our video.  Kickstarter will ask you for your pledge, which reward you want, and how you want to sign up.  Signing up is easy -- you can even do it on Facebook.   And PLEASE pass on the info to your friends -- the more backers, the more we can show the studios films like this can have a following.\nBehind the scenes look at our process:\nArt Fans of the World Unite!\nIf you're an art teacher, work at a museum or are just a big fan of paintings or the arts -- this project is for you.  We'll treat this world right -- with respect -- honoring and celebrating these paintings.  An animated film is a great way to excite the next generation of artists, museum-goers and fans of the arts.  We hope you see the potential in the story and will become a backer.  \nWant More?\nConnect with us at:                              https://www.facebook.com/ArtStoryFilm & https://twitter.com/artstoryfilm\nCheck out Aaron's awesome range of paintings and work at: http://aaronblaiseart.blogspot.com & http://creatureartteacher.com\nMore Visual Development Artwork (Concept Art)\n\nWalt and Grandpa argue in Hopper's \"Nighthawks\" (concept art)\nWalt and Grandpa corned in an Escher!

The $350k will give us a great start, but animation is expensive -- in the 10s of millions, especially considering all the location and character design changes in this film. \n\nBut we know there's nothing out there quite like it and we think this can be a VERY SPECIAL FILM: a moving, entertaining story set in a world that will fascinate and one which you'll want to expose your kids to. \n\nTHE FINE PRINT (Stuff we gotta say)\n\u2022 Please understand, we are a creative team -- directors, writers, artists, producers -- we are not a production facility. At the appropriate time in the future we will look for 3rd party production partnership to complete the film. At this stage it's too early to pick a partner. However, this a technically challenging, reel-worthy project. We're 100% confident that when fully funded, we can find a great production facility to make this film -- there are a handful of really top-quality houses ready for animation.\n\n\u2022 If we can't get the funding for the film, we won't be able to fulfill some of the items. The pitch book, T-shirts, blog site, digital artwork and apprenticeship will all be funded by this campaign and we'll get them to you asap. We'll also create a CHILDREN'S BOOK ready for publication, but we can't guarantee you or your painting can be in the film or that we'll have a private screening if we can't get the film made. This is the same for the DVD. We're confident, but we've got a lot of big wig studio execs to convince -- THAT'S WHY YOUR BACKING IS SO IMPORTANT. \n\n\u2022 The APPRENTICESHIP is an unpaid position and is NOT a guarantee of employment on the film. We'll make it a worthwhile, rich experience -- you'll be right at the core of the film. Great for a resume and a unique peak into the pre-production process. \n\n\u2022 You must be over 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian to tour the studio or be a voice in the film. \n\n\u2022 The usage of a character likeness or a voice in the film will be ultimately determined by the filmmakers. You will be in the final cut, but we'll have to figure out where and how. We know we're asking for a lot of money for it, so we want you to have a good meaningful appearance, but we can't determine it until the storyboarding and editing begin in earnest. \n\n\u2022This fundraising campaign is all subject to applicable Kickstarter rules and regulations, movie guild rules and applicable laws. If any of this conflicts, we will work with you in good faith to give you a substitute reward.\n\nTo wrap it up -- filmmaking on this scale is a long and winding journey and we're not sure where all the bumps in the road may come. We know how important your contribution will be to this project and will do EVERYTHING POSSIBLE to: 1) make a great film you can enjoy for years, and 2) get you your rewards. Anything you can give, any recommendation you can pass on to your friends and family is very important to us.

If you look at his cartoons and they don\u2019t make you laugh, you\u2019ve got to go back to the very beginning as a person and start with \u201cknock-Knock\u201d jokes and then work your way back.\u201d \u2013 Lewis Black (The Daily Show)\n\"Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird\u201d is comic anarchy on a splendid level. Great imagery. Let\u2019s face it, Gahan Wilson is a genius. I loved it!\u201d -- Mel Brooks\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWHO IS GAHAN WILSON?\nPeople have seen and heard the name, but most recognize Gahan Wilson\u2019s work by his unique style of drawing and his unmistakable signature. His cartoons are strange, twisted, gross, weird, darkly humorous, completely developed universes, populated with monsters, vampires, maniacal generals, politicians, ordinary people, and of course - atomic and ecologically contaminated mutants. Wilson has been called \u201cthe Master of the Macabre,\u201d and is proudly eccentric; a champion of oddball individuals.\nHis legions of fans know him from his special guest star appearances at Comic-Con, over fifty years of monthly cartoons in Playboy, weekly cartoons in The New Yorker, and the years of off-the-wall, insanely funny covers and spreads in National Lampoon, where Gahan\u2019s ever popular NUTS series captured the paranoia and frustrations of being a little kid just trying to survive. He has received more lifetime awards than any living cartoonist, including the World Fantasy Award, and the National Cartoonists Society\u2019s prestigious Milton Caniff Lifetime achievement award.\nGAHAN WILSON: BORN DEAD, STILL WEIRD \u2013 The title originated with the fact that Gahan was indeed born dead, and fortunately revived by the family doctor. He is very much, still weird and proud of it!.\nWHY I MADE THE MOVIE? \nI was ten years old when I saw my first Gahan Wilson cartoon. It rocked my pre-pubescent brain. It was eye candy for the demented. I became obsessed with his cartoons; the lurid colors, the dark and twisted point of view, and the asymmetrical way he drew people and the world they inhabited. I had no idea who this Wilson fellow was, or how to pronounce his first name, but I felt I had discovered a kindred spirit. Over the years, my love of Gahan\u2019s work only increased.\nAfter becoming a producer, I was obsessed with trying to meet the mysterious cartoonist to see if there was some way of bringing his work to the big screen. I finally met Gahan Wilson and we struck up a friendship that continues to this day. After seeing the documentary on cartoonist Robert Crumb, I decided I had to make a documentary about Gahan so that the rest of the world would realize what a national treasure and a truly inspiring artist he is.\nI took an unpaid sabbatical from producing Hollywood movies. I thought it might take six months, maybe a year tops- I was willing to take the financial risk. As soon as I realized the responsibility I had undertaken to tell Gahan\u2019s story, there was no turning back. Six years later, having shot over 175 hours of footage, I completed the film.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u201cGahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird is brilliant. You held us, informed us, and moved us. The sequence with the cartoonists waiting for a thumbs-up or thumbs-down at The New Yorker is one of the most powerful slices of real life that I've ever seen in a documentary, and the final scene of Wilson skipping lightly away from the camera is a stroke of filmatic genius. Suddenly the viewer knows it's not just a film about Wilson, it's about how to live one's life with the sword of fate always above your neck.\u201d -- Bill Moyers, Moyers & Company, PBS.\n\u201cJaffe\u2019s film is a lively and entertaining portrait of the man whom director, Guillermo del Toro honors with the title, \u201cthe poster child of disenfranchised children.\u201d -- Andrew Farago, The Comics Reporter\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGahan and his custom Carver Edition skateboard (one of our rewards) --->\nHOW I MADE THE MOVIE\nIn addition to documenting Gahan\u2019s mysterious life and work, I fantasized who I\u2019d like to see as guest stars. So I made a wish list of todays\u2019 iconic cultural visionaries, including Stephen Colbert, Neil Gaiman, Stan Lee, Guillermo del Toro, Randy Newman, Bill Maher\u2026 to my delight and surprise most of the people on the list enthusiastically embraced the idea of participating in the film. Gahan not only influenced but also played a pivotal role in the childhood of many of today\u2019s leading artists, thinkers, politicians, humorists, and thousands of fans around the world.\nUnlike other documentaries with big budgets and large resources at their disposal, the fact that I was operating the camera insured that the interviews were intimate and personal. I was at times challenged and anxious about the unknown aspects of the documentary, but I had encouragement from fellow filmmakers, and became excited about getting to the truth of Gahan\u2019s story. Once you\u2019ve seen the documentary, you\u2019ll realize and appreciate how complex and personal Gahan Wilson\u2019s work is. Trust me, you will laugh, be amazed and inspired by the film. There is something for everyone in Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"A fascinating portrait of the great cartoonist who's delighted fans of all ages for the past fifty years: funny, poignant, and revealing. I've always enjoyed Gahan Wilson's work but now I appreciate him all the more.\" -- Leonard Maltin, Author and Film Critic\n\"Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird\" is a marvelously humanizing portrait of one of the great cartoonists. It would make a great companion piece to \"Crumb.\" -- Peter Rainer, Film Critic, The Christian Science Monitor\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCURRENT STATUS AND WHY WE NEED YOU\nThe filming and editing are complete. I took the financial risk of investing my money and over six years to produce the documentary.  This does not include salaries for the other producers, my editor, and myself. We have not been paid for anything. The guest stars were not paid, they did it out of sheer admiration and enthusiasm for Gahan Wilson.\nIn that spirit, we are turning to you to help us raise money to launch an official campaign to submit the documentary for ACADEMY AWARD\u00ae consideration before this year\u2019s deadline is closed. What this means is that we have to rent a theater in New York and Los Angeles to screen the movie in each city for one week with advertising in the major newspapers.\nThe money we raise with your help will not go towards paying my producers or myself.  It will be used to book the theaters, pay for advertising, hire a publicist, do a technical finish to the sound and picture, pay for final music and stock footage licensing. There are other documentaries entering the competition, which have big studios or networks behind them, and unlimited resources with lots of money to pay for budgets exceeding a million dollars. Many have newsworthy topics that certainly are headline grabbers, and are produced by professional documentarians who have very polished films that include expensive animation, title sequences, reenactments, helicopter shots, large crews\u2026 \nThe Value of an ACADEMY AWARD\u00ae\nIt is of course a great honor to be recognized for ones work by your peers. The ACADEMY AWARDS\u00aeare one of the most fiercely competitive cinematic races and the odds of winning are very slim. However, It\u2019s widely accepted that with the right marketing, an Oscar\u00ae nomination and of course a WIN, can propel a documentary at the box office. Realistically, I don\u2019t expect to win an Oscar\u00ae but this is the best opportunity to get the documentary exposed to the WIDEST AUDIENCE POSSIBLE and launch its release.\nRemember, the big goal here is to introduce Gahan\u2019s work to people everywhere. Let me state bluntly, this is not going to be easy! GAHAN WILSON: BORN DEAD, STILL WEIRD is personally financed and a sincere labor of love- WE ARE THE UNDERDOGS. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u201cWeird is Good, particularly when you\u2019re legendary cartoonist Gahan Wilson.\u201d -- The Hollywood Reporter\n\"Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird\u201d is a deeply moving, uniquely honest portrait of an American treasure. It's a stunning film that succeeds in capturing the creative process--in this case how a gifted man transforms great pain into the stuff of great art.\" -- Daniel Kupper, Ph.D., Associate Clinical Professor, Department of Psychiatry, David Geffen School of Medicine UCLA\nSOME OF OUR REWARDS :) \nOur GWBDSW Tee Shirt!!\nSpecial Screening Invitation\nNear Dark Movie Poster\nGHOST- We Believe in Talent- Movie Poster\nThe Wind and the Lion Movie Poster\nWeight of Water Movie Poster\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTHANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT ! :) ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLEGAL DISCLOSURES \n\n-If you are a minor, you must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian (who will count as your plus one) to attend the screenings.\n\n-This fundraising campaign is subject to applicable Kickstarter rules/regulations, and applicable law.

Normally, I might not have paid much attention to this, except I found my passenger, Mr. Wilson, the master of the macabre, staring at the sign. I slowed down as we approached it. Neither of us said a word, but I imagined a cartoon bubble exploding above Gahan\u2019s head with a dark and disturbing image of being inside the bar with all manner of clams; Ipswitch, Cherry Stones, Middle Necks, Little Necks, Steamers, and of course, my favorite \u2013 Razor clams, all seated on bar stools. But big, the size of people. The bar tender, a peculiar looking, large Quahog, smiling happily as he watched his customers devouring what appeared to be people, or parts of people\u2026 I looked over at Gahan as we passed the clam bar, a slight smile appeared on his face. \u201cWhat kind of people are they eating in there?\u201d I asked.

Producers, casting directors, and studios spend endless hours, searching high and wide for a seductive glance, a courageous swagger, or a sway of the hips unlike any other. No one knows quite what the right combination is, until they see it. But when it hits... when it truly hits... it\u2019s a look that launches ships, a look that utterly seduces, a look that erupts into belly laughs, or tears. There is no formula, no recipe, no road map \u2013 Only this is true: When they find it, when the look works, its stupendous. Witness please:\nThe eyes (Hepburn, Newman)\nThe smile (Roberts, Cruise)\nThe curves (Monroe, Vergara, Jolie)\nAnd think how these looks changed them \u2013 and us.\nThe chance to be one of these rare creatures is the stuff of legend. Its promise has attracted legions to Hollywood, all in hopes that their look \u2013 their particular physical charms \u2013 will be the one that sticks out.\nPhoto by Bobby Quillard\n\nThis documentary is the story of one such face -- highly unlikely one at that. A passionate writer, after having landed in Los Angeles at the age of 21 -- but after losing his first job -- took advice from his roommate: sign up for background extra work.\nThis advice changed his life.\nJesse Heiman, an unlikely star, has since worked steadily, on hundreds of films and television series alongside some of the most prominent names in the business. Directors from Spielberg to Fincher have placed him in the center of the frame for their highest profile projects \u2013 albeit as a wholly anonymous presence. From Old School to The Social Network, Catch Me If You Can and Spiderman -- Jesse has offered up the face dreammakers sought: homely, earnest, innocent, and brave. Over time, Jesse\u2019s pure determination has made him an unlikely, irresistible worldwide face.\nThis utterly heart-rending portrait film exploring the courage, risks, fun and the truly wild leaps Hollywood culture demands in order for Jesse to achieve his ambitions -- it is also about the fascinating things one distinctive look can do. A young man in search of dreams can inspire a public that seeks out a face to mirror their own desires.\nComic-Con 2013\nTHE CREW\nJason Connell (Executive Producer)\nConnell is the president and founder of Connell Creations, a Los Angeles-based production company. He has produced numerous award-winning films, including STRICTLY BACKGROUND, THE ROCK-AFIRE EXPLOSION, GABI ON THE ROOF IN JULY, HOLY ROLLERS: THE TRUE STORY OF CARD COUNTING CHRISTIANS, and GLOW: THE STORY OF THE GORGEOUS LADIES OF WRESTLING. Connell is also the founder and director of the United Film Festival, which began in his hometown of Tulsa, OK ten years ago and has grown to Los Angeles, New York, London, San Francisco, and Chicago. Connell's distribution division, the appropriately named United Films, has grown rapidly and now represents an impressive and constantly expanding library of independent films.\nNick Weis (Director/Producer/Editor)\nWeis is a self-taught filmmaker from Louisville, KY. Through trial and error, he's created powerful, heart-wrenching documentaries, like his most recent editorial work in The Potter's Field. His innate passion and naturally creative eye is a true gift. He is a co-owner in Magic Happens Productions, established for the purpose of making WORLD'S GREATEST EXTRA. Weis' approach to filmmaking is fearless and playful.\nEmily Carroll (Producer)\nCarroll is a Louisville, KY transplant now living in Los Angeles, and working for well-known film/TV production companies. A lifelong fascination with how movies are created led her to switch careers, from advertising to film production, in 2011. Upon her move to LA, Carroll became enamored with the business side of film/TV. She's worked on films such as 2nd Serve, The Wedding Pact and Dracano, and TV/web series Hell's Kitchen, Sandra Lee's Taverns, Lounges, and Clubs, and Up Close with Carrie Keagan. Carroll is co-owner of Magic Happens Productions. Carroll's approach to filmmaking is meticulous and well-organized.\nEdward Heavrin (AD/Cinematographer)\nHeavrin is an artist from Louisville, KY, working in film, performing arts and music. He recently spent several years in New York City working in theatre and film, and co-wrote an original play, \"Letters From India,\" which received an Off-Broadway staged-reading, at Urban Stages, in 2008. His first documentary film, The Potter's Field, screened to a sold-out theater of over 500 people, at the 2013 Flyover Film Festival. Heavrin's approach to filmmaking is straightforward and unapologetic.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTime is a challenge on this project. We've filmed periodically throughout the last four months but we need to follow his story for at least a full year. Eight additional months of filming will ensure a cohesive story, involving all the people, places, and things that are important to Jesse and to shaping the outcome of his career.\n\nPart of the expense is having the equipment needed to capture the magic of a beautiful shot or pick-up audio on an important conversation... the other part of the expense is affording the people who can use the equipment to make magic happen. Luckily, the core team on this production is incredibly hard-working, budget-conscious, and committed to seeing the project completed and given back to the audiences who made the film possible.\n\nJesse risks a lot by doing this film. Giving us access to his private life would be difficult for anyone to do. Full disclosure can be a scary thing, but as we've seen through documentaries like \"Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work\" and \"The Kid Stays in the Picture,\" it is also liberating and captivating. Hollywood is a volatile place and we don't get to see the real-time rollercoaster ride of how people attempt to build their careers in the madness of it all. As Producers, our relationship with Jesse is one of trust and understanding, which has been cultivated by dedicating our time and attention to sharing his story.\n\nFor Producers, we risk a lot, too. Our reputations as filmmakers, however short they may be at this time, are on the line.\n\nLastly, YOU are sharing risk, as well.

Every year, thousands of residents of all ages visit the Balboa to relax and enjoy the magic of the movies in a classic neighborhood setting.  We want this tradition to continue, but we need your help. \nAfter 100 years of movies being screened from film, Hollywood is converting to digital. Every theatre must upgrade it's projectors and associated equipment and it must be done by the end of this year. Upgrading the projection and sound equipment in both of the Balboa's auditoriums will cost close to $150,000. This goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to raise the funds to cover the cost of the digital upgrade for one of the Balboa's two auditoriums. Any funds raised above the goal will be put towards upgrading the second auditorium. \nBalboa Theatre, 1969\nUnfortunately, classic cinemas like the Balboa are rarely able to compete against modern multiplexes.  The Balboa is able to survive only because the non-profit San Francisco Neighborhood Theater Foundation holds the lease for the Balboa and covers many expenses so that the Balboa's operator, CinemaSF, can afford to keep the theatre going.  To date, the Theater Foundation has enabled numerous improvements including new paint, new floors, a new heating system and new seats.  The expense of the digital upgrade, however, requires this Kickstarter campaign. \nIf the campaign is successful we will immediately upgrade the Balboa's auditorium 1 to digital and hopefully we'll be able to get work on auditorium 2 going as well.  With digital projectors in place we'll be able to keep the Balboa alive offering a modern, first-class movie experience in a classic neighborhood theatre.  Once the digital conversion is complete, we plan to work on other upgrades including expanding the concesssion operation to include beer, wine and food.  We also hope to rehab the Balboa's aging restrooms. \nAnd if we're not successful?  Without digital the Balboa Theatre can't continue to screen new films and the theatre will likely go dark.  We don't want that to happen and we know you don't want it to happen either.  So please give what you can and for that we'll give you great opportunities to experience the new and improved Balboa for many years to come. \nBalboa Theatre, 2012", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately we just installed a brand new digital projector at the Vogue Theatre so we know what we're doing.

The film takes a personal and holistic look at this international creative community who are disrupting the traditional video games industry.\nGameLoading is about game developers, specifically indie game developers. Without them the games we love would not exist. Our film explores the lives of developers around the globe and we strongly feel this is a story that needs to be told in detail. We want to demystify their craft and how they are working on the cutting edge of entertainment. We want to show their infectious passion for making games. Right now there is a global renaissance in indie game development and GameLoading aims to capture this moment time.\nVideo gaming is still a young medium, ready to explode in ways we are yet to imagine. The democratisation of game development has enabled independent developers to express themselves like never before. \nLike DIY musicians and film-makers, indie game developers are working without the big budgets and huge teams of mainstream studios, giving life to their own visions, on their own terms.  In the process they are pushing the limits, challenging the status quo of what games are and bringing a new language to the medium. \nGameLoading aims to take a snapshot of the worldwide indie game subculture, by following the pioneers of indie development to see how they are changing the industry and even our views on what video games can be. \nWe will get a personal glimpse of the endless hard work, risks faced and sacrifices indie developers make to bring their creations into the world.  What drives them?  What does it mean to succeed?  Will they make it?\nWe are gamers ourselves, excited by the creativity and innovation of the indie gaming subculture. We want to make our film personal and holistic; indie developers at all stages of the process telling their own stories, in their own words.\nWe have been working, planning and researching for a year and have shot over a dozen interviews with developers from different parts of the globe at different stages in their careers.  We are closely following a handful of development teams in Australia.\nRight now we are now ready to travel to film the next round of interviews we have lined up. Firstly to the USA for PAXPrime and IndieCade, and then to Europe to do interviews in Stockholm, Belgium, France, Italy and Romania.\nAfter Europe we will explore the burgeoning indie game scene in Japan. Finally we will come home to Australia and continue filming the teams we have been following for the last year.\nSo far we have spent our own money on the film and now we are reaching out to you to help us with the next phase of filming.\nLike the developers we are following, we are also totally independent and running off our own passion and commitment in getting inspiring people to tell their stories.\nWe have done a huge amount of work already but we can\u2019t do it all alone! So we are asking for support to help us get to the finish. If you share our passion for the world of indie games and filmmaking, please pledge towards the project and help make it happen. If you are a game developer at any level and you want to see the culture of game development nurture and grow then please show your support.\nWe are excited to have a bunch of great games included in the rewards. This selection will grow throughout the campaign. \nHere is a trailer of all the current games:\nFree Games Bundle\nOPENCLONK - Beautifully nuanced side-scrolling adventurer and builder. Full of antiquity, rich landscapes and flowing weather patterns. \n\nQBEH - A gorgeous first-person puzzler with a lovely minimalist aesthetic - this one's incredibly addictive.\n\nA.R.C.S. - Super retro tower defense game with a modern polish. Big guns. Big bombs. Big old-school arcade destruction!\n\nZombie Grinder - Bust some block-headed zombie brains to the sounds of an awesome analogue soundtrack. Very cool and cute pixel-art multiplayer zombie survival with heaps of fun mods. \nPremium Games Bundle\nLivalink - Solid, wave-defense FPS with tons of atmosphere and a more than few nods to the pioneers of the genre. The deadly Progeny are eerie and terrifying!\n\nSpyleaks - Sophisticated, brain bending puzzle game. Fully retro-fit spy saga that swings effortlessly between beat-the-clock covert conundrums and trenchcoat shootouts. \n\nUbinota - A wistful, cloud-born wonder. These French auteurs' deceptively simple tale of a colourful painter thinly veils a deeper tragedy of complex gravity. \n\nUnderrail - Gritty post-apocalyptic isometric RPG that feels like an obscure forgotten gem from the shadowed shelves of a 90's wargaming store. It's dark, complex and awesome.  \n\nRecruits - Gung-ho top-down shooter with a full swag of firepower and explosives. Bred from hardened Cannon Fodder stock, the environments are beautifully natural and the gameplay kicks some serious ass.\nThese stretch goals will help make the best film we can. We have been relying on friends donating their film gear but we would love to start paying people and using our own equipment. \nWe have been borrowing sound equipment and lenses from friends throughout the production. We would love to buy our own equipment for the shoot - sound gear, lenses, a camera bag, tripod and a light panel. \nSo far we have been shooting the film mostly on our own. We would like to hire talented camera people for some of the shoots so the film looks amazing. \nOur friends have supported us immensely during production, lending us their time, talents and equipment.

He was 113 years old. A year later, Hunter Weeks and Sarah Hall set out to tell his story along with that of several living Supercentenarians by exploring their major contributions to the world and their personal philosophies on how they were able to make it past the 110 mark. Their journey helps capture the stories of the last few people born in the late 1800s. This movie celebrates life and will help people think differently about their personal timeline differently.

Because of this we've decided at Team Zombie upon a new reward.  Our 100th backer, and then our 200th and then our 300th (and onwards as far as this campaign goes) shall be automatically eligible to be depicted in the background of one of the cards care of our great illustrators, this is otherwise only available with the Chuck Norris level of support. While you wont be the focus of the card (our lovely zombie ladies are of course), you will be clearly depicted as a zombie in one of our cards. This reward is not something that will be on the sidebar, but will be something we will contact each person who hits our 100th, 200th, 300th backer mark. Stay safe, board the windows and stock up on canned goods my friends.\n\nAbout estimated delivery date: Please note that while most of our rewards state that the delivery will be in September, this is an error, they will actually be in October (unless we're able to finish the art on the cards and have them printed sooner, in which case we will).  Our apologies for this error (once rewards are claimed, it is too late to change the dates on them).\nAbout the cards: The cards material will be of high quality, German Black core paper (310gsm. 63*88mm)\nWhat is it?\n100% custom Zombie Pinup Girl poker playing cards.  Because what's better than zombies? Beautiful zombies...duh! Henceforth they shall be known as \"Zom-B-girls\".\n\nWhy Pinup Girl Zombies?\n\nWe believe many will love a unique deck incorporating humour, playful sexiness and of course that current staple of pop culture, the ever lovin' Zombie! Just because humanity has perished from this alternate post apocalyptic zombie world doesn't mean they have to miss out on cute girls when they play cards! And neither should you.\n\nHow we found the deck.\n\nIn a world much like our own, in a time, in a place...it was/is (dimension hopping is confusing) 2015 and the pandemic has/had (ok I'll stop) reached its natural conclusion...humanity has pretty much snuffed it.  The zombies unlive everywhere, but after a while of chasing the few survivors around, they just kind of went back to their normal unlives, just at a much slower pace with a lot less chit chat. Card games still got played, albeit very slowly, the occasional finger falling into the chip bowl and pinup zombgirls still needed to show off, before their looks completely fade (in a day or two usually).  And so a world went \"rraouggha\" and \"brains!\" and \"uhhhg?\" in response to the most beautiful deck of pinup Zom-B-girls ever unleashed upon an unthinking and pungent populace.\n\nFortunately for us we've only got a portal into their world and we pop in now and then to nick stuff.  In this case we've come back with a deck so profound, so beautiful that we had to share it.\n\nWhere you come in...\n\nBut here's the thing, we've only managed to find a few of the cards before we had to run (we lost Gary, but nobody really liked Gary anyway). But we need your help!\n\nWith your funding we'll be able to launch a full expedition into this world to recover the missing cards (and maybe some other goodies).  We'll keep you updated on our progress, we'll let you get to know the team (and mourn the occasional one we'll probably lose).\nZombie Queen of Hearts\nZombie King of Aces\n5 of Hearts\nBackcover of ZOM-B-GIRLS cards\n7 of Hearts\nRewards\nFor clarification: all those who back this project above \u00a36 will ALSO get 2 HD Zombie Pin-Up wallpapers for their desktop.

So far, we have successfully funded two titles; Data Hacker Initiation and Fantasyche. The ability to be part of this community is an honour to behold, and the community's reaction to our previous titles has both awed and humbled us.\nIf you need to pledge via Paypal, rather than Kickstarter, that is indeed possible. Just head over to the Official Website!\nA word from the chief 'game guy' : I'm SO SO SOOOO excited and passionate about the Data Hacker series, and Corruption in particular! Hopefully, my enthusiasm shows through, and you guys see fit to want to play this game of ours. I say this with no ego at all- This game is going to be badass. Or, as one fan put it; this game's going to be off the hook! Enjoy.\nThe Data Hacker Series comprises of three titles: Initiation, Corruption and Reboot.\nInitiation \n(Corruption's prequel) was also Kickstarter-funded, and response from fans was amazing, both during funding and after release (suggesting that it did not disappoint!). The game currently has a rating on Desura of 8.6 / 10 (at the time of writing), which is a massive compliment to the game, and a testament to the sheer amount of love and craftsmanship that went into creating it. \nPlayers begin their journey as Jay- a retired hacker. After an ironic case of mistaken identity, Jay is banished from Online World; an online game that serves as a respite from a broken society. Jay\u2019s quest involves a dark narrative, many characters and unexpected twists, but there is much more to come\u2026 \nThe main feature of Initiation was a massive fork in the storyline, dictated by the player\u2019s actions. And now, it is time to continue your chosen path in Corruption. \nDon't take our word for it, here's some feedback we received after the game was released:\n\"I highly recommend! Well done to the developers.\" - Aldorlea user blitzen\n\"...far better than a lot of other cut'n'paste - expensive - commercial RM titles, that's for sure. The custom soundtrack is especially enjoyable\" - Desura user Sabin1981\n\"The best thing was that the combat never got boring\" - Desura user Lordmalakar\n\"rich, intelligent and terribly addictive! Do not hesitate\" - Desura user Danteros\nCorruption \nallows you to load your old save file, complete with your chosen team and choices made, which actually makes Corruption two complete games in one package!\nIt is your previous decisions that will determine which story, alas, on which side you will stand in the coming war. It is YOUR choices that will decide the fate of the worlds and characters that you have encountered, and will encounter as your journey progresses.\nJay's Avatar (left), Leader of the Virulea (right)\nThe game's main features include:\nTwo COMPLETE stories in one package, with an amassed 40-hours of estimated core play time,\nA much more diverse graphical spectrum, new characters sheets and customised tilesets!\nA well-thought out, darkly twisting narrative,\nHack monsters and players!\nDynamic recruitment system,\nRecruit Mission System - Send party members on their own missions while you continue the main story,\nMature your recruits into more powerful allies!\nCraft hundreds of unique items & equipment, new recruits, evolution items and more...\nInteract with any one of the scores of in-game characters on a dynamic level. Chat, trade, challenge, or even hack them!\nTons of sidequests to undertake, from 'official game quests' to special player-initiated quests!\nUnique Dungeons! No copy-paste shortcuts.\nChallenging puzzles within each dungeon,\nPlenty of optional content\nOver 100 in-game Achievements,\nTrioarch! An addictive trading-card game\n\nDon't be fooled into thinking that you HAVE to play Initiation. Corruption will stand on its own as a game in itself, although it is recommended that you do play Initiation beforehand.\nDoing so will provide you with a great foundation-level knowledge of the events that have led up to this point- the choices made by various parties, and the consequences wrought upon the worlds.\nThat being said, you're free to begin your journey with Corruption as your starting point, since all game systems will be explained to you (should you require it), and brief recaps of the series' story will also be mentioned during your travels. \nAnd finally, Data Hacker: Reboot. \nThis game will have an expansive feature list, and will most likely be built on the Unity3D engine. \nDue to the nature of  distinction between the two engines, Reboot will not feature a save file import system, but will instead introduce a new set of characters following the aftermath of Corruption's climax.\nThere's little point going into the expansive feature list planned for Reboot, so just rest assured, it's going to be EPIC. And so much fun.\nWhilst the narrative is definitely a strong selling point of the game, story alone cannot make a great game. That is why Corruption is crammed full of features and optional content.\nInitiation and Corruption share a time-tested turn-based yet somewhat frantic battle system, during which you will find yourself thinking tactically about how to defeat each and every foe you find yourself trading blows with! \nExploration takes place both through dungeon-crawling and town hubs in Online World, and through field exploration in the DigiPlane.This brings the best of both worlds to your gaming experience.\nHacking monsters and other players has a direct influence on how the game plays too. The prolific hacker will find themselves armed with an assortment of 'hacked' recruits; entities that will obey your every command and often 'mature' into even more powerful allies. On the other end of the scale, the less hack-happy player will likely find themselves with a small army of loyal 'player' followers.\nHacking when monsters are on full health can have detrimental effects...\nWhile hacking provides a method of recruiting players, it can also be used to 'farm' for unique items and provide a means to unlock hidden areas (much to the chagrin of Online World's administrators!).\nCrafting items from materials that have been gathered provides an exploratory method of acquiring not only new items and equipment, but methods of upgrading your teammates. You can either find recipes for crafting, or simply combine random items to see the effects!\nSelect up to five materials to create something unique!\nThe crafting system implemented into Corruption allows you to access hundreds of unique weapons, armour, accessories, restorative items, evolution items and more. Recipes are available for 'base' items, which can then be modified with rarer materials with special effects.\nGathering materials for use in crafting also forms another level of depth and immersion within the game world. Players can shop, hunt monsters, farm seeds, fish and mine for the materials they need to craft any of the hundreds of unique items featured in-game.\nThere are plans to release two differing versions of Corruption. The Hacker\u2019s Paradise edition will feature exclusive additional content including equipment, characters, locations and battles.\nThis extended version will not be publically released. Featuring at least two exclusive dungeons, new monsters, challenging bosses and unique equipment, the 'Hacker's Paradise Edition' of Corruption is our way of saying a massive \u2018Thank you!\u2019 to those who saw fit to back the campaign, and really help us to grow this game into the best product it can be!\nSo, to reiterate; this edition is exclusive to Kickstarter!\nThe Physical Realm\nThe tangible world in which you and I live (most of the time). \nRavaged by war, the world is in tatters. Though there could be hope, the world is populated primarily by a defeated shadow of a society.\nOnline World\nThe game world which exists primarily in the servers of 'EPT Corp.' This online video game provides a respite for those living in a post-war shattered shadow of a world.\nThe 'beginner' dungeon- Jurassica\nAt the beginning of Initiation, the player is presented with information about players going missing while logged into the game, however most shrug it off as urban legend. \nThe RedPlanet Dungeon holds many secrets...\nBut as the story progresses, it becomes clear that there is something great, and terrible at work behind this addictive game, leading Jay to make tough choices about the path he treads. \nOptional caves and tombs aplenty within each dungeon\nOnline World (the game world) itself centres around central town hubs, and a series of dungeons and disjointed locations, which are accessed through town Gatestones, inventory Crystones and other kinds of 'keys.'\nA zoomed-out image of the City of Angelus under construction\nThe City of Angelus is taking on shape\nWith our stretch goal, players will be able to buy a plot of land to call their own, build a house and furnish it as they see fit\nThis provides a semi-linear method of play: Players can choose which dungeons they wish to play next, while being subtly nudged towards the next major plot point.\nOnline Realm / DigiPlane\nA subtle, intangible world which is home to the SilicAI (digital people). It is not clear whether this world existed before the creation of Online World, or whether it sprang to life as a result of it.\nOverlooking the city of Processon\nThe DigiPlane consists of one main metropolis, around which there are colour-coded zones that have been 'tamed.' \nDespite having teleport abilities, Jay still chooses to use a more 'traditional' means of conveyance\nThere are however, many 'Wild' Zones that have not yet been fully integrated into the world order. The player can work to 'tame' these lands by completing dungeons and puzzles, and defeating the most challenging of foes.\n'Tamed' fields provide monsters and traps aplenty.\nWhen not engaging in combat in the field, players will find themselves in one of the many towers that form the city of Processon. Each level contains shops, residential and military zones, and just a few secrets...\nTower 3 (Lower Level) - Jay's home in the DigiPlane\nDo not be fooled! A digital realm such as this follows rules, just like our world. It is just as real, if not more so, than the Physical Realm. You will come to see in time.\nThe Datastream\nA sub-ethyric river of power. To those who know how, this force can be tapped to create, destroy and to link. \nThe NetherLand\nA non-place devoid of life as we know it, which exists outside the domain of known worlds. The normal rules do not apply here.\nVERY Early concept art of the NetherLand\nThroughout your journey you will encounter a wide variety of people and other life forms, all of which you can interact with on some level. This could be through the art of combat, chatting, trading, challenging to a card game or even hacking the person to steal their data, there are a myriad ways you can affect the worlds within Corruption.\nThe Justica/Hunters\nThe Justica were originally a fanatic group of Hacker-haters within the confines of Online World. However, things have progressed somewhat. The Justica have since been rebranded the hunters on account of their new agreement- kill all SilicAI on sight.\nSome old faces from Jay's squad may return, plus a host of new ones\nSilicAI\nDefenders, builders and artists of Online Realm, or the DigiPlane. The SilicAI are borne of the data of players, their physical bodies, and power from the Datastream. They are the culmination of everything that is good about humans; passionate, loyal, obedient, and with few of the frailties such as vengefulness, jealousy, mind degradation and ageing.\nThe SilicAI live in great domes that look futuristic to us. But it could all come crashing down in an instant\nUnfortunately, as the skirmishes grow into a full-scale war, less emphasis has been placed on the lives and arts of this people. Hundreds of SilicAI are being lost on the battlefield, and their leader thus (albeit reluctantly) has announced the conscripting of any able fighters. \nA world, and a people destined to greatness; reduced to desperation.\nThe Virulea\nThought to have originated from the NetherLand- a void in which horrors lurk- the Virulea were not a particularly formidable force... until now. They have formed an army, and march with seemingly single objective: to destroy all life.\nThat being said, the apparent leader of the Virulea is thought to be of a different origin.\nPlayers\nPlayers still log into Online World, despite the apparent risks. With nothing else to go back to (only a broken physical world), players find purpose in the game, especially if they are shortlisted for the defence against malevolent otherworldly forces.\nImagine scores of players roaming the streets, looking for help, challenges and trades!\nAdministrators\nFormer keepers of Online World turned rogue. They seek out the truths behind the strange occurrences within Online World and beyond, while answering to EPT Corp; the game's creator.\nRuling from up high, the Administrator's higher purpose is no longer clear\nThe barriers that once separated the worlds are breaking down. The Datastream is fluctuating, and areas of all worlds are becoming corrupt. Something is eating at them, but what?\nA malevolent force, seemingly hellbent on the destruction of all life on all worlds has risen in power and rank.\nPlayers from Online World, and the SilicAI from the DigiPlane lock horns in an epic struggle. With neither side letting up, will this conflict end with the destruction of both sides?\nWhere do your loyalties lie; do you seek to protect the human players of this world, or do you help the SilicAI stave off the attacks on their homeland?\nHow do you go about solving your own problems; do you seek ultimate power for yourself, or do you build an army to lead?\nThe fate of all worlds lies in your hands.\nThis funding will be spread over several main areas that include (but is not limited to):\nAn Original, epic Soundtrack from Allen Elezeid\nTilesets and Background Artwork Licensing\nCharacter Sprite Sheets\nProfessionally-produced SFX\nGame systems programming\nAnimations\nRewards and Shipping\nKickstarter and Amazon's 10% slice of the pie\n\nShould we hit our initial goal, we'd like to thank you all for your amazing support! Let's move on to adding even more content:\n\u00a31,250 - Initial Goal - MET - This goal will cover everything we hope to include in the main game. Your Hacker's Paradise edition will come complete with exclusive content that ONLY YOU will have access to, and will not be included in the retail release.\n\u00a31,500 - Zombies! - MET - How innovative!

Having a certain party member in your team may yield unexpected events...\n\u00a31,800 - MET - The Tower of Shadows - A 100-level tower comprising of challenges such as complex puzzles and combat.\n\u00a32,300 - MET - New Game + - Featuring more story content, additional challenging dungeons, and even more characters and loot, new game + is for those players who just are not happy with a single play-through!\n\u00a33,000 - A little Piece of You! - MET - As a massive thank you to you all, when the surveys go out, you'll be asked to name either an in-game character or guild!\n\u00a33,300 - Welcome Home - MET - You'll be able to purchase a house in some of the game's towns, and even dungeons. Some will come complete with their own mini-quest and loot!\n\u00a33,500 - Bonus Soundtrack - MET - In addition to the already awesome original soundtrack, I'll coerce (gently) Allen into producing a small 8/16-bit MIDI soundtrack from some of the game's more popular tracks!\n\u00a33,700 - Bonus Sticker Set - MET - Featuring the main character's sprite and text that says 'HACKED!' I had a few of these made up for fun, and started sticking them all over people's computers for laughs! Eveybody with a package on the way will receive one of these sticker sets.\n\u00a34,000 - Voice Acting 1 - MET - If we can manage to stretch all the way to \u00a34,000, we can hire professional voice actors/actresses to voice-over both the beginning and ending sequences, elevating this game into a new class of awesomeness.\n\u00a34,500 - Pandora's Box - MET - A complete quest line to find the elusive Pandora's box, complete with an unexpected team-up.

We can answer any questions you might have!\n22CREDIT Shirts - \nAll garments we provide are 'Fruit of the Loom;' very high quality fabric\n35CREDIT Hoodies\n10CREDIT Mousepads\nAvailable with or without the obscuring grey bar\n35CREDIT (Each) Corrupted Art Book and Full Colour Game Guides - An estimated 15 page+ art book containing sketches, scribbles, screenshots and professional artwork, complete with annotations and notes all the way from concept to production. This will be signed off with a personal message of thanks from yours truly. \nAs well as the Art Book, we're offering exclusive printed copies of the game guides to both Initiation and Corruption!\nPreview of Initiation's 75+ page guide\n10CREDIT Conference Ticket - a 1-hour session with myself and other ticket-holders to discuss the development of this game, and future ideas. Those that attend this exclusive Kickstarter-backer conference will have an insight into precisely what is planned for the future.\n50CREDIT Statue & Game Lore - Immortalise yourself by erecting a statue in your honour in one of the game's towns. This statue will come complete with consistent game lore, raising you above the mere mortals.\n10CREDIT Design a basic character - \nDesign a character, pick his location, provide a description of his/her appearance (don't worry, we'll do the artwork) and give him/her some dialogue.\n25CREDIT Design a recruitable character - As above, but the character will have a class, equipment and will be able to join your party and engage in combat alongside the main character.\n50CREDIT Design a deep character - As above, but you can give this character a unique quest that the player can opt into following for unique loot. You can also give your character a backstory and home in one of the game's town hubs.\n100CREDIT The Works! - As above with the 'deep character', but you can also submit a dungeon/area design for implementation into the game, complete with traps, puzzles, monsters and a complete questline.\nAll design rewards are subject to approval, but we're pretty lax. Your submission must be consistent with the game's settings and backstory, and there are of course limitations to what we can do with your design. For example, an incredibly complex boss-fight design just might not be possible with this engine.\nAt the moment, Initiation is available for PC on the Official Studio 69 website, Desura, Aldorlea, Shiny Loot and Indie City. We are also in talks with Indiegamestand, Green Man Gaming, Gamersgate and GoG.\nWill the game be ported onto other systems? Sadly, at this point, no. Due to engine restrictions, we can only support PC, though the game does run smoothly in Wine for Linux.\nThis is likely the LAST game Studio 69 will release on Enterbrain's RM engine! We\u2019ll be making to jump from 2D into Unity3D to begin work on Reboot, as soon as Corruption is finished. After that, who knows?\n'\nSo, there's me, Ross Tunney. I suppose I'm the 'game guy.' It's really surprising how much I can achieve through hard work and an obsessively-creative mind. I work on pretty much every aspect of the game, from the characters and narrative, to level design, and then over to marketing and PR. I don't sleep much. \nAllen Elezeid. While not technically 'tied' to the company, Allen and I have a strong rapport and find each other incredibly good professional company. This guy is an aural genius; he produced Initiation's soundtrack in its entirety, and the vast majority of Fantasyche's musical repertoire.\nWant to hear some of his amazing work? TAKE THIS:\nDayna Gibson\nOur very own talented artist; Dayna is responsible for overhauling all of the character portraits, and is also working on some cool concept art which will feature in the art book. \nTom Clifford - A very talented pixel artist, Tom is working on many custom assets for the game, mainly environment-related, and others character-related. Some examples of his work can be found on this update.\nErica V. Szalkowski\nThe latest addition to our humble team, Erica is assisting in the development of the game's many sidequests. Having two writers on the project will pay dividends, allowing for more variety and a fresh approach to many aspects of the characters themselves and the many problems they will face.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWow. There are so many challenges that developers face with a project like this, especially with a small team like this. I'll try to address as many as possible:\n\nKeeping a Consistent Art Style: Any custom game assets will be created with a consistent art style in mind. I know what to look for in good freelancers, from experience, and will settle for no less than perfect.\n\nTimescale: This is the main challenge. To deliver a product on time, you need a keen awareness of how long each phase will take. Freelancer schedules, illness, global catastrophes, and lots of other things can affect a project's deadline. Allow me to be frank (you can still be you) - if the game release date gets pushed back a month, or two, you can rest assured that it's because we're working DAMN hard to bring you the best game that we can.\n \nRunning out of Funds: A none-issue with this project. Everything that is pledged will be used to advance the project. We have quotes from freelancers on the areas that we would like to have them work on, and have a contingency margin, just in case. My skills in project management leave little to be desired.\n\nDelivering the Promised Product: Also a none-issue. Those of you who have dealt with myself before now will agree that I will lose sleep, go without eating, and ignore my family if that's what it takes to deliver. And we WILL deliver.

And when the required period of exclusivity ends, Gridiron Thunder will be available for all Android and iOS devices. And now that final NFL rosters are set and the NFL regular season is about to start, our good friends in the NFL are getting involved. Here is what Dezman Moses of the Kansas City Chiefs just said:\n\"I'm feeling this new football game @kickstarter. @gridironthunder http://bit.ly/gridironthunder\" \u2014 Dezman Moses (@DezmanM) September 2, 2013\nWe have only shown you a very small portion of what Gridiron Thunder is about so far. There is so much more coming!!! We will update you as other elements become ready to unveil. We just might let you play Gridiron Football against some of our NFL players and personalities when we launch our online play!\nUpdate #3\nA few days ago, we posted a short video and explained that the foundation of the game was in place and that we would start to clean up the rough edges. Here are some things that show the progress we have made since our last post. We are very proud of our developers and the progress they are making. You are going to get an awesome football game!\nUpdate #2\nHere's a short video and some UI elements from where the game was last week. While the visuals are still rough, a significant amount of the groundwork for the game, such as the AI, UI, mechanics, physics, data loading and controls, is already done and in place. While most of this stuff is not visible (as any game developer knows), the key to a great game is a great foundation and this is where we focused our efforts.\nDuring the next few weeks, we will clean up the rough edges that you now see and add local multiplayer, fantasy teams, and online multiplayer.\nUpdate #1\nHey Friends,\nHere's a Shout-out from Scott Fujita who is one of our most stalwart friends and supporters.\nMany more Shout-Outs and updates about the game to follow.\nWe are creating a new Indie pro football game called Gridiron Thunder for the OUYA, other Android devices, Apple devices and Facebook, and we need YOUR SUPPORT!\nGridiron Thunder will offer much more than your typical sports game.

One of the features that we are adding in is fantasy football. This won't be the regular fantasy football that you play with your friends and co-workers. Gridiron Thunder fantasy will allow you to actually play the game with your fantasy roster.\nPit Your Team Against The Best!\nAdditionally, we don't want you to be in the dark about what's happening in the real world while you're making a name for yourself as the baddest gunslinger in our game. That's why we are going to pipe in real-time news, stats, and scores into the game, so that while you are playing you'll stay up to date with the latest happenings in the football world. To make Gridiron Thunder even more immersive we will have live feeds coming into the game from some of your favorite pro football players' and personalities' social media accounts. \nWorking Concept For News And Social Media Center\nAll of these features will be built into and around an eye-catching, easy to play, and extremely fun football experience that you can enjoy with your friends. \nA big factor in deciding what features to add will be hearing about what you guys want to see in Gridiron Thunder.

We at Xaos Publications have been working hard trying to bring a new system and a new gaming opportunity to the market.\nMechanika was designed to truly embrace the Steampunk horror genre, while at the same time incorporating Magical elements. Bringing them all together in a way that makes them feel genuine, and fully realized. Mechanika (indeed all the Xaos games), is also designed to deliver a rapid fire cinematic tabletop experience. We call this genre of tabletop gaming: Cinematic Roleplaying.\nWe accomplish this in a few different ways.\nFirst, the system is designed to be easy to learn, with fewer types of dice in mind. Fewer types of dice means fewer types of rolls, fewer types of rolls means faster gameplay. All you need to play is a pair of percentile dice, and a set of FUDGE dice. This dice combination is simple, yet allows for a high level of customizability. It gives the game a system for varying degrees of success or failure. We have found that this ensures combat (whether social, mental, or physical), is quick, brutal, and rewarding.\nSecond, we give you all the tools to play what you want, how you want, from the very beginning. We have no classes or level system, resulting in an open ended free form development process, while still offering rich opportunities for character advancement. Character creation is deep and satisfying, with perks, flaws, bonds, back stories, and more customizability than you can shake a gas powered stick at. We want the characters you make to feel like they are the true stars of the game.\nThe Mysterious Sylvan\nThirdly, magic is magical and machina is amazing! In mechanika you have access to terrible and incredible powers through a force we call flux. We want it to be a truly spectacular thing to cast an incantation, or use a piece of artifice. But everything in Mechanika has a price, and the price can be dire indeed. Manipulation of flux can draw the attention of sinister beings and dark forces better left unmentioned, and unimagined. For this reason overusing these terrible powers can cause insanity, death, or worse. This gives your decisions weight and consequence; and makes success that much sweeter.\nFinally, we want the characters to feel like they are more than just players in a story. We want the characters to help create that story. For that reason we have implemented a destiny system. Allowing player the ability to earn points for roleplaying the aspects of their characters that make them unique. These points can then be used to make live in-game changes. Anything from rerolling dice to completely altering the scene in a measurable way. This keeps the GM on his toes and makes the whole experience more engaging for everyone, and therefore, more fun!\nMechanika is about Steampunk and steampunk is about building anything and everything. We want to emphasize that creation process in every aspect. From magic, to machina, to monsters, we give you the tools to build practically anything you can imagine.\nNo seriously.\nTake magic for instance. We give you 12 primary schools of incantation, With many specific abilities in each school. You can then mix and match spell effects, allowing you to create elaborate chained catastrophic effects on the fly as the situation dictates. Do you want to set an undead soldier on fire, teleport him into a group of his buddies and watch him explode? Yeah. You can do that.\nOr take machina, our version of steampunk gadgets. We give you a system of templates and effects to work with and you do the rest! Want to build a steampunk set of ironman armor? How about a bunch of exploding clockwork spiders? Done and done.\nThe Sturdy Dwarf\nFinally even our monsters are fully customizable. We give you a rich menagerie of terrible and dark creatures to choose from, and a full system of templates and conditions that can be quickly and easily hot swapped to allow for unpredictable and innovative encounters. All of this customization and cinematic experience would mean nothing if it didn't have a rich and interesting environment to live in. The world of Mechanika is that environment.\nThe game is set on an anachronistic Earth, following an alternate timeline filled with historical and fictional characters from throughout history. Mark Twain, Mr. Hyde, Rasputin, Queen Victoria, Vlad the Impaler, and Nichola Tesla. Just to name a few. Altered and augmented in dark and exciting ways, and given new roles in our new world.\nThe Incorrigible Mr. Hyde\nWe have reimagined Earths cultures and countries in a myriad of interesting ways, injecting them with a heavy dose of Lovecraft inspired cosmic horror and exciting high adventure, and We can't wait to show you our vision and give you the opportunity to be a part of the story.\nThank you for reading, we truly believe we have a fun and innovative experience here that will tailor itself well to both the new and experienced gamer.\nFrom all of us here at Xaos Publishing. See you in Mechanika.\nAs we near our goal we wanted to let you all know that we've got plenty more to come beyond what we've already shared with you.  We have a set of stretch goals that we will be adding to the project as we finalize the steps and challenges to bring these additions to you early.  This is our love and our passion, every level we climb during this kickstarter allows us to pay for production, design and costs to make sure like our core rulebook we deliver quality products to you.  Because good people deserve good games.\nIf we reach 125% funding ($4687.50), we will begin production on our first run of unique Mechanika Chessex dice sets. They will feature a Victorian style plus and minus side, as well as the Mechanika \"Pentagear\" logo for the blank side. Each set will have four fudge dice and one set of percentile dice. They will come in three colors: Old One Green, Rusted Metal, and Blazing Inferno. Stay tuned!\nHere is the mock-up for our dice designs. This is just in white of course for the purpose of showcasing the look. We can't do the color swirls justice with the mock-up so we aren't showing those but as soon as they arrive from production we will take shots of them and add them to our site to check out.\nFinish writing, clean-up, editing and page layout for \"It Started at Innsmouth\" Serial to be ready at game launch. Everyone who pledges at the 35$ rank or higher will receive a PDF copy of \"It Started at Innsmouth\" in addition to the ones already included.\nFinish writing, clean-up, editing and page layout for \"Enter Jack the Reaper\" Serial to be ready at game launch. Everyone who pledges at the 35$ rank or higher will receive a PDF copy of \"Enter Jack the Reaper\" in addition to the ones already included.\nReaching 200% funded will move us into more promotion and exposure but more importantly more chances to connect with you. At the 200% mark being unlocked we will put in our registration orders to PAX Prime 2014 & GenCon 2014. We love getting to show off our work in person and run demos whenever we can; this is another chance to share what we created with you.\nThis stretch goal is a pretty fancy one if you ask us, and a manual labor of love.  We have been making a new fancy set of GM screens to release into the wild.  None of that cardboard stuff; rust, metal, expandable pouches, chalkboard panels, and best of all modular.  More details in the updates section but suffice to say this stretch goal will let us pick up some machining tools to help speed up the production and save some skin on our hands.\nOur final stretch goal will take you deep into the mysterious land of Bohemia. Once the three separate countries of Germany, Austria, and Poland, Bohemia, and its sturdy, but distrustful people wage an endless war against the undead armies of the Eclipse empire. With this stretch goal reached we will begin the development of the first \"Gazetteer\" from the world of Mechanika. \"The Lands of Bohemia\" This Gazetteer will offer 10 new perks, five additional flaws, one aberrant school, five unique artifice functions, and 20 powerful new spell effects. This is it Kickstarters, and thank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPlease join us and help us bring this world to print. The kickstarter goal we have listed will help us finish and print the Mechanika core rule book, and get our virtual store and products up and running. We also intend to have a bi-monthly magazine and serial adventure available if we can get help from fans like you.

Without the Queen of Blades to stop the hybrid\u2019s assault, the protoss are overwhelmed and defeated. In this reality, what would the survivors of these shattered worlds do? StarCraft Universe tells this story.\nStarCraft Universe (SCU) is a game mod (Note: it is not a standalone game) for StarCraft II. Originally named World of StarCraft, SCU focuses on telling an epic story and intense combat action, as well as highly replay-able multi-player experiences. StarCraft Universe will be released as a series of custom games published through Battle.net.\nThe objective of this game is to experience the universe of StarCraft from a third person view and master a wide variety challenges, missions, and raiding experiences. The focus of the game is to have a team of players/friends, creating/customizing their own hero character which they use to battle together through enemy forces and powerful bosses in a rich and living environment.\nPlease note that this is just a quick listing of the most important features within the game. You can get more information and details by taking a look at our user guide right here.\n- A unique story line by Ryan Winzen which plays out in an alternate StarCraft Universe.\nYou can read an introduction to the lore on our homepage.\n- Custom model assets:\nKiefer 'Ghostnova' Traub, arguably the best kit basher in the world, rips apart, dissects, then re-imagines Blizzard assets in his own vision by combining and altering models and textures from World of WarCraft and StarCraft II. His art form allows for the creation of fully pre-animated model assets much faster than building them from scratch, and often has an equally as impressive result.\nThe Hybrid Harvester is a twisted genetic merging of the Zerg Hydralisk and seasoned Protoss Zealot. Its unrelenting demeanor on the battlefield strikes fear into the even the most experienced combatants.\n- A wide variety of monsters, bosses and character classes\nLeft-Click on the icons to view an alpha video demonstrating some of the abilities for each class.\nClick class image for details.\nClick class image for details.\n- A persistent system to customize, save and load existing characters.\nEach character can be customized upon creation and its progress will be saved permanently until it is deleted by the player.\nThe game allows to save up to 8 characters which you can choose from.\n- Hundreds of customizable weapons, combat modifiers and equipment variations to choose from.\nStarCraft Universe features an advanced item system akin to World of Warcraft with a variety of stats, bonuses, and different gear slots.\nThe character equipment screen.\n- Single and Multiplayer experience\nAn intense boss fight in multiplayer.\n- Vehicle System featuring mounted multi-passenger combat\nThe game features an advanced vehicle system which allows the player to control vehicles. The vehicles are powered by fuel and have a unique ability set which differs from your class abilities.\nFighting against the Hybrid in a vehicle.\n- Item crafting system\nMany items will be obtained by crafting them, meaning the player has to collect various components which then can be used to build a new item using a blueprint.\nA blueprint which can be used to create a new item.\nA vendor selling blueprints.\n- Unique allocation ability system allowing the possibility of hundreds of unique builds per class.\nStarCraft Universe features a unique ability system that gives players a wide range of freedom when customizing their character.\nAbilities can be unlocked by paying with Minerals (this is the main resource in SCU). \nOnce an ability is unlocked, it can be learned at any time from a Class Mentor, adding it to the character's ability bar. An ability can also be unlearned in order to make room for different ones.\nThe capacity of the ability bar is limited, so it only allows the player to learn a certain amount of abilities at one time. Stronger abilities will require more points (combat weight) to add to the ability bar. This simple principle allows for heavy character customization for combat while giving the developers enough regulation to prevent flavor of the month (FoTM) builds..\nA class mentor can teach new abilities to the player.\nThe character stat boost allows each player to customize his character by using Outfitting Points to boost its stats.\n- Original Soundtrack!\nStarcraft Universe features a unique, original soundtrack composed by David Orr, an award winning composer for games, animations, television and film.\n\n- Fully voice acted cut-scenes!\nVoice acting is performed by experienced professionals such as Michael Gough (StarCraft, Diablo, Dragon Age), Danielle McRae (World of Warcraft, League of Legends), and Eric Dieter (Heroes of Newerth, The Leviathan Chronicles).\n- Many options to customize your game experience\nStarCraft Universe allows customization of nearly every aspect of the game including arranging the various graphical interface elements to suit one's tastes or changing of hotkey preferences. In addition, there are other game settings which influence combat or display behavior.\nThe game options menu.\nAlmost every UI element in the game can be unlocked and moved to a new position.\n- Difficulty and player scaling system\nThe game can be played in 4 different difficulty levels to be challenging and fun for players of all skill levels. It also features a player scaling system which automatically adjusts enemy strength based on player count. It doesn't matter if you play the game with two or five friends!\nDifficulty-Level information within the game.\n\n- Achievement System\nPlayers can earn tons of achievements within the game by completing certain missions, defeating bosses and sometimes by completing crazy challenges.\nThe achievement window.\n- Enemy, loot and strategy information directly within the game\nIf there is a problem defeating a certain boss or you are simply looking for a specific item, you may use the in-game strategy window which displays all this information directly within the game.\nThe strategy window displays ability information ...\n... as well as loot information directly in the game!\nPlayers already familiar with the MMO genre of gaming will pick up StarCraft Universe quickly, as the core game-play elements are very similar. For those who are not familiar with MMOs, we've developed an extensive user guide for players new to the game!\n- You must have an internet connection and a gaming PC/Laptop.\n- You must have a Battle.net Account. A Battle.net Account is the gaming membership required to play StarCraft II. You can sign-up at Battle.Net by clicking on \"Create An Account\". Sign-up is FREE and requires a valid e-mail address.\n- If you don't own StarCraft II, you will need to download a FREE copy of the StarCraft II: Starter Edition here. Since the file size is very big, downloading may be paused and resumed at your own discretion.\n- Downloading the project through the Arcade and start playing!\nWe must emphasize that all acts and expansions of SCU will be completely FREE to play through the StarCraft II: Starter Edition. You don't need to buy StarCraft II to play!\nYes and no! Here's a good article which clears up the confusion from 2011:\nWhile Blizzard is not directly affiliated with this project's production, we do communicate with them to submit bug reports and make technical requests. They have given their blessing/permission for us to launch this Kickstarter, and they are supporting our efforts by featuring SCU as an Arcade Highlight.\nUpheaval Arts is a small company formed in June, 2012 by the lead developer Ryan 'Kreation' Winzen. Made up of a small group of modding hobbyists, members of Upheaval Arts have been modding Blizzard RTS engines for over a decade in the creation of prototypes and custom games and are considered elite developers by Blizzard Entertainment.\nUpheaval Arts contracts talented industry professionals and entertainers, aiming toward AAA content creation. \nUpheaval is a company created by the fans, for the fans, developing one highly-demanded title - StarCraft Universe.\nUpheaval has been developing StarCraft Universe for over two years with no funding whatsoever, donating their time and effort to its development with no monetary reward. All developers on the project have had to return to work their normal day jobs, dramatically hindering the progression of the project due to its time intensive requirements.\nAfter releasing the StarCraft Universe Beta Prologue: Chronicles of Fate to the public, we're hoping to receive backing from the awesome StarCraft community to push our project forward and expand the team with sufficient funds to expedite the development process. With your help, we'll have the time, motivation, and resources we need to put that fresh looking AAA polish on SCU and get it out to you faster, better, and sexier.\nDeveloping SCU is just as complex and time consuming as developing a stand-alone. Remember we've had to build a brand new engine on top of the StarCraft II engine for this to work.  \n\nPrimarily, the money will be spent on the lead developers so we can produce the mod full-time just like a job. Split among us, we are taking a VERY small amount of money for basic living expenses over the next year of production. Remember that 80,000 quickly becomes 72,000 after Kickstarter and Amazon take their share, and then there's a 26% income tax on top of that. We also have to pay our voice actors, pay for software, hardware, our musical composer, and the list goes on. \nModding isn't anything like it used to be. People's standards are VERY high now, and to produce something of quality takes significant time, energy, and sacrifice. \nCan I play a demo of the game before I decide to back it?\nYep! One of the great things about this project is that we already have so much done, you can test out a single-player beta version of the Prologue! Please note SCU is still in the Alpha stages of some elements of its development, but it's fully playable and still enjoyable!\nTo begin playing, just log into your StarCraft II client, click on the Arcade button, and search for Universe in the reach box! We should pop right up!\n\nIf you don't have the time to play through online, or haven't downloaded the StarCraft II: Starter Edition, you can check out this game-play video, or search \"StarCraft Universe\" on youtube to view some of the many player-uploaded videos and see their reactions.\nOK. That was pretty cool. So, if this funding is successful, how will Upheaval Arts release StarCraft Universe, and how will it sustain itself to provide additional content in the future?\nWe will release StarCraft Universe as a series of downloadable games over Battle.net that are FREE to play with the StarCraft II: Starter Edition.\nBecause of our limited Staff, the first chapter we plan on releasing will be a multi-player open beta to test the core system functionality, combat balance, and progression rates of SCU through a gauntlet of challenges. Kickstarter pending, we will release this open BETA in late 2013/Early 2014.\nOnce we feel that all of the game elements are stable, we'll begin developing additional campaign missions as episodic content, released as completed.\nUpheaval Arts believes that the Arcade which Blizzard is currently developing to support mod game sales will sustain our ability to provide content for players throughout StarCraft II's lifetime, but we need your help to continue until that point.\nWe have the talent, we have the drive, and we have the passion - Now all we need is your help.\nEn taro Adun!\nThis grid reflects the current bonuses and add-ons to the original offers. Things have only been added to each tier. Nothing has been removed.\nAll in-game rewards will be awarded once the first map of the initial stretch goal is finished. In order to receive the rewards, backers will be notified via their Kickstarter provided e-mail with additional instructions.\nRelic aspect overview\nA relic aspect is a special piece of gear which changes the way your character looks and what stats it focuses on building. The class you are logged in with when receiving rewards will effect what Relic Aspect you receive.\nJudicator's Warshield\nThe class you are logged in with when receiving rewards will effect what Weapon you receive.\nPets will be awarded in the form of an item which can be used to warp in the pet. Please note that pets do not take part in combat. \nPets from left to right: Automaton 2000, Artosilope and Baby Ursadon\nVehicles will be awarded in the form of an item which can be used to warp in the vehicle. \nArmored Personnel Carrier, SCV and Troop Transport\nTanker Truck\n\n\nSCV: The SCV is a single slot vehicle which has a channeled repair ability which can restore health on friendly or neutral mechanical units. \nTroop Transport: This vehicle has multiple player slots. The first player who enters the vehicle is the driver and has access to its abilities, such as \"Engine Overdrive\" which makes the Troop Transport move faster but consume more fuel. \nTanker Truck: The tanker truck is a slow but durable mountable single-slot vehicle able to both tow and re-fuel other vehicles. Warning! If a tanker truck is destroyed it will instantly kill the driver and deal massive damage to both friendly and enemy units in a large radius. Can be used as a bomb in this manner if executed properly.\nArmored Personnel Carrier: This huge vehicle has multiple player slots.

Players create and maintain a military force to defeat their opponents. Here is an example of StarCraft II gameplay.\nWhat's the difference between a standalone game and a mod? \nMost mods are like mini-games, but like StarCraft Universe, some are complete re-workings of the StarCraft II engine which make the game play completely differently than it was originally designed. These custom games are created using the map editing program included with StarCraft II and are published online through Battle.net.\nWill I need to own StarCraft II or its expansions to play this?\nNOPE! The StarCraft II: Starter Edition, which is FREE, is all you will need to play StarCraft Universe!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause we've already completed most of the core systems and functionality behind SCU, and we're permitted to use the endless assets provided by Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft II Editor, the risk factor is very low in our development.\n\nSome risks do include converting the RTS engine to run properly within a third-person RPG engine. Some players have experienced synchronization issues with the current camera systems and slight delay with input commands. This is an issue both Blizzard and Upheaval are aware of and working to remedy.\n\nThe biggest challenge we face is the time required to implement custom assets and script in content for players to explore, but with your monetary assistance we'll be able to eliminate many of the challenges of our lives, and focus on our work.\n\nIf delays in production do arise, backers will be notified of the issues via provided e-mail.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "StarCraft Universe AMA 8/20/2016", "update_content": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/4yqg8j/starcraft_universe_launches_in_a_week_ama_with/\n\nHey everyone!

They are standard engraved 16mm six sided numbered (or Fudge/FATE) dice, cast in zinc with an antiqued bronze finish, which, while probably not exactly like these prototypes, should be similar.\nWe also have Gearpunk dice available as seen above, though those are plastic Shapeways prototypes that I've dyed, painted and color shifted (on top), whereas these Tinker dice are metal Shapeways prototypes.  The Tinker designs and the Gearpunk designs will all be cast in solid metal for the final product.\nIt should also be noted that these dice are already available via Shapeways over in my shop, Tish Tosh Tesh Toys, which is where the dice in these photos are from.  I have them there in collector-ready form, singletons or pairs, ready to be printed.  They have been hollowed out to save cost, hence the holes in the corners, and they are still much more costly than they would be via this campaign's group order... but they exist.\nWe're trying to get a big group order together so everyone can get them in higher quality at a better price.  The final product will be solid, with no holes in the corners, coated with antiqued bronze, and will be cleaner.  Shapeways does fantastic work, but the nature of 3D printing simply leaves artifacts that a nicely moulded die won't have.  This does give them a certain character, though, which has its own charm, to be sure.\nWhy\nThere are plenty of custom dice out there. There are even a bunch of mechanical or steampunk styled custom dice. I've even designed some of them, the Gearpunk Dice over at Shapeways. So why make more? Well, dice are among the most affordable pieces of gaming art that can be made, at least if you can leverage the economy of scale and get a nice, big, juicy order to a manufacturer. Dice also are simply just fun little tactile toys.  Metal dice are somewhat less common as well, and these designs just seem to really work well in metal.\nI believe these designs to be unique and appealing, fitting with games that have a mechanical theme. I'd love to have some of these dice in my collection, and I'd love to get them to other people who might be interested as well. So, I'm bringing these designs to Kickstarter to see if we can put together a sufficiently sized order to make these Tinker Metal Dice happen at a good price point.\nWho\nI am T. Eshelman, or more frequently, just Tesh. I am a happily married father of four, technical artist and animator in the video game industry by day, game designer, artist and photographer in my hobby time. I fit the occasional blog post in as well, over at Tish Tosh Tesh. I love machinery and I love to see how it ages over time. I have a series of game components and games in mind that fit this Tinker theme, and this is one of the simplest, smallest piece of the puzzle. It's a good start to the larger experiment that is the Tinker world. Good machines are made of good parts, and I'm excited to see what we can build. Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to hearing from you as time goes on!\n\nRewards\nEach pledge tier has some mix of Tinker Dice, Gearpunk Dice or both.  You may mix and match in each design type, selecting from any of the unlocked designs for that type.  For example, an order of six Tinker Dice might consist of four Fudge/FATE Tinker Dice, and two numbered D6 Tinker Dice.  An order of 12 Gearpunk Dice might consist of a set of seven \"gamer dice\" (the D4, D6, D8, D10, D10decader, D12 and D20), a set of four Gearpunk Fudge Dice, and a spare D6 to make a neat pair with the other D6.\nIMPORTANT UPDATE:\nInternational shipping rates have been adjusted downward, I just can't change the pledge tier descriptions.  Please adjust as follows. I'm sorry there isn't a better way to do this (U.S. shipping is unchanged):\nIf you're pledging for 4 dice (of either type), please subtract $1 from the Canadian and international shipping I ask for in the pledge description\nIf you're pledging for 6 dice (of either type), please subtract $2 from the Canadian and international shipping I ask for in the pledge description\nIf you're pledging for 7 dice (the GEARPUNK GAMER tier), please subtract $3 from the Canadian and international shipping I ask for in the pledge description\nIf you're pledging for 9 dice (the NICE NINE DICE tier), please subtract $4 from the Canadian and international shipping I ask for in the pledge description\nIf you're pledging for 12 dice (of either type), please subtract $6 from the Canadian and international shipping I ask for in the pledge description\nThe newest pledge tiers, SEEING DOUBLE and 31 FLAVORS, are unaffected by this, as they have the new numbers for shipping baked in.\nAlso, as noted in the Twisted Metal update, we're teaming up with the Mechanika: Empires of Blood and Steam RPG campaign to offer a Tinker variant of their Fudge dice design, which will be available as one of the Tinker designs you may choose from.\nAlso, in addition to the Pentagear Fudge Tinker Die design being added to the design pool, we'll also give you an extra one of them as a bonus (not another Tinker Die pick, just one of these specifically) if you pledge at any level with six or more dice of either type, and if you back their campaign (at any level, noting that you'd need to be at $35 or more to get the exclusive serial adventure, too... which may or may not have a \"kill ten rats\" easter egg).\nPentagear Tinker Die Mockup!\nOf special note is the NICE NINE DICE tier.  It functions as the collector's tier, where you are guaranteed seven Gearpunk Dice picks and two Tinker Dice picks.  (Which you may use on any designs, as in the other tiers, but it's tailor made for one of each die design.)  We're also throwing one Pentagear Fudge Tinker Die into that tier (whether or not you back the Mechanika campaign), and we'll also add one Gearpunk Fudge die since we cleared through the $10,000 goal that unlocked that design.  Yes, that makes the tier very cost-effective.  We kinda like it that way.  (Note that alternate finishes for the dice do not count as new dice picks.  If you want one of each design and finish, that's going to be the SEEING DOUBLE or 31 FLAVORS tier, if we hit $18,000.)\nALSO, because we appreciate those of you have pledged for a dozen dice in either type and don't want to seem like we're just paying attention to the NICE NINE DICE tier, we're going to make those 12-dice tiers a Baker's Dozen (13 dice) now that we've hit $10,000.  I can't edit the pledge descriptions, but I'll make a note of this where I can, and we'll be sure to note it in the surveys at the end of the project.\nSince we've hit $11,000, each order will come with one (or more) of three types of bag:  Simple Cloth Bags, Mad Science Cloth Bags or Leather Bags.  Just let us know which you prefer when the final surveys come to you.\nCloth bags that have been through the Mad Science Lab will look something like this, though there's not much predictability to the processing.\nYou blasted the campaign through $11,000, so we'll order a big batch of these leather bags and upgrade everyone at no extra charge. (Though if you want up to 3 extra bags, those are available as Add Ons at a charge of $2 each.)\nColors will be random. You can request a color, and we'll try to get it to you, but we can't guarantee anything.\nStretch Goals \nWe've stretched significantly past the base goal in the time we've been running so far.  Many thanks, everyone!  As such, we've unlocked the Tinker Fudge design:\n...and we've unlocked all of the Gearpunk designs as well.\nHere is the plastic prototype set of these Gearpunk dice, dyed a dark brownish purple and painted with a bronze paint to catch the highlights.  Of course, once cast in metal, the corners will be filled in (these are also hollow Shapeways prototypes).\nHere's another beauty shot by a kind lady who printed them in black via Shapeways then did some painting on them:\nIt is important to note that the company I have lined up to do these weren't able to use my source 3D files, but I gave them the 2D art for the faces and plenty of photos of these prototypes and Shapeways renders, and they are confident they can match the shapes.  Since we are dealing with this sort of secondary setup, there's a bit of risk involved, that we may not get a precise translation, but I'm going to work hard with them to make sure that it's as close as possible.\nSpecifically, they are ready to make four sided dice (D4), six sided dice (D6), eight sided dice (D8), two kinds of ten sided dice (D10, D10 \"decader\"), twelve sided dice (D12), and the important twenty sided dice (D20).\nWe're getting them all in standard sizes (16mm for most, 20mm for the D12 and D20), so they should fit into most dice collections.\nThe Gearpunk dice do cost more to produce, so there are different pledge tiers for them, and there is an add-on system (see below) so you can get some of each type, since mixing and matching the Tinker dice and the Gearpunk dice would make for too many variables.\nThank you all again for your support thus far!  It's great to see these received as well as they have been, and I'm really looking forward to getting them made and shipped out to all of you!\nSince you all pushed the campaign to the lofty heights of $14,000, we're talking about a new stretch goal at $15,000, wherein we'll offer all but the Pentagear Fudge die in an alternate finish.  As yet, we're undecided on what finish that will be, so please go check out the poll at my blog, Tish Tosh Tesh, and let us know what second finish option you'd add to the antiquated bronze base:  a pure zinc finish or antiquated copper!  (Yes, these are photos of medallions, not dice, but they are from the production company, so should be at least relevant.)\nPoll over thisaway!\nKicking it Forward\nWe've also updated and decided to participate in the Kicking it Forward initiative.  There are a bunch of great projects out there, and this community is filled with awesome people.\nAdd-Ons\nSince we've introduced the Gearpunk designs, and the prices are necessarily different, we're using Add Ons to let you pick up some dice from the type other than your base pledge's contents. \nPlease note:  Just to keep things cleaner, you may only do each of these once on your pledge.  So, you could add on up to twelve (12) Tinker dice and seven (7) Gearpunk Dice and up to three (3) bags, if you felt so inclined, but no more.\nTo add TWO (2) Tinker Dice to your order (any mix of the three designs), please add $8 to your pledge.\nTo add FOUR (4) Tinker Dice to your order (any mix of the three designs), please add $16 to your pledge.\nTo add SIX (6) Tinker Dice to your order (any mix of the three designs), please add $24 to your pledge.\nTo add ONE (1) Gearpunk Die to your order (any of the available designs), please add $6 to your pledge.\nTo add TWO (2) Gearpunk Dice to your order (any of the available designs), please add $12 to your pledge.\nTo add FOUR (4) Gearpunk Dice to your order (any of the available designs), please add $24 to your pledge\nTo add ONE (1) Bag to your order (any available type), please add $2 to your pledge.\nTo add TWO (2) Bag to your order (any available type), please add $4 to your pledge.\nTo add THREE (3) Bags to your order (any available type), please add $6 to your pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe designs have been preapproved by the production companies, so there shouldn't be trouble there.

You\u2019ll have under your lead every single detail of war: logistics, equipment and diplomacy, which are as important as leadership and cold blood in battle. \nDo you enjoy strategy videogames like X-COM? The powerful machines from Mechwarrior? Sci-fi universes as we\u2019ve seen on Stargate? Black Talons gives you a bit from all of these, mixed up with real time tactics veterans in mind.\nYou will lead your forces from a battlecruiser where new troops and mechs can be recruited, trained and customized. As the commander of the company, you must decide which missions to accept, and carefully manage your reputation amongst all the existing factions.\nSquads and Mechs are persistent in Black Talons; you can choose and upgrade your own army the way you like it. The surviving units of each battle learn new skills and abilities, and will get more powerful with earned experience. Squads from other factions can also be recruited... if the company has previously gained their trust. And sniffing around the black market could also be a source of additional weapons and equipment for the battlecruiser. Build a powerful warship and become unstoppable! \nIt's the year 2179.\nHumankind has reached and conquered the stars long ago; alliances and nations are born on distant planets. But there are also new struggles on the horizon... \nThe United Space Federation tries to maintain order and negotiate peace with the Alliance of Free Worlds, formed by dozens of planets and star systems where warlords and governments rise to power.\nYou'll join the Black Talons, a mercenary company that have been hired by the Noctae Republic to do a simple job: help a small army mount an organized defense against an overwhelming invading force, the Tzanar Union. \nBut things quickly go sour. When Black Talons arrived in Genai, Noctae\u2019s homeland, the planet had already been overrun by Tzanar\u2019s forces. Noctae\u2019s remaining forces had scattered and retreated to the forests and wastelands. Black Talons find themselves stranded in an occupied star system and surrounded on all sides by enemy forces. What started as a simple contract is now a fight for survival. \nDo you have what it takes to prevail?\nThe Black Talons need to fight for their survival, standing against enemy armies and expanding their influence into new unexplored planets. The company need to manage both powerful units and strong allies ,which also can be recruited from other factions by doing contract missions. Missions allow you to earn money; as a commander, you decide wether to spent it on equipments, units or new recruitments from other factions.\nEvery mission or contract will have a different objective. For instance, capturing resources, destroying buildings or eliminating units, personnel rescue, infiltrations, ambushes... And keep in mind that units can't be used and killed like cannon fodder. Reinforcements can be called from the battlecruiser during the mission, but even these are limited to the available troops.\nYou will travel around different planets and various regions, chasing or evading your enemies, and facing rain, snow, fog... even ionstorms! Think fast and readapt your army in order to beat not only the enemy, but also the environment. \n\u25aa Persistent and customizable squads.\n\u25aa Deep campaign mode. The actions of the player directly affect the balance of power on the system. There is one main objective to achieve, but there\u2019s much more to do, and many different gaming experiences to discover.\n\u25aa Customizable Battlecruiser. The Battlecruiser serves as the base of operations, and can be customized with weapons or infrastructures that will boost the squad numbers, teleport soldiers or even bombard the battlefield.\n\u25aa Advanced Diplomacy System. Your reputation will affect your relations with the factions you encounter, allowing you to trade or forcing you to fight them.\n\u25aa Upgradeable and unique (per class) skill tree for all units.\n\u25aa 5 worlds with different environments and weather conditions that directly affect the battle: rain, fog, snow, ionstorms and more.\n\u25aa Different unit classes with specialized roles: Recon, Tactical, Assault, Support, Engineer. Each class can carry a different set of weapons and has its own abilities. \n\u25aa Powerful mechs can enter the battlefield with salvaged or bought equipment and weapons.\n\u25aa DRM-free for Windows, MAC and Linux versions\nThe Black Talons have infantry and mechanized units at their disposal. Infantry units fall into three categories: light, medium and heavy armored. Light armored squads are faster and stealthier and can perform specialized roles like recon or sniper units. Heavy armored squads are slower and less agile, but are able to carry heavy weapons like chainguns and laser cannons.\nInfantry squads can perform different roles depending on their armor type, each equipped with different gear, weapons and abilities: Scout, Tactical, Assault, Support, Engineer and Sniper. Allied factions can provide specialized troops with unique abilities; a great complement to the Black Talons unit.\nAnd don\u2019t forget about the icing on the cake: mechs. They vary in tonnage and hardpoints, and can be equipped and customized with the weapons available in the armory, ranging from laser and projectile cannons, large chainguns and missile launchers.\nThe funds will be used to cover the development expenses of the game, ensuring that we're able to keep our view on the design and vision of the game without outside interference. This means covering the expenses of programming, art (2D & 3D), production, audio and QA.\nThere\u2019s already been extensive work of pre-production, where we outlined and designed the whole project: graphical assets, timings, levels, gameplay mechanics \u2013 everything that is needed to successfully complete the game.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the funds will be used:\nThe biggest slice goes to programming and art \u2013 about 40% for each. This includes gameplay, game mechanics, AI, level design, concept art, unit design and software.\nWe intend to create an awesome soundtrack \u2013 epic, futuristic and action oriented. Music will make a difference bringing a scene alive, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re not overlooking. We\u2019re choosing not to use royalty free stock music, but instead, customized and unique themes.\nAnd there\u2019s something that we definitely don\u2019t want. And that is to rush production. That\u2019s why we reserve part of the funds for Quality Assurance. The game won\u2019t be released without intensive testing and bug fixing.\nBack in 2005, three friends tried to make a shoot 'em up game, just as part-time fun. It was released in 2006 and sold an astonishing amount of 5 copies.\nAlthough the game was a flop in terms of sales, the three friends decided that they wanted to make more games and pursue game development professionally and full time. They then made a second game and entered a game development contest in Portugal, winning the \"best game\" and the \"best visual art\" category. \nThe three friends were the founders of Camel 101. \nSince then they've learned a lot and worked on a multitude of platforms ranging from PC, to mobile and consoles, releasing a number of successful titles over the years - starting with casual games - but eventually shifted their focus to strategy & wargaming, which is their true passion. \nThey're now using all that passion, knowledge and experience acquired over the years to create a fun, powerful and entertaining wargame that you'll hopefully enjoy.\nRight now you\u2019re probably thinking. Who are these guys?\nWell, come and meet the team!\nBruno is the tech and engine expert. He\u2019s like these guys in the matrix that look at something and see strange codes passing on the screen. He handles most of the coding.\nBoris is the graphics wizard. 3D art and vfx are his specialties. Don\u2019t mess with him or he\u2019ll make a photorealistic image of a pig with your face. Most of the 3D art in the game is made by him. \nRicardo is a software engineer, but it\u2019s said that he mostly bugs the team with deadlines and strange charts that only he understands.\nObviously we can\u2019t make such a game just by ourselves. We also work with several artists through outsourcing.

When a wealthy and eccentric noblewoman from British Hong Kong named, Lady Cushing, hires the father/daughter duo, they are instantly thrust into a world of intrigue, lies, danger and excitement in which the balance of worldly power rests unaware, alternately in both the calloused hands of Sho Tinker and the gloved hands of Lady Cushing.\n1st Season Overview\nThe wealthy and eccentric adventure-seeker, Lady Cushing, attempts to complete the life\u2019s work of her late father and older brothers, with the help of a well-known father and daughter team of inventors called, the Tinkers. \nBy engaging the services of this world-famous duo, Lady Cushing hopes to build an unprecedented device from a set of incomplete plans created by her father 15 years earlier. The \u2018contraption,\u2019 as she calls it, is supposed to provide sustainable energy and is to be demonstrated at what will surely be a triumphant presentation at the 1899 World Exposition in Paris. If successful, this device will provide cheap and abundant power to the general public and likely change the world, but this innovation threatens the status quo and for that there are repercussions.\nWord of this device has even caught the attention of renowned inventors and energy pioneers, Nicola Tesla, Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse, as well as cutthroat businessman and financier, J.P. Morgan. The corrupt energy utilities of Western America, most notably the Ministry of Water & Power and the Gasworks, have each dispatched their agents in an effort to thwart the Tinkers and Lady Cushing.\nHer well-equipped entourage, lead by the courageous Captain Alexandra Victoria Brian Pelham, intervenes but Lord Blackwelder has a plan to maintain his dictatorship over the American nation\u2019s valuable and extensive power resources. With an energy war on the verge of erupting, an additional obstacle surfaces, provided courtesy of the notorious masked criminal, Jawbreaker, who runs interference at all parties, by playing both sides in this emerging battle for power and the wealth that typically accompanies it.\nNow when you say \u2018Web Series\u2026\nThe Web Series is planned to consist of 14 first-season \u2018Webisodes\u2019. \nTINKER aims to expand the boundaries of Steampunk science fiction by further transforming it from what many know as just an aesthetic to evolving it into a multi-ethnic, culture- exploring, collection of stories that does for Steampunk what Star Trek did for science fiction back in the sixties. \nConcept Art by Johnnie Quan\nThis includes: mature themes, exotic locations, sub-plots, drama and action, always making the effort to keep true to the 'punk' in Steampunk by going outside currently established 'rules' of the genre, and fusing the diverse talents of several industries into a new kind of steam-powered animal. Even if you don't actively follow the subculture of Steampunk, there is still something here for you.\nHerzhaft 7ft Giant Robot\nSTEAMPUNK PARTNERS plans to distribute the show initially on the Web. The episodes would be available on both the TINKER Web site: www.TinkerSteampunkSeries.com as well as on Vimeo.

The music will be as diverse as the Tinker's travels taking the audience on journey's of beauty, adventure, classical, the darkness of a corrupt system, and of course just plain fun! As this Kickstarter is for the Pilot. The remaining music of TINKER and the soundtrack will be funded by a PledgeMusic campaign following our Kickstarter campaign. A double disk featuring the original score on disk 1 and bands tracks on disk 2. Our bands are steampunk themed, or steampunk fans themselves that want you to hear their vision of our steampunk inspired world.\nFeatured in our Kickstarter fundraising videos are: \nThe Anix \n3 Piece from Southern California known for their sonically massive choruses, and constrained electronic verses. Inspired mainly by film rather than music. \nBirdeatsbaby \nOrchestral rock quartet from Brighton/London, UK. Birdeatsbaby are far from your average rock band. Incorporating a varied collection of influences, the band combine piano-lead power-pop with orchestral and melodic rock, resulting in something that sounds hauntingly original and delicate.\nOther Artist's on board Tinker are:\nGood Co, Violet, Savi0r, Chamber of Echoes, Arcane Dimension, Psyche Corporation, Marquis of Vaudeville, Shovelman, Arthur A. Belekonov.\nMore to be announced!\nWardrobe\nSome of the wardrobe, jewelry & accessories in TINKER will be by: Generations of Art, The Blonde Swan, Steampunk Obscura, Nonconformity, Dr. Brassy Steamington, Kelly's Heroes, Wonderland Corsets, and Silver Leaf Costumes.\nThe Pitch Video\nThe content of the pitch video does not reflect the final production value and feel that will be TINKER. McCune Design & Mr. Hardberger will become involved in TINKER once it has reached it's funding goal.  It is a conceptual pitch video of minimal budget featuring costumes provided by some of the cast. The majority of wardrobe will be completed after the completion of our Kickstarter, to finally begin this ambitious projects world creating.\nNarration by Shelley Avellino, and Tommy Mack. \nAdditional music by www.pacdv.com/sounds\nKeane played by Tommy Mack, Lady Cushing played by Tabitha Marsden. / Herzhaft Giant Robot developmental stage\nWhere will your hard earned money be going, and why do we need your support?\nSome of you might be thinking we have talent involved that has worked on big movies why do we need your money, we must be rich right? While we wish we were rich, we aren't. As evidence that this is our 3rd attempt at crowdfunding. Times are tough for creatives, and those big names don't come free, no matter how much they love our project. \nOur goal of $20,000.00 will cover: Pre-production, Production, Sound, Musical Score, Inicial Original Music for the Soundtrack, Wardrobe, Props, Sets, and all other essentials to create our Pilot. Without your support TINKER will develop at a crawl.  \nPre-production\nIf we raise funds beyond our goal, then the next expense is the all important Marketing. After that will come more production value on the pilot, then the next priority will be the episodes planned for the first season, and even more production value by bolstering the current budget in all areas, all only possible with your support!\nBare minimum once we have our high quality Pilot other opportunities to sustain, and continue the series will be available to us. Aside from the soundtrack, it is our preference to not rely on crowdfunding after this initial kick start. We will try our best to utilize alternatives, or in the least greatly reduce the funding we need from future crowdfunding until the series develops a strong following.\nWe support the http://kickingitforward.org/ movement!\nRewards!!\nMore rewards viewable & larger images ->HERE<-\nChoose your flavor of the TINKER Pilot: \nHD Digital Download, DVD, Blue-Ray DVD Combo, or the Deluxe Collector's Edition Blu-\u00adRay / DVD Combo!

We'll ask about additional names in the reward survey. If you have questions, feel free to message me. \nThe HPLFF started almost 20 years ago in Portland, Oregon by Andrew Migliore. After years of attending and contributing, filmmaker Aaron Vanek went insane and spawned an HPLFF in his hometown of Los Angeles. This is a licensed franchise of the Portland fest, but each festival has its own distinct brand of madness. \nThe first three LA festivals were successes but paid for out of pocket and just missed breaking even each time. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide the same excitement and entertainment this year without your help. Our savings are drained so without YOU we'll be hard pressed to maintain and improve the quality this independently run horror and weird tale film festival has had in the past. \nEaten Last - Thank you!

Joshi (editor) and Steven Gilberts (illustrator) - With eight psychotropic visions of damnation and transformation in the urban coral reef of San Francisco, COPPING SQUID forms a mosaic of otherworldly menace shot through with glimpses of awe-inspiring majesty: of invisible outsiders and self-medicating seekers whose desperate prayers and hidden rituals lead them to behold their alien reflections in the all-seeing eyes of the secret masters of creation. \nThe Womb of Time by Brian Stableford (author), S.T. Joshi (editor) Cyril van der Haegen (illustrator) - From Britain's master of the fantastic comes a pair of insidious new novellas that combine the pulp existentialism of the Cthulhu Mythos with a counterfeiter's eye for masterful literary forgery. \nTHE WOMB OF TIME: The rustic English village of Dunwich is slowly crumbling into the sea, but a rare tidal event promises to roll back the waves and reveal ancient ruins, buried treasures and the lost true crown of England. Three scholarly pilgrims have come to Dunwich for their own secret reasons, but as they gather at The Hidden Crown, the mysteries that summoned them begin to take on a life of their own, and the seashore offers a brief but shattering glimpse of the ultimate Other. Dreams and debates intertwine with nameless, sentient dread to form a daring deconstruction of the meaning and menace of Cthulhu.\nTHE LEGACY OF ERICH ZANN: Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast, but in the wrong hands, it can open doors to spheres of infinite evil. When a murderer stalks the streets of Paris on the trail of Erich Zann, only Europe's greatest criminal investigator, Auguste Dupin, can hope to foil an insane scheme to take up where the mad violinist left off. With deft craftsmanship that transcends pastiche, Stableford introduces a brilliant reincarnation of Poe's seminal detective to the cosmic irrationality of Lovecraft's Mythos, with explosive results.\nRadiant Dawn and Ravenous Dusk two novels by Cody Goodfellow - \nTHE BEGINNING IS NEAR - From a ruined chemical weapons bunker in Iraq to a shallow grave in California's San Andreas Fault, the lines are drawn for a shadow war that will decide who, or what, will inherit the earth and reign as the next dominant species.\nThe Electric Eye, Copping Squid, The Womb of Time, Radiant Dawn and Ravenous Dusk are all courtesy of Perilous Press\nStrange Aeons & Morbid Adventures - A miniature skirmish game of Eldritch horror: The aim of a miniature skirmish game is to enact battles between two opponents on a tabletop. In the case of Strange Aeons, one player takes control of a band of heroic Threshold operatives and the other player acts as the evil Lurkers.

Lovecraft Film Festival & CthulhuCon - Los Angeles"}}, {"backer": "Mark Taormino", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "For the Love of Pie and Pi\nEver since I learned the formula to find the circumference of a circle, I have longed for the day to create a Pi shaped pie. After talking with many Pi enthusiasts, it seems that they have had that same desire. The goal of this project is to help geeky cooks around the world celebrate March 14th in style.\nNow some people have indeed created Pi shaped silicone baking molds, but this product has fallen short. For starters, you can't even bake a pie in a silicone mold, so what's the point? Also, if you do make a cake, when you flip it over and someone takes a slice, you are left with this amoeba looking form that makes no sense to the poor guy at the back of the cake line.\nBrownies are exceptionally tasty in Pi Pie Pans because you get tons of crunchy edges.\nWe made this first run of Pi Pie Pans to solve this problem, giving the ability to make a perfectly baked Pi shaped pie to the world for the very first time. Furthermore, because you serve the pie from the tin, even the last guy to get a slice can still can get the joke and realize that you are the geekiest person in the office. It turns out that the Pi Pie Pans bake great, and not just for pies. Brownies and cornbread are awesome because of all the edges that you get.\nThis is what our Pi Pie Pans look like without any yummy filling.\nDesigning Pi Pie Pans, 2010 to 2012\nIn 2010 I had left my company to try to start a software business. While this ultimately never was able to take flight, I found myself incredibly creative at this time, working on different iPhone apps, blogging as well as coming up with different ideas for products. Being a food blogger and a bit of a math geek, I thought it would be spectacular to create a Pi shaped pie pan when my preliminary search yielded no product in the market. I dusted off my Autodesk Inventor skills and drew up some preliminary CAD drawings to show to friends.\nOne of the first designs of the Pi Pie Pans in 2010 - pretty crude, huh?\nThe feedback I had received was positive - people just couldn't believe that there was not a Pi shaped pie pan. Unfortunately, the project would stall for the next couple of years as I had to re-emerge into the workforce (man cannot live on hotdogs and potatoes alone) and just didn't have the time, or know-how, to manufacture an item.\nAnother prototype design of the Pi Pie Pans in 2010.\nThis all changed in the spring of 2012. One of my friends from middle school, Philip Butler, remembered the concept for the Pi Pie Pans. Philip believed in the idea and worked with a classmate and friend of his at MIT, Chris Possinger, to get the pan designed up to the correct specs needed to manufacture it.\nPi Pie Pans prototyping in 2012 - the pan begins to take shape!\nWe went through several molds in the summer of 2012 and ultimately got our first prototype in the fall of 2012. \nSome of the molds that were made in the evolution of our Pi Pie Pans.\nAfter that time we worked with the manufacturer and received our first small run of finalized product in the first half of 2013.\nGetting back one of the first functioning prototypes of Pi Pie Pans.\nNot Pie-in-the-Sky, Our Team Can Get It Done\nOur team is led by an individual with a strong order fulfillment experience. Philip runs a distribution business that ships products all over the world. He has a keen understanding in the shipping challenges and has set up a system to rapidly pick, pack and ship products to the end consumers, perfecting this in his business for the past three years.\nCornbread made in Pi Pie Pans turns out well too - I like mine with jalape\u00f1os.\nChris has a background in mechanical engineering, material sciences and manufacturing. He has been the interface with the manufacturer overseas to ensure that the mold and fabrication of our pans fulfilled our vision. Through his efforts, we were able to produce an manufacturing die to shape the pans in the summer of 2012, our first prototypes in the fall of 2012 and our initial small run in the first half of 2013. We did a small run of pans and have full confidence that our manufacturer can handle additional subsequent requests on a longer run. If, however, this project was to explode (which we hope it does), we would be interested in exploring further options to decrease lead times in order to get our product out to our bakers.\nIn addition to having a background in Industrial Engineering, logistics and marketing, I love to eat pie.\n\nWith the Pi Pie Pans team, experience and current manufacturing provider, we foresee no problem with satisfying our backers needs for the Pi shaped pie pan.\nDon't you want a cherry pie like this? Please back our project today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe made an initial run of several hundred Pi Pie Pans, which took a little bit of time. One risk is that our current supplier couldn't meet the demand if this project absolutely exploded (which, of course, we hope it does!).

However, we have recently had some reports of pans becoming discolored after being washed in a dishwasher. This problem is not unique to the Pi Pie Pan: search for \"aluminum dishwasher discoloration\" and you'll find all sorts of horror stories. It seems that in 2010 a new EPA regulation forced the removal of phosphates from dishwasher detergent [ ], and the new detergents have a different mix of chemicals that can oxidize and discolor aluminum. This discoloration is cosmetic, and the aluminum of the pan is non-toxic, but we understand that these pans are also decorative items, so we wanted to send out a warning and recommend that people NOT wash their pans in the dishwasher."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Pi Day 2014! #PiPiePan", "update_content": "Happy Pi Day Eve Kickstarter Backers!\nI hope that everyone is excited about the big day!

Thank you all so much! If you're in the San Francisco area, please join me in celebrating the completion of funding this evening!\nSee the collection as I scan it on Tumblr\nMore information at WalterKoessler.com\nI have a hundred page photo album with nearly a thousand photos my great-grandfather Walter Koessler took in World War I. It's in pristine condition, beautifully preserved by my family over the last hundred years in Southern California. They've even saved the negatives\u2013 untouched, crisp and unfaded \u2013and a box of stereographs from the war and the early 1900s.\nThis album is a real treasure. Trained as an architect and conscripted into the German Army directly from the classroom, Walter became an officer in the reserve artillery battalion and he took advantage of many unique opportunities to record his experience on film. He captured the haunting experience of building and living in the trenches, the sunlight pouring in through the broken windows of bombed churches, and the clouds through the wings of biplanes as an early aerial reconnaissance photographer. After moving to Los Angeles to work as an art director in films, Walter made this album. The story the book tells begins with a pack of young men playing at war and ends with their crushing realization of what war really means.\nThese photos have captivated me for nearly two years, even after paging through them hundreds of times. It's an unbelievable, rare and intimate story, a deep look into the first world war you can't find anywhere else.\nThe images deserve to be seen and appreciated in the context of their whole story. They're compelling on a digital screen, but having spent many hours with the originals, they are significantly better on the pages of a book you can explore as a physical object. If I can find enough supporters and meet a minimum order requirement for this ambitious project, I will create a book from this album at its original size with my notes in the margins so you can have this full experience with history too.\nSaint Quentin Cathedral, August 1917 (Walter Koessler) - October 2012 (Dean Putney)\n\"When Dean first shared this discovery with me, I knew he'd found a rare family history treasure \u2014 but I don't think I, or he, or anyone realized at first what a treasure of shared world history this collection would turn out to be. It's such an amazing story: a time capsule from an ancestor, finding its way to the hands of a young man who works in the digital world. I'm glad Dean is able to preserve it, and I'm happy to see it shared with the world.\" - Xeni Jardin, Boing Boing\nAs seen in:\nWhat I'm doing\nI want you to experience this part of our shared history. I've done a lot of research about the photos in this book and Walter's journey. I even went to France to attempt recreating the photo above. This project means a lot to me and I've spent a lot of time working on it.\nMy goal is to scan and archive each image in the book, make an annotated version of it in its full form, and share that with all of you. I've already begun this process by posting some of the pages and their photos on Tumblr. I also want to print these images in a book roughly the size of the original, with space for my notes and closeups in the margins so I can share my research.\nDigital images are neat because they don't take up space, you can zoom in closer than the eye can see, and they are easy to share. But the images in this book belong together, not separated or in a mishmash online. They deserved to be printed, held and spent time with. They're a priceless, rare look into forgotten age that you'll come back to again and again.\nThe book itself will be available in high resolution PDF form and as a high-quality offset printed, casebound 11\"x17\" coffee table book. I've rejected vanity press for this project because it's absurdly expensive at nearly $1 per page, and it greatly limits the sizes at which you can print. Each book would cost over $150 and the quality would not be worthy of Walter's work. I've begun researching the best ways to do photo printing, found a printer, priced it, checked paper samples, and begun laying out the book. These are going to be really beautiful prints, with a fold out page in the back for the large aerial panorama. A collector's item for sure and much higher quality than a vanity press could deliver. Here's a blank copy of the book's actual materials, this is the size and format I'm making it at:\nI need supporters to help me approach a 1000 copy minimum order quantity so I can move forward. When ordering a book from the non-early bird levels, you'll also receive a print from one of the book's photos.\nI'd also love to get people following along as I scan images so they can spot things I wouldn't normally see and share their expertise. The Internet has been invaluable in identifying military equipment, locations, people and much more. For backers $25 and above, you'll receive access to high resolution images of prints and negatives as I scan them so you can see my progress and pitch in if you'd like. Definitely get in on at least on this level, this stuff will knock your socks off.\nThe goal here is to have rewards dated for December 2013 in your hands before Christmas. I cannot guarantee that will happen (see Risks and Challenges section), but if I meet my funding goal I will do everything I can to meet this goal.\nI hope that this project will make you consider the stories in your life. How do you create and record new ones? How do you review the ones you've already made? How do you preserve the stories from your family? Go make those stories something you can share, can't ignore or forget, and want to spend more time with.\nHigh level rewards\nFor those of you particularly interested in early 20th century photography, military history or World War I specifically, I have some very special rewards for larger backers.\nStereoscopic View-Master\nWalter took fifty nine stereoscopic photos throughout the war. These show military equipment, biplanes, and possibly a crucifixion in 3D when seen through the proper viewer. I'm planning to make classic View-Masters and reels of the best ones to make viewing these images easy and fun! You'll also receive digital versions of the stereograms in anaglyph magenta/cyan and side-by-side formats. I'm expecting to be able to include four reels of six images for each backer here, but I may be able to make more if there are enough backers at this level. Here's an example of one of the 3D photos as an animated GIF:\nTriptychs or panorama\nThese photos are incredibly detailed, and as I've been scanning the prints and negatives I've found nuances and hidden bits you can't see in a small image. Walter took photos that tell stories, and I'm curating a few triptychs for this. These may change in the future as I find more negatives, but here are some mockups of possibilities. You'll receive options from me if you back at this level.\nTrenches\nChurches\nThe back of the book will include a fold out copy of this aerial panorama Walter took, with annotations of trench and front positions. This reward level will have an option to receive a print of this panorama instead of a triptych. The book board will be removed in this image.\nPrints from the original negatives\nI've started experimenting with printing photos in the darkroom using traditional photo enlarging and processing techniques from the original negatives I have, and the results so far are exciting. \nAs I work with these images, get better and larger paper, and learn more about enlarging them, these photographs are only going to bring you closer to the day they were shot. Walter's negatives are pristine and clear, and he took many wonderful photos. Printed large, they show details you just can't see with the naked eye.\nI won't be making many prints. The negatives are nearly a hundred years old now, and I'd really like to put them back in storage. But for the few of you who want a beautiful and rare art print from the original negative, this is a great opportunity to get one made for you. Few people have negatives from this era, and I doubt anyone besides me is crazy enough to actually print from them now. Sizes to be determined, but at least 8x10, and I will provide a series of images for you to choose from.\nVisit from me, showing of all the materials, and discussion\nI want to make these photos available for the hardcore enthusiasts to see first hand. It's so much fun sharing the story and images with people, and I could talk all day to the ones who are most interested. So let's do that.\nAt the highest tier, I'll fly out to your gallery, museum, club or organization with all the materials I have. We can spend a day discussing them and going through everything. I've limited this to five so that I can prevent undue stress on the album and materials, but I've priced it relatively low so that small but determined clubs still have a chance of organizing a meeting. Can't wait to meet you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter. It's been a long time in the making because I believe this is a deeply important thing to share and share right. Here are some points I expect may present challenges and how I intend to reduce the risk behind them.\n\nI have never written or published a complete book before. Fortunately I am getting excellent advice from print designers and publishers who do this regularly. Since I work for major online publishers (boingboing.net, Kevin Kelly and others), many of my friends have made books and print products before, and the printer I've chosen comes highly recommended by the publisher of Coilhouse Magazine, so I'm confident that I'm in good hands. I've already begun the layout of the book, received financial quotes and checked paper samples. I've set out a timeline from now until I plan to ship, and I'm ready to commit to it. I've given myself a substantial time buffer between each stage of the process to prepare for things going wrong.\n\nI expect shipping physical product to have some unforeseen hangups. I have first-hand experience in seeing this done, but I have not done it myself. I've consulted with experts in retail shipping to make sure my timeline and goals are reasonable. International shipping is particularly risky and troublesome, but I've already begun pricing it out and preparing for it. I am hiring help with packing and shipping once the books arrive to make sure this goes smoothly.\n\nPrinting large numbers of photos is new to me. I've priced this out, done test prints, and begun learning more about printing from negatives. I've got experience printing high quality photographs, and I've connected with SF Photoworks to print the reward images. I've done test prints at RayKo Photo and I'll be working with them to create the best traditionally processed prints from the negatives I can. I've been working with photos for years, but I've never printed them in large quantities, so this is an area I'm actively learning more about to get the best results.\n\nAlthough unexpected production challenges will undoubtedly arise, I've spent a year and a half and plenty of my own money on this already, and I will not give up until you get your rewards. I look forward to you joining me in reliving history through First Lt. Walter Koessler's photo journal of World War I.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "From Grandma's closet to the museum walls!", "update_content": "Dear friends,\nJust about all rewards have been shipped to backers!

Here is how it will unfold:\n150K Let's Bring In The Team\nHere is where we can really begin to play. Hitting the 150K mark will fund additional episodes featuring our spectacular website columnists like John Ary, Eric \"Quint\" Vespe, Glen \"Merrick\" Oliver and more, more, more! We will dig into the glorious insights and secrets hiding out in the darkest reaches of their brains, and include live talk back with the studio audience; all within a new set built especially for this level of interaction, a true, \"Cinematic Playground\" if you will. It will be wild, uncharted, unmanageable and not to be missed!\n200K Beyond The Studio\nHitting the 200K mark will fund an additional batch of episodes that feature people who just can't get down to the Austin studio; so the crew will go to them! We have so many opportunities in this category that that it could develop into a feeding frenzy! So we'll be using your feedback via Twitter polls to sort through them and prioritize. We plan to go wherever this takes us!\n250K AIC Special Event Episodes\nHitting the 250K mark will allow us to expand the reach of the Ain't It Cool with Harry Knowles studio to create a special event with the Alamo Drafthouse and the Austin Film Society that I have long dreamed about doing: a large capacity, affordable classic movie event that includes the actors, filmmakers and craftspeople who made it happen. The resulting live interviews, footage of the events and the in-studio interviews would be integrated into an extended length bonus episode that fully explores this great talent! \n300k The Big Enchilada Meets Crepes\nDreaming big comes naturally to me, especially when it involves what I can do to please our Ain't It Cool community. With another 50K, we'd take our homemade green chili enchiladas to Cannes, or Sundance or Toronto or SITGES or ComicCon, exact festival to be determined by YOU by TwitPoll, and capture those moments of insight and pre-news-break scuttle on what's coming for the coming year. Even at 50k, it won't buy us any yacht time, but hey, we've got the best enchiladas! Plus, we're resourceful... The people who matter to us most will respect that! From this we will create one or more bonus episodes and make them available to the entire community before anyone else gets to see them! But you won't have to wait that long to reap the benefits as we will be sending out enough live time updates, clips, mini videos and pics to make you feel like you are right there with us!\nWhat Happens If We Go All Veronica Mars?\nUhhhhhh... I guess we'll throw one hell of a wrap party! \nAnd then let's aim for the moon!!! Instead of being limited by impossibly small budgets that have us perpetually robbing Peter to pay Paul, the realm of a serious 300K+ budget would put us in the position of acquiring a multiple year lease and customizing the studio as a full on production hive for our own projects and many others! With a permanent studio home, we could go far: help foster new filmmakers, help other kickstarter projects take off and teach multiple generations about the breadth and scope of cinematic cool! I would really love to help continue to make Austin shine for film events; the more resources that come together, the bigger and better this whole cool thing is gonna get! For example, hiring additional crew and studio help and growing the talent pool for gonzo cinema journalism and imagination. Plus, including other collectors with film history in their possession to join us and give magical life to those objects! \nThe Martini Shot\nMy crew and I want to thank all of you for being a part of our crazy dream at whatever level you can handle. We know firsthand how much  dedication and sacrifice it takes to support a career in the arts and recognize that most of you have your own projects for which you are also pursuing funding. We have bootstrapped it, paid it forward and dumpster-dived with the best of you and we hope that you will see the potential for the Ain't It Cool with Harry Knowles studio and show to serve all of us who so passionately believe in the transformative power of storytelling though the film arts!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks? Challenges? For those of us who have spent years as a part of the Ain't It Cool News community, this is a no brainer. Me, my director Brett Hart, my production designer Suzette Soucie and my entire crew are on board for Season 2. We completed 30, yes 30 episodes for Season 1 in 7 months, using a format we invented on the spot. This inaugural season earned us an International Academy of Web Television nomination, accolades from film luminaries such as William Friedkin, and best of all, the delight of our fans. \n\nEven with the new features we're including for Season 2, delivery is a sure thing. And to keep the guest lineup filled with multiple options for this season and beyond, we have brought on casting director Jaime Gallagher, incredibly well connected in Los Angeles and currently casting the next Coatwolf Productions feature film. \n\nFor those of you who are new to our little party, you are in for a wild ride with the Ain't It Cool News community. I founded Ain't It Cool News in 1996 and worked tirelessly to grow it into the film fandom powerhouse of today. Our community is made up of the most passionate fans of the art of film based storytelling, and I usually feel like the most enthusiastic one of all. Between myself and my co-writers at Ain't It Cool News, we view, review, analyze, and discuss more films than we can count. And then we do it again! We care about film history, film futures, the indie industry, the studio industry, the stories behind the movies, the stories behind the stories! And so do the almost 1 million visitors who are on our site daily. If you have ever loved a film, hated a film, wanted to make a film, or are a filmmaker already, then you are one of us.

After each game, players are hungry to play again with a new captain and to try their hand at a new strategy or play style.\nComponents List\n20 Captain Cards\n40 Bounty Cards\n40 Port Cards\n60 Cargo Cards\n60 assorted coins\n6 coin bags\n1 white and 2 red dice\n6 Colored Ship Pieces\n1 Map Game Board\n6 Ship Tracking Boards\n30 assorted track markers\n1 Wind Marker\n\nGameplay\nThis game was meticulously designed to be fun for both new initiates and seasoned players. We love playing board games. We also have a very large group of friends with diverse interests. Our challenge was to create a game that could be enjoyed by anyone who we wished to play the game with. The result is a game that has been enjoyed by children, teenagers, adults, and grandparents. The game takes a relatively short amount of time to explain (even to non-board game players), yet allows for deep strategy and rewards adaptive foresight.\nBy supporting this project, you will allow us to finalize the production of a game which we have been playing for over a year and a half. Our prototype game is a blast, but we would love to bring the production in line with other games you may already own. It is our belief that Privateer deserves a spot on anyone's gaming shelf, or can be the first game to start one!\nShipping\nPrivateer will retail for $50. On Kickstarter we are offering the game for $45, which includes shipping in the US (a significant savings.) For backers in other countries, there are some increased costs for shipping:\nCanada: Add $10 to your pledge total (down from $20!)\nEU: Add $10 to your pledge total (down from $20!) *Remember, you may also be responsible for VAT*\nEverywhere else: Add $20 to your pledge total\nThe object of the game of Privateer is to be the first captain to amass a total of 20 \"Infamy\" points. Infamy is a measure of how fearsome, clever, and skilled your captain has become throughout the entirety of the game. Infamy can be gained through upgrades to your captain's ship or through the accumulation of powerful and rare Relic cards.\nEverything in Privateer is based off of your captain's upgrades. Upgrades can be purchased in any of the game's four unique tracks, which are detailed as follows:\nSails: This track determines how quickly your captain's ship can sail between ports. A higher sails score allows you to visit ports more frequently, catch and attack other ships, or even outrun other ships altogether. \nCrew: This track governs your captain's influence. Throughout the game there are a large number of events which may transpire during play (called Fortunes). When a Fortune occurs, captains with a high crew score often receive larger benefits than captains with a lower score. For instance, during the Parley Fortune, each captain rolls a six-sided die and adds the result to their total crew score. The captain with the highest total roll may receive a free upgrade to any of their four tracks!\nCannons: Upgrades to this track will allow your captain to best other ships in combat. This track is essential if you wish to plunder cargo from other ships or if you want to ensure that your own cargo will not be plundered by other aggressive captains. A captain with a low Cannons score can often fall prey to continuous attacks from greedy captains with an eye out for easy plunder.\nHold: This track affects a captain's ability to store cargo. Simply put, the higher a captain's Hold score, the higher the number of goods he or she can carry and trade at a time. This is often a very important track for merchants, or even for pirates who often plunder large amounts of cargo at one time. What is the use in plundering cargo if you have nowhere to store all of your hard earned booty?\n\n\nAll of Privateer's captains are wholly unique, and have special abilities that increase a player's ability to utilize different track upgrades. You will often want to play to your captain's strengths in order to ensure victory. Often, however, a player may choose to play their captain in an alternate way depending on the way the game is transpiring. There is no wrong road to victory!\nIf you like your project, please consider backing us and sporting this nifty backer avatar:\nBacker Avatar\nTo add the avatar, Right click the above image, select \"Save As\", and save the image on your computer. You can changed your avatar on Kickstarter by clicking on Me -> Edit Settings -> Picture.\n Our goal on Kickstarter is to fund our project to a total of $25,000. We arrived at this figure by approaching many different game manufacturers and calculating costs, as detailed below:\nOne-time costs: These include costs for creating molds, developing artwork, and ensuring our legal compliance.\nProduction costs: These costs include the per-unit cost to produce and ship one game of Privateer.\n\nWe believe very strongly in this game, and we have brought the total funding goal lower than what we believe is necessary by investing a good portion of our own money to cover production costs. As such, we don't want to just successfully fund this project, we want to see this game in as many homes as possible! In order to ensure the quality of the game reflects the interest of our backers, we would like to offer the following additional rewards for all backers who will receive a copy of the game. Each Stretch Goal will be unlocked when the total funded amount reaches the amount detailed on each rung of the boards, as detailed below:\nEnsignia Games is a small game company consisting of Rick Barnes, Braven Carver, and Zackariah Schuster. Originally we were just three friends who all loved playing Privateer, but after exploring our options and then realizing how talented each of us were in our own rights, we decide to take a risk and develop our own company.\nEverything produced so far has been done through our own hard work and through the charity of a lot of great friends and family. We are unbelievably lucky to have access to such a huge network of immensely skilled videographers, artists, marketers, CEOs, designers, and even fellow game developers. \nA huge thank you to Robert Bagby, who has helped mentor us every step of the way. None of this would have been possible without your help, Bob.\nA big thanks to all of our family and friends, especially Judy Secor and Dawn Schuster, who convinced us to make this project a reality.\nAlso, a shout-out to Bill Trammel (of Catan Boards fame) for the early Kickstarter help and to r/boardgames on Reddit.

I would love for games to be in backer's hands before the holiday season, and artwork will be the one element that could have the potential to postpone that goal. \n\nAs such, a great amount of our resources will be spent in art creation.

The dungeons change each playthrough and always offer new situations to handle. Crypt Run presents combat, exploration, and collection in a playful medieval fantasy world. What makes Crypt Run special is its unique death mechanic -- the game isn\u2019t over when you die in Crypt Run!\nNote: now all $15 rewards and higher come with a free copy of Lava Blade (for Windows, Mac, and Linux).\nPlay the early demo in your browser!\nCrypt Run screenshot\nGameplay\nCrypt Run is a desktop Windows and Mac game that can be played with a keyboard or a gamepad. The action takes place in dungeons, which are comprised of a series of rooms packed with interesting monsters, traps, and loot. Explore the rooms to collect powerups and dodge hazards. Attack and kill monsters by throwing swords, daggers, axes, and other fun weapons.\nWant to see Crypt Run in action? Play the early demo in your browser or watch this gameplay video:\nDeath is just the beginning!\nDesign on Crypt Run is driven by the theme \u201cDeath is just the beginning.\u201d Any decisions made about the game revolve around that theme. \nThis theme has also been applied to the game mechanics. When players die in Crypt Run, they find themselves transported to the Realm of the Dead. This new realm has an otherworldly appearance and is inhabited by evil dead creatures (some of which you yourself put there!). In this way, dying begins an adventure in a new realm. (This unique death mechanic will allow for extremely deep gameplay, including challenges that require transporting between realms to complete!)\nCrypt Run gelatinous cube\nDark medieval fantasy theme\nAlthough it\u2019s a hardcore game that requires considerable skill to play well, Crypt Run\u2019s art style is intended to be accessible and lighthearted. Since the game involves so much blood and death, we feel that these heavy themes are easier to consume in large quantities if delivered with a playful aesthetic. Though Crypt Run is a cartoony game, its subject matter is quite mature!\nCrypt Run giant spider\nProcedurally generated dungeons\nThe dungeons in Crypt Run are procedurally generated, meaning they are randomly created by the game during runtime. We apply heuristic techniques to make the level design feel as handmade as possible. Our goal is to provide a fresh and exciting experience every time you play Crypt Run!\nProcedurally generated dungeons!\nOpen Development\nWe believe in developing out in the open as much as possible.

Geoff Blair and Matt Hackett founded Lost Decade Games in 2010 and have since released Lava Blade, Lunch Bug, and Onslaught! Arena (as well as an assortment of small mobile games). Joshua Morse has done the music and sounds for all of our games.\nGeoff Blair\nGeoff Blair\nGeoff Blair is the principal architect and co-founder of Lost Decade Games. His chief influences are Shining Force, World of Warcraft, and Final Fantasy Tactics. When not chained to his desk, Geoff loves to spend his winters hurling himself down snow-covered mountains on a snowboard. His apartment has more cats than people!\nMatt Hackett\nMatt Hackett\n\u201cTechnical artist\u201d is probably a good label for Matt Hackett, since he handles all of the visuals for Lost Decade Games. Also a co-founder, he spends about half his time on game art, the other half writing scripts to make the art feel more alive. He\u2019s also an award-winning foosball player!\nJoshua Morse\nJoshua Morse\nJoshua Morse is an accomplished video game composer and songwriter. Heavily involved with the video game remix scene (including plenty of contributions to OverClocked ReMix), he was referred to as \u201cmaster of funk\u201d in the June 2012 issue of Game Developer Magazine!\nWant to know more about Lost Decade Games? Please download our press kit or contact us.\nThe Music of Crypt Run\nCrypt Run\u2019s music has been inspired by the Sega Genesis era, especially by classic Climax adventure games such as Landstalker and Shining Force 2. Joshua is diligent about matching visual aesthetics to sound design, and has developed a warm, retro feel for Crypt Run\u2019s unique soundtrack.\nWatch the below video to hear some beautiful Crypt Run music:\nWhy Kickstarter?\nHere at Lost Decade Games, we currently pay the bills by making small games (like Onslaught! Defense) and licensing them to game portals. These portals seek quantity over quality, so they want as many small games as they can get -- and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re all about! Our passion is to develop large games that offer players plenty of depth and rich content.\nAll of Crypt Run's development so far has been out of pocket. If we aren't able to fund the game, we'll have to stop development, and find other ways to pay the bills.\nWith your help, we'll be able to finish Crypt Run!\nWhat are the funds for?\nOur budget will buy us just enough time to finish Crypt Run. This includes a few months of fleshing out the content, polishing, fixing bugs, finishing features, and finalizing the death mechanic. We'll also be able to afford awesome new sound effects!\nAn important thing to note about Kickstarter is that it works on the \u201call or nothing\u201d framework. If we meet our funding goal, we get funded and the game gets made. If we miss the funding goal, even by just $1, the game will not get funded and we get nothing.

These stories were an exploration of the crucible that made a personality and the people who lived through her trial: who saw that light and helped raise her up. It is equal parts brutal and uplifting, and I like to think it holds up well thirteen years later. Plus, it establishes some important characters in the Paradox universe, and helps launch the military science fiction stories from the same setting as my previous stories, Earthrise and Mindtouch (among others).\nHowever! These stories are among my oldest published works. Alysha's Fall was issued when having more than one color on a cover cost a lot of money, and all books had print runs. Thirteen years later, all the copies of AF are either gone or very hard to find.\nSo it's time for a tenth anniversary edition (three years late, but it's the thought that counts)! The original edition had art by a variety of artists, but one of the luminaries who contributed was Magic: the Gathering legend Mike Raabe. Mike has graciously agreed to do all-new illustrations to accompany the two he originally furnished for the book. And for that I'd like to pay him! I'd also like to pay my graphic designer Dave Bryant who will be adjusting the print edition to include the new illustrations, and have some left over to adjust the e-book editions with the art and other fancy formatting things.\nI'm also pleased to announce that Watts Martin has agreed to write an introduction for the tenth anniversary edition! Not only is Martin a fantastic author in his own right, but he was the editor who bought \"Blood Money\" for Mythagoras in 1996. I still remember his editorial comments: he made it a much stronger story. I'm delighted to have him in the book.\nHere I add a note: this story is violent and contains mature and disturbing situations. Readers who are avoiding such material should pass on this story. I recommend instead either of the two books mentioned above, Mindtouch or Earthrise.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nNEW COVER ART. When Cornwuff Press first put together the collection, they asked me to do the cover, and I said \"sure!\" And then they told me, \"You can only use black, white and one other color\" and my brain exploded. One other color! I chose yellow, but I felt severely constrained. At the time they'd asked me, I had finished a wonderful illustration I thought would make a fantastic cover, but it was rather more colors than black, white and yellow. I did the best I could at the time, but looking back at it now I can see how hard I worked for it.\nA tenth anniversary edition seems a great time to do a new cover!

We intend to travel the extent of the Mississippi River from its headwaters at Lake Itasca in Minnesota to the delta in New Orleans in Louisiana.  Our goal is to document the culinary essence of a place, diagnose what makes foods true to a location and why. \nWe are Mr. Sheng & Tabatha\u00b4s Traveling Revival.  Mr. Sheng (a.k.a. Andrew) hails from Minnesota and grew up on walleye and wild rice. While Tabatha (a.k.a. Elin) who is Swedish got her fair share of salmon and beetroots. We both are curious about new flavors and have a passion to find them. Together we have a catering company in Sweden, and have been working on killing a few stereotypes about American foods.  We intend to take a closer look at local foods in various regions along the route.   \nOur goal is to put together a \u201ctraveling cookbook\u201d documenting local dishes, conversations with the people who know them and their preparation.  We want to share this experience with you in a hands-on and practical manner by documenting the trip with video, blogging, and photos.\nOur intention is to collaborate with people who know and prepare the dishes, (Chefs, Cooks & Self-proclaimed Cooks) and those who produce the raw ingredients (Farmers, Beekeepers, Winemakers, Brewers, etc.)\nOur preference is to highlight local establishments and small businesses that capture the food culture of the area.  These meetings will help us determine what makes up the local culinary essence, and how the dishes are prepared.  . We have already made contact with several experts in all the major regions along the way through local historical societies. these contacts are excited about the project and ready to help us book meetings. These meetings will be edited into approximately 5 min clips which will be put out on YouTube. But will also be presented as chapters on our DVD for easy reference just like a cookbook.\nWe will be shooting with a Canon T2I Rebel, which is a user friendly DSLR camera with a professional grade video capability and a hookup for wireless microphones.  Commonly used for shooting documentaries for its simplicity and high quality picture output.(i.e., we\u00b4re not cinematographers but we have the means to create a high quality product.)  The meetings will be set up in advance and have very specific goals.  If we are meeting with a cook we will know beforehand what they are preparing, if we are on a farm or a winery we will have agreed on what information is relevant.    \nThe DVD will also contain some spontaneous footage of our journey in-between these meetings, part of this will be shot on a GoProCam mounted in our car.  In addtition to the standard questions we will be asking about food in every location.  This should provide some interesting insight that we can compare. \nWe have a film editor in Sweden we will be working alongside intensively in the months of November and December in order to finalize our DVD. We will be loading up the videos on YouTube throughout the editing process giving tidbits of the final DVD production.\nTo make this dream a reality we need your help! \nWe plan to head out in the fall of 2013, a prime time for local produce and a great time for a road trip. \nWe will do most of the work ourselves; however we still need help. \nThe funding for the project is going to be used to cover gas, car insurance, a vehicle, housing, our editors fees, the printing of the DVD, as well as purchasing food for the video demonstrations.  It is very hard to determine an exact budget for this project.  The cost of food for the production can very greatly, we don\u00b4t want to limit ourselves when it comes to groceries.  We have set a budget we feel is realistic, but will not stifle the outcome. \nHowever we have no intention of profiting off of this project.  If our funding proves to be more than we need to complete the project, we plan to donate the money to food shelves along the river.  Most food shelf donations are canned goods, a monetary donation can allow for a food shelf to purchase fresh foods.  Fresh food is a privilege and we want to keep this in mind while exploring the culinary peaks of the river. Anyone interested in purchasing the DVD after our project is complete will be able to do so at cost. \nThis is not a project with a finical goal on the horizon, it\u00b4s something we are just really passionate about.  The journey is for our own interest, but the product is for cultural benefit.\nIf you have input on local cuisine or suggestions of a great place to visit, please drop us a line.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe three greatest challenges we face are first technical, this is the largest project we will have undertaken working with multimedia.

I would love to continue raising funds to support this project, my friends suggested I set a new goal. I had a dream last week in which I saw the Kickstarter at $6000. I decided to go ahead and stick with this number as the new goal...dreams def can come true, with enough intention, support, & work...amazing things can happen!!!\n\nWHAT?\nI have been invited to exhibit one of my unique photo based light box installations at Photoville, in Brooklyn Bridge Park this September 2013. Photoville is a free event, this is why I am reaching out and asking for help to make this amazing opportunity come to life for both me and the attendees of Photoville.\nPHOTOVILLE is a new Brooklyn-based photo destination, a pop-up village of freight containers transformed into temporary exhibition spaces, which first took place in the summer of 2012. Photoville featured a feisty mix of exhibitions, lectures, hands-on workshops, night-time projections, a photo dog-run, a camera-flower greenhouse, and a summer beer-garden with food trucks that created a photography destination like no other.\nPhotoville 2012, \u00a9Julienne Schaer ~ I can just see my light boxes there, lighting up a pathway :)\nIn 2012, occupying more than 60,000 sq. feet in the heart of Brooklyn Bridge Park, Photoville was located on the uplands of Pier 3, along the Brooklyn Waterfront and attracted close to 40,000 visitors over 2 long weekends.\nPhotoville returns in 2013 from September 19 \u2013 29 in Brooklyn Bridge Park!!!\nWHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT THIS PROJECT?\nFirst things first, my installation will add an amazing and unique experience to the 40,000 + people that will attend Photoville, adding to the diversity and uniqueness of the event!\nI have been working in photography now for 20 years. I began working with light boxes in 2008 and have discovered that this format truly brings photographs to life. My installation 'The Mahayana' has now traveled to numerous music and art festivals all over the world. The images I have displayed in the past are from my personal travels. I have been told time and time again, that people have been inspired to travel after interacting with my installations. This is the greatest reward I can receive as an artist, to inspire action.\nWhat makes my light boxes special is hard to put into words. But, I can tell you what makes them unique, each of my light boxes are double-sided, they are free-standing, they are made from beautiful wood, they are water-proof, and people are magically attracted to them. The most common response I hear from people is that they are magical, that they make people feel like they are in a fantasy world, and bring them closer to the feelings of the photographs. They bring a dynamic that is hard to describe into the experience of looking at photographs.\nIn 2012 I won a Getty Images Creative Grant for my photographic work with my light boxes. This was the first time that a photography based organization recognized this creative way of exhibiting photography. This grant was used to bring attention to a very deserving non-profit doing charity work in India. I completed this project in July 2013. Thankfully the grant provided me with an opportunity to invest in my light boxes, making them waterproof, adding unique elements to the construction, that create more stability and longevity to the installation.\nExhibiting my light boxes at Photoville in Brooklyn this year would be the first time that my work would be shown alongside peers and professionals in my field. This is an incredible opportunity for me to exhibit both my photography and my creativity. As well as introducing my installations to the world of professional photography, the attendees of Photoville will see a new and inspiring way of viewing photography,  which challenges some of the more traditional notions of the medium. Creatively, photography has the capacity to continually develop and evolve, my light box installations challenge these traditional notions and create a fun, inspiring and interactive, living photography installation that continues to evolve with each exhibition.\nHOW WILL THE MONEY BE UTILIZED:\nPrinting all new Duratrans images & mounting them to plexi. I will be exhibiting new work from my recent trip to India at the event.\nBuilding new concrete based stands for the light boxes to withstand larger audiences.\nAdding new electrical elements to brighten the light boxes for daytime viewing.\nFlying myself round trip from Berlin - New York City. \nShipping the installation round trip from Berlin - New York City.\nExpenses to cover basic needs for and during the exhibition.\n\nIF WE ACHIEVE MORE THAN MY GOAL:\nI will invest in small solar panels to place on top of each light box, converting the light boxes to solar energy has been a long time goal of mine.\nI will add 4 larger light boxes to the installation for Photoville.\nNOTE added August 9th: I left the above, because I would love to add these elements to the installation. But due to time constraints with my electrician and wood worker, this won't be possible for Photoville 2013. However, the current goal only covers the costs for the exhibition and I am receiving no payment for the work I am doing. In addition I will be couch surfing in NYC. Thus, if the campaign goes over $4500, I will allow myself to stay in a hotel for a few nights, as well as eat some amazing NY food. In addition, I will be able to perhaps get a taxi one or two times around the city, who knows, I might even have a Bloody Mary for breakfast. Yes, I think it is fair to say that if the campaign goes over, I will be able to pay myself just a little bit. Thank you so much for supporting this project, I am incredibly excited to share my photography and installation with the attendees of Photoville.\n\nWHAT IMAGES WILL I BE EXHIBITING AT PHOTOVILLE?\nThanks to Getty Creative Grants, I had the chance to spend 4 months in India this past year and I documented the diversity of the country in a colorful and vibrant way. The images that will be shown at Photoville will represent modern India and I will take the participants on a journey through this incredible country. Here is a sample of some of the images that can be seen:\n\nWHERE IS PHOTOVILLE?\nBROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK\nBrooklyn Bridge Park is a world-class waterfront park with rolling hills, river front promenades, innovative play areas, and stunning views. Located along the Brooklyn waterfront, Brooklyn Bridge Park is bordered by Atlantic Avenue to the south and Jay Street to the north. The park is being constructed in phases and new sections will be opened to the public as they are completed.\nFor more information, visit:brooklynbridgeparknyc.org\nWHO IS HOSTING ME?\nUNITED PHOTO INDUSTRIES\nOur mission at United Photo Industries is to promote and showcase emerging photographers through curated exhibitions around the world.

Debate looms large\u2026.is he more attractive? Respectable? Trustworthy? Does it define him, or not? Does he use facial hair as a form of creativity, self-expression or perhaps a little rebelliousness?\n\n\u201cOf Beards and Men\u201d is a labor of love for graphic designer and photographer Joseph D.R. OLeary. Over the past 18 months, he\u2019s photographed 130+ bearded men. Each portrait is an exploration into that man\u2019s passions, personality and unique individuality.\n\nThe next step for this project is printing a handsomely designed and exquisitely produced book that brings together all 130+ portraits. The book will include three essays by art critic George Slade, photographer and educator Douglas Beasley and Twin Cities\u2019 arts writer Andy Sturdevant. The book is scheduled for release in Fall of 2013.\n\nThe print run will be limited to 1000 copies. As a backer, you would be guaranteed to receive a copy with any pledge of $65 or more.\nNational Praise for \u201cOf Beards and Men\u201d\nVicki Goldberg is one of the leading voices in the field of photography criticism. She has written about photography for The New York Times for thirteen years, lectures internationally, and writes on photography for ARTnews, Vanity Fair and various magazines. She writes:\nIn a time when portraits are everywhere, on magazine pages, cell phones, and screens ad infinitum (not to mention galleries), these register in an unusual key. This is partly because of the theme, bearded men, which could have been a joke but is not, because it is merely the excuse for a larger exploration of what the sitters are about. OLeary intends to show how masculinity and male personal identity are defined in contemporary society, a subject that can barely be hinted at in so short a compass. Yet he has registered sufficient and often striking differences in style and self-presentation among these men, enough so that viewers can at least imagine that they know something about the personalities who sat for the camera.\n\nThe sitters literally sit, a sameness of pose that sharpens the sense of differences. Clothes supposedly make the man, and they do at least disguise him and  present some desired image. A hat, a vest, a tie, a T-shirt, a pair of overalls: immediate placement in one sector of the culture. One man here took off all his clothes and managed to convey despite, or maybe because of, his nakedness, the image of a personality. Then there are extravagant or careful beards and tattoos, all clues we generally think we know how to read. And props, and body language, and, of course, facial expressions.\n\nPortraits are deceptive. We\u2019ll never know what degree of a man\u2019s identity was due to his attitude before the camera or to the photographer\u2019s idea of him. Richard Avedon said it all: \u201cWe have separate ambitions for the image. His need to plead his case probably goes as deep as my need to plead mine, but the control is with me.\u201d\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nWhy a book of bearded men? So many dynamics converged to yield this project.\n\n\u2022 Over the years I have perused many historic photographs and books of portraiture and was intrigued by the prevalence of beards on so many of the men from generations past. I started thinking about and discussing the lack of acceptance beards have today among influential, important, even respected men in society and wanted to dispel our current biases of the shaved vs. unshaved man.\n\n\u2022 I was looking for a way to refocus my energies and distract myself following a difficult 2011/2012 during which my brother unexpectedly died and I endured a debilitating bout of Lyme disease.\n\n\u2022 As a photographer, I\u2019ve always been compelled by portraiture \u2014 of myself and others. People are fascinating and everyone has a story to tell. It is these \u201cstories\u201d that need to be recorded through portraiture.\n\nThe project transformed from a simple study of photographing bearded men to an indepth exploration of how men define themselves \u2014 personally, professionally or spiritually \u2014 in a culture that seems obsessed with defining masculinity as well as granting the freedom of defining your own personal style.\n\nThe guys I met during this project were inspirational. Hearing their stories as I photographed them was amazing. Capturing a glimpse of their lives infused the images with a warmth, personality and beauty I hadn\u2019t expected.\nHow long did it take to photograph everyone? 18 months \u2014 from February 2012 to July 2013.\nWho are the guys in the portraits? The guys are people just like you. They all answered the call to give their beard its \"15 minutes of fame.\" Initially, they were all local to the Minneapolis area, but as word spread about the project, bearded men came to my studio from throughout Minnesota and beyond including Texas, Missouri, Illinois, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Washington.\nUltimately, what connected them was not their beards. Rather, it was the fact that they all had a story to tell and they all stepped up to \u201ctell\u201d it.\n\nHow will the money be used? All of the money raised will go directly to cover the costs of printing. To date, all the incidental costs associated with the project (e.g., design, marketing, promotional materials, Kickstarter video, project website, writers, etc.) have been paid for from my personal funds. (The Kickstarter is not intended to recoup those costs).\n\nWhy a printed book in the age of digital? This book will be a limited-edition coffee table book, beautifully designed and impeccably printed. Think of it as a keepsake you can enjoy and share with your family and friends for years to come. In a sense it is a time capsule \u2014 a visual record \u2014 of masculinity in contemporary society. Think of photographs you see of people circa 1900...now imagine what people will think when they look at this book 50 to 100 years from now.\n\nWill the book include text, too? Yes. The book will include three essays. Art critic George Slade will be writing about the importance of portraiture throughout the ages in particular the age of photography. Photographer/educator Douglas Beasley will be writing a critical essay of the portraits in the book. And, Twin Cities\u2019 arts writer Andy Sturdevant will be writing about beards and beard culture in contemporary society.\n\nWill the book be included in the Library of Congress? Yes! If printed, it will definitely be included in the Library of Congress, which means it will have an ISBN number and will be placed in our national archives. Beards will live forever.\n\nWhat if this campaign generates more money than is needed? Well, that would be awesome. If the project gets more funding than is needed to cover the cost of the printing, I will either print a higher quantity of books or upgrade the production values of the book.\nWhat are the details of the book? The book's page dimensions are 9.75\" x 12\". It will be 130+ portraits on 168 pages. The images will be printed in full color on 100 lb. matte paper with spot varnish on each image. The book includes three essays, an artist statement, and contributor list. The soft cover version will include a full color cover with extended cover flaps. The hard cover version will be 4mm board covered in fabric with a debossed frame for a full color tip-in image on cover and foil stamping on the spine. The slip case, constructed of 4mm book board will be a covered with a complimentary fabric color with a debossed frame for an additional tip-in image.\nPlease consider supporting this project. Perhaps your photo will be in the book. Perhaps you know someone who was photographed for the project. Perhaps you wear or love someone who wears a beard. Perhaps you are just a staunch lover of beards. Or, perhaps you just appreciate beautiful portraits. Either way, we thank you for your consideration and support.\nLove. Beard.

Today, the foil stamping on the softcover. Tomorrow will most likely be the foil stamping on the dust jacket. Also this week, a sample book was sent to Sunrise Packaging for construction of the slipcase edition.

Rolling shutter only captured the strobe at the bottom of the image.\nCheck out what a few others have said about the project:\nhttp://www.visualnews.com/2011/06/29/a-one-man-mobile-studio-at-burning-man/\nhttp://burnafterreadingmag.com/words-from-the-human-light-suit/\nEvery year I rent the lighting equipment required to, in essence, overpower the sun.  I use a few 1200 w/s generators and various lighting setups.  2010 was two softboxes, 2011 was one beauty dish, 2012 was a combination of both, plus a daytime studio that was part of my camp.\nMr. Kita from Japan has found me every year! This is from 2012.\nThe suit has also been upgraded yearly. In 2011, kickstarter backers went above and beyond and we were able to invest in some solar panels to recharge the spare batteries during the day.\nThis year, I'm building a brand new rig (one that I don't have to rent - the largest expense each year) made out of LEDs.  The regular light suit is designed to overpower the sun, and works great during the day.  This new rig will be made out of thousands of RGB LEDs - I will be able to adjust the power output and color of the light, opening up a whole new world of possibilities.  \nPhoto by Sidney Erthal. The main rig, from 2010. The lights are positioned high so I can shoot from a lower angle.\nI'll give the new rig a daytime test as well, but I think it will me most useful at night, maybe at dusk as well.\nDuring the day, I shoot on a digital medium format camera.  Nighttime shoots will happen on a digital SLR.\nOne of my favorites from 2011\nThe biggest cost is renting the lights, followed by renting a van to get it all there.  Each year all the gear needs to be professionally cleaned upon return, in addition to repair costs for damage to the gear.\nThis year, there are costs for building the 2nd suit as well.  I'll be using a few thousand LEDs, we're still figuring out how to attach them in a way that will give a good even light and still look interesting from afar. The lights will be RGB and adjustable for color and brightness.\nREWARDS:\nEveryone who backs the project will be thanked in this year's video.\nSupport us at $10 and up will receive a HLS postcard in the mail with a personal thank you!\n$15 reward is a glossy sticker, as seen in the video and right here!\nHelp us out with $25 and receive a collection of 5 oversized postcards from this year's project -or-a set of Alex Minsky postcards.

We have images available from 2010, 2011 and will be adding one from 2012, plus an Alex Minsky option.

This year, the biggest challenge is building an LED rig that is both lightweight and adjustable, while being very solid, so all of the little teeny tiny soldering points hold.

I am a 101st Airborne combat veteran (11Bravo Infantry). I served two tours in Iraq. I have been working on this series for a while now, professionally and therapeutically. The purpose of this series is to show the thoughts and emotions of combat veterans after they return home from their service. Through this, I'm hoping to create a better understanding of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) caused by the training, service, and returning to a now alien environment. \nIn the series, there are four sections:\nFirst, there are still life images of my combat gear. I photographed them in a way that shows that they are not only a part of what saved my life, but also the part that destroyed it. \nSecond is a group of self- portraits depicting \"reality\". Through these images I give the viewer a look at what we (veterans with PTSD) feel and experience on a day to day basis. The feelings of loss, confusion, paranoia, fear, anger, and sadness. \nThird is the \"dream\" sequence. I'm using this style, mainly, to convey feeling alone. The military, and I think most people know this, their main objective is to break down who you were and rebuild you. You are trained to be unattached, formidable, and disconnected from normal behavior. Upon returning home, you are not only a stranger to your friends and family, but the behaviors you learned are no longer acceptable.  \nFourth are pictures of myself and of my platoon in Iraq. I want people to get a real sense of where I had been and what it looked liked. One of the things my overseas tours did give me, and I do miss, is a feeling of brotherhood. And I will remember all of them, forever. \nHere's where you fine people come in, in order for me to do this accordingly, the 20+ images that I have (and a few more to be added soon), need to be printed and mounted, LARGE. I have a gallery that's already interested in showing my work but I don't have the funds to make that happen. My dream is to show my images this fall. After that, I'm hoping to get accepted into other Chicago galleries, and from there who knows? Hopefully other major cities, or even smaller showings. My hope is to spread enough word so that soldiers can come home to safe havens instead of yet another foreign environment. Where people ask \"Is there anything I can do?\" instead of \"How many people did you kill?\". My hope is to create a world of understanding for what I long to be the last soldiers ever sent off to war. I know that changing the world and the minds of those who are in it is no small task. But this is the way that I've found to try, and in order to do that I need your help. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.

Oddities from Space\nBrought to you by\nGordon Robertson\nJimmy Furlong\nBlas Bigatti\n\nSpace Oddities was a short run idea utilised in Mark Millar's comic platform Clint. \nThe basic premise was simple five pages or less comic shorts with a sting in the tale ending. Artists and writers from across the globe were actively encouraged to post their work on the Millarworld forums in the hope that some of them would eventually be printed. What resulted was a ton of incredible and unique strips from some of the industry\u2019s hottest new talent.\nA small group of us from the forums decided it would be a cool idea to gather all these great stories into one single volume and unleash it on the world and so Spod! Oddities From Space was born. Featuring the creative talents of over forty writers and artists, including the industry\u2019s current high-flyers; JEFF MCCOMSEY (FUBAR), MONTY NERO (DEATH SENTENCE) and NEIL GIBSON (TWISTED DARK). Each story is unique, no longer than five pages long, so you can either snack at your leisure or gorge till your stomach bursts. Feast on tales filled with sex, violence, aliens and wrongness, with a side order of terror and dark twisted humour to wash it down.\n\nWe are looking to raise \u00a31500 to make this a reality and we need your help.

Rounds will speed by in next to no time as you no longer have to scrabble around on the floor looking for where the other disc went after a particularly wild shot went awry! \nOur next target is \u00a32000 where we'll be including an expansion that will be exclusive to all Kickstarter backers - a fifth lilypad and corresponding target card! Claiming this card with an incredible shot could swing a game in your favour!\n\u00a32500 opens up another expansion... The Rise of The Froglings! New discs and new rules add a little element of complexity to the FrogFlip experience\nFinally (for now...), a KS exclusive set of Button Badges will be yours should we hit \u00a33250! \nIdeas for games can come from anywhere. Sometimes it could be a line from a song. Perhaps a story inspires something creative. In the case of our new project FrogFlip, a long wait at a restaurant led to the creation of a quick and entertaining dexterity game... and it's all down to a three-and-a-half year old called Claire!\nWell, not just Claire. Her dad happens to be designer Jason Kotarski, creator of The Great Heartland Hauling Company, a talented guy with a passion for making great games. Last year, while the two were having a daddy-daughter day and waiting for their dinner in a restaurant, Claire made an origami frog and began flicking it around the table. Soon this developed into a challenging little effort with Claire attempting to land her frog on various targets, which got daddy Jason thinking...\nOriginal version on the left, Sprocket Games prototype on the right! Remember, final versions will come with the disc laser etched with the Frog from the FrogFlip logo!\nPretty soon FrogFlip was born, a quick-playing dexterity game for two. With simple rules and easy-to-understand gameplay, it's the perfect game for any age group - if you can flip a coin, you can FrogFlip! \nCheck out some of our test laser cut tokens from Simon, our resident Scientist!\nEarly reviews from noted designers like Jeremiah Lee have called the game \"Light, quick, and fun. This is the kind of quick dexterity game that I love.\" The good folks over at Father Geek declared that \"every game, be it with adults, kids, or both, was filled with high levels of frustration and exuberance after every flip. Good times, good times.\" Theology of Games said FrogFlip was \"an adorable little family game.\" Socially Inept Gamer gave FrogFlip 8.5 out of 10, saying that it's \"pure, silly fun.\"\nAll you need is a flat surface to lay out your four lilypads - any table will do. Shuffle the deck of target cards and you're good to go! Players flip the disc from the side of the table, with the amount of flies on the card telling them which lilypad they're aiming for, like so:\nHarold the Bear is facing off against Slime Knight. The current target is the third lilypad, as shown by the three flies on the card. Players must aim for the pad that is three cards away from them, so you're never trying to hit the same one as your opponent!\nHit the right target and you get to claim that card, adding to your points score for the game. Land on the target and things are even better - you flip the card to show that you've scored double for that Flip! Once all cards have been claimed, whoever has the highest score is the winner - but as FrogFlip is so quick to play it doesn't take long to reset and challenge again.\nIn the basic bag you'll get:\nFour Lilypad Cards\nEight double-sided Fly cards\nOne wooden Frog disc\n... and any stretch goals we happen to achieve!\nSprocket Games is delighted to be working alongside Jason and Claire to bring their fantastic little game to a bigger audience. We enjoyed a huge amount of success with our last project (Fox & Chicken) and are looking to do the same with FrogFlip. While the game has previously been available on The Game Crafter, we plan to really pump up the art and improve the package as much as we can. We also have some interesting ideas for extras that we'll be revealing as the campaign continues, but for now we're keeping them under our hats!\nWhether you're breaking it out in the pub to battle over who is the supreme Flipper or shoving it into your backpack to keep the kids entertained while away, FrogFlip is the perfect game for all kinds of people. If you fancy ramping up the challenge you can even combine two copies to make it a Four Player FrogFlip Frenzy! It's portable, expandable and 100% Guaranteed FrogFlipping Fun! Show your support by sporting one of these fine avatars!\nHeading to Essen this year? Want to pick up your copy from us there? Yeah, we can do that - and if you're an international backer you won't have to pay for shipping either! When you back FrogFlip, simply pledge for the standard amount AND SAY THAT YOU ARE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM instead of adding extra for shipping - then, when the surveys go out just let us know that you'll be seeing us in Germany!\nSprocket Games previously had success with Fox & Chicken, their take on the classic game Werewolf. Launched in late 2012 and run by Michael Fox from The Little Metal Dog Show, they aim to produce great games that are fun to play and look great. With art direction from Stephanie Burrows Fox, you can be sure that when you go with Sprocket Games you'll get the very best!

Before you CHOOSE A REWARD to the right, let us tell you a bit more about the project. \nWhy a Museum of Pinball?\nPinball is experiencing a massive comeback.\nWe want young people to experience the excitement of an electronic game that doesn't just appear on a screen.\nWe want people who grew up playing pinball to rediscover their passion for the game...or what we like to call a \"sport.\"\nWe want to help bring competitive pinball tournaments into the spotlight.\nWe want to preserve the amazing history of the game.\nUltimately, we just want more people to fall in love with pinball.  \nWe know you want to be part of this project, but don't contribute quite yet!\nThere's still more to learn.

After owning three arcades in the late 1970's to early 80's, it has been his LIFE-LONG DREAM to create a facility where young and old alike could enjoy these nostalgic games. When he came across the property in southern California, he leveraged all his financial resources to purchase the facility.\nIn other words, HE'S ALL IN!\nAs a non-profit organization, we have the 18 acre campus, 40,000 square foot facility, and over 500 vintage and modern games, but we don't have the $150,000 that's needed to renovate the space.  \nThat's why WE NEED YOUR HELP! \nIf you have questions, keep reading. BUT, if you're ready to contribute, go ahead and click BACK THIS PROJECT (upper right) and CHOOSE A REWARD to the right. \nWhat's Unique About the Museum of Pinball?\nWe are a non-profit. We're in this for the love of the game first and foremost.\nWe own the property. Therefore, we don't have a lease that will  threaten our financial stability.\nWe have room to expand. We envision all 127,000 square feet full of nostalgic games and the 5 acre park full of vintage RVs.\nWe will be open every week. While some other pinball facilities or local events limit their availability to just a few times a year, we will be open every week - Friday-Sunday with regular hours and Monday-Thursday for special events. \nWe are near a destination location. With the Morongo Casino & Restort and the Cabazon Outlets within a few miles of our campus. \nWe are close to six major airports including the Palm Springs International Airport (only 28 miles away).\nOur pinball collection is remarkable. Not only do we have over 500 machines, but many are rare and highly collectible. \nOur founder is a seasoned businessman. John Weeks knows how to build something from the ground up having been successful in launching both Internet and bricks & mortar businesses.\nWhat are you waiting for?

Click here to learn how your company can support the Museum of Pinball - a non-profit organization. \nIf you own the facility, don't you already have $150,000 of your own money?\nIf we had it, we'd use it! When John Weeks came across the property in southern California, he leveraged all his financial resources to purchase the facility. In other words, HE'S ALL IN! As a non-profit organization, we have the 18 acre campus, 40,000 square foot facility, and over 500 vintage and modern games, but we don't have $150,000 to renovate the space. That's why we need your help!  \nWhy did you choose this location in Banning, California?\nFor the past 5 years, we've been searching for an appropriate location in southern California. Anything in LA or Orange County was extremely costly (either to lease or purchase), but we wanted it to be near a destination location. When we found 18 acres with 127,000 square feet of buildings within a few miles of the Morongo Casino & Resort and Cabazon Outlets (and 20 minutes from the resort town of Palm Springs with an international airport), we were amazed by the potential. By purchasing the facility (rather than leasing), we are able to ensure that someone else (i.e., a landlord) can't increase the price of our monthly facility expenditures. \nIf I want to fly to the Museum of Pinball, what is the best airport?\nThere are seven major airports near the Museum of Pinball including:\nPalm Springs International Airport - 28 miles\nOntario International Airport - 50 miles\nJohn Wayne / Orange County Airport - 75 miles\nLong Beach Airport - 87 miles\nBurbank Bob Hope Airport - 96 miles\nLos Angeles International Airport - 100 miles\nSan Diego International Airport - 120 miles\nAren't there other pinball museums or facilities in the US?\nYes, we LOVE other pinball facilities, because all of us are focused on the same goal - spreading the love of pinball. Here are a few facilities around the US...\nPinball Hall of Fame (Las Vegas, NV) - 150 machines.\nPacific Pinball Museum (Alameda, CA) - 90 machines.\nPAPA (Scott Township, Pennsylvania) - open twice a year for tournaments with approximately 450 machines.\nSilverball Museum Arcade (Asbury Park, NJ) - 180 machines.\nSeattle Pinball Museum (Seattle, WA) - 50 machines.\nNational Pinball Museum (Baltimore, MD) - closed due to landlord canceling lease.\n\nWhen will the Museum of Pinball be open?\n  If we are successful in raising $150,000 with our Kickstarter campaign, we anticipate a Grand Opening in late January or early February 2014. The Museum will be open Friday-Sunday (regular hours) and Monday-Thursday (special events).\nWhen the Museum of Pinball opens, will I have to pay to play?\n  With a $15 entry fee (after the Grand Opening Weekend), you'll receive a card that will allow you to play approximately half of the machines at no additional charge for as long as you would like on the date of purchase. Other games will require additional credit to be added to your card, and you'll redeem those credits by swiping your card at individual machines of your choice.\nI'm a pinball aficionado, and I've never heard of John Weeks and his collection. Who is this guy?\nIf you're a follower of PAPA tournaments and the pinball culture in the US, you're probably familiar with high-profile players and collectors - but maybe you've never heard of John Weeks. After owning a chain of three arcades in the late 1970s and early 80's, John became enamored by pinball. In 1996, he started seriously collecting machines with a vision of opening a massive pinball facility. While John does participate in some pinball gatherings in southern California, he has also flown to see the other major pinball facilities in the US to learn and be stretched in his vision. With the majority of his time focused on running his Internet-based businesses, he loves spending time playing pinball with friends...and avoiding the attention of the spotlight.\nWhat pinball machines do you have in your collection?\nClick here to see the list. As we acquire more machines, we'll update the page on our website.\nHow do you plan to maintain over 500 pinball machines?\nBecause John Weeks has owned arcades in the past and is an avid pinballer himself, we know that one of the keys to ensuring that everyone enjoys the Museum of Pinball is to keep the machines in great condition for pinheads and the general public. Not only have we had numerous people already volunteer to be part of our ongoing tech team, we also plan to hire pinball techs to be on the museum staff. Although the Museum of Pinball is a non-profit, it must be run like a for-profit business in order to go the distance.\nWho manufactures the pinball accessories that you're offering as rewards?\nWhile the t-shirts are printed in California and the custom tokens are sourced in the US, all of the pinball accessories (including the covers, skates/dolly, and rotisseries) are manufactured by John Weeks. He has sourced and manufactured these items for the last few years, and he's happy to offer them as rewards to backers of the Kickstarter project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWITH THE $150,000, we are confident that the renovation and Grand Opening of the Museum of Pinball is possible for early 2014 (ideally late January - early February). \n\n- We own the facility and over 500 pinball machines.\n- We have a lease signed for a business to move into the 87,000 square feet in the middle of the property.\n- We have the business acumen to oversee the renovation, installation of the machines, and the opening of the Museum.\n- John Weeks has owned and operated successful arcades (1970s and 80s), retail tool stores (late 1980s), and Internet-based businesses (currently). \n\nWITHOUT THE $150,000, we know that the opening of the Museum of Pinball will be delayed.

Douglas was a huge fan of audio drama. The original BBC Radio edition of Hitchhiker's Guide was always his favorite. Over the years, he and I often discussed a shared dream: to recreate the experience of text adventures in pure sound. A few baby steps were taken, but until recently, the technology to do it really well simply wasn't in place. It's great fun watching Reactive Studios finally realize this vision. [Douglas: \"Er, well, not much of a 'vision,' exactly, is it?\"]\"\n-- Brian Moriarty, Game Designer of Loom, Writer/Implementer for Infocom, and WPI Professor\nWe want to entertain a wide audience on a serialized basis with an interactive story. Just like in the days of radio drama, but we're combining it with the narrative techniques of interactive fiction and choose your adventure books... and voice recognition.\nAbout The Gameplay\nWe're keeping our UI super simple. The experience is entirely sound and story: Writing + Voiceover + SFX + Music. With either a spoken word or a simple tap on the screen you can listen to the drama unfold in a progression similar to the multiple choice dialogue moments that you find in adventure or RPG games.  You get to make decisions about what to do and what kind of agent to be in a world of espionage. Your iPhone/iPad recognizes your speech (or accepts the tap of a button) to trigger and play the next sound file so that the characters react to you as the events and story continue.\nThe Episodic Model\nAnd the story will continue to unfold week after week if we're successful. We're launching in August with Mission 1, which will include a short Prologue and three full episodes in one complete story arc.\n[[Sorry agent, details on the heinous plot that you must thwart are still classified! Monitor your typical communication channels for more info in upcoming weeks.]] \nIf we're funded we can also begin work immediately on the two additional sidequest episodes of Mission 1 so they are ready to release in September. And then we start Mission 2!\nWe estimate that a single play-through of an episode will be about 15-20 minutes on average, although the total playable content will be a lot more. We'd like the experience of a full serial Mission to equate to the length of a feature film.\nWe Have the Tools, We Have the Talent!\nVOICE ACTORS\nLogan Cunningham - We knew from the beginning that we needed top notch voice talent. We were thrilled beyond belief when the narrator (Rucks) of Bastion from Supergiant Games agreed to play our first spy nemesis! This man needs no introduction. Just wait until you hear him deliver his villainous speech in Mission 1! If you want a taste, you can check out the teaser trailer on our website.\nSarah Elmaleh - We were equally excited when we recruited Sarah, whose credits include Skulls of the Shogun, Gone Home, and Wadjet Eye Games titles such as Resonance. Sarah is like the \"NYC branch\" of Reactive Studios!\nRob Wiethoff - The name says it all...\nWe've also had the good fortune of working with Chris Ciulla of Fallout:NV, YouTube personality Kite Tales, Chris Rando, Emery Westlake, and many others. In total, over 25 actors are involved with the pilot episodes of Codename Cygnus.\nAUDIO TEAM\nShannon Daly has knocked it out of the park as the sound director of all things Cygnus. She previously did sound for Popcannibal's Girls Like Robots and created an audio narrative for her MA thesis in Media Arts at Emerson.\nLi Xiao'an is composing the music and soundtrack for Codename Cygnus. He is an Award-Winning Composer, Audio Designer and Guitarist (Berklee College of Music) who creates Custom Music and Sound Effects for Video Games. He has played on Chart-Topping Pop albums in more than 3 countries and produced audio for Games, Films and Commercial Media.\nBrett Apitz rocks as a Sound Designer whose prior work includes VO mastering for Bioshock Infinite.\nWRITING TEAM\nHeather Albano is the lead writer for Mission 1. She is a novelist and game writer of titles such as Choice of Romance, Choice of Broadsides, and Choice of Zombies.\nChris Dahlen is a narrative consultant for Mission 1. He is the former editor-in-chief and co-founder of Kill Screen who also recently wrote the script for Klei's Mark of the Ninja.\nJonathon Myers is the creative lead, narrative designer, and writer for Codename Cygnus. Previously a freelancer, Jonathon planned and implemented narrative launch content for Game of Thrones Ascent, by Disruptor Beam. He was also narrative designer and writer of the successful iOS title Jack Lumber by Owlchemy Labs, published by SEGA in 2012. Prior to that, Jonathon was a full time game writer and narrative consultant for Zynga Boston\u2019s Indiana Jones Adventure World, named a top-5 social game of 2011. In addition to co-founding the www.bostonindies.com website, he is a lifetime member of the International Game Developers Association and a member of the Writer's Guild of America Videogame Writer\u2019s Caucus.\nYou Built a Sound Booth? Wut!?\nYep. We looked into the hourly costs of scheduling and recording our actors in professional studios. It simply wasn't in our budget to do it. We also looked into purchasing a pre-made booth. That, too, wasn't possible. So we did it ourselves. As you can hear in the video, we're now able to produce high quality voiceover any time we like.\nWe also documented the construction with photos. You can view our FLICKR SET to watch the whole process from beginning to end.\nCurrent Promotional Considerations...\nWe're doing our best to reach an audience of listeners, which is a part of why we're running this Kickstarter campaign. We even prepared the following 30-second \"radio spot\" to promote our game on podcasts, websites and social channels.\nWe believe people out there want to listen to and play an interactive radio drama.

It\u2019s a game about being a kid, growing up with a little brother that needs your help, facing obstacles, and solving unique puzzles in an industrial-alchemic world.\nIn the words of Or\u00e7un Ni\u015fli, the game\u2019s creative director . . .\n\"Platformer games are about our childhood. Think about it for a moment. What we do in a platformer is what we used to do when we were children playing at the playground. We\u2019re adults now and don\u2019t need to push a box and jump over it. We never climb wooden ladders or swing on a rope. In Monochroma, I try to celebrate everyone\u2019s childhood by setting the tutorial at a playground.It was my way of saying \u2018thanks\u2019 to all the developers that carry childhood memories within and keep the genre alive.\"\nPLAY THE DEMO (Windows, Mac and Linux)\nMonochroma has been described as Limbo meets Ico. However, Monochroma is much more than a skilled mix of two great games: It is a deeply visual, intellectual, and emotional experience. It is not a game that \u201cbarks and howls\u201d through voiceover or cinematics. Instead, the puzzles and visuals speak for themselves. Monochroma features realistic locations, puzzles modeled with accurate physics\u2014and a layered, grim atmosphere that will immerse you for hours.\nMonochroma is the product of Nowhere Studios\u2014a team of indie developers, artists, and musicians from Istanbul, Turkey. The game includes a bold soundtrack from the psychedelic folk band, Gevende, and handmade cut-out artworks and marketing materials from multi award-winning design studio LOV B&D . \nThe puzzles in Monochroma take a more realistic approach by blending in with the environment. Super-accurate physics modeling ensures that interaction (pushing/pulling objects, sliding, jumping) always feels right. More so, Monochroma tells its story without any cut-scenes, narration, or in-game text. Players learn about the environment and follow the story through carefully crafted black-white visuals with splashes of red. As a result, the story is instantly understandable by players of all nationalities \u2013 without any localization required.\nThe game will be released on December 2013 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. We also plan to support consoles: Ouya, Wii U, Playstation Vita, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. We also need your vote on Steam Greenlight! Please click here to support Monochroma.\nSet in an alternate universe during the 1950s, Monochroma tells the story of a boy and his brother \u2013 two kids against a massive corporation that makes all their money from building and selling robots to city dwellers. One day, the two brothers witness something truly awful, a crime hard-to-believe committed by the same corporation. Alone in the rain, they must survive six hours of devilishly clever puzzles in order to save their world from tyranny.\nMonochroma\u2019s gameplay builds upon the relationship and unspoken sacrifice between two brothers. Early on, your little brother injures his leg\u2014so you must carry him on piggyback to continue further. You can\u2019t run fast or jump high while carrying your brother. Furthermore, you must put your brother down temporarily in order to solve most of the puzzles\u2014but you can only do this where it\u2019s bright. Like most small children, he is afraid of the dark\u2014and you can\u2019t leave him behind. This is just one of the elements that makes Monochroma unique and engaging. Both brothers must survive for the player to win the game. However, if one dies during the process, don\u2019t worry: Monochroma has a player-friendly, ultra-fast checkpoint system!\nMonochroma\u2019s gameplay is built primarily on physics-based puzzle solving but there is plenty of action to be found across the game\u2019s four unique chapters; the full game will contain 60+ puzzles and a 6-hour single player campaign. In order to extend replayability, players can seek mysterious flowers hidden within each chapter.\nMonochroma has four 90-minute chapters: Outskirts, Ghetto, Factory, and Zeppelin. Each chapter has its own game assets and puzzles, without cutting-and-pasting and/or repetition.\nMonochroma is almost complete. Most of the hard work is done\u2014including engine scripts, controls, physics, and the first half of the game assets and levels. Nowhere Studios is now producing the third chapter (Factory). The team is also tweaking and polishing current chapters (Outskirts and Ghetto)\u2014and fixing bugs.\nNowhere Studios has been developing Monochroma for 18 months, with just six months to go. The game will be available December 2013 for Windows, Mac and Linux PC\u2019s. We also plan to support Ouya, Wii U, PlayStation and Xbox.\nWe also need your vote on Steam Greenlight!

It's bigger than anyone can imagine. Most of us are too small to have any sort of meaningful change all on our own. The only thing we have agency over is ourselves. People can become stronger or weaker, and that inner strength and resolve can definitely leave an impact on our own little world. \nThis is why traditional weapons wont work in Insignificant\nInsignificant is a game that reflects and explores that feeling, because it's hard for me to identify when every other game pits my character as the messiah destined to weave the fate of the Universe. I'm pretty sure less than 10% of the people I know are messiahs destined to weave the fate of the Universe.\nSee what critics are saying about Insignificant:\n\"Insignificant is a tiny game with tiny people that has big ambitions.\" - Patrick Klepek, Giantbomb.com\n\"I'm sorry, we cannot cover Insignificant at this time.\" - Anonymous News Organization, AnonymousNewsOrganization.com\n\"I think it's a very unique idea.\" - Dan's Mother, Text Message\nStill not convinced?\nWell if television has taught me anything, it's that commercials are the number one most effective way to convince people to buy your stuff. So here's a terrible commercial I made for Insignificant!\nThey say that long ago civilization was all but destroyed by titans who roamed the land, wiping out every brave warrior who dared to face them. It was the cowardly who survived by hiding in caves and underground.\nThey came to be known as The Insiders, and they lived the way you'd expect them to with a name like that. To this day, The Insiders never figured out why all those beasties and monsters arrived all those years ago. There are some things you just can't explain. The Insiders have a word for that: Magic.\nFire, Lightning, Water, some people say Gods are responsible for all that. It's not too different, The Insiders just have a different word for it.\nProblem is, Magic is what got them into this mess, so whenever it comes to pass that an Insider uses this sort of witchcraft, the elders figure that the best way to get rid of the Insider's Magic is to get rid of the Insider.\nAs this Insider was ripped from their loved ones, they wondered \u201cwhat will I find out there, in this world of magic? Will it be cold? Will it be lonely? Will it even exist?\u201d It wasn't the first time an Insider had been exiled, nor would it be the last, but on this particular day, this particular Insider embraced the magic they had been scorned for, and realized that they had truly become an Outsider.\nThe thing those stories neglected to mention is that it wasn't just the monsters who towered over The Insiders all those years ago, it was the whole world. To everyone else, The Outsider might just as well be a bug. So The Outsider looked around and wondered how they were ever going to find a place in this new world which clearly wasn't meant for them. How were they ever going to be anything but Insignificant?\nBacking Insignificant does more than raise funds for the game, this is the Flagship game for Significant Games, and we eventually want to branch out and make even more unique games beyond the scope of this project.\nThe work for Significant Games is, right now, almost completely the result of myself, Dan Rickmers. Insignificant is my first foray into making my own game, which is why it was important to me to prove my abilities as more than just a concept. In fact, if I had the money to support myself that long, I'd just make the whole game before I showed it off.\nI don't have the money of course, which is why you're seeing this kickstarter, but I think I've created enough Game to show that as far as games-made-by-a-single-dude go, Insignificant is a pretty good deal. It might not look gorgeous, and it might play a bit wonky, but it's earnest and it has heart, and those are two things no amount of funding can add.\nI mean if I just showed you the stuff I made way back when I actually started making Insignificant, you might be a little less inclined to back the project. Take this little monstrosity for example:\nkill...me...\nBut yeah, don't worry, you don't have to play Inisgnificant as an abominable husk of nightmare-fuel straight out of a David Cronenberg movie. Unless you want to? I guess I could add some kind of support for that if you really want.\nWe've reached our project's minimum funding goal! That means the costs of publishing the game have been covered, and Insignificant, no matter what, will become a game. There are many things that simply cannot be done on such a small budget, so these stretch goals are an attempt to lay out what we can do if we have a little bit more! If you want to see exactly what these numbers are going to mean, check out the Budget Breakdown section near the bottom of the page.\nEvery dollar we get for Insignificant is going into making the game better. The reason most games have large budgets is because they need to pay people for their time. I'm okay working for like $10 a day if I have to, but other artists aren't so generous, nor should they be, if they're worth their salt. I can promise that whatever Insignificant gets, I'll make it work.\nCurrent Stretch Goal: Living Titans $13,000\nGiant wolves and birds aren't the only titans you'll have to contend with, if we hit this stretch goal, I'll be able to put some living human beings into the game. They wont notice you at first, but if you start stabbing them you might be in for some trouble.\nUp to this point I had been planning to write around not being able to feature big humans in the game, but I think it's much more appealing if players could be able to interact with these giants. These humans have a story of their own as well, and if we hit this stretch goal, players will be able to peer into the lives of these ordinary people.\n(As a side note, this is the aspect of the game that would be most like Secret World of Arrietty in video game form)\nAlchemy\nThe Alchemy system is more than just an extension of the crafting system. It uses berries and other raw foods found in the world and allows you to combine them and discover new items. What do these berries do? Well they all have different effects, some of them can confer unique bonuses and effects for a limited time, and some of them simply confer the joy of a full stomach, which as we all know, is the greatest power of all.\nBerries? How does this work, exactly?\nLet's say I've found some Blueberries, Blackberries and...um....redberries.\nNow I can combine them in any way I choose, but I don't really know what will happen when I do. I'll mush together the Blueberries and Blackberries, and I'll get a Blacknblue Berry.\nThis new berry can also be used in Alchemical combinations, which would already double your total number of berry combinations. This system leads to many unique and hidden berries which can be created, and I'm sure someone will spoil them all with a guide, but assuming they don't, you might be surprised when you uncover some very unique berries, like the Cageberry.\nHere's a lady enjoying the Oculus Rift\nInsignificant will now support the Oculus Rift!\nIf you don't know what the Oculus Rift is, it's a Virtual Reality headset, and unlike certain other virtual reality headsets of yesteryear (I'm looking at you, Virtual Boy), this one actually functions. Not only that, it also succeeds in making the wearer look completely ridiculous.\nInsignificant already has a functioning first person mode, and Unity3D is supporting Oculus Rift natively, so it should be a perfect match. Playing Insignificant from a monitor is great, but I'm personally excited about getting to play it that close up.  \nHere's an older lady enjoying the Oculus Rift\nA word of caution regarding this point, the Oculus Rift is experimental, in fact the consumer version isn't even publicly available yet, so this will be my first time working with this piece of hardware. To be fair that's true of most developers right now, and with Unity's native support for Oculus Rift, it shouldn't be an issue, I just thought I'd be up front about the fact that, hey, something could go wrong.\nHere's a guy who is being reserved about his feelings for the Oculus Rift. Honestly, it could go either way.\nThat soundtrack backer reward is now officially worth something! Awesome composer Marty Meinerz is composing the soundtrack and doing some sound design for the game and is getting 10% of the Kickstarter money. So part of the money you back the project for will go to making the soundtrack better as well! You can hear an early cut of one of the tracks he's making for the game right here, called \"Little Victories.\"\nMarty has a great instinct for memorable rhythms, and is a great addition to the Insignificant team! Here's a video of Marty talking about his ambitions for the Insignificant Soundtrack:\nAnd here's the second proof-of-concept track he's released, \"Tall Order\"\nWhat kind of a game is Insignificant? I'm calling it an Open-World RPG, but both genres are fairly broad, because that could literally mean anything from a free-roaming Final Fantasy to GTA with a leveling system. If I had to make comparisons I'd call it a mix between an Elder Scrolls and Shadow of the Colossus, but comparing games only gets you so far, so let me detail a little more about Insignificant's gameplay.\nStats\nWhen you kill enemies in Insignificant, you'll get experience, which is like a currency you can spend to upgrade your primary statistics (you know the ones, Strength, Vitality, etc), and by doing so, you'll also increase the skills they govern. These stats are balanced so that there is something useful to most players, so increasing Strength will allow you to do more physical damage, break locks more easily, and penetrate magical defenses through brute force.\nIt's no longer useless to get a point in Strength if you only care about casting magic. Does that mean you need to get strength? No, but if you happen to find a piece of gear with all your favorite stats, and also strength, you wont feel like it's going to waste if you put it on. This is key in a game with random loot, otherwise you'd just end up throwing away half of what you find.\nMancies\nPhotoshopped Fish Not Included\nMancies are a list of (currently) 22 different Proficiency choices players will have which allow them to specialize their character more drastically than attribute points. Here are five as an example:\nLoot\nInsignificant has loot. You're going to find stuff on enemies, and you're going to equip that stuff. There's also a crafting system which can supplement your character with gear you have trouble finding. I want the gear to seem kind of dumb, because you're not using it for its intended purpose. That's why your character might see fit to wear a stone or a mushroom on his head.\nFor some reason it's surprising to people that the game as it is now has no inventory limit. You're allowed to sell things whenever you want, but if you choose to hoard everything, you can.\nThere's no encumbrance system set in place, except for the one where you use too much of your computer's memory because you have a billion items in your inventory. I don't know, I've never reached that point yet, but I think we're all mature enough to handle that limit on our own, don't you?\nHand-holding\nThere isn't any. I don't think that people in this day and age really need tutorials telling them how to walk forward and look up and down, that's what instruction manuals are for. There aren't any waypoints floating overhead, because there isn't only one place to go to advance the story. In fact, I am opposed to calling anything in an open-world game a \"story mission,\" because in a true open-world game, there shouldn't be a difference between story missions and \"side missions.\" When I'm playing a game and it tells me \"hey, go here to see the story,\" I think, \"well then why would I go anywhere else? Forget all this other stuff, it's not even related to the story!\"\nBasically I'm designing this game to treat the player like they're someone with a brain who can figure things out for themselves.\nThese features are either already in the game or have been directly added by this Kickstarter.\nController support and Mouse and Keyboard support.\n22 Proficiency Classes (Mancies) which specialize your character\nEarly access to a beta with free updates guaranteed until version 1.0.\nAn open-ended Spell Creation system which allows you to combine virtually any spell effect in the game.\nCraftable equipment, with a tech tree, because I like unlocking stuff.\nThe game is programmed in Unity, so you'll have Windows, Mac and Linux versions of the game if you want them.\nDecyphering system which determines whether or not what the books and notes you find are translated properly. As a result, you wont really ever know if what you're reading is completely true.\nCompendium which tracks all the information you pick up as you travel through the world.\nThrown weapons like Dice and Pills react according to Physics, and will bounce off of objects in the world. Science!\nClimbing system allows players to explore vertically. I'm working on getting this to also work with climbing large enemies like the wolf you see in the trailer, but it isn't in the game yet so I'm not going to promise it just yet.\nCharacter Customization allows you to change the look of your character, and depending on the support the Kickstarter gets, more, hopefully silly and crazy options will manifest.\nIndoor Locations and Outdoor Locations\nBoth Male and Female Playable Characters\nUnderwater Exploration\nOculus Rift Support\n\nGameplay Modes\nThere are a number of different ways to play Insignificant, based on what kind of a person you consider yourself:\nLonely - No enemies spawn, allowing you to spend hours in quiet contemplation. Leaves a large portion of the game out, but sometimes I just want to explore, and that's what this mode is for.\nInsignificant - The baseline \"normal\" mode. Normal stuff happens and it's all really, really normal.\nUnforgiving - Enemies level up as you die, permanently getting stronger each time. Very challenging, possibly even more difficult than the next one.\nMortal - When you die your character is permanently and unceremoniously deleted upon dying. A mode only suited for crazy people. You glorious crazy people.\nWhenever people hear about Insignificant, they immediately start firing off ideas for tiny objects that could be used as weapons or critters who could serve as fearsome enemies, and I love hearing all those suggestions. Honestly it would be hard to implement every single one and still make a game around them unless I had some extra funds to make that happen, but that's why some of the backer rewards are catered to doing just that.\nHave an idea for a weapon? Maybe you don't have an idea, but you'd like me to add another one in to the game anyway?\nInclusive Rewards\nI hate exclusive stuff. Rather than give backers some kind of Exclusive Doritos Double XP Bonus reward that no one else gets, I want to give backers an inclusive reward.\nWhen you get an inclusive Item reward, not only to you get a totally unique reward that wouldn't have been in the game otherwise, but you also give that same reward to everyone who plays the game, and (if you choose to allow it) they'll all know you were their mysterious benefactor, smiling down upon them with a wistful chuckle as they loot their radical new item, because you'll have that item featured next to your name in the credits.\nHere's an example of what that might look like:\nSomething like this, but probably better looking and not made in 5 minutes in photoshop\nI think that's a much better reward than a t-shirt.  \nIn my experience, people who go to Kickstarter like having an impact on the things they back, and what better way to show that than to give you something you can point to in Insignificant and say \"this wouldn't be here if not for me.\"\nOn top of that, instead of getting a reward that gives you something like a shirt that's only tangentially related to the thing you're really after, any inclusive rewards that anyone gets will ultimately make your own experience with Insignificant better and more fully featured than it would've been otherwise. \nIf Insignificant is something you want to see and want to see become great and expansive and have twists and turns at every angle, support this project, write about it, bother your friendly neighborhood game journalists about it, because I want to be able to make this game for you, and you want it to be awesome (I hope), so backing the project is a good idea for both of us.\nContent Creation Guidelines\nInsignificant would never lean on established properties for recognition!\nOkay so if you have an idea for a weapon, helmet, shield, enemy, whatever it is, there are a few guidelines to follow to make sure the tone of the game is consistent, so everyone who is backing the project can rest easy knowing that the items people come up with aren't going to break their immersion or anything.\nAvoid copyrighted materials: That's pretty obvious, right?\nitem suggestions should be real world items\nItems should be about a size where you could reasonably see a 2-3 inch person picking it up. No bigger than a fork, for sure.\nFor example: A Bottle Cap Shield is a perfect item idea (which hasn't been taken yet, by the way), but Cloud's Buster Sword from Final Fantasy VII is probably the polar opposite of a perfect item idea.\nAlso, no memes. I'm sorry, but if you suggest a meme I'll probably say no, because chances are the meme wont be funny by the time the game comes out. You just have to trust me on that one.\n\nGame-Changing New Reward: Insignificant Forum Badge\nOkay so it's pretty small, but for donating at least 10 dollars, you'll get a Forum Badge on the Significant Forums, and you'll keep it FOREVER. Even after society crumbles and the internet goes dark, and the last remnants of man's creations have been reduced to rubble, this forum badge will remain yours as shining proof that you backed Insignificant while it was on Kickstarter.\nI want to be transparent with you guys about how the money received from this Kickstarter will be spent. So here goes:\nBase Goal $1760\n$1500 - Unity Pro Version\n$100 - Steam Greenlight Application Fee\n$160 - 10% Kickstarter/Amazon Payments Fee\nStretch Goal #1 $3000\n$1000 - Creating Art Assets and Textures for indoor furniture and obstacles (at the cheapest option, which is me doing it all myself, I'd put it at about two months of work for one guy, and that would about cover rent for two months, so that seems like a fair amount to ask)\n$112 - Copyright Preregistration Fees\n$124 - 10% Kickstarter/Amazon Payments Fee\n$4 - It was really bothering me not having an even 3000. I don't know, I'll go buy some coffee or something. UPDATE: I bought coffee and announced to the world \"This particular coffee was crowdfunded coffee.\"\nStretch Goal #2 $4000\n$500 - Implementing a Female Playable Character will either cost me at least this much in contracting or I'll spend at least this much in resources creating it myself.\n$410 - Working on Underwater Exploration will take about 400 in resources, to code it, make sure it works, and to make some things to put down there in the water so it isn't just boring and empty.\n$90 - 10% Kickstarter/Amazon Payments Fee.\nStretch Goal #3 $4,500\n$450 - Our composer is getting 10% of the Kickstarter budget to score the soundtrack, so up to this point, that's $450\n$50 - 10% Kickstarter/Amazon Payments Fee\nStretch Goal #4 $5,200\n$340 - Oculus Rift Development Kit\n$220 - Me spending time figuring out how Oculus Rifts work\n$140 - 20% Composer/Kickstarter/Amazon Payments Cut\nStretch Goal #5 $6,500\n$257 - This seems as good a time as any to work in the strangely pricy costs of license fees for registering a legitimate business.\n$783 - I'll have to spend some time creating, or pay someone to create some more facial and body customizations. I estimate this will cost exactly this much. Definitely not to reach an even 6,500.\n$260 - 20% Composer/Kickstarter/Amazon Payments Cut\nStretch Goal #6 $7,700\n$960 - Adding NPCs means a lot of writing. For instance, Mass Effect 3 supposedly had around 40,000 lines of dialogue. It also means a lot of programming as well, and both of those take some serious time and dedication.\n$240 - 20% Composer/Kickstarter/Amazon Payments Cut\nStretch Goal #7 $9,000\n$250 - Purchase of Third Party Shaders and Assets\n$750 - Design and Implement the Alchemy System (Scripting, Modeling crafting items to pick up, drawing item icons)\n$260 - 20% Composer/Kickstarter/Amazon Payments Cut\nStretch Goal #8 $10,000\n$800 - Creating assets and programming the Enchantment system (Weapon particle effects and correctly applying spell effects)\n$200 - 20% Composer/Kickstarter/Amazon Payments Cut\nStretch Goal #9 $13,000\n$2,400 - AI behaviors, highres textures for the humans, story sequences for the humans \n$600 - 20% Composer/Kickstarter/Amazon Payments Cut", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've done my best to only promise what I am sure I can deliver, holding back on mentioning some of the planned features I haven't worked the kinks out of yet, but there is always a possibility that things wont go as planned.\n\nSome things are out of my control as well.

I think my brother John Bailey and I, Jim, always knew we would do this, somehow. We've been making stuff up and playing games since the seventies. We've been fortunate enough to meet, befriend, and work with a whole host of wonderfully creative industry people and passionate fans who have supported us over the last few years to get us to where we are today. This is Kickstarter, not the Iliad, so I won't start rolling off the long list :-). There is one person I do want to mention here, though: John Roberts. His relationship with me began years ago as a devout fan who kept poking me when he thought I was doing something wrong. Now he runs Grindhouse beside me. This Kickstarter is largely due to his quiet but persistent insistence. Come say hi on Facebook. We love to chat.

If the cargo ship from China is hijacked by Indonesian pirates and the black market flooded with cheap Incursion, we'll just print more and get you your rewards.

Equip augments to change your combat style.\nCrash Point provides players with multiple ways to overcome challenges. Either through combat or by hacking into the Net which adds a puzzle and platforming aspect.\nDiscover the rich story as you progress through the game and interact with complex characters\nWe hope to release Crash Point at the end of 2014 or early 2015.\nFollow along at our Blog, Twitter, and Facebook page\n\nCrash Point takes place in a dystopian future where megacorps rule. They wage constant war against each other through hired bands of mercenaries looking for their next paycheck. Their wars exist only to line the pockets of executives and leave shattered lives of the common man in their wake.\nThe puppet government is able to appease the populous with free augmentation programs that are only research programs for the megacorps in disguise. But the people are growing wise and rebellion must be crushed by the super soldiers created through these nefarious means.\nOur story begins in the underbelly of Avalon Prime, an arcology built by the government while it still had some semblance of control. A towering self-sustaining pyramid filled with homes, schools, shops and parks. It was advertised as an idyllic place when it was built, but it was really a housing project for undesirables. Long since has it been abandoned by the government, and the people left to rule themselves. For a long time, Avalon Prime remained off the radar of the megacorps, but now those halcyon days are over and the megacorps see the arcology as a bastion of hope and independence that needs to be snuffed out.\nVal - Val is a merc for hire, or she was. After a mission gone bad she's been black listed. She hasn't had a job in months and she's getting restless. That's when she gets the call from an unknown corp that seeks to employ her. In the past she wouldn't have taken a job for a no name like this but her reputation is shot and she needs cash, augments don't maintain themselves after all. The job seems simple, infiltrate Avalon Prime and bring back Dr. Merculious. If only she knew what was ahead of her, she wouldn't have picked up the phone that day.\nThe Inhabitants of Avalon Prime - Avalon Prime is a big place, the inhabitants are as diverse as their self contained city is large. The base of the pyramid houses all the utilities for the operation of the arcology. The workers there have seen better days. Avoiding the cyber slime that flows through the underbelly is a daily chore that some inhabitants have given up on. Now the slime has mutated them and they're no longer the men they used to be. Yet they carry on working, there's not much else to do.\nMutants\nAs you move up the levels of the arcology, the layer of filth starts to lift, although you feel like you can never really be rid of it. This is where the real life of the arcology can be found. There are various gangs that control sectors of the monolithic structure, some are violent criminals while some are just trying to hold together the remnants of the blossoming community that once lived here. Among them are the Chuppers, the Beta Kids and the B-Tuffs. A community has grown around the Net in this part of the arcology. NetJackers can be seen at consoles in the area living their lives out in virtual reality.\nChuppers\nBeta Kids\nB-Tuffs\nNetJackers\nThe apex of the arcology has quarantined themselves away from the slime and the filth that exist below. They don't mingle with the rest of Avalon Prime and they don't care that their very existence requires the labor of those living below. No one has seen an Upper Avalon resident for over 50 years.\nCultists\nSome of the inhabitants of Avalon Prime are hostile towards Val, and some will become her allies. Val will also have to deal with defense forces and vicious creatures on her journey through the arcology.\nCombat - Val has both a melee and a ranged attack. Her melee is her bread and butter and evolves throughout the game with various combos.\nVal's ranged attack is limited use, you can use your weapon to get you out of tough situations or shoot down a turret that's just out of reach, but you're not going to be running through an area guns blazing. It takes time to recharge your weapon every time you fire off a round.\nFinding and utilizing augments is a big part of the game. Val will find augments for her arms, legs, and body. Each of these will affect combat and game play in different ways. Many of the arm augments will alter the combos that Val does or her combat style. Leg augments tend to effect the way Val moves through the level. Body and head augments are variable and effect various aspects of the game.\nHacking - Hacking is one of the unique elements of this game that sets it apart from other metroidvanias. Hacking stages will be different through out the game and will offer challenging puzzles and platforming areas. The goal is always the same though, get to the Crash Point. The Crash Point is a visual representation of an exploit in the program that Val can use to manipulate the environment in some way.\nVal will also be able to store programs that she has exploited in her suit. She can hack into a different area and once she's reached the Crash Point she can run one of her programs to try to use that exploit to her advantage\nSince we want a lot of variety in this part of the game, a lot of the design decisions are open ended. We will be sharing stages with the community and listening to feedback about what kinds of stages they'd like to see more of.\nConcept Level Design For a Hacking Stage\nHere are a few of the tracks that we have so far for the game. Just like the art for the game, some of the tracks might get changed during development. But this should give you an idea for the kind of music we'll have in the game.\nThis song, Chup-1, is currently what we have in mind as the theme for the Chuppers. It'll be playing in some of their hangouts.\nThis song, Dark, is what we are probably going to use during part of the intro animation. We'll see Val getting her mission and flying to the Arcology.\nWe also have a lot of music that doesn't have a designated area yet. We'll be using them for when Val is just walking around the arcology or when she gets into fights. This is one of our favorites, Super.\nSo far we have a lot of the framework for the game. We have much of the basic programming done, as well as the beginnings of our art, sound and music libraries. We have the story planned out and we know how we want the player to progress through the game. The rest of development will consist of polishing what we have already and building out the rest of the world and characters.\nThe scope of this project is large but we are confident that we will be able to deliver. We've been thinking about Crash Point for over a year, but until recently regular life got in the way. We planned out a lot of the game over that year but were unable to get the amount of work done that we wanted to. So, we decided to take one month out of our lives and produce enough work to launch a great Kickstarter. Everything we've shown you in this Kickstarter has been done in just over one month. That's all of the programming, character creation and level design from the ground up. Unfortunately we can't keep working at this pace forever because we have bills to pay. If we're successfully funded we won't have to throttle back, we can keep going at the pace we did in this month for over a year.\nWhich brings us to where the money is going.\nMost of the money is going to go to the development team. We've asked for just enough to fully support two of our team members for over a year and provide the rest of the team with enough funds to devote after work hours to the project.\nWe are lucky to have a team that is capable of making, the art, music and sound for this game. So we don't have to commission any of that from outside sources.\nMost of the project so far has been done on free software like Gimp and Unity. Gimp has been great but it has some limitations, we'd like to purchase Photoshop for a few of our team members and to buy more sophisticated sound editing software.\nFor all of the digital goods, we'll have those distributed to you on the day we release the game. The delivery date for the physical rewards will vary. For the t-shirt, we'll be able to get that to you 1-3 months after the kickstarter ends. The art book will not be shipped until near the end of the project.\n$50,000 - Port to Playstation and XBox. With this level of funding we will be able to purchase licenses and devote the time required to port Crash Point to these consoles.\n$60,000 - Animated Cut scenes throughout the game. We already plan to have an animated opening and closing scene, but we'd love to be able to have cut scenes for all the major plot points.\n$70,000 - A playable prologue chapter detailing the events leading to Val's blacklisting. Val's back story plays a huge role in the story of Crash Point, we think it would be awesome to deliver a short playable version of that back story.\nIf we make these goals we have a few more things in mind that we'd love to do with the game, but we want to keep those under wraps for now. Once we reach our $40,000 goal, we'll start updating with more stretch goals!\nThe development team of Crash Point is a group of friends from Chicago who have shared a love for video games since they met during high school. We spent many years after high school working at our day jobs or going to college, but always coming home to video games. To us video games aren\u2019t just a hobby they make up a huge part of how we define ourselves. So when we sat down and assessed our various abilities we realized if we put a lot of hard work into it, it seemed like we would have what it takes to make a video game of our own.\nOur lead programmer, Cuauh, wasn\u2019t a programmer at all when we began, but over the past year and a half he has come home from work every night and spent 3-4 hours teaching himself programming. Once he had acquired enough knowledge to start programming the actual game, the rest of the team started their work in earnest. We spend our nights and weekends honing our various skills and learning what we need to learn in order to make this game come to life.\nWe\u2019re not starting completely from scratch though. All of the people on the team were knowledgeable in certain areas and we\u2019re using everyone\u2019s strengths. Our lead artist VivaGoBoom has been working intermittently as an artist. Our sound man, Will, has been recording sounds and making new sounds with his synthesizer since before this video game was even a thought in our heads. He is also a talented artist himself and graduated from college with a degree in Industrial Design. He\u2019s also been teaching himself some programming, so although he is in charge of sound he is also the jack of all trades in the group. Our music man, Brian, has been making music for fun since as long as we\u2019ve known him. He knows how to play a few instruments and used to do some local touring with his band, he\u2019s also constantly making new tracks on his computer. Shelagh is the last person on our team. When the rest of us are working hard at our specific goals, she is there to fill in the gaps, anything that we need from her she\u2019s able to get done.\nWe make no claims that any of us are experts at what we\u2019re doing yet, but we are dedicated and full of passion. We want to deliver a game that people will love and we are willing to work hard to accomplish that goal.\nThe Team:\nCuauhtemoc Rodriguez: Lead Programmer\nVivaGoBoom: Lead Artist\nWill Church: Sound/Programming/Art\nBrian Tasch: Music\nShelagh Rodriguez: Art/Miscellaneous", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first attempt at making a game so there are risks that go along with us being new. However, I think you can see from the work we've produced that we're dedicated and capable of delivering on our promise. The benefit of this game being in the alpha stages mean we can be very interactive with the community and address their concerns through out development.\n\nThe scope of this project is somewhat large, and for first time game makers we understand that we might not be accurate when we estimate a release date. Our hope is to have this game finished by December of 2014 but it's possible that a game of this length and complexity will take longer than expected. We will reign ourselves in however and make sure that we focus on the core elements that people want out of our game and not get caught up in every minute feature we want to add in.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Indy Pup Games\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nThe development team of Crash Point is a group of friends from Chicago who have shared a love for video games since they met during high...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project ends": "SEPTEMBER 1, 2013"}, {"Project launches": "AUGUST 2, 2013"}]}], "comment_no": 3, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/10589586/crash-point", "project_name": "Crash Point"}}, {"backer": "Mark Taormino", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In the late 1950\u2019s, the Soviets were pressured into a quick follow-up to the success of Sputnik 1. As they scrambled to launch Sputnik 2, they included plans to launch the first organism into orbit as a way to up the ante on the Americans. They took stray dogs off the street and put them through rigorous tests and training. One of these strays was the dog we know now as Laika. She was selected to be the first dog in space and was launched aboard Sputnik 2 on November 3, 1957. Unfortunately, in their haste, the Soviets did not incorporate any method to return Laika to Earth. At the time, it was said she was humanely euthanized after several days in orbit. It was revealed decades later that she most likely died from heat exhaustion shortly after leaving the Earth's atmosphere.\nWe all have a sense of how dependent and trusting dogs are and it\u2019s this aspect of their nature that makes the story of Laika so tragic. The more we read about the details of this story, the more we became obsessed with making it right. What if Laika didn\u2019t die? What if she came back to Earth? How would she treat the people that seemingly betrayed her?\nThese questions developed into the alternate universe of the game. The tide of Soviet power rolling across the face of the Earth was strong, but not inexorable - until novel, strange energy sources were discovered. The impunity granted by these new engines of destruction lit a fire under the Russian war machine. So when Stalin rolled into Paris, the resulting flare-up of global conflict left little more than smoking ash heaps where America and Great Britain had been, and left the less developed countries of the world in the shadow of a newly unipolar, unabashedly imperial USSR. Now, Stalin is dead. Though resistance movements have emerged, the Soviets still stand supreme as rulers of the globe. Only a force from beyond the earth could possibly tip the balance. Abram Krupin, who leads one of many resistance cells alonsgide his wife, Amulya Diggavi, knows this. When he sees a dog fall from the stars, then, he takes it as an omen. This dog speaks, wears silver armor, and has an arsenal of mysterious weapons. Abram calls her Laika.\nLaika believes that, despite all odds, she can protect the countless lives crushed by the Soviets.\nLaika Believes is a 2D action platformer in the same vein as Cave Story and Iji with some Metroid and Deus Ex influences as well. What makes Laika Believes unique? \nMassive, nonlinear levels that model the layouts of real locations in a way not yet seen in other platformers \nLarge, choice-rich skill trees that let players approach the game the way they want to \nA novel defensive mechanic that lets players turn the firepower of Laika's enemies against them \nUse combinations of offensive and defensive techniques in unique and exciting ways\nSmoothly flowing, fast-paced shooting action \nA story of struggle and hope, full of twists and revelations \nRich, evocative art depicting a world dominated by a technologically ascendant Soviet empire \nSecrets and rewards hidden in every corner for the determined player\n\u201cThe idea of the game is so cool, so ambitious and utterly bat-crap, that it could be amazing.\u201d - Stephen Johnson, G4\nLaika Believes has been in various stages of production for about 2 years now. We got this far through an initial fundraise with angel investors.\nLaika Believes is planned to be a three-part release. The first episode, The Sun at Night (SAN), is nearing completion. During the course of development so far we have:\nBuilt an engine from scratch using XNA, MonoGame, and OpenGL\nSpent tons of time of pre-production with story writing, gameplay design, and art prototyping\nConstructed and designed all of the levels from The Sun at Night (SAN) and have the skeletons complete.\nDesigned and implemented a unique 3D mapping system for our 2D world.\nTested and refined aspects of gameplay mechanics\nDesigned a soundtrack aesthetic that fits with the world we are building and begun composing music\nDeveloped a nanomachine system as both an important part of the world and of gameplay as a crafting system\nDesigned and implemented a complex upgrade system to allow players to tailor their gameplay experience\nCreated beautiful, hand drawn 2D art assets to populate the wire framed levels and breathe life to the world we are creating.\n\nThis first installment will be about 5 - 15 hours of gameplay depending on how you choose to play the game. Laika Believes: SAN will include a prologue and four large non-linear levels. The game is very narrative-driven and you can choose to explore this narrative in depth or to bypass parts of the game and move quickly, keeping the action high-octane.\n\u201cThe characters are well-realized, the dialogue well-written and the concept gripping\u201d - Jordan Mallory, Joystiq\nUsing Kickstarter for our final raise allows us to start a conversation with the future players of Laika Believes and get your feedback on what features you\u2019d like to see in the final product.\nOne of the awards is Alpha Access and we want to use this as a true testing environment where we can get a great influx of feedback to help us tweak the final game and make it as great as we know it can be. Kickstarter is the perfect platform for this!\nIn our previous campaign, in which we asked for $100k before we found ample funding privately to cover most of our costs, we learned pretty early on that localization is going to be important for this game. Learning more about our diverse audience is an incredible byproduct of Kickstarter.\n\"Yup, totally sold on this idea\" Earnest Cavalli, The Escapist\nWe are asking for $20,000 which will be split almost evenly between finalizing the sound design/effects and localization costs.\nWe were fortunate enough to raise significant funds through private investors, but we need your help to perfect the sound design and bring the game to as many people as we can!\n\u201cSoviet soldiers, robotic versions of man\u2019s best friend, and in-depth character and exploration?

Laika Believes promises to be such a game.\" -True Achievements \nThe fun part! We've pulled together some really awesome rewards as a thank you for supporting Laika Believes.

Thank you.\n______________________________________________\n     Dungeon Attack! is a fast-paced, action packed dice game where you and your friends venture into an ancient dungeon, defeat angry monsters, and search for treasure.\n     Each die represents a monster. A single die is a strong monster while rolling a handful of dice represents weak minions fighting at their master's will.\n     The game pack easily accommodates four players and more can join in on the fun with additional dice packs.\n     Dungeon Attack! is played in a series of abstract dungeon levels. The rules introduces players to a dungeon consisting of three levels, but you are free to configure the game as you see fit by changing the number of levels and the Monster Dice found in each.\n     Before delving into the dungeon each player selects an Adventurer Card. We prefer the random method but any method the players agree on is acceptable. Each Adventurer has a unique ability and an Attack Rating. The Attack Rating is the maximum number of Monster Dice they are allowed to defeat each turn.\n   After everyone in the game has selected an Adventurer, it is time to bust the door in. The first player picks up all the Monster Dice in the dungeon room, rolls them, and sorts them by their symbols. Defeated Monster are set aside out of the game, but used later to search for treasure. Moving Monsters are sent fleeing back into the dungeon room, or passed to other players. Lastly, Attacking Monsters stay with you to roll on your next turn. If it happens that all dice turn up with the attacking symbol, the adventurer takes a hit. On the third hit the adventurer is knocked out.\n     Each player takes a turn rolling the dice or if free from monsters, use an ability or magical item, until all the monsters in that level have been defeated or have fled. Once this has been accomplished, each player rolls their pile of defeated dice to see what treasures they find before moving on to the next level.\n     At the end of the last level, the adventurer with the highest tally of gold is declared the most successful adventurer.\n     Each turn is quick and presents the players with multiple actions to choose from. Cooperation is key to successfully finishing the dungeon but as we have found out, gold and magical items will bring out competitive play which is okay and has lead to some memorable moments.\n     A copy of the rules in a working draft format is available on our website or click on this link: Dungeon Attack! Rules. To watch a video on how the game plays head over to our YouTube Channel.\nATTACK DICE GAME SYSTEM\n     The Attack Dice Game System is a set of dice mechanics that consist of six-sided dice with three symbols on each. The Remove Symbol takes the dice out of the game (1 in 6), the Move Symbol moves the dice away from the player (2 in 6), and the Stay Symbol keeps the dice with the player until next turn (3 in 6). With this simple set of rules we have been able to create games with interesting themes and player interaction.\n     Our first game, When Zombies Attack! came out in 2012 and the rules are free to download on our website. Dungeon Attack! we present to you here, and Super Attack! is slated for a 2014 release date.\nSince you asked...the following add-ons are available at the extra cost listed under each entry. These add-ons are found under the different pledge levels but are listed here for those who wish to have additional copies or who prefer to pick and choose.

One night we came across an old man called Geom Sa Terdun (he told us just to call him Bob) tossing a curious object from one hand to another.\nScientifically expeditioning, we asked him what it was. He told us it was part of a game, which he called Pop, Lock \u2018n\u2019 Rooooll, although he said it in Missinmoonese, of course. By the light of the stars and a kerosene lamp (no moon, remember) he taught us how to play this curious game. And it was the BEST GAME WE HAD EVER PLAYED.\nIt was an intriguing mix of card game and dice game, with the cards slotting intriguingly onto the die. The values on the faces never stayed the same for long as cards were taken from the die to be played. (It sounds more complicated than it is! Trust us it's really easy to play, it must be because we\u2019re really bad when it comes to rules.)\nRead the Rules here \u2192\nWe decided not to visit the famous Bat Splat caves of the Lunarless Valley, or look for the legendary Baa Bird \u2013 the only avian known to have wool instead of feathers, and we passed on the Great Cheese Lake Festival. Instead we spent the rest of the expedition exploring the possibilities of this AMAZING GAME, the name of which we stylishly abbreviated to PLnR.\nAnd Bob was a happy man. He was the last of his tribe, the last man alive on the planet to know the mysteries of PLnR. We had come across him just in time!\nOur expedition soon came to an end and we bade Bob a fond farewell and let him thrash us at the game one last time.\nAs we sailed away Bob waved and shouted at us \u2013 \u201cTell all the world about Pop, Lock \u2018n\u2019 Rooooll! Give it away for FREE \u2013 none of that pretend freemium hogwash! And set up a website too, not a crappy one though, a good one that\u2019s robust and will last a long time, where everyone can get everything they need to play the game. Oh, and encourage everyone to make their own changes and share their ideas!\u201d\nAs we marvelled at how technically savvy Bob was, a kraken reared up out of the water and dragged him to a watery grave. We would have got photos, but someone forgot the charge the batteries. We won\u2019t name names, not here, this is neither the time nor the place\u2026 Jon.\nAnyway, we were left with the last words of Bob, the last member of his tribe and the last bastion of the secrets of POP, LOCK 'N' ROOOOLL! And we will honour his dying wishes. We will take his GREAT GAME and give it away for FREE.\nBut we need your help.\n\nTWEET ABOUT US! - @PopLocknRooooll\nTELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT US ON FACEBOOK!\nSHOUT ABOUT US IN THE STREET!\nBACK US! - EVERY PENNY COUNTS!\nThink of a trading card game like Magic: The Gathering, but you don\u2019t hold the cards in your hand, instead you slot them onto the faces of a large dice. When it\u2019s your turn to go you take a card from one of the faces of your dice and play it, then you roll the dice. Using whatever special powers the card gives you and the number you roll you try to beat your opponent over a series of rolls \u2013 BLASTING AWAY cards from their dice and the deck that replenishes the cards on their dice. Whoever runs out of cards first, is the loser!\nAnd the big dice are called Rumble Bots and the cards are called Slides.\n\nYou can download the rules here.\n\nOkay, that\u2019s the game in a nutshell, now imagine you don\u2019t have to spend any money to get new cards, you just download them, print and cut them out, and you\u2019re away and playing! Actually, the same goes for the big dice. Pay to play? Forget it, those big toy companies are dinosaurs, and not the cool kind, the boring kind that nobody talks about and will never appear in a Jurassic Park movie.\n\nThis is a Rumble Bot prototype - Click on it to download it, print it and make it!\nSlides - These slot onto your Rumble Bot and give the game its depth. We're just getting underway with one of our biggest tasks, which is converting all our little scrawled but highly playable Slides into great looking, easy to understand components.\nRight about now you\u2019re probably starting to understand why we\u2019re on Kickstarter. We need your help to give things away! First of all we\u2019re only asking for the merest smidgen, the bare minimum we need to get this off the ground, because the most important thing for us is to get it into your hands.\n\nNow for some specifics.\nWe all know it\u2019s possible to throw up a cheapo website for a few bucks. That\u2019s all well and good for your average blog but it\u2019s a recipe for disaster when you\u2019re dealing with large image files that you hope the whole world will want to download. So we need to be able to afford a good hosting solution and guarantee it can be hosted for years to come \u2013 this project isn\u2019t some short term escapade, we have very long term plans for it.\nBuilding a good website is not a trivial matter, we know, we've built good websites. Our skinniest implementation of the website won\u2019t be overly complicated, in terms of the initial content, but it has to be built to scale-up to the demands we will be put on it in the future. As time goes by we\u2019ll be adding more content and more functionality, and we don\u2019t want to be building all that on a foundation of sand, we want solid rock beneath our feet.\nWhatever happens we want to website to be able to run for a good long time, even with a high volume of traffic. You'd be surprised at how rapidly traffic costs can escalate when a website starts to pull in a respectable amount of users, especially when there's a range of high quality images to download.\nPotentially, advertising on the website could help us with these costs, but relying on ad revenue would be a lot like relying on the lottery; even some fairly high volume websites fail to generate good earnings from ads. And, let\u2019s face it, wouldn't you prefer it if we didn't have to run ads on the website?\nAlthough we know the game plays well, we also know all too well that there's a large amount of work to be done between proof of concept and having something that can be released. Every single Slide needs to be usability tested before we can go anywhere near beta testing. Usability testing is done to make sure that the game makes sense to the player.\nTo conduct the testing we need a fresh crop of unspoiled folk, who we don\u2019t know all that well, and who don\u2019t know anything about the game. Usability testing also isn't normally all that much fun for the subjects, and to get good usability testers we need to reward them with tokens of our appreciation. We're sure some of you good folk would readily volunteer, but usability testing is best done face-to-face; and trust us when we tell you it's no fun.\nFinally, refining the designs for Rumble Bots and Slides isn't as cheap as you might expect. As we progress with the designs we have we\u2019re constantly making little tweaks, and every tweak needs to be tested in the only way we know how \u2013 by printing a version and building it. As time goes by we're working our way through plenty of paper and pots of glue quite quickly. But that cost is nothing compared to printer ink, which always runs out when we need it most (which is always). And so far we\u2019ve only got a couple of Rumble Bots designed, so who knows how much paper, glue and ink we\u2019ll have used by the time we launch.\nWithout your generous help there\u2019s no way we can get Pop, Lock \u2018n\u2019 Rooooll to the standard we need to in order to launch it on the world.\nWe desperately need your help.\nThis project is our life, and our goals are far reaching. Help us SMASH past the paltry 5k funding target and come on a journey with us, a journey through the Roooolliverse of STRETCH GOALS where we\u2026 Unleash the Rumble Room; Dance for delectation and delight; Boost the website with forums for easy ideas exchanging; Put in your hands a shiny sleek creation app; SHOUT about the best bits from the forums; Broadcast \u201chow to\u201d and \u201cmaking of\u201d videos \u2013 including cutting edge 3D print designs; Super MEGA-IFY the app; Tour the world visiting YOU; Stage the first ever Pop, Lock \u2018N\u2019 Rooooll World Championship!

LOCK! AND ROOOOLL!\nShortly after we launched we got a message suggesting a cracking idea: Richard Fleming wrote to us to suggest we ask folk to help out refining the designs of the Slides we already have. Specifically he suggested we change Deck Jam to \u201cNailed It\u201d and Mirror Mountain to \u201cIn Your Face\u201d.\nWe might well take him up on those ideas, and we are massively grateful for his ideas.\nSome of the other Slides we have work great on a pure gameplay level, but they don't necessarily have great names. 10 out of 10 for gameplay, not so much out of 10 for exciting names.\nSo, we offer up the following selection of Slides for your superb renaming suggestions.\nSend us a message and tell us what you think these Slides should be called. But not only that, you can suggest thematic changes to the text too, to go along with your name idea.

You play as Tom, a reluctant hero/software engineer with a newly acquired demon arm (and the powers that go along with it). The intended platforms are, for now, PC and Mac (though Linux and consoles are a future possibility). Also, the awesome music you hear in the intro cinematic and the trailers was composed by Danny Baranowsky, who is a bad ass, and has agreed to do the music for the game, because one of the things I know literally nothing about is how to compose music.\nSome of the art is still placeholder, and will be replaced with something more interesting. The most obvious things are the items that drop will be something other than colored orbs, and that the guns will actually look unique and interesting. In fact, the only two guns that are functionally \u201ccomplete\u201d (aside from the actual gun art) are the Arc Cannon (lightning gun) and the Plasma Rifle (the thing that shoots green stuff). The others will be upgraded/updated and more interesting, over the top guns will be added. The generic guns (shotgun, assault rifle, smg, pistol) are there as placeholders right now to test out functions of the powers/weapon system, but will end up being something cooler in the final game.\nImpending demon slam beat-down.\nGameplay Style\nIf I had to describe the gameplay in as few words as possible, I would say think Ratchet and Clank meets Bastion. There may be some light puzzle solving, but mainly you will be fighting things and advancing the story.\nGameplay in AoH is fast-paced and skill based. That means that your ability to manipulate your character and, well, shoot things, is more important than any kind of \u201cstats\u201d on your weapons or character. There will be some light RPG elements, but I hesitate to call it an RPG because there aren\u2019t classes and traditional leveling, so to me, that makes it not an RPG. I know, I know, it\u2019s isometric. Doesn\u2019t that inherently imply that it\u2019s an Action RPG? The modern games media would lead me to believe that is indeed the case, but I am resisting such designations.\nThe chain-lightning style Arc Cannon in action.\nThe game will support both mouse and keyboard as well as a gamepad. The primary development platform is mouse and keyboard, since it\u2019s how I personally like to play, but don\u2019t worry, gamepad support will not be half-assed and tacked on. I have several plans to make sure that gamepad mode is every bit as fun and intuitive as mouse and keyboard.\nAs far as ways you can attack, there will be guns, melee, demon powers, and gadgets. Some will deal damage, some will have some other utility effect\u2026 you know\u2026 like in video games. Oh, and you can periodically turn into a giant demon and wreck everything in sight. That\u2019s important too.\nStory Telling\nThe story will be told primarily through the level opening narratives (like above), as well as in-game cutscenes, both interactive and non-interactive. Don\u2019t worry, though, almost every cut scene will be skipable, as long as skipping it wouldn\u2019t break the game state. I love exposition, but the 3rd time I\u2019ve watched an unskippable cutscene I generally want to claw my eyes out.\nA shot from on one of the in-game cutscenes.\nEnemies\nIn the videos you\u2019ve seen (if you haven\u2019t seen them\u2026 what kind of person reads words before they watch videos?), there are three distinct enemy types, a mid-boss who is a scaled, slightly altered version of the normal ghouls, and the boss. The plan is to have a lot more enemy types in the main game. There will be variations on all the standard types (ie: red ghouls who have a fire attack, blue ones who have an ice attack\u2026) as well as many other unique enemies that don\u2019t appear in the videos. Some of them have already been concepted, some are just ideas on paper, but suffice to say that there will be many more and they will be distinct from one another. Not all of them will be mindless monsters either, which the early demons qualify as.\nOne of the higher level demons Tom will encounter on his journey.\nThe World\nThe game doesn\u2019t actually all take place in an office, despite what the first level and intro video might lead you to believe. As much as Hell is invading the office, the office has actually invaded Hell, and Tom will spend a good deal of time in Hell itself, not just running around cubicles.\nThe Hell dimension in the AoH world has its own government and economy, and there are higher order demons who do more than growl and attack. The first level actually takes place in The Void, which is the space between Hell and Earth. Only lower order demons tend to leak into the void, but once Tom arrives in Hell proper, there will be much more to contend with.\nAn early concept piece of the office environment from the demo level.\nWhile a good amount of the game takes place in Hell, the office and weapons lab beneath it remain important parts of the game. Several levels will be different sections of the office/lab that have been scattered around Hell after passing through The Void.\nWhile traveling through the hellscape, Tom will run into a variety of different non-demonic entities as well. Everything from the Titans who have claimed a section of Hell as their own and don\u2019t care for their demon neighbors, to survivors from the office who have formed rag-tag refugee groups in an effort to survive in their new home, or in some cases gone a bit nutty and set up their own fiefdoms in the ruins of the office complex.\nBoss Fights\nOne of the areas I want to pay particular attention to is boss fights. I want the boss fights to really feel different than normal fights. To that end, bosses will generally be very large (you can see the first boss in the gameplay teaser), and will have multiple states. What I do not want is a boss fight that is just a scaled up version of a normal enemy with a sack of hit points.\nPower Ups\nPower ups are going to be a major part of the game as well, because I like them, and we don\u2019t see enough of them. Things like damage multipliers, shields, speed boosts, all kinds of temporary effects. There will also be a super-charger powerup for your guns, which will temporarily give you unlimited ammo and dramatically change the function of your weapon. So, for a laser blaster, it would transform into a laser gattling gun, whereas a rocket launcher would go from firing one normal rocket to firing 5 drunken rockets that arc all over the screen sending ragdolls flying. Things like that.\nYou mentioned RPG elements?\nThe RPG elements I mentioned will come in through the weapons system. As you unlock/find new weapons, you will also be able to upgrade your existing weapons. These upgrades will be structured as short trees, much like a talent tree in other games. Fully upgrading a weapon in different trees will result in a weapon that actually functions, somehow differently than the other (at least that\u2019s the intent). An example would be a rocket launcher. By default you could either upgrade it towards single rockets with massive damage, or a cluster of small rockets, a rocket shotgun, as it were. They would both start as the same gun, but the final product would actually work and feel quite different (and serve a slightly different purpose).\nThere will also be similar options to upgrading your character and/or demon powers. There will be the same standard upgrades you find in most games, health, damage resistance, speed, as well as upgrades related to specific powers/functions.\nWill there be loot?\nMaybe? This is a tricky one. On the one hand, loot isn\u2019t particularly hard to add, and I love it. I already have a functional item system in the game. On the other hand, implementing loot in a way that is not shitty and tacked on is much more subjectively challenging. The more you make a game about loot, the less it is about skill, and so the balance of those two things becomes kind of tricky, and the more you focus on balance, the less you focus on fun. If the game is focused on, for lack of a better term, \u201ctwitch skill\u201d, then loot becomes functionally meaningless. If, on the other hand, you make loot important enough that the player actually cares, now the game is less about skill and more about making sure you\u2019re decked out in the best gear. So, I am leaning toward some loot, but it certainly won\u2019t be a paper-doll simulator like Diablo 2 (I say Diablo 2 because I chose to live in a world where Diablo 3, like the second two Matrix movies, does not exist).\nGame Length/Size\nThe game\u2019s final length is always going to be a slightly moving target, and is somewhat subjective anyway, considering everyone plays games at a different pace. The story is written and divided, as one does, into 3 acts of approximately the same size. The goal is to produce a game with a main story-line that takes around 5-7 hours to complete. In addition, the plan is to have at least a New Game Plus style mode, to provide some replay value, but there are other plans for increased replay value as well which I\u2019ll detail in the stretch goals area.\nWho is making this?\nI am. No, really, it\u2019s just me. I\u2019m weird like that. On the upside, I have years of experience in both games and film VFX, so I know what I\u2019m doing. I was the Technical Art Lead on Champions Online and Star Trek Online, worked briefly on the new Tombraider game, and then shifted to film VFX at Industrial Light and Magic, where I worked on Transformers 3, Battleship, Cloud Atlas (briefly), The Lone Ranger, and Pacific Rim.\nWhile almost the entire game is being made by myself, I did outsource some of the office props to an awesome company called Axion Studios, and that\u2019s part of what this Kickstarter is about, getting enough money to continue hiring out portions of the art where appropriate to contractors who are better than I am at specific things (and faster) so that the quality of the game continues to increase, and so that my work week starts to decline from 100 hours to a more manageable 70 or so.\nHow Far Are You?\nWell, as you can see in the videos, I\u2019m pretty far from a systems standpoint. That means, all the core functionality is all working pretty solidly, and most of the big technical decisions have been made, and hurdles have been\u2026 er\u2026 hurdled. There is a modular powers system in place that allows me to very easily add new powers and weapons, and the enemy system is very simple to work with now. The code/systems for the game are probably over 80% done, which leaves the content (levels, final art\u2026), which is a much, much lower percent completed.\nMy best estimate is that the game will take approximately a year to complete, and I\u2019m planning on having that turn in to 18 months, because that just tends to be how these kind of projects evolve. You rarely surprise yourself by finishing early.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThis is an easy one. I can\u2019t afford to self-fund the entire game myself, and I knew that from the beginning. I\u2019ve taken it as far as I can with a combination of my own money and money borrowed from family. When I first started this project I knew it wasn\u2019t possible to make while also working my full-time job, so I got as far as I could, proved the idea to myself, and then took the leap. That was about a year ago. The progress has been great, but there is a lot more to do, and to do it I\u2019m going to need someone\u2019s help. I\u2019m coming to Kickstarter first because I\u2019d rather be beholden to gamers than to a traditional publisher.\nWhere will the Money Go?\nA few places. A good chunk of it will go to feeding my family (myself, my significant other, and our dog) and keeping a roof over our heads. I have already invested a lot of money and time into the project, but if I\u2019m going to be able to finish it, I will need some other source of funding. In addition, I need to be able to pay contractors so that the game can be completed in a reasonable amount of time, and at the quality level I\u2019m targeting. There are also, I\u2019m sure, other fixed development costs that I will run into down the line that I\u2019m not predicting (software upgrades, hardware failures, legal/business fees, convention fees\u2026) and I\u2019ll need to be able to cover them.\nStretch Goals\nHere\u2019s the fun/scary section. You\u2019ll notice I don\u2019t have specific target amounts tied to anything, like many Kickstarters do. I don\u2019t, because I can\u2019t imagine how anyone at such an early stage in development can commit to specific features like that. The reality is, you can\u2019t, not even when you have a 50 person team, let alone when you\u2019re working on your own. However, I want to give you an idea of some of the features I want to add, and will add if I am able to, either before or after release, depending on how much money I\u2019m able to raise through this campaign.\nUnlockable Player Characters\nThis is a big one. I really want to do this, for obvious reasons. The design is structured to support it, and the idea would be that the guns are the same, but where Tom has demon based powers (and can turn into a demon), each other characters powers and abilities would be based around another theme. If you\u2019ve watched the intro cinematic, you can probably guess who the first unlockable character would be. This would also, in my mind, add a lot more replay value.\nSome Amount of Level Randomness\nI do not plan on doing Diablo-style random levels because, honestly, doing them well is extremely difficult and the game scope is large enough as is. That said, I would love to inject some level of randomness into the game so that subsequent play-throughs remain interesting. I have a few ideas of how to do this, but whether I am able to get to this is going to be dependent largely on if I have enough time to spend on it, and if it ultimately seems to add any real value beyond a bullet point for marketing purposes.\nAct Ending Cinematics\nI would love to do a cinematic, similar in style to the intro cartoon, for the end of each of the three Acts. That was, however, a TON of work for me to do by myself, so if I\u2019m going to do that, I will almost certainly need to contract with an outside animation studio to do the actual final animation. This makes it very doable time-wise, but very expensive. More than any other stretch goal, this one is definitely tied to how well the Kickstarter does. No matter what I\u2019ll have some kind of exposition, similar to the level intro, which is more of a motion comic, but fully animated cinematics to end each act would, I think, add a lot.\nVoice Over\nThis one is kind of tricky too. It\u2019s easy to say that voice-over is always better than no voice-over, but anyone who has heard amateur voice-over knows that isn\u2019t really true. Also, when you\u2019re writing, especially humor, you write differently if it\u2019s going to be read by the viewer, or performed by a voice actor. At a minimum I\u2019ll do something like in the newer Zelda games, where lines aren\u2019t necessarily spoken, but are accompanied by some kind of emoted generic voice-over sound that fits the dialog. However, if the Kickstarter does well enough, and I have enough room in the budget to hire real voice actors to do full voice-over, I may just adjust the writing style and make voice over the target medium, and just have the text as captions.\nLocal Coop\nThis is another big one. It\u2019s a little more complicated because AoH is, first and foremost, a single player game, but local coop is a blast, so I\u2019d love to include it. There really isn\u2019t much more to say than that. Everyone knows what it is, and that it\u2019s cool, but adding it in a way that doesn\u2019t detract from the single player experience can be tricky, so it\u2019s a stretch goal.\nWhy No Online Coop?\nBecause net code is sheer agony. The early prototype of the game actually had network coop, but maintaining that code was a nightmare, and far too big a task for one person who is also doing everything else involved with development. If you want to know why netcode sucks to write, there are some articles about TF2\u2019s network code out there. Most of it isn\u2019t really that bad, as long as the game isn\u2019t competitive and doesn\u2019t need to be server authoritative (then you get into prediction code to hide latency, which is painful), but either way, it adds a certain percentage modifier to how long everything else takes, and it just isn\u2019t realistic for this game, sadly.\nConsoles?\nAnother big giant maybe. I would love to support consoles, and Unity theoretically works on them, but there are hurdles. One, the game\u2019s visual design is not really in the wheel-house of the PS3 and 360. That doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t look good, it just means there would need to be a lot of optimization. PS4 and Xbox One would, I\u2019m sure, solve that, but too little information exists about developing for them for me to commit to anything. Two, everything I\u2019ve ever heard about developing for consoles sounds like a miserable, thankless, agonizing journey of corporate bureaucratic bullshit. I\u2019m even uneasy about the lack of transparency involved in Steam/Steam Greenlight, so Sony and Microsoft really\u2026 concern me. That said, maybe I\u2019m paranoid and it would be easy/beneficial to all involved. I\u2019m not ruling it out, but I\u2019m certainly not going to promise it.\nRewards\nNote: Physical rewards will ship earlier than the December 2014 date, which is the estimated date for the game's launch. I don't have an exact date, but as soon as the drive ends, I'll begin processing the physical rewards.\nThe Game - $15\nYou get a digital copy of the game when it\u2019s completed. If everything goes according to plan, it will be via Steam. If not\u2026 it will be via some other method. The mystery is part of the fun!\nThe Game Double Limited Edition - $20\nFor the first 1000 people who want it, for $5 more you get two copies of the game! That means you can give one to your morally dysfunctional software pirate friend to cleanse him of his karmic transgressions. Or you could give it to an honest friend I guess, because the other guy probably already has it, because\u2026 you know\u2026 internet. I mean, let\u2019s be honest, its digital, so by \u201ccopies\u201d we really mean that you get to give the game to a friend and not feel shitty about doing it.\nThe Game Double Regular Edition - $25\nThe same as above, except you waited too long. Way to go. You just lost out on $5. Warren Buffet you are not. But, hey, a deals a deal, and every little bit helps\u2026 me.\nRavings (and drawings) of a Madman Digital Edition - $35\nYou get two copies of the game, and a cool development journal/art book I\u2019ll put together at the end of development in PDF format. No, I swear, it will actually be cool. You\u2019ll not only get to see the final game art that you will have already seen, but also half-finished sketches and lesser quality art that was done and deemed too crappy to include in the game! Joking aside, I\u2019ll be including a timeline of several characters (how they started as several sketches, all the way up through more finished concept sketches and the final models), as well as some background info on the story and how it evolves over the course of the game.\nSuper Awesome Poster Edition - $60\nThe first physical reward tier. You are a distinguishing class of backer. In addition to the previous digital rewards (two copies of the game, digital development journal/art book), you also get a bad-ass poster as pictured below. The poster is 18inx24in and printed on\u2026 well\u2026 poster paper. Not a lot more to say about that one.\nDragon Slayer T-Shirt Edition - $70\nYou get all the digital rewards previously mentioned, as well as the t-shirt worn by Tom\u2019s coworker in the intro cinematic. Technically it\u2019s slightly different, as more thought went into the design of the real shirt, but the idea is the same. How do dragons relate to a game about demons, you ask? They don\u2019t! But the guy in the intro cinematic didn\u2019t know the office was going to be invaded by demons. We can\u2019t always plan our wardrobe for all possible contingencies. The shirt itself is a Hanes Tagless T-Shirt, and sizes S-2XL will be available.\nI Want it All Edition - $100\nYou get all the digital rewards previously mentioned, as well as both the t-shirt and the poster!\nHopper Figurine Edition - $200\nYou get a full color, 3D printed figurine of the Hopper, the monster that mauls Tom in the cinematic trailer. This figurine is printed sandstone, so it's a bit fragile, definitely not an action figure. You will also get all previous digital and physical rewards. This figurine is approximately 3 inches tall, and is printed a bit further down.\nDemon Form Figurine Edition - $600\nIn addition to the Hopper figurine, you also get a 3D printed, full color figurine of Tom in his Demon Form. These prints are sandstone, and relatively fragile, so think display piece, not action figure. The Demon is roughly 4.5 inches tall, the Hopper is roughly 3 inches tall, and both are pictured below. You'll also get all the previous digital and physical rewards. Note: the Demon figurine will vary slightly, as the initial model had some issues (slightly off balance, fragile wing tips). The final model will have slightly larger feet, and slightly altered tips to wings.\nBe in the Game Edition! - $1500\nBe an NPC in the game! I'll base one of the NPCs in the game on a picture you send me (including a custom 2D portrait), and if you want, give him/her your first name. Your character will be standing somewhere in the game and will have at least one line of dialog. In addition, you'll get all the previous digital and physical rewards.\nExecutive Edition - $10,000\nThe executive edition. You get all the other stuff (including being an NPC if you want, no pressure though, I know executives don't like to get their hands dirty). In addition, you will be listed as an Executive Producer in the game's credits. You'll also have the knowledge that you went well above and beyond in helping get this game made, which obviously comes with my eternal thanks (though the market rate on my thanks, eternal or otherwise, isn't that impressive). Also, no international shipping surcharge! Because, at a certain point, that just becomes silly.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is pretty simple. There are really only two major risks. One is if I've grossly underestimated what it will take to finish the game, much like every other game developer in the history of the industry, and two, without me the game obviously doesn't happen, so if I get hit by a meteor, that\u2019s bad. While I can\u2019t really do much about the latter (outside of avoiding risky past times like alligator wrestling, wearing red on a Star Trek set, or doing live action Frogger reenactments), I can do something about the former. \n\nThere are two ways to mitigate the reality of missing projections. One is to plan on missing them. If you think a game will take you 12 months to make, you better plan on it taking you 18. If it really only takes you 12, then you can add a few extra features and a lot more polish, and everybody wins. The second way to mitigate this is to be realistic about where you are at any given point of development, and keep your design and goals agile enough to respond to a shifting timeline. The design I have down on paper is flexible enough to be scoped up or down as development evolves. Beyond that, anyone who tells you they can 100% guarantee a timeline for a creative project is either lying to you, to themselves, or most likely to both.\n\nIn spite of all that, the one thing I can say for certain (baring errant meteor strikes) is that if the project gets funded, the game will get made. I can't promise the exact timeline, but I'll do my best to stay on track.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Burgoon Entertainment, LLC\n2 created \u00b7 6 backed\nMy name is Sean Burgoon, and I've had a lot of jobs.

Well, first, it means the Kickstarter 2 Pitch video has now been re-shot and is once again \"done\".

SuZSie moans about it every day. We INTEND to FEED some starving artists with this project. If you know one, have him or her Tweet SuZSie @ShitZombiesSay or post a comment on the Shit Zombies Say Facebook page.\nZOMBIES ARE THE NEW NORMAL... \nIn 2013, if you ask anyone on the planet, \"DOES THE FUTURE INCLUDE ZOMBIES?\" you\u2019ll get a resounding, \u201cYES!\u201d Why? Because  we're everywhere.  We're in Congress, on the job, chasing runners, crawling pubs ... you get the drift. We\u2019ve eaten our way into human consciousness while moaning the entire time. Your survival depends on you knowing all that shit zombies have been moaning about behind your back. \nOh LAWD! Cousin Earl's here. Let's eat him first.\nHELLO, MEAT! Say Hello to our little FIEND:\n SuZSie @ShitZombiesSay\nformerly Rebecca A. Frierson, is our Zombelle Writer-in-Residence. As soon as she turned zombie in Oct. of 2012, she shuffled off into territory where no zombie has gone before by translating zombie-speak to English, French, and once Swedish. 6 months, 31,000 Tweets, and a worldwide following later, SuZSie's Twitterverse translations need to be shared with the Twit-illiterate. The time smells RIPE to publish an illustrated book of 1001 Things Zombies Say.\nSusie puts BACON on everything...\nSo, just who are the SLAYERS on this project besides SuZSie?\n\nWriter to the Stars: JT Eberhard --\n\nJT makes his living as a writer for the hit blog What Would JT Do? on the Patheos network.  When he's not touring the country giving talks on religion and current events, JT is also a columnist for American Atheist magazine, a gaming columnist for The Secular View, and perhaps most importantly, a contributor the Bite Club blog at shitzombiessay.net where he prepares people to survive the inevitable.  \nOutside of his work as an activist, JT Eberhard is a veteran of the Springfield Regional Opera's Young Artist Program. A baritone, JT has a handful of professional roles to his credit with various companies including work under the directorship of two-time Grammy-winner James Billings.\nProfessional Brains: Ashley F. Miller --\nLooking dramatic at the Prop 8 trial\nWriter, public speaker, and mass communications scholar, Ashley makes her living thinking about, creating, and criticizing media.  Her eponymous website houses much of her punditry and is home to her podcast.  Her academic writing has been featured in conferences and journals.  Before turning to a life of opinionating for a living, she worked in film and television, including on an award-winning short called Prombies!\nFX Gore-gal: Michelle Mulkey --\nspecial effects makeup artist for SuZSie and films such as Seed of Chucky (Jennifer Tilley, John Waters), Chronicles of Riddick (Vin Diesel), The Last Samurai (Tom Cruise) and TV shows Charmed, CSI Miami, and Without A Trace \u2014 has teamed up with us to reproduce some of SuSZie's killer zombie prosthetics as part of the rewards for this project. \nAll of SuZSie's zombie wounds are made by Michele. Get a load of the #ZombieHickey Michele created for you ...\nI promise this won't hurt a bit.\nThe @ShitZombiesSay Kiss: SuZSie does #BiteHardBiteOften.\nSuSZie's #BiteHardBiteOften face\nInternationally recognized zombie experts, Dave and Bob Madore at Necropology --\n... are volunteering a smidgen of zombie science oversight (when we feel like getting technical) even while in the midst of zombie consulting for the game-changing zombie movie, Heart Land starring Donald Sutherland (worldwide release 2014).\nSocial media rock star, John S. Rector (Mind Media Group) --\nJohn's barely managed to keep his brain from being eaten during brain-storming sessions with SuSZie. He's lending his legendary waaaaaaaay outside the Crayon box creative and design expertise. Oh, and next time you see John, tell him SuZSie told you to ask him to show you his rock star belt.\nJohn Rector\nProducer / Director, Hector J Salazar (Mind Media Group) --\nHector's resume includes ESPN, CNN, PlayBoy, and MTV. Early on in this project Hector accomplished something NO HUMAN HAS EVER DONE BEORE. He wrangled a zombie, a gore-gal, and a rock star in a video shot  in a building with a metal roof during torrential rain. AND ... THEN ... HAVING SURVIVED THAT ... did all the amazing post-production you saw above.\nHector Salazar\nBusiness-BWAAAIIINNNN / veteran entrepreneur, William H. Bailey --\nBill formed the LLC, is securing the trademarks, and does all that stuff that normally turns humans into zombies. Suffice it to say, Bill ain't normal but he does have BWAINS...\nHe'll even take one for the team ...\nSocial media maven, Twitterati, Model, and Author in her own right, @Cat_ONine (www.bookoflucifer.com) \nCat is working with us on photography, models, and editorial consulting. She's the one responsible for hooking us up to the great folks at Pin Me Up Studios who did the group shots above.\nWe're pretty sure this Cat is as feral as a zombie.\nProfessional Nerd, L. Nicol Cabe\n\nNicol is a nerd of many stripes - theatre, video games, science fiction, and bikes are the big ones. She is a freelance writer, director, and dramaturg, and in her spare time she collects and builds up road bikes. Her Skyrim character is currently level 73. \nSo what's it gonna take to knock this baby out of the park?\nBy now you've gathered it'll take a horde to make this book possible \u2014 especially the way we envision it. BUT...it's MOSTLY done. Remember those 31,000 plus Tweets? \nLike all zombies, SuZSie's constantly flappin' her jaws...\nThe real HORDE behind @ShitZombiesSay...\nis all the Tweople who, while not directly associated with this project, have encouraged and supported SuZSie. If you're on Twitter later, consider this one huge beyond 140 characters #FF (#FF is FollowFriday \u2014 a Twitter institution where Tweeters recommend Tweople they follow).

We also have a Paypal option for our backers.)\nTales of Terrene follows the main character and their struggle to adapt and survive in an ever evolving world filled with enemies. The story is set in the steampunk themed world of Terrene. The main character is a renegade airship captain who has had his vessel stolen, along with something of great worth on board. He must fight and transverse his way across Terrene and beyond battling enemies and other various renegade Captains to require his ship and the precious treasure that everyone seems to pitted on taking.\nTales of Terrene utilizes the Unity engine and Dolby inspired 7.1 sound channels. Working in conjunction with Dolby we plan to implement their sound technology to bring you a great game that really comes to life in surround sound! The Development team is working around the clock to create a game that is compelling and challenging, insuring a great experience for all gamers. We plan to include features like...\nTalent Tree\nCurrency System\nInteractive NPC and Shops\nExperience Leveling System\nCompelling Lore & Quest Line\nAnd Much More!\n\nIf you'd like to see Tales of Terrene come into fruition please take the time to get information from our website and Kickstarter and donate. All donations of any amount are generously appreciated!\nThe world of Terrene is no stranger to the ways of war. Having endured hundreds of years of steam engineering and constant battle the people of this world are hardened and living life on a pin. Terrene is split into three ruling factions. \nRoyal Kingdom of Asteria\nThe Guild of Mechno-Alchemist\nSky Pirates\nThe Royal Kingdom of Asteria is the predominate ruling class, having captured most of Terrenes vital and strategic resources during the last steam war. The Guild of Mechno-Alchemist are a fanatic group of engineers who believe that man and machine must join in a single union. The Sky Pirates of Terrene are renegade airship captains that have abandoned their post and fled during the last war to make their own way, preying off any airship that come across them.\nThe player will have a choice to choose between the guilds and choose their alliance.

They are sonic warrior-wizards who possess  rare and powerful Superstring Manipulators, sonic weaponry in the shape of musical instruments that can vibrate the underlying structure of the universe, bending it to the whim of the virtuoso musician.\nThe most elite Metalheads are granted the privilege of 'Riding the Heavy Metal': Titans! These giant robot combat vehicles tower over the battlefield and possess the power of an entire tank battalion. The nobility of headbanger society, those who possess these massive behemoths are, by definition, more metal than everyone else: the rock stars idolized by a society of rock stars.\nBoHM is a conversion of the very popular BoX system found in Barbarians of Lemuria by Simon Washbourne. It is a simple game with a lot of variety in character and adventure types. You can be a wandering Sonic Warrior, a Titan Rider, a Soldier, Groupie (31st century courtesans), Manager (the officers of the 31st century), Space Cowboy, Warp Rider, Inquisitor or any mix of 28 different careers. Add to that 8 attributes, eight different Schools of Rock and a wide variety of musical instruments to specialize in and equipment to outfit yourself with, and you open up a universe of possibilities.\nBoHM also adds new rules systems for using music as a tool and a weapon. Metalheads can win fame and fortune by playing to crowds and dueling with other Metalheads (which can be lethal with the safeties off). There are also rules for the sonic manipulation of reality: create a musical shield around your band; summon flames in the shape of ravening dogs and send them after your opponents; or drop the equivalent of a small nuke in the center of a battlefield. Your only limits are your virtuosity, the size and virtuosity of your band and time to play out the complex songs necessary to warp reality to your will.\nBoHM will also introduce rules for Giant Robot Combat into the BoX system. Create your own custom death machine with a plethora of system and weapon load outs. You can even arm them with a massive superstring manipulator, turning them into towering Gods of Rock who can destroy everything around them with sonic wizardry. Add in heavy armored vehicles, Aerospace fighter-craft, orbital bombardments from Warp Ships and the odd infantry platoon, and you've got yourself the tools for battles on a massive scale.\nVisit the Barbarians of Heavy Metal Design Diaries to find out more about the evolution of the game from initial concepts to the current state of play.\n\nWhat will  set BoHM apart from other RPGs is that it will usher in a new paradigm in RPG publishing. While we will be doing a print version of the game, we are also going to be releasing it as a Digital Boxed Set. What, exactly, is that?\nBack in the day, RPGs used to come in boxed sets that included everything you needed to play the game. D&D, Top secret, Star Frontiers, you name it, the typical RPG came with a book for the players that contained the basic rules, a GM guide with all the tools necessary to create adventures, a full starter adventure, dice, character sheets, and sometimes paper miniatures or even an entire wargame, as was the case for the Star Trek Deluxe Set. A few modern games embrace this 'play it right out of the box' mentality (including one the designer of BoHM has worked extensively on, Doctor Who: Adventures in Time & Space) but most rely on selling you an individual book (followed by a series of splatbooks) and then expect you to go around gathering up everything you need on your own.\nBoHM is going back to that Boxed Set mentality, but we're taking advantage of modern mobile technology to make that boxed set digital. The BoHM app will contain everything you need to play the game, from rules to character generators, to GM tools and even a map based wargaming function for playing out battles, all in one easy to use package.\nNo more carrying around a backpack full of books, a bag full of dice, a case full of minis and a bottle of ibuprofen for your strained back. No more dice rolling off the table, or being limited to a room with a big enough table (or computer access) to run the game. You will be able to take BoHM and play it anywhere: in your living room sitting in comfy chairs; in the park on a blanket in the grass; or even on the road to your favorite gaming convention (NOTE: we do not suggest that the driver attempt use a tablet while driving. That's not metal, that's just stupid).\nInitially, we will be programming the App for Android based tablets, with an eye towards developing for other platforms in the future. If we reach our first Stretch Goal, however, we will immediately begin programming it in for iPads, to be released at the same time as the Android version.Check out some screen shots of the app interface, below:\nCharacter Generation Panel\nAction Panel: Where the game is largely played...\nMusic Screen - Headcutting: For musically dueling Metalheads...\nWhile BoHM is striving to start a digital revolution in RPG publishing, we also love a good book. The feel of it, the smell of one being opened for the first time, and all the great art that serves to build the world and inspire us to play in it. As such, we are doing Print and PDF versions of the book as well.\nAs BoHM is really our love letter to the gaming and music of our youth, we are partnering with an industry legend from that period, Jeff Laubenstein, to bring the Metalphere of the 31st century to life. Jeff has defined the look and feel of many famous game worlds from the eighties, nineties, right up to the modern day, including Battletech, Shadowrun, Earthdawn and Magic: the Gathering.\nWe are extremely proud to have Jeff on board. Here are just a few examples of his genre defining work (you can find more here):\nAt the Groupie Level, you will receive a Backstage Pass to the play-testing process and be able to lend your voice to the product. As a thank you for your service, you will receive a text only PDF of the rules. You won't get the art or any sort of fancy-schmancy layout, but you will get the full rules.\nThe Headbanger level is the electronic game level. You will receive a Backstage Pass as well as your choice of either the Full Game App, or, for those who don't have a compatible tablet, a PDF of the fully realized rulebook. Everything you to adventure in the Metalsphere.\nUPDATED REWARD! BoHM UNPLUGGED! By popular demand, we have created this special level for those of you who are really old school and want a solo 'acoustic' set of BoHM! No electronic versions, no swag, just a single copy of the softcover rulebook.\nUPDATED REWARD! BotA BONUS! Everyone who pledges at the $30 or higher level will also receive a free PDF of Barbarians of the Aftermath, our post-apocalyptic supplement for the Barbarians of Lemuria game!\nMetalheads score a copy of the Barbarians of Heavy Metal: Rocktagon game soundtrack in addition to the rewards listed above. This is a set of 8 MP3s, one song for each School of Music on the Rocktagon.\nMetalmasters get to show off their Metalocity by donning an official Barbarians of Heavy Metal T-Shirt, emblazoned with our logo. All we need from you is a $45 pledge and your shirt size. One color fits all: black as the blackity-black of a black hole.\nMetal Lords are graced with an App, a PDF AND a softcover print copy of the full 160 page rulebook, illustrated by Jeff Laubenstien, with layout and graphic design by the man who brought you Barbarians of the Aftermath, Doctor Who: the Eleventh Doctor Edition and the Time Traveller's Companion. My Lords will also be privileged to have access to Stretch Goal number 2, should it be reached.\nLegends of Rock can keep their heads warm and their eyes shaded with this totally metal BoHM ball cap embroidered with the icon of the School of Rock you bear allegiance to. You also gain access to two more Stretch Goals, numbers 3 & 4.\nAll hail the Ayatollah of Rock & Rolla and his massive haul of metal swag! Multiply Stretch Goal 2 eight times, as you will be the proud owner of one set of Rock & Rollers for each School on the Rocktagon. You will also receive every stretch goal that comes up over the course of this Kickstarter. \nGO GO ROCKZILLA!!! You are to be immortalized  as an iconic character in the game. Working with the game designer, you will create a character who epitomizes one of the schools of the Rocktagon (1 per School, first come, first serve), and a vehicle for that character, using the BoHM rules. Your face and description will then be used to create a custom illustration by Jeff that will then grace the pages of the main rulebook. Finally, you will receive a signed print of your character suitable for framing.\nYou have reached the pinnacle of Rock Godhood and will be canonized as a Lesser Saint of Rock & Roll, with an entire house devoted to your name in one region of the Metalsphere (1 per School, first come first serve). You will work with the designer and the artist to create an illustration and special rules for those who follow your Saint in the main rulebook.\nUPDATE!!! NEW REWARD UPGRADES!!!\nDue to popular request, we a re offering the following optional upgrades for every level!\n+$20 - Upgrade your BoHM Softcover Book to a Hardcover!\n+$20 - Add a BoHM Metalmaster Screen to any level, including a 32-page adventure module: War Pigs!\n+$20 - Sinners & Saints: a limited, Kickstarter only set of prints featuring the 8 Patron Saints of Rock and 8 Iconic Characters from each school, numbered and signed by Jeff Laubenstein and packaged in an illustrated envelope.\nShould we exceed our initial funding goal, you can look forward to the following:\nAll international orders will be charged shipping based upon the level of Reward chosen.

It combines the deck building elements of a Trading Card Game with the strategic positioning of a battle field environment. Players move Character Cards around on a board, playing Support Cards from their hand in concert with Character movements and attacks in a mad race to destroy the other player's Commander Card first.\nSpatial tactics are everything in a game of War Command. Your cards are only as good as their access to the enemy.\nThe game takes place in the far future on the planet Haven, which, due to a cataclysmic wave of radiation, will soon be the last livable planet in the galaxy. Upon learning of the impending disaster, Humanity quickly scrapped what civilization remained on earth and took to the stars; arriving at the shielded planet just in time to survive the interstellar catastrophe. Unfortunately for them, they hadn't planned on its pulsing gravity field or violent magnetic storms. Doubly unfortunate for them, they weren't the only ones.\nHard to say who's nastiest looking.\nThe Humans quickly found themselves sharing the planet with the hideous purple Delylians and the reptilian Gharrana. Each society, however, has been ripped apart by the trials of their migration effort, cut off and unprepared to offer a unified front against the enemies that are all around them. Treaties are made in the only way they can be, face-to-face, and ragtag armies composed of survivors from all races begin to organize, and move across the planet's surface.\nI think you can imagine what they leave in their wake.\nWith broken factions from every corner of the universe vying for dominance of this alien world, the game features a rich diversity of characters. This diversity is reflected in gameplay in the cards' unique abilities and contextual strategic value. By considering each card's strengths, position and access to support, you can set yourself up for a variety of strategies and play-styles.\nAt the beginning of each match players set their characters' starting formation on the board.\nPlayers will be able to set their characters\u2019 starting battle formation and build a unique deck to suit their battle plan. War Command is designed to give the player unlimited strategic opportunities while remaining fast and easy to pick up. It's simple enough that most people have the gameplay figured out in their first couple turns, but complex enough to support a nearly infinite range of strategic expression.\nThere are two videos below which explain the gameplay in more detail. The first is a draft tutorial for the digital edition of the game, the second is Game Creator Ray Hayes sitting down for a game with a GoPro strapped to his head :) This should help give an idea of the kinds of strategies that can pay off in a game of War Command.\nIf you're more into reading, check out these links for a breakdown of the rules of the game and a more detailed look into the universe of War Command.\nwww.warcommand.com: How To Play\nwww.warcommand.com: Game Story\nWar Command has always been planned and budgeted for exclusively as an iOS project. Recently we've gone through some internal shuffling in the programming side of the project, which resulted in our release ultimately being pushed back but with the possibility of releasing to multiple platforms much faster, and that got us thinking about our user feedback.\nA user, feedbacking us.\nYou see, we've been bringing a printed beta of our game around for people to play, first at various game shops, then at some conventions (LepreCon, SaltFest, Phoenix Comicon, etc.,) and we've gotten a tremendous response every time. People seem to have no problem picking the game up immediately, and within a match or two it's fantastic to see how much thought is already going into the decks they put together. The thing is, while many people were as psyched as we were for a card game in a convenient, electronic format where you need never fear losing your cards or, god forbid, spilling coffee on them, our most consistent request by far was that we also release the game in a physical edition.\nThere's something charming about this that doesn't translate 100% to touchscreen.\nSo, here we are. We've already invested substantial amounts of our own money into this project, and almost everyone who's put serious time in on War Command has done so at the promise of a future reward. The final iOS product is still months (and months) away from completion, but the game itself is practically done-and-waiting, so we've decided to show you what we've got and throw ourselves on your mercy, Internet.\nMost of the money raised here will go to having the game printed and setting up distribution for the physical edition. (It will also be available for sale on the War Command website!) However, 20% of what we raise here will go straight to our Artists for the hard work they've put into the product already!\nFringe Games is a small group of people who have devoted our lives to making a very large game for the last couple of years. Raymond Hayes, our founder and CEO, had no prior professional experience in game design when he came up with the idea for War Command 3 &1/2 years ago. Starting with nothing but a quality game concept and a die-hard attitude, Ray put together a talented team of people who, after playing a crude version of the game he put together by hand with index cards, were willing to invest their time and experience into making War Command a reality.\nShaun Mitchell is our Art Director. Having worked for Bethesda Softworks and Acclaim Studios, he's the voice of experience on the team and a guiding influence to the game's many artists. As the head of our Art and Design departments, Shaun was instrumental in defining the visual feel for War Command and helping our artists maintain a thread of commonality across their sometimes very different illustration styles.\nMuch of the lore behind the game was established between Ray and his younger brother Rusty Hayes, who also helped with balancing the game and is currently busy with various PR duties (like writing this!) Rusty has also developed his own game to be released under Fringe Games in July.\nOne more small sample of our artists' handiwork!\nFor War Command we've put together a team of fantastic artists, ranging from known fantasy greats like Keith Thompson to fresh talents like Carly Sorge, Venn Locklear, Aaron Cooper and more from around the world.\nWe've expected a lot out of our artists for this project and we definitely feel they've delivered in spades. A major focus for our art direction was on keeping the illustrations diverse both in terms of content and stylization, so the first edition of War Command will present lovers of sci-fi and fantasy art with a collection that spans genres and never gets tired or suffers from the drudgery of an oft-repeated pose. Most of the artists who have worked with us on this product are also stakeholders in the game, investing their time and talents to help create a high quality product.\nWar Command is currently slated for a Winter release on iOS (probably in the January - February range) but with the success of this Kickstarter Campaign we'll be able to pre-empt that release and get the game into people's hands a little bit sooner as a physical card game.\nBecause getting the game into people's hands is really, really awesome.\nWe're hoping to have the Physical Edition released and available for purchase this holiday season, but Backers can expect their copies of the game to begin shipping out as soon as it's finished and available to us (probably mid-to-late November.)\nIn addition to the tiered pledge rewards we are also offering un-tiered reward upgrades which can be added onto any pledge. To order an add-on, simply make any other pledge and add the add-on's value to your pledge amount. At the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey, just list your desired add-on(s) there and they'll get to you with your reward. If you pledge for any add-on or reward that contains a shirt you will use this same survey to list the size desired.\n(Plus $10 for international shipping)\n(Plus $10 for international shipping)\n(Plus $25 for international shipping)\n(Plus $10 for international shipping)\n(Plus $10 for international shipping)\n(Plus $25 for international shipping)\n(Plus $30 for international shipping)\n(Plus $35 for international shipping)\n(Plus $35 for international shipping)\n(Plus $50 for international shipping)\n(Plus $50 for international shipping, your card gets made whether the kickstarter succeeds or not)\n(Plus $50 for international shipping, your card gets made whether the kickstarter succeeds or not)\nThe final iOS game will be available for free, complete with a starter deck of 31 cards geared toward a commander from any one of the first edition's three races. From there players will have to purchase new cards, either with their real-life money or with credits earned in-game.\nOne day, all of this could be yours - For Free! (Well... Mostly)\nThe physical edition will be packaged a bit differently. It will be distributed as a full game set, with two starter decks and two of every card in the first edition (except the rare cards, of which there will each be one) included in a box set with a board, a divider, and the necessary dice for rolling and damage counting. Future editions may also be packaged in booster or random packs later on to enhance collectibility, but for now we just want to make sure that anyone who purchases the game can get right into it without depending on a bunch of future releases.\nOne day, all of this could be commercially available - with Your help!\nThe retail price for the boxed First Edition set will probably be very close to the price you'll get it for by donating here, though it might be subject to change depending on our final retail and distribution costs.\nThe response we've gotten since unveiling the game at SaltCON earlier this year has truly blown us away, and we could not be more excited for War Command's eventual release on iOS! It was never our plan to release the game physically, but after the response we've seen we feel we owe it to the players and to the game to give it a shot. And if that gives us a chance at getting it into players' hands sooner, well that is a hell of a motivator too!\nBecause seriously, getting to see this is awesome.\nIt is impossible to put into words how gratifying it has been to see people enjoying the game so much at conventions after all the work we've put into it, and even if this Kickstarter doesn't make it we really want to thank every person who's given us a word of feedback or support, not to mention anyone who pledges support here! ;) It's been a hell of a ride so far!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the reasons we're so excited for this project is that the game itself is basically done. While the digital version still has a ways to go, the only things we have left to finish for the physical edition are getting the last art assets in place, the box art for the game and the instruction manual, all of which we expect to have done well before the Kickstarter is over.\n\nOur only real fear at this point is if something goes wrong with the manufacturer or shipping company.

A brotherhood stands ready to fight for humanity as a wall of Iron.\"\nThe main aim of this Kick Starter project is to make a set of resin model soldiers and an armoured personnel carrier to transport them. The soldiers are themed as \"future warrior\", with science fiction equipment and transport. \nThe different helmets for the project are already sculpted. Choosing any of the rewards or add-ons with figures in will allow you to pick your choice of heads to go with them. \nThe second aim is to be able to expand the army and offer support weapons for the soldiers. These will include hand-held flame throwers, plasma blasters and thermal guns. \nThe third aim is to offer heavy weapons. These will include a carriage mounted heavy weapon, with a choice of mounted weapon options. A mortar and missile launcher are also planned as part of this expansion. All the heavy weapons will come with two crew members. \nIf this Kick Starter project is successful then Ramshackle Games hopes to support this army further by adding more options and vehicles.\nThe first Rhebok APC is out of the mold now. Here are some images of the unpainted resin version. Please note that it will be supplied with a selection of gun choices.\nSo these are resin casts of the figures. The one standing up straight measures 29 mm to the top of the crest on his helmet, so they are true 28mm figures. The models are shown with the \"Iron Brother\" heads.\nPlease note that the image contains a scale shot with a Games Workshop Cadian Imperial Guard. This image is for scale purpose only and is used without authorisation from Games Workshop Ltd.\nThe models come as three parts: body, head and gun with hands attached.\nThe penultimate row shows the Weapons Specialists, left to right Plasma Blaster, Flame Thrower and Thermal Gun.

I will have a plough and hatch as turret alternative ready for the end of the project. \nRhebok Extras\nBelow are images of the Rhebok with the new plough and cupola. Please note these are the master parts and will be cast in grey resin. The cupola is in two sections, so can be modded open or closed.\nThere is also a new back section almost finished. It needs rivets adding and some more detailing. This is the chemical tank section and allows the vehicle to be turned into a flame thrower or chemical attack variant.\nAnd finally there is a third back section.

We are really lucky to have two amazing actors who have agreed to play the lead roles - the legendary theatre and film actor Derek Jacobi (The King's Speech, Gladiator, I Claudius) and Katie Leung (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), who is known for her role as Cho Chang in the Harry Potter films and most recently for her great work in the theatre adaptation of the internationally acclaimed book 'Wild Swans'. Writer/Director - Daniel Jewel, Produced by Ateh Jewel & Mandy Belnick.\nHi Kickstarter Backers! Our names our Daniel Jewel (writer-director) and Ateh Jewel (producer) and we are a husband-and-wife team with a track record of producing high quality short films. We are really excited to share our project with you and together we hope to bring it to life.\nDaniel wrote the script and will direct the film this Autumn, and Ateh will produce alongside producer Mandy Belnick - who is hugely experienced in marketing feature films and short films. \nWe also worked together as a team on a short film called 'Sidney Turtlebaum,' which was received really well at festivals around the world and was shortlisted for an Oscar, nominated for a British Independent Film Award and won 'Best Foreign Film' at L.A. Shortsfest. It also starred Derek Jacobi and it's really exciting to have the chance to join forces with him again to make another film. \nEarlier this year, we completed another short film 'Drone', starring Ewen Bremner, who played Spud in the cult British film 'Trainspotting.' Drone has been accepted to three Oscar Qualifying film festivals this year - Aspen Shortsfest, Rhode Island Film Festival and Montreal World Film Festival. You can check out more information about our background in producing short films, on the websites for Sidney Turtlebaum (www.sidneyturtlebaum.co.uk) and Drone (www.dronemovie.co.uk, https://www.facebook.com/dronemovie2013).  \nYou can also check out the new Facebook page for Sun Never Sets here: www.facebook.com/pages/Sun-Never-Sets/164270243752988\nWe feel that Kickstarter is a really liberating and empowering platform to connect filmmakers and audiences. With your support we can make the film happen this year, and we will put all our efforts into making the very best film possible. We will treat this project with the same care, passion and attention to detail as if it was a feature film. If we exceed our funding goal perhaps we can achieve our dream of making a feature film based on the same characters and setting as this short film. \nIf you come on board and help green light 'Sun Never Sets,' you can be guaranteed that we will produce the highest quality film and market it to all the major film festivals around the world - just like we did with our last two shorts 'Sidney Turtlebaum' and 'Drone.'\nThe film will star Derek Jacobi - the legendary British stage and screen actor known for films including the Oscar-winning 'The King's Speech', 'Gladiator', 'Gosford Park' and 'I Claudius'. And Katie Leung - who made her name in the Harry Potter films and who most recently starred in the first theatre version of the international bestseller 'Wild Swans' and the upcoming new Channel 4 series 'Run.'\nOur film is set in the near future where China has become the undisputed world power and the West is in disarray. Now, the tired and hungry people of Europe are fleeing to the great cities of China to seek a new life as economic migrants.\nAgainst this backdrop, a Chinese-born Englishman named HEDGES has decided to turn his back on the tide of history by taking his adopted daughter KATIE to a small abandoned island downstream from Shanghai, where his British ancestors used to trade to China from in the nineteenth century.\nHe has rebooted the abandoned island and staffed it with illegal English immigrants to China, creating his own world as if the British Empire had never fallen. The island is off the grid and has no electricity or running water.  The small community living under Hedges use gas lamps, so it's as if they are living a British version of an Amish village.\nOne day a wealthy English family, who have started a successful new life in Shanghai, crash their boat on the shores of the island. Hedges and Katie are forced to take them into their community. The arrival of the family sparks off something in Katie - who has always wondered what life might be like away from the island. She spends her evenings gazing at the neon haze of Shanghai, which she can see through her grimy bedroom window. Katie can see how at ease the family are with life in Shanghai; they speak fluent Mandarin and are fully accepted into Chinese society, and this leads her to question everything Hedges has told her about the modern world. This brings her into conflict with Hedges, especially when the young son of the family, TOM, offers to take her back to Shanghai with them.  In the climax of the film, Katie is pressured to make life-changing choices, which ultimately reveal the dark history of the British Empire in China and Hedges's ancestors involvement in the Opium Wars. \nWe feel that the themes of Sun Never Sets - the themes of loss of power and nostalgia for the past - can connect with a wide audience. Many people across the world, not just in Britain, feel that their country's best days are in the past. People in France, Spain, Japan and now America have the feeling that the best days are not to come. This feeling can lead to a sense of bitterness and a need to seek comfort by looking back to past glories, and this is exactly what Hedges has done with his island retreat. With the rise of China being reported every day across the international media, many people in the West see this rise as a threat. However it can also be an opportunity. For instance, once Katie sees how immersed the new family is in Chinese society, she stops seeing Shanghai as a threat and instead as an opportunity to grow and participate in a modern world.\nIn the last century, the rise of Germany and Japan led to terrible war and bloodshed, and everyone must hope that this cycle isn't repeated in this century. Our hope is that by examining these themes of conflict through the film, we can encourage open debate about what this century will look like and how best to tackle conflicts that may arise without repeating the mistakes of the past.\nAs well as these geo-political themes, at its heart Sun Never Sets is a film about family. Both Hedges and Katie feel an intense need to belong and to find a family and place in the world, but they are pulled in opposite directions. Hedges is living in the past surrounded by the family and community he has created on the island. Meanwhile Katie has the urge to find herself and her true identity by jumping into the future, which Shanghai represents. This need for family and identity is a powerful theme in the film and is one that we hope people can connect to.\nThe world of SUN NEVER SETS will look visually stunning, with a hyper-modern Shanghai combined with the world of 19th century England, which Hedges has tried to bring back to life. To achieve this ambitious look we using three elements - Production Design, Locations and VFX. The Production Design of the film will be created by Caroline Amies who designed the Oscar-nominated 'In the Name of the Father', which starred Daniel Day Lewis. We have carefully chosen locations on the Southwest coast of England , which have green forests, waterfalls and coastal views that will give the impression of China. Then, we have a talented and dedicated VFX team who will create a vision of a futuristic Shanghai - that is always in the background of the shots - almost mocking Hedges as he tries to blot out the modern world.\n\nWe aim to shoot SUN NEVER SETS this Autumn over a five day shoot and to complete the main post-production of the film by December 2013. We are looking to complete the VFX, Colour Grade and Dolby 5.1 Sound Mix of the film by January 2014, and to have the film ready to submit to film festivals by February 2014. We then aim to have a 12-14 month film festival cycle of the film before looking to distribute the film online.\nWe will use the funding to produce the film from start to finish - to hire our cast, crew, locations, film and lighting equipment - right through to the post-production and VFX for the film. If you would like to get involved in the film and become a Kickstarter Backer - we have created a range of contributor benefits including credits on the film, props from the film, tickets to cast and crew screenings and even an opportunity to visit the set and meet the cast and crew in person as we make the film.

Crafted for both purpose and honor - join us in making history once again!\nFor the Love of the Blade\nSwords create legends, spark tales, and even write history. Whether it\u2019s studying the techniques behind the blade, the art that goes into crafting them, or the joy of watching \u201cthe great dance\u201d come alive on the big screen, each of us has been marked by the sword in one way or another. The sword has created a passion that lives within each of us, a fire that we cannot quench.\nThis same passion drove Galatia Films to produce their first Reclaiming the Blade film. With reviews naming it \u201cEpic and grand!\u201d and \u201cSensational and long overdue!\u201d, it\u2019s no surprise that it won it\u2019s way to become a  #1 iTunes documentary. Produced with the support of The Lord of the Rings special effects team Weta Workshop and The Royal Armouries, the movie featured the voice of John Rhys-Davies and included exclusive insights from legends such as Bob Anderson, Viggo Mortensen, and Karl Urban.\nReclaiming the Blade won the hearts of every sword enthusiast, and now Galatia Films has officially announced the news that the long-awaited sequel is here at last!\nReclaiming the Blade: Sons of Fire\nWhile the first film focused on both European and Asian historical swordplay and offered an in-depth look at the fascinating world of stage combat on the silver screen, the second installment, Reclaiming the Blade: Sons of Fire, will take a closer look at the sword and bladesmiths who create real historical blades just as they were handcrafted from iron ore thousands of years ago. \nThese bladesmiths are the life-blood of this new movement and resurgence of the blade. They create not only replicas, but real historical pieces that the martial artist then use to train with, learning the techniques from the original fight masters.\nReclaiming the Blade: Sons of Fire will also feature two phenomenal sword trainers from The Chronicles of Narnia films, Brian Danner (300, Master and Commander, The Three Musketeers) and Allen Poppleton (Wolverine, Spartacus, Avatar, Narnia). We are happy to announce that Ben Barnes (Prince Caspian) and William Moseley (Chronicles of Narnia) should be joining us as well for unique interviews.\nDigital Fire \nReclaiming the Blade: Sons of Fire will explore the gaming culture, as well as sword crafting and wielding within digital domains. The online gaming and RPG (Role Playing Games) worlds present a very interesting opportunity to learn more about our true fascination with the sword. The first film delved deep into the cultural influence of swords in television and movies, while the second film, Sons of Fire expects to learn more about the army of gamers and developers who love the sword just as much. From forging a \"real\" digital sword, to then taking up that weapon and using it in great battles and epic online quests, the second film will leave no stone unturned in exploring our true love with the blade.\nWhere does this fascination with the sword lead and what is our final destination? Will crafting systems and digital blacksmithing become more real than ever? Will the martial prowess and historical movements in digital space become more and more like their deadly counterparts? Galatia Films will be exploring these questions and more in our sequel. Let's face it, there are many more things we can do in a game that are just not practical in the real world!\nForging the Way\nThe funds raised in this Kickstarter campaign will be used specifically to complete the film and deliver a very high quality product in the end. Specific portions of the financing budget will go to editing, special effects, DVD jacket design, special features, original interviews, and music. The final budget will ensure release and distribution of the film.\nPut to work on these tasks is an award winning crew that works very hard for not much more than simply their passion to make good films and their love of the blade. Galatia Films will travel the globe to find the best interviews and moments for the blade, and deliver them in an awe-inspiring film that will encourage you to take up the sword!\nThe Master Craftsmen\nGalatia Films is a US production company managing projects from early development to final publicity. Working with key executives, production talent and A-list actors, Galatia specializes in both history and fantasy; delivering legends from the past to international audiences today.\nFormed in March 2011, the Middle-earth Network is a multi-media company with branches in social media, website hosting/design, publishing, audio and video production, online radio, and higher education, as well as news outlets all centered around fantasy, sci-fi, and history.\nWhere are the funds needed?\nGalatia Films has arranged the interviews, done the pre-production planing and writing. We have begun to shoot interviews but need 150k to complete all the interviews (the more interviews the better the film) ... we need 35k for editing, graphics and titles. We also need an additional 57k for both travel and shooting budgets (sound, lights, camera) for some of the more far aways and exotic interviews/locations but we do not want to leave anyone out and to tell this story properly we will need these interviews.\nWe are going to put another amazing soundtrack on this film with top upcoming pop/rock artists (John DiBartolo being one) and an orchestral score written by a good Hollywood composer, we are considering David James Nielsen should we reach our goal but we need desperately need those funds. Orchestra.net will record the orchestral score in Prague, the cheapest place on earth with the best players to put brilliant orchestra music to the sword. The blade deserves the very best music. This final music budget is roughly 12k.\nFurther there are still special effects, animations that need to be done with the animation company involved. This comes to about 45k and will enable us to tell the story with images that focus on energy and history of the sword. We also plan to use special 3D software that will allow us to show sword fights in film, movies, games and real life that detail all the action from every angle, but we need your help to make complete this.\nWe also have legal, accounting and attorney fees that come with telling a story that includes Hollywood to a certain degree. These fees total 7K. Ultimately we can not finish our film without the above, and without your help. Thank you so much for your support!\nA Tribute to Bob Anderson\nAs part of the effort to revive the glory of the blade and bring the sword community together Galatia Films and Middle-earth Network have partnered to host a massive online convention, \u2018Reclaiming the Blade Day\u2019. It will air live August 3, 2013, in tribute to the late Bob Anderson and other great sword masters.\nSpecial featured guests include John Rhys-Davies (The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones), Richard Taylor and Weta Workshop (Avatar, The Hobbit), photographer Ian Brodie (The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles of Narnia), John Clements (sword expert and academic), and other celebrities, along with a horde of fantasy and sci-fi fans, affiliates, scholars, and artists of the Middle-earth Network. Two great Hollywood stunt sword coordinators are joining us as well for Sons of Fire and likely \u2018Reclaiming the Blade Day\u2019, Allan Poppleton (Wolverine, Spartacus, Avatar, Narnia) and Brian Danner (300, Master and Commander, The Three Musketeers).\nThe growing roster of events will be made up of exclusives with bladesmiths and scholars, plus giveaways, movie viewings, live chats with stars, and exclusive spokespeople for the event. For more information email: pr@galatiafilms.com\nA Balanced Blade is a Beautiful Thing\nProducing Reclaiming the Blade: Sons of Fire is, without a doubt, a massive project. However, the folks at Galatia Films and Middle-earth Network feel that preserving the sword\u2019s true history and the combat techniques that surround it are vital. It is this knowledge that needs to be passed on to future generations.\nJoin us! Become something more than a spectator, help us capture these epic moments for the blade, and make your mark in history!\nWe know many will want to help, but may not have the funds to do so. We completely understand, and wonder if perhaps you have something you can offer as a prize or reward, or even something to barter. Let us know! We\u2019re interested and would love to hear from you.

We will endeavor to track down every relevant specialist and artist out there to bring you their brilliant perspective on the blade, however, sometimes they can be elusive. In the first film we faced great challenges to get every interview that we needed to tell the story but in the end we did not miss anything that was crucial and stumbled upon some great teachers of the blade.\n\nTechnical difficulties can arise in any filmmaking process. From pre to post production, these are inevitable. Nevertheless, we will take every precaution necessary to ensure that the film is produced on time and of the highest possible quality. It is our duty to you, the fans, artists, the academics, the practitioners, experts, and to the sword.

Woven together, this colorful rogue's gallery of established and emerging comic creators, fans and media experts paints a living, collective picture of why comics continue to transform our cultural landscape with a resonance all of their own. \"Comics Are Everywhere!\" speaks not only to the comic-book fan, but also to the creative person inside every one of us.\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP!\nWhile $15,000 is just a fraction of our entire production budget, the funds generated from this Kickstarter campaign will enable us to begin securing the next phase of production costs and travels costs.

Now, this 20-year odyssey into the world of comics and graphic novels is culminating with the feature-length documentary \"Comics Are Everywhere!\"\nNatalia Quintana, the producer, has been working in film and TV for over a decade.  She has a collection of well-kept comic books stashed away at her parents' house.  With a couple of #1 editions, this documentary was an easy fit.  \nNeil and Natalia met in college in the early 2000's.  This is their first feature-length documentary production.\nAbout the Artists\nJJ VILLARD\nLos Angeles-based artist JJ Villard, who fought against the rigors and structure of a successful career as a character designer at DreamWorks, now works day and night developing his own show for Cartoon Network\u02bcs Adult Swim. Fighting to get his vision onscreen, Villard wrestles with self-imposed pressure and creative interference from network executives, all the while knowing his show might never reach the screen. \nDrawing inspiration from the city he lives in and the next comic- book fix, he escapes into his ever-present sketchbooks where his ideas are free to run wild; ideas that will later fuel the never-ending work required to make it in the industry. Recently, Villard's animated pilot for \"King Star King\" received the \"greenlight\" from the Cartoon Network and it is slated to premiere on Adult Swim's 2014 lineup of new animated TV shows. The artist's dream is within reach!\nDANNI SHINYA LUO\nPasadena-based artist Danni Shinya Luo juggles her commitments as a freelance cover artist for Marvel Comics and other comic companies with exploring the female mystique in her sometimes-risqu\u00e9 paintings that have generated a following through her limited- edition books. Luo, whose work has begun to gain attention outside of the comic-book realm, labors endlessly to make good on the sacrifices that her immigrant parents have made for her to pursue a career in art. Luo\u02bcs father remained in China while her Mother accompanied her to America where she would be free to pursue her dreams. Separated from his wife and child for years, her father will travel to America this fall to see the artwork that is the epicenter of his daughter\u02bcs creative life in her upcoming exhibition at Los Angeles' La Luz de Jesus gallery.\nTHE PROS\nComics Are Everywhere also takes viewers into the minds of established artists like Ghost World author Daniel Clowes and Love and Rockets co-creator Jaime Hernandez whose pioneering and original comics have found appreciative audiences and crossover success after years in the trenches. These veteran creators sound off on how their lives and work have had to change over the years to accommodate each other and the different ways they\u02bcve stayed creative as their work - once a self-motivated personal expression - has become a career.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenges of making a film:\n\nWe have a list of innovative artists whom we plan to approach and hope that our documentary inspires them to share their stories of creativity, determination and their own distinct voice in the morphing world of alternative comics and graphic novels. \n\nAnother challenge is building a small animation team from scratch to help create short, motion-comic sequences that will be periodically juxtaposed with the live-action footage. We want the film to echo the kinetic feel and texture of how images work on the printed page of a comic book while lending them the dynamic qualities of movement and rhythmic pacing that can only be found in motion pictures. The goal is to meld the two media together in an organic fashion where these short, burst of animations act as a form of punctation to emphasize and/ or underscore the intent of a specific scene. \n\nWe will also have to secure the necessary clearances to use specific pages of comic-book artworks and archival footage. Fortunately, Seattle-based Fantagraphic Books has already granted us the necessary clearances to use select pages from such celebrated comics as brothers Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez's \"Love and Rockets\" comics and Daniel Clowes' seminal 1997 graphic novel \"Ghost World.\" But we want to broaden the documentary's pool of imaginative comic-book images and this task will be time consuming and demand a great deal of patience and research. \n\nBut we are confident that our combined strength of passion and production experience will enable us to overcome these potential challenges through hard work and perseverance and keeping our collective eyes on the prize. \n\nWe find inspiration in Oscar-winning filmmaker Steven Soderbergh's straight-forward statement that marks the conclusion of the introduction to his published screenplay for \"sex, lies & videotape\": \"Talent plus perseverance equals luck. Be ready for when it happens.\" With your financial support, we can make our own luck and fully realize the cinematic magic of bringing the engaging story of \"Comics Are Everywhere\" to legions of filmgoers eager to learn more about the exciting and always changing realm of comics and graphic novels in the early years of the 21st century.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Neil Kendricks and Natalia Quintana\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nProduction Team Neil Kendricks, Writer/ Director/ Producer/ Cinematographer Neil Kendricks is a San Diego-based filmmaker, artist...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Thank You for Your Kindness and Support and Please Keep in Touch!", "update_content": "The first Kickstarter campaign for Comics Are Everywhere! came to a close on August 17.

When Leah leaves for the weekend, Kate unexpectedly finds herself alone in the apartment in the midst of the worst blackout in North American history. As darkness falls over the city, Kate\u2019s paranoia grows and she begins to believe someone in the building is stalking her. With no one to help her and escape out of reach, Kate is forced to confront her deepest fears as she fights to survive through the night.\nA story with a raw, gritty, neo-realistic feel that evolves into a suspenseful nightmare, DARK thematically is about isolation and plays on the fear of entrapment. In the tradition of moody and methodical thrillers that explore character psychosis such as Polanski\u2019s Repulsion or more recently Black Swan and Martha Marcy May Marlene, DARK is a journey into the depths of one\u2019s own mortal fears, weaknesses and the desperate struggle for sanity in a world engulfed in shadow.\nThe official poster for DARK -- Become a backer at the $50 level and get your very own!\nWHO'S ON THE TEAM?\nAttached to play Kate, our lead and heroine, is the extraordinarily talented and stunning actress Whitney Able.

But even with all of the resources of the team combined, it\u2019s not enough. The money raised through this campaign will help us acquire high quality camera and lighting equipment, materials for ambitious props and set decoration, location and insurance fees, and a multitude of other production costs. \nA concrete example is a scene in the script which requires the recreation of the 2003 blackout at night on a Brooklyn street complete with extras, burning barrels and the cooperation of the city of New York and local businesses to shut off all the lights on the street to complete the effect.

roll the dice, keep your doubles, take your re-rolls, and then act accordingly. Be the first one to collect enough sheep and you've won! Simple, right? Not quite. \nYou and your neighbors can steal sheep from each other, and your Barbarians occasionally have too much (root beer) to drink and deliver sheep to the wrong pasture. But, worst of all, is the dreaded... Sheep Guevara! If this revolutionary find his way into your flock he'll work to free them until the fight calls him elsewhere!\nThe Game - What You Get\nThe game includes:\n7 Shepherd Dice (molded, not printed)\n1 Black Sheep Die (molded, not printed)\n35 Sheep Tokens (injection molded plastic)\n1 Black Sheep Token (injection molded plastic)\nGAMEPLAY- THE BASICS\nThe game includes 7 White Sheep Dice and 1 Black Sheep Die. The White Sheep Dice decide how, and how many, sheep you will gather that round by matching doubles. Although you have to keep your doubles, the other dice can be re-rolled... but if you don't roll doubles on the re-roll you lose ALL of your dice for the turn. Except for the Black Sheep result.\nThe Black Sheep Die determines what action Sheep Guevara takes that turn. You may lose a sheep to Defection, you and your neighbors might all lose one to \u00a1Viva La Revolucion! -- or Sheep Guevara might set up camp in your pasture, and lead your sheep to freedom every turn until he moves on.\nThe game ends when one player has collected the target number of sheep (which is determined by the number of players in the game), or the field is empty and there are no more sheep to collect.\n\nGAMEPLAY - INTRO VIDEO\nThis is a quick look at the basic rules, and function of the dice, using one of our playtesting sets. Here, the dice are made with stickers over blanks -- the actual dice will be injection tooled, and not printed, for greater durability.\n\nGAMEPLAY - PLAYING A ROUND\nThis is a candid look at one of the rounds we played at a local shop with a group of volunteers. We played at least a dozen rounds that night and this video was chosen more-or-less at random. Note that we're being very polite because of the video camera.\nSTRETCH-GOALS GALORE!\nOf course there are stretch-goals for this project -- including expansion sets, product upgrades, and new add-on items. If we hit our stretch goals, both of the expansions will be included with your reward! Check it out!\n$20,000 -- Injection Molded Sheeps!\n$25,000 -- Occupy Wolf-Sheep (1 die, 1 token)\n$30,000 -- Combat Duck (1 die, 1 token)\n$40,000 -- Fluffy Sheep Doll Add-On\n...

The game is loosly based on movies like Seven and Zodiac. \nOne player plays the Detective character who struggles with his Obsession, Stability and Conscience while trying to apprehend the Killer. The detective character can be a true detective, a reporter or anything else that fits the theme. The second player plays the Serial Killer who utilizes his Cunning and Control to manipulate and elude the Detective character, all while battling his own Compulsion to kill.\nPlayers take turns using a shared character sheet called the Framing Table, to help them frame scenes. Players roll six-sided dice on the framing table to determine which aspects of their characters must be incorporated into each scene and then choose from of a variety of scene types to narrate. The game mechanics are similar to those used in Paul Czege's My Life with Master with attributes increasing and decreasing based upon the success or failure of scenes. \nPlayers take turns narrating scenes for their characters. Each character has 5 scene types to choose from that have different effects. The Detective can choose from Investigation, Personal, Compassion, Crossing the Line and Reflection, while the Killer can choose from Murder, Manipulation, Personal Kill, Misdirection or Flashback. \nFragile Minds has no Game Master, so players have free reign to narrate their scenes however they choose within the limits of the Framing Table roll. Players create the entire setting including Non Player characters (NPCs) who they maintain control of regardless of which player controls the scene. Players can also spend Plot Points to introduce their character, NPCs, or plot complications into each other's scenes.\n\nThe game continues until the Detective has collected enough Evidence to overcome the Killer's Cunning + Control, or the body count exceeds the Detective's  Conscience + Stability. Players then narrate one final scene describing their character's fate which is determined by the final attributes of the characters. There are a dozen different outcomes.\nSo, that's the game in a nutshell. I have a lot of writing left to do though. I'll be including a great deal of information about how to build characters and \"get in their heads\". One of my goals is to make each game session a character study of sorts. I'll also be including a lot of advice on framing scenes and narrating on the fly, so players who are used to having a Game Master are not stymied by the 2-player format.\n\nDonate as little as $1 and gain access to the play test version of the game that covers character creation and the basic rules.  Just donate, then check the updates to get the access info. \nWant a combination of rewards not listed, or just want to kick in a few dollars for something extra? Here are a few add-on rewards you might like. Add the appropriate amount to your pledge and when the Kickstarter campaign is over, you'll be asked which add-ons you want.\n$5 - Get 8 pages of bonus material added to your print copy that\n        shows you how to play the killer as a monster like a werewolf or\n        vampire. If you are at the $25 level or lower, just bump your pledge\n        up to the $30 level.\n$10 - $8\" x 10\" premium B&W print of a photo of your choice.\n$12 - PDF copy of Kayfabe: The Inside Wrestling Game.\n$20 - Print copy of the Fragile Minds.\n$15 - 50 pack of 11\" x 17\" Fragile Mind framing tables\n$50 - 16\" x 20\" premium poster print of a photo of your choice.\n$50 - Bound art book with photographs used in the game\n$3000 - If we hit this level, all backers getting a print copy of the book will get it in hardcover. Add the $5 Add-On and you'll also get 8 pages of bonus material that shows you how to make your Killer a supernatural creature like a Vampire or Werewolf.\n$3500 - If we hit $3500, I will write up detailed \"Case Files\" matching the three created detectives with the 3 serial killers. These Case files will include a psychological profile of the serial killer, the detective's \"official file\", crime scene photos, police reports, pictures of evidence and whatever else I can come up with. The 3 Case files will essentially be pregenerated game sessions ready for play. Anyone already getting the print edition of the game will get these too.\nThe bulk of the money raised will go towards the artwork. As many of you may know, I am an aspiring photographer, so rather than using hand drawn artwork in the game, I want to use photographs that I take myself. I need money for special effects, props, costumes, models, make-up artists, and all of the other expenses that come with doing multiple elaborate photo shoots. I want to do at least 20 different shots throughout the Fall ranging from simple prop shots to graphic crime scene photos and character portraits. I want the game to be as visually stunning as the content is intense. I will also be using the photos to do a coffee table book for people that are into horror, but not so much into roleplaying games. \nView my photography at\nerrantknightphotography.com\nClick HERE to see some promotional shots I took for my friend Renee's movie Ivanna and the Wolf (See it at GenCON this August!!).\n\nI don't have a lot of photos in this genre to show you, but here are some behind the scene shots I took from the film Golfing by Moonlight. These were taken very casually between takes, so they are not at the level the Fragile Mind shots will be.\nAs I mentioned, I still have a lot of detail work to do on the game. I'm not a serial killer or unstable detective and I'm hoping that none of Fragile Mind's future players are either, so I would also like to buy some criminal psychology textbooks and books about serial killers and forensic psychology so I can help players get into the heads of their characters. Some books are inexpensive, but the textbooks (which will be most useful) are pretty pricey. I obviously won't buy all of these, but here is my Amazon Wish List of some books I'm considering.\nBack in the 90s, when I was in college, I visited a friend during summer break and we played a few sessions of the DC Heroes roleplaying game. It was just the two of us and it was amazing. Not so much because of the game itself, but because of the story we were able to tell with the focused one on one interaction. Ever since I've been hoping to find a good two player rpg that captured that kind of storytelling.\nJump ahead 10 years when I started getting involved in the indie rpg scene. I designed a little rpg about pro wrestling called Kayfabe: The Inside Wrestling Game. Kayfabe has one major flaw, finding a group of players that is not only into gaming, but also into wrestling's behind the scenes drama and politics. Tons of people wanted to play it, but finding a group was often a big barrier for them. \nI felt bad for the people that bought my game, yet had no opportunity to play it. It was at that point I started thinking about how great it would be to have an RPG that was designed to be played with just 2 people. After all, finding ONE additional player isn't that difficult. I thought back to that DC Heroes game and how much fun a 2-player game could be, and I set out to come up with a two player game. Thus Fragile Minds was conceived.\nFor the past few years I have been playing around with Fragile Minds trying to come up with mechanics that would allow two players to tell a compelling story without a Game Master doing the bulk of the leg work behind the curtain. I discovered early on that without a GM, players would have to be good at scene framing and doing all the stuff that usually falls on the GM's shoulders \u2013 something not everyone is good at. It was a frustrating process, but I eventually came up with mechanics that worked and now I'm ready to introduce Fragile Minds to the world.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough I am confident that this project will be completed on time, There are always potentials for problems.

Design your company logo and color scheme, and watch your company stock rise and fall against your competitors! \nI put our stretch goals here for easy viewing. A more detailed description can be found here.\nWe are a two-man team of amateurs making the game of our dreams in our spare time. After developing this game for almost a year, we are looking for backers to help us make releasing this a reality. We are also looking for feedback and potential collaborators. We'd love to hear from you!\nBack in the Dwarven Motherland across the great sea, the Dwarven King, Dunold the Wise, has chartered a number of Dwarf Companies to explore and colonize strange new lands beyond the sea. As a Regional Manager in one of these companies, it is your duty to scout out one such island and make a foothold for Dwarven civilization there.\nAs regional manager, your duty is to oversee a colony of worker Dwarves for the motherland.\nThe King of the Dwarves commissioning the company's Royal Charter.\nBack home, the Dwarves are at the beginning of an industrial revolution. With newly invented gunpowder weapons and steam engines, the Dwarves have quickly overcome their ancestral enemies in the motherland, and have spread across the earth in search of profits and expanded market opportunities.\nThe Dwarves are a hardy race, and with access to gold, a warm hearth, and ale, can overcome any challenge -- and this colonization business is going to be a major challenge. The strange lands beyond the sea are uncivilized wilds, and full of unknown dangers. Competing companies see profit in these lands as well, and they don't take kindly to other firms edging in on their territory. Dwarven companies are ruthless competitors, demanding profits for their shareholders at all costs. If that means sacrificing a few measly workers for that extra ton of gold ore, so be it!\nA balloon arriving in the strange lands across the sea.\nThese are trying times for the Dwarves. Will you manage your company well and gain profit and glory? Or will you be driven back to the motherland by the hordes of savage Goblins, Elves and Mole Men, and thrown to the dustbin of history?\nDwarfcorp is played from a free-floating overhead perspective. The game takes place both above and below ground, and so is a truly 3D real-time strategy game. You can go up and down slices of the terrain, all the way from the fiery underdark to the snowy mountain tops.\nYou can go up and down horizontal slices to view different parts of the terrain. You then build underground by constructing tunnels.\nYou command a company of Dwarves by assigning them tasks such as Building, Mining, Gathering, or Attacking. Dwarves are pretty smart. Using symbolic planning-based AI, the Dwarves seek out unique ways to meet their own goals. Tell a dwarf to build a wood wall, and he will determine the best way to do that might be to chop down a tree, or else to grab the wood from a stockpile.\nDwarves take great pride in hoarding resources.\nThe goal is to gather resources and send them back to the Dwarven Motherland for profits, and grow your colony from a tiny enclave to a huge fortress. Generally, the more valuable the ore, the deeper it is in the earth.  \nSend your resources back to motherland for great profit!\nUsing the money from gathering resources, you can promote your Dwarves, or make them happier by paying them more. You can also hire more Dwarves with special skills such as Craftsdwarves, Soldiers, Wizards, and Musketeers to join your colony.\nA small one-level fortress is shown with some of the starting rooms. Each room allows Dwarves to engage in different industries or build weapons and spells.\nWith your profits, you can upgrade your colony by constructing rooms. Training Rooms can give your Dwarves the edge in combat -- The Forge can be used to construct a wide variety of mechanisms and weapons to make your operation more efficient, The Laboratory allows your magical Dwarves to research powerful spells -- and of course Drinking Halls and Bedrooms allow your Dwarves to rest and relax (like they'll be doing any of that!)\nDwarves need ale and song at the end of every hard day!\nYou can choose to pay whatever you want to your Dwarves, but if you pay them too little, or treat them too poorly (say, by not giving them enough ale), they may go on strike! Unhappy Dwarves may choose to stay in bed rather than go to work, and will write you a bad manager's report to the corporate higher-ups. Happy Dwarves will be more efficient, and will even sing while working!\nA horde of Goblins.\nBeware! The surface is full of dangers. Hostile Elves and Goblins aren't too keen on the Dwarves coming and stealing all their stuff. Underground, it isn't much safer, as Mole Men and Demons dwell there.\nMole men are sort of anti-Dwarves. They live miserable lives of savagery digging tunnels beneath the earth. They will hoard resources you need for Dwarven industry. Demons, on the other hand, are rare, devious, and should be avoided at all costs!\nDefend your colony with the most humane deterrents: deadly spike traps!\nLeverage your technical superiority over the local savages! Defend your fortress by constructing traps, hiring mercenaries and building a dazzling array of walls and channels. \nDwarves use their superior technology and crafting skills to their advantage!\nA randomly generated mountain.\nBefore starting play, you may generate an island on which to build your colony.\nMany aspects of the world are simulated.\nThe islands in DwarfCorp are procedurally generated and fully simulated.They are different every time you start playing. Fault lines, air currents, moisture, temperature, rainfall, rivers, lakes and oceans are all simulated through the passage of time -- which gives rise to forests, deserts, snowy tundra, jungles and grasslands. Additionally, civilizations of Goblins, Elves, Humans and Demons are randomly generated and given time to \"fight it out,\" so to speak, on the island. So you, as the Dwarven outsider, will make quite a splash as you arrive.\nDifferent terrain types arise from the simulation.\nAnd speaking of splashing, DwarfCorp features a finite liquid simulation system. Drain entire lakes for Dwarven industry! Power water wheels with the flow of rivers! Direct channels of lava from volcanoes! Just take care that none of your employees drown.\nMining too deep can get your Dwarves into some deep trouble!\nDay and night are simulated in the game, with the sun, moon, stars, and clouds dynamically moving across the sky. During the day, your employees may want to forage for food, but at night they had best stay underground -- where they can find caves, ores, dungeons, and other treasures.\nA full moon rising over the Dwarves.\nVolcanoes!\nIslands!\n\nWe are Completely Fair Games Ltd : a newly formed game company from Pittsburgh, PA. We are just two guys coding and pixeling for fun. In the past, we've made many smaller games with groups of friends from Carnegie Mellon University and elsewhere. We've been associated variously with the Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society, Dr. Fishbowl, and \"Team Danger\". We also participate in game jams from time to time. We both have day jobs in academia.\nMatthew Klingensmith - Programmer. Day job: PhD candidate at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon.\n\n\nWilson Pei - Artist. Day job: Master's student in Electrical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon. \n\nHere are some obscure games we've been involved with in the past:\nGet Pumped! (Winner of the 2013 Pittsburgh Global Game Jam!)\nRedux (Winner of the 2012 Microsoft Imagine Cup!)\nHydraman (2011 Global Game Jam!)\nBeestruction (Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society Gold Winner!)\nA Day in the Life of Danger (Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society Gold Winner)\nMoonwalk (Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society)\n\nWhat are we Delivering?\nIf we get this project funded, we hope to have a playable beta available by this time next year. The beta will have the basic parts of the \"sandbox\" version of the game fully implemented: colony-building, combat, traps, Dwarf classes, world generation, and an economic system. The beta will be Windows only (7 / XP), and will be available for less than $20. Purchasing the beta of the game entitles you to free updates for life. \nFrom there, we hope to have the game grow organically over time through numerous updates and community involvement. Depending on the level of initial funding we are able to acquire, we may opt to add more features or gameplay modes (i.e. stretch goals). \nOne of our main stretch goals is to port the game to other platforms like Linux, Mac and mobile via MonoGame or Unity. Another stretch goal we have in mind is to expand the game with a singleplayer campaign, complete with a storyline, cutscenes, and more. Should we meet our funding goal, more details on the stretch goals will be revealed.\nWhat do we Have So Far?\nRight now, we have what amounts to a small toy with basic implementations of some of the parts of the game. You can see screenshots of this toy on this page. Basic world generation, AI, building, mining, and economy exist, but they are in an extremely incomplete and early state. \nWe have released a simple pre-alpha prototype for you to play with to get a feel for the game. You can find it here.\nWe have a video of the prototype in action:\nFully developing the game from here will take quite a bit more work.\nWhat do we Need the Money for?\nThough we've been developing the game for free over the past year or so, we've been doing so purely as a hobby. Any time we spend on the game is currently time taken away from friends, family, work, and graduate school. We have considered working on this game at least part-time, but without any income, that is hard to justify. We want to make this game the best that we can possibly make it, and as quickly as possible.\nOur estimate of how the money will be distributed.\nAdditionally, development of the game would go much smoother if we could purchase licences to better tools (particularly to content creation tools and professional code profiling and analysis tools), better content (by commissioning professional artists and designers), and better equipment. \nFinally, the cost of actually publishing a game, even with self publishing methods, can be prohibitively expensive. \nWhen we worked out how much of an investment this would be on our part, it broke the bank! That's why we need you! If you want to see this project get off the ground and onto your laptops, become a backer! \nCheck out some of the rewards we're offering for becoming a backer! Our rewards fall into four basic categories, \"Fluff\", \"Digital\", \"Physical\", and \"Creative\". \nFluff rewards give credit to backers in the game. All backers can have their names or nicknames put into the credits. If you're extraordinarily wealthy, and have a few thousand dollars to blow on this venture, you can be named as a \"producer\", have your name appear in a subtitle on the game's main screen, or even be named as the deity of the dwarves! They will sing songs in your honor!\nDigital rewards include the alpha, the beta,  and the sound track, which you can download DRM-free. The alphais the \"feature complete,\" \"playable\" version of the game which has most of the promised game features. The alpha will be out much sooner than the beta, (probably by Christmas 2013) but will be much less fleshed out, and will be quite buggy. The beta is \"feature complete\", \"playable\", and has most of the content of the game already created. Only minor bug-fixes and tweaks remain. The beta will not be released for some time. The sound track of the game is being created in-house. You can hear a sample of one of our tracks on the video. Digital downloads of the sound track will contain 12-18 high quality, uncompressed audio tracks, and/or high quality MP3 versions.\nPhysical rewards are custom items which we will ship directly to your door over the next few months. First, you can get a glossy 7 x 5 inch postcard featuring one of five randomly generated terrains on the front, and a message from the developers on the back. We're also offering an 11 x 17 inch poster featuring artwork from the game, as well as two T-Shirt designs. Finally, we will be offering a physical CD of the game in a jewel case with custom-printed artwork on the case and CD face itself. (art by Emily So: http://emilyso.com/)\nCreative rewards allow you, as a backer, to design elements which will appear in the game. DwarfCorp allows players to customize the logo, motto, and name of their Dwarf Company. We will have several pre-set companies that players can choose from. Non-player companies will be randomly generated from these pre-sets. Taking one of the creative tiers will allow you to create one of these pre-set companies. If it's within taste, we'll include it as a pre-set! The higher creative tiers allow you to name physical features in the randomly generated world (such as oceans, lakes, rivers, mountains or volcanoes), and even design monsters and/or Dwarf classes!\nA table of rewards. Here's how to read it: each column is a donation tier. Every row with an 'x' in it is a reward you can get for that tier. If the 'x' is inside a \"pick one\" box, you may choose only ONE reward from that box.\nT-shirt, 8 color print!\nPremium T-Shirt, full color!\nMake a 32 x 32 corporate logo!\nA glossy postcard!\nThis 17 x 11 inch poster on your wall!\nSome of the Creative Tiers allow you to put a name of a company or its motto into a random pool.\nAs more people back the project, the little Dwarf will climb a ladder from the depths of the earth to the top of the mountain. He's very tired, and would desperately like to get to the top of the mountain to meet his friends! He needs your help!\nAs the Dwarf goes higher, stretch goals  may be revealed. When the Dwarf reaches a stretch goal, we will be obligated to add that (awesome) feature to the game. These will include technical features (like a larger number of available platforms) as well as gameplay features.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDwarfCorp is unfortunately nowhere near finished! We are nothing but two starving grad students working on this game as a hobby. We are NOT professional game developers. We have full time jobs, research, conferences, and all the miscellaneous bits of life to deal with in addition to making this game. And a game of this ambition and magnitude is not easy for just two people to make in their spare time.\n\nWe plan on dealing with these issues in several ways:\n\nFirstly, at the end of this project, we plan on only having a limited playable alpha available, which will be updated (slowly) over time with new features. This is the kind of game which can never be said to be \"fully finished,\" but is a kind of game which organically grows.\n\nSecondly, depending on how much funding we get through the kickstarter and other sources, we will be able to commission artists, programmers and design people to help us build the game. In addition to the general population of independent game developers we could call on to help us, we also have many talented friends and acquaintances who would love to help -- with a little funding.\n\nThirdly, if there is enough interest, we might be able to work part-time or completely quit our jobs over a couple of summers to finish this game. Trust me, I would like nothing more than to spend all day creating the game of my dreams!\n\nFinally, we hope to generate a vibrant community alongside this game and develop easy-to-use modding tools to help with content creation.

It is vast conspiracies and intimate conflicts, brutal betrayals and loyal sacrifices, final, fiery collapse and new worlds rising from ruin. It is a story in which a broken empire and a broken relationship between a father and his son can be inescapably intertwined, with one determining the fate of the other. It is a world that the mysterious Amiculus rules in secret, and no one, be he general, warlord, emperor or Pope, is beyond his reach.\nThis campaign is dedicated to the completion of Volume I of the series, Roma Aeterna. Volume I will be a 60-page, full-color comic, lavishly rendered by Italian artist and 30-year comics veteran Giancarlo Caracuzzo.\nTHE STORY\nROME FALLS...\nRomulus surrenders to Odoacer (public domain image)\nIn A.D. 475, the Roman general Flavius Orestes overthrew the Western Roman emperor Julius Nepos and placed his 12-year-old son Romulus on the throne. A year later, Orestes's partner, the German chieftain Odoacer, turned against him, and the two went to war. Odoacer destroyed the Roman army, executed Orestes, and forced Romulus to surrender his crown, ending the Roman Empire in the West. Romulus was then exiled, and disappeared from history.\nSIXTY YEARS LATER...\nA New Day?\nIt is A.D. 538, and the Eastern Roman army of Byzantium has come to reconquer the West. With them is Procopius of Caesarea, a Greek historian, who, in his search to learn Romulus's fate, discovers something unexpected: an account of Rome's last days, written by the boy-emperor himself.\nA SECRET HISTORY...\nWho is Amiculus?\nRomulus's fall of Rome is very different from the sparse history that has come down to us. It is a mosaic of conspiracy within conspiracy, bloodshed and betrayal, tragedy and loss. At its center is AMICULUS, a mysterious cloaked figure manipulating the fates of kings, generals and all of western civilization.\nWIth an empire in the balance, and an approaching Dark Age on the horizon, Procopius must learn the truth of Romulus's history: DID ROME INDEED FALL...OR WAS IT PUSHED?\nAmiculus is coming.\nTHE BACKGROUND\nAmiculus began over a decade ago as a ten-page play written for a college project. Afterward, it remained in the back of my mind amid the other flotsam and jetsam of classical learning that I had accumulated, until I revisited it as a possibility for a short graphic story. I began drafting it as a 32-page comic, and soon realized the scope was too small. One-hundred and sixty-two pages later, I realized I had an epic on my hands.\nSince that realization, I have worked tirelessly at developing the story, absorbing a library's worth of research, traveling to Rome to gather hundreds of model pictures, and securing Giancarlo Caracuzzo as a top-flight artist. \nMap of Rome\nStumbling upon Giancarlo, a native Roman, to draw my Roman story, was beyond serendipity. With his eagerness to tell this story of his city and his ancient ancestors, I don't know if I could have possibly found a more enthusiastic partner.\nTHE KICKSTARTER\nAll proceeds from this campaign will go to the production, marketing, printing and distribution of this first volume.  And we have some excellent incentives for our backers, including limited edition poster and print art, customizable covers on the first volume, an extra-long Kickstarter edition of the book, and the chance to not only be drawn in as a character, but to receive your own original character drawing, signed by the artist! \nUPDATE!\nI'd like to announce that, upon the successful completion of the campaign, ALL backers at the $15.00 level and higher will receive the 80-page Kickstarter edition version of Vol. I in place of the 60-page book!

Plus, this is our third Kickstarter, so we understand how to plan and budget for this kind of project.\n \nHere are a few of the things we\u2019re keeping an eye on:\n\n\u2022 Art: Finding the right artists and fitting into their schedule is not easy, as professional artists are almost always working. So there could be delays not only with finding the right artists but also getting it done in a timely manner. But we have a good relationship with the artists we\u2019ve worked with previously, so we have a pool of people who already know the HEX style to choose from.\n\n\u2022 Writing: Finding writers for Hollow Earth Expedition has always been tricky, as we need people who can put an original spin on a well-known genre. This is especially true for Revelations of Mars, since sword and planet fiction varies so wildly. As a result, we are going to do more of the writing in-house, which means that it may be slower initially, but what we produce should require less re-writing as we fine-tune the vision. But we will use freelance writers as much as possible to speed the book along.\n\n\u2022 Editing and Layout: Sourcebooks are complicated beasts, as they not only contain prose and flavor text, but they also include lots of rules and stat blocks that all need to be checked and double-checked for accuracy. Often, a single person can\u2019t edit the entire book. One person may have a great editorial voice while another may be a wizard with the rules. Consequently, we've used a different team of people for each book, but we\u2019re hoping to get the best of the best back for Revelations of Mars.\n\n\u2022 Printing: We\u2019ve used different printers over the years, but our print buyer works with multiple game publishers to make sure any prospective printer can meet our special needs. With that being said, there can be a dizzying array of things that can go wrong with printing: supply chain problems, mistakes and reprints, and even civil unrest. The last one just happened once, but still. While some of these things are hard to anticipate, rest assured we will do everything in our power to deliver the highest quality book in a timely fashion.\n\n\u2022 Shipping: Next to printing, shipping is the next most unpredictable area. Shipments from printers can get delayed and packages to customers can go astray. But we will do our best to keep you informed and replace missing packages as necessary.\n\n\u2022 Money: We\u2019ve done our best to budget accurately, but sometimes things cost more than expected. As long as it is not a catastrophic overage, we should be able to absorb it. We did try to keep things lean so we could set a reasonable funding goal, so we\u2019re not going to be swimming in money and will be doing our best to say within budget.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #86", "update_userinfo": "GM Screens Shipped (and HEX 10th)!", "update_content": "Greetings rocketeers!\nGood news!

The money will go towards completely covering the production costs of the miniatures and offset some of the sculpting costs. The miniatures and busts have already been sculpted and some are already being cast. This gives us a faster release time and also cuts out the risks associated with the sculpting process.\nShould we reach our goal, our first stretch goal of $12,000.00 would be used toward the funding of additional miniatures and further expanding our range. We have another two miniatures. One is currently being sculpted, the other is already sculpted and we have concepts for 6 more.\nOur final stretch goal of $18,000.00 would be used to help us develop and produce more miniatures and support the development of Carpathia, a table-top skirmish game with RPG elements based in a unique fantasy/steam-punk world developed by us.\nThe Miniatures - The 6 miniatures we are offering are 32mm or \"28mm heroic\" scale and will be cast in high quality resin. All 6 miniatures are designed specifically for Carpathia. They will all have stats and back-stories made available the deeper we get into developing Carpathia. \nOur 2 busts are about 75mm tall and are meant to be part of our collectors range. These will be released in limited numbers, in this case 2000, the first 400 of which are being made available in this KickStarter.\nLast Minute Update - Inin the Wanderer - Sculpted by Robby Crawforth\nA last minute addition of a figure from one of the factions of Carpathia. Miniature is 32mm scale and will be supplied with a 25mm round lipped base.\nThe Black Rock Clans Scorcher - Sculpted by Robby Crawforth\nThe Black Rock Clans are a collection of goblin clans living in the area known as the Black Rock located in the south eastern foothills of the Shiverpeak Mountains. They worship the Spider Goddess and consider all spiders to be holy symbols. The Black Rock Clans Scorcher is an engineer who discovered that by mixing two specific spider venom he acquired from a Arachnid Priest and setting the concoction on fire produces a tremendous heat and flame. He then built a contraption that is capable of turning that flame into a projectile thus making it a very effective weapon, especially against those pesky know it all goblins of the Free Trade Company from the other side of the mountains. \nThe miniature comes with a 25mm round lipped base and 3 head variants. \nFree Trade Company Field Marshal - Sculpted by Robby Crawforth\nThe Free Trade Company is a far reaching alliance of very wealthy merchants with only one goal, turning a profit. The Company was founded during the Goblin Wars and has since become the richest entity in the world with ports and colonies all over the known world and a large standing army. The Free Trade Company Field Marshal is a merchant who is rich enough to command his own army to help defend his interests. When he is not busy commanding his troops in battle, he takes up adventuring to far flung reaches of the world to find new riches. \nThe miniature comes with a 40mm round lipped base and a scenic resin base. \nImperial Dwarf General - Sculpted by Sergey Savenkov\nThe Imperial Dwarves are what remains of the Dwarven Empire. Only 12 legions remain of what was once a force of 40. They defend the passes through the Shiverpeak Mountains to the East. The Imperial Dwarven General is a proud and honorable dwarf. His quest of finding out the truth behind why the Dwarven Empire collapsed the way it did brings him to Carpathia. That and the Dwarven cities of Karud Nim and Karud Ish, which have been long since abandoned and according to some are now cursed.\nThe miniature comes with a 40mm round lipped base and a rectangular resin scenic base. \nImperial Dwarf Captain - Sculpted by Sergey Savenkov\nHe once led 100 men into battle when serving in the Imperial Legion, however years ago something happened. Something he never speaks of but it forced him to leave his beloved legion and his brothers in arms behind and travel to Carpathia to search for something. Whether he knows exactly what he searches for is also unknown, but until he finds whatever it is he is looking for Carpathia is his home and the dark denizens that inhabit it his enemies. \nThe miniature comes with a 25mm round lipped base and a resin scenic base.\nLilly the Huntress - Sculpted by David \"Anakron\" Ayral\nLiliana, Lilly for short as she likes to be called, is the daughter of a Elven noble. She comes from the Elven Isles in the west. Never one for conformity, her love for adventure persuaded her to leave her home at a young age and travel to the mainland to seek the adventure she loves. Her witty charm and uncanny skill with a bow have helped her find her way in the world. In Carpathia she seeks more adventure and danger.\nThe miniature comes with a 25mm round lipped base. \nThe Wolfman of Renwald - Sculpted by Robby Crawforth\nOnce a simple man from the village of Renwald in southwestern Carpathia, he now calls the Dark Forest his home. When the moon is full the sickness takes him and transforms him into a horrible bloodthirsty creature. Too often he finds his way back to his old home and preys upon the villages inhabitants. \nThe miniature comes with a 40mm round lipped base and a square resin scenic base. \nThe Wolfman Bust - Sculpted by Steven Crisp\nThe Wolfman Bust is being released as part of our Collector's Range. It is about 75mm tall and is meant for painters and collectors. The Wolfman Bust will be limited to only 2000 pieces, of which the first 400 are being made available in this KickStarter.

Read below for more on Carpathia \u2026\n\nMore About Carpathia - \nCarpathia is a D6 table top game like no other.

Build a small or large group of adventuring heroes and determine the amount of skill level and points used for the battle thereby determining the size and length of the game. You will also be able to choose the equipment, armaments, spells and a multitude of other items to equip your heroes with for battle.\nYou will then be pitted against opposing groups of adventurers. Fighting over land, glory, fame, riches or forgotten knowledge; the heroes you choose to include in your band, the equipment and items you choose to provide them with and the strategies you decide to use will all play a part in the outcome of the game.\nCampaign Mode\nFor all you RPG fanatics, Carpathia\u2019s campaign mode is what you\u2019re looking for. Get together with your friends and embark on epic adventures. Together with Carpathia\u2019s \u201cCampaign Guides\u201d you can build a group of adventurers and set forth on a journey for riches, power and fame or ancient knowledge and artifacts or even to be the most powerful and feared in the land.

Equipped with some of the most imaginative miniatures around, detailed imagery, terrain and plenty of supplemental books to help spur your imagination Carpathia will keep you wanting more!\nOur goal with Carpathia is to develop a game enjoyable by both table-top war gamers and dungeon crawling RPG players. Set in a richly detailed and unique fantasy world, we hope to make the game both enjoyable and easy to pick up, but also full of depth and customization options. The Battle Mode is a more traditional table-top war game mode, where players will be able to build war bands and do battle against other players. The Campaign Mode will be a RPG mode, where groups of players set out on epic quests together and do battle against a multitude of foes. Most if not all of the miniatures we will be releasing in the near future will be geared towards Carpathia. Including 6 of the 8 offered in this KickStarter.\nOur plan is to make all this available to you in one affordable package and to make it easy to pick the game up and begin enjoying it right out of the box. Our goal is to release Capathia late 2014.\nKeep your eyes peeled for our official Carpathia Kickstarter late next summer!\nStretched Goal $12000.00\nOur first stretch goal of $12000.00 would be used to continue expanding our Carpathia range of figures and begin introducing new factions that will be playable in the game. So far we have an additional 6 miniatures planned. These are not nearly as far along in production as our first batch. \nSahra Mistress of Djinn, Countess Erzsebet, and Imperial Dwarf Signifier\nFree Trade Company Captain, Black Rock Clans Warlord, Free Trade Company Treasure Hunter\nStretch Goal $18000.00 - \nReaching the $18,000.00 stretch goal and beyond would enable us to release even more miniatures and also help with developing Carpathia. The money will not only go towards producing new miniatures, but also towards helping create the unique world in which Carpathia is set as well as further developing the rules and other game essential materials.\nStretch Goal Rewards - \n$12000.00 - If we hit our $12000.00 stretch goal, all backers who have pledged $20.00 or more will receive one of three miniatures for free. Either Sahra, Mistress of Djinn, Countess Erzsebet, or the Imperial Dwarf Signifier.\n$18000.00 - If we hit our $18000.00 stretch goal, all backers who have pledged $20.00 or more will receive one of two miniatures for free. Either The Free Trade Company Captain, or the Free Trade Company Treasure Hunter. \nAbout Carpatha -\nCarpathia is a table-top skirmish roleplaying game set in a rich fantasy world with steam-punk elements currently in development by Olde World Miniatures. Players will take control of groups of adventuring heroes fighting against rival groups or monstrous creatures ranging from the undead, to demons, or even crazed groups of heretics and the possessed.\nThe game will be based on a points system. Before each game the participating players will decide what the game point limit should be. From there the players will be able to build their groups of adventurers each hero costing a set amount of points. There will also be countless customization options available for the heroes including weapons, armor, spells, artifacts, and many other items. There will be a total of 11 different available factions in the game with a large amount of heroes to choose from for each faction. Each hero will have his, her or its\u2019 own unique abilities and play styles. This will allow for endless group builds and possibilities that suit the players\u2019 preference. We plan on introducing various game modes ranging from group vs group combat, objective based games, and a more traditional RPG player vs environment mode. We also hope to make the game as engaging and entertaining as possible by introducing a unique game mechanics. The basic game mechanics will be very similar to many war games that are on the market today. Played on a table top complemented with scenery of the players choosing, the games will be played on a turn basis with various phases of game play taking place in each turn. Each hero will have specific attributes, statistics and unique abilities. \nAdd-Ons\nWe have received several messages from people inquiring about add-ons. We have heard you loud and clear and are doing our best to make pledging as easy and clear as possible so hear is our add-on list. I hope this makes your pledge decisions a little easier. Thanks for all the comments, suggestions and positive feedback so far.\nAny of these items can be added to any of the pledges listed, simply add the amount to your pledge and put in a comment letting us know which add-on you are looking to get.\nLast Minute Add-On - Inin the Wanderer - $10.00\nRam Mount - $8.00\nDire Wolf Mount - $8.00\nBlack Rock Clans Scorcher - $10.00\nImperial Dwarf Captain - $10.00\nLilly the Huntress - $10.00\nFree Trade Company Field Marshall - $15.00\nImperial Dwarf General - $15.00\nThe Wolfman of Renwald - $15.00\nNew Add-On, Orc Warlord - $12.00\nStretched Goal Pledges\nWe have also received a few questions on how to order the images of the stretched goal concepts. Though we would love to let you pledge for those now, we don\u2019t want to offer anything we can\u2019t deliver in a timely fashion. Our stretched goal concepts have not yet went out to be sculpted, however if we make it half way to our first stretched goal we will create pledges for the first stretched goal concepts. If we make it half way to our second stretched goal we will create pledges for the second stretched goal concepts. Just please realize that those pledges, if created will have delivery dates a little farther out the current pledges as we do not want to make any promises we can\u2019t deliver.\nWho Are We?\nWe have read your comments, both on the kickstarter and a very popular forum that we noticed has begun to comment on our project. It seems that the biggest question is, who are we? We are two friends Matt and Kevin and our company is based out of Hartford, CT. We have been friends and avid miniature fans for years. Matt has some experience in war-gaming and has been collecting and painting miniatures for 15+ years, while Kevin was into Dungeons and Dragons for much of his younger years and in the last few years has become obsessed with RPG miniature games. We both have day jobs at the same company during the day and as a team we plug away into the evenings designing and bringing to life these miniatures we are offering to you on this kickstarter, but there is a bigger picture.\nWe are, and for the last year have been developing a massive game world filled with interesting races, factions and a very rich history. Most of the miniatures that we are developing are in support of a game called Carpathia which we are also working on and plan to release much more information on in the coming months.\nOur thoughts are that while there are great miniature companies out there, a lot of them become disconnected from their fans and supporters. At Olde World Miniatures our main goals are and will always be to never sacrifice the quality of what we produce, to always do our best to remain connected to the customers, friends and fans we meet and to offer miniatures and games that are fun, interesting and don\u2019t drain your wallet. We have poured so much time, effort and money into this little start-up venture of ours that we assure you we are not going anywhere as this is our first love and we will continuously work diligently at it until it succeeds.\nExpected Delivery Dates - \nSome of these miniatures will begin shipping as soon as early September as they are quite far along in the production process. The rest will ship no later than early October.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risk is a delay in the release of the miniatures. Whether that occurs because of a damaged sculpt, a lost shipment, or delays with the casting process. We have been working with most of our sculptors for nearly 7 months now and have yet to have any issues. Also we are working with one of the most reputable casting houses in the US and have every confidence in their ability to produce only the highest quality miniatures on time. \n\nWe have seen this process through from start to finish several times and are confident that you will receive your miniatures on time. With one miniature completely finished and available for sale, three more in the final stages of the casting process and most others already sculpted and waiting to be cast, we feel that we are far enough in the process to eliminated most risks and challenges that can arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Welcome to the Olde World Kickstarter..", "update_content": "Hi Everyone!  \nJust a quick update.

We tried but it just wasn't ready and we were not about to launch a Kickstarter that wasn't ready and a game that wasn't ready only to fail. Now however, we are ready!! The Carpathia Kickstarter will be launching on April 14, 2016 and we are very excited about this.\nSo for those interested here is an update as to where we are. We currently have 19 figures in production and available on our website www.oldeworldminiatures.com (slowly transitioning to  but yes they both take you to the same page right now). We also have approximately 20 more figures sculpted and sitting waiting to be cast. We have also been adding some figures that were sculpted in 3D as opposed to traditional sculpting. Don't get me wrong we love our traditional sculptors but we were quickly finding that there wouldn't be enough time in the world to produce all of the figures we have in store for you with traditional sculpting and we were also very pleasantly surprised at how amazing the detail is with our 3D sculpts so now we have a nice mix of both being produced."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "We have been quiet, but very very busy!", "update_content": "Hi everyone, We know it's been a while and we apologize for the silence, but as it turns out working full time during the day and trying to develop an entire world, game and figures at night takes a lot out of you!! We have been quiet but very busy continuing our mission to bring you the game we promised you over a year ago. Olde World Miniatures is now up to about 30 miniatures and working hard to finish off the first 4 factions needed to launch our game. We have dealt with all kinds of road block including a website that didn't work for a year. Well we are here to tell you some good news. Our new website is up and running and the store actually works!! The site is currently being updated daily as we are adding tons of write ups about the world, the game and the factions involved. Now for the biggest news, the game of Carpathia is finally nearing completion and we are working with manufacturers to figure out pricing all while refining and finishing off the rules and we are excited to announce that we will be launching the long awaited Carpathia Kickstarter this September! So everyone please, check out our Facebook page and check out the new website. We will be updating them often from now until launch. We are also working to bring you a forum where we can all exchange ideas and we can ask your opinions as we tweak and finish what promises to be the best tabletop game of 2015!

Make sure you check out the rest of our Kickstarter page to see what we wish to deliver with our final product.\nNB! This is just a prototype, there is music but there are no sound effects, also one might encounter some performance issues. So please just keep in mind that we are still in early stages of development and the demo or trailer do not represent the final quality of the game. \nIf you find any bugs or have suggestions on how to better the game, we are more than happy to take a look, you can post about it to our official forum on Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/ljis17/) or let us know in the comments section :)\nWe have also uploaded a Developer Commentary video about the demo to Youtube, you can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkA8XkIjBHo\nThem thumbs, we sure need'em! Can we have yours?http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=169956505\nLast Jungle In Sector 17 is a top-down view 2D action strategy game being developed for PC and Mac on the Flash platform. It can run in a browser using the Flash plug-in or as independent entity (.exe file).\nThe game is planned to release in 3 parts, each part adding new gameplay elements and continue the story.\nOur first goal is creating the single player campaign, though we'd love to add multiplayer co-op and competitive modes (see stretch goals).\nControls: The game is played using the keyboard and the mouse. The player starts out with the hero craft which he controls throughout the game and the first goal is to learn to control that craft in zero gravity environment. To be effective in dogfights the player needs to also master the deflective shooting technique.\nGUI: There is a lot of information the player needs to see at any one moment, we have tried to make all of it as easily readable as possible.\nObjectives: The primary objective of the game is to defend the home space station from hostile enemy activity. At the beginning the player must use the hero craft to do so, but as the game progresses he also gains access to defense turrets, upgrades (which won't just make the stats better, but also deliver special abilities), tactical structures and allied crafts.\nEconomy: Upgrades and assets can be purchased for credits which are earned by eliminating the enemy crafts. In the current demo version the credit is given by simply destroying the enemy craft, but for the final version a more intricate system is planned - after destroying the enemy craft, it's debris would be left floating in the space, to earn the credits one of the pieces would have to be scanned close by for verification. The player has to act fast though before the debris float too far and are lost forever. The pieces can be scanned by the hero craft or the allied crafts, so the allied crafts would also act as kind of \"harvesters\".\nEnemies: The game would feature many different kinds of hostile vessels all with different abilities and characteristics. Some crafts rely more on numbers while others on their special abilities. To be successful the player has to learn, adapt and react to each unit differently. Some of the enemies are what we call \"puzzle crafts\" which the player has to figure out how to defeat (e.g. Teleporter in the current demo). Few enemy crafts examples (copy/paste from drafts file): \nKamikaze - Fast moving low health craft, doesn't maneuver, only tries to get close to the closest target(allied ship or the spacestation), locks on a target. Shoots the cannon when something is straight on sight. Makes a sound which grows louder when it comes closer. When exploded do damage to both allied and enemy crafts. Think of something like those guys: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpY-cfTqzsI&feature=related \nTeleporter - Doesn\u2019t use boids, shoots rapidly like 5-6 shots at once, doesn\u2019t teleport away until is shot at. Uses shields. Medium-Hard enemy. Attacks firstly the crafts secondarily the space station. Does not teleport on top of the space station.\nEMP generator - Has very strong shields which are down only when it is charging up for next pulse. When getting hit by EMP all electronics go down, player can\u2019t move the ship, the radar screen goes black, the buying menu disappears, no dialogue can happen, even music stops. There is a sound of engine powering down - D\u017dIJUUuUuUuuuu. When the EMP power is restored the engine powering up sound is played.\n\nAllies: Like mentioned above the player can purchase defense turrets and allied crafts to help defend the space station. Unlike traditional RTS games in ljis17 the allied units aren't really controlled by the player, they act on their own, leaving the player free to fight with it's own craft. As with enemy units there are a variety of allied units, all with different characteristics and abilities. Some turrets are good for taking down enemies from afar while some are good against stronger enemies which get closer to the base. Same with allied crafts some are good for offensive maneuvers while others stay back and defend the base.\nSummary: We want to put the player into situations where he first feels helplessness and desperation, but after figuring things out he'd feel rewarded.To get there he would have to use his reflexes, strategic planning abilities and observation skills. \nSoon after leaving Earth in the 26th century, mankind encountered an intelligent space-faring species much like themselves. Through the technology exchange programs between the two races many new breakthroughs in science were made, most notable being the discovery of quantum teleportation. Born from the cooperation of the most brilliant minds from both sides it was as if filling the gaps one couldn't alone. Soon after the discovery, the speed of space colonization took to another level. \nThe teleportation devices could teleport matter to anywhere in the universe, but the procedure had a mystery no-one could solve or even explain. A cruel teleportation law applied to all living beings, for anyone alive going in from one end arrived brain-dead the other. Even sending insects or plants resulted in failure because the process corrupted the DNA sequences beyond repair. This limited the possible colonization distance since everything living would still have to use classical means of transportation. Even so, soon all nearest habitable planets were colonized by both races.\nThe increasing live matter trade between the colonies eventually lead to the rise of interstellar rocket fuel prices. Latter being a limited resource only found and mined on handful of planets. The at first subtle political fights for control over those planets coupled with greed, corruption and race pride eventually lead to an all out galactic war between the two races.\nFor a decade a short period of peace was established, but the ever decreasing fuel supplies eventually lead to the break out of the Second Fuel War, this time without remorse, both sides going for complete control of another.\n100 years into that war, after a large scale attack on humanities greatest war ships, fighter craft pilot Ryder finds himself stranded alone, without communications, on an abandoned space station from the last peace period. However, soon after the arrival he discovers that he isn't as alone as he thought - the station is controlled and regulated by an advanced neural network AI 'Johnny'. \nRyder finds out that Johnny was created to simulate and control the integrate climate system of the rainforest on board the space station, he also learns that Johnny has been cut off from civilization since the war started again 100 years ago. Together they try to work out ways to contact the outside galaxy. Months after Ryder's arrival the station is found by the enemy fleet, they then have only each other to rely on in order to survive the hostile assault.\nThe story is told trough in-game dialogue and graphic novel style story scenes.\nPrimary goal of $5000 adds to the pot of finances we have already put aside ourselves and buys us time to create the base game and do the following before this year ends:\nAdd sound effects (This is one of the few things we don't have the skill for and we'll need to hire someone for that).\nLicense music.\nCreate an animated and interactive tutorial system.\nOptimize our current game engine for better performance.\nIntroduce a more intricate economy system.\nCreate upgrade system for hero craft, turrets and allied units.\nCreate smarter AI with fight-or-flight response.\nAdd a variety of different special ability enemy units.\nAdd more types of turrets and allied crafts.\nCreate multiple difficulty levels.\nAdd more boss units.\nFinish drawing the story.\nAdd more and nicer particle effects.\n$6000 - Bullet time function - this function will allow the player to slow down time to dodge projectiles and aim shots. The bullet time ability has a trade-off though, it uses the same energy resource as the hero craft's shield, so the more player uses bullet time the less shield he has at that moment.\n$8000 - Colossal enemy ships - right now only smaller fighter crafts are planned for the game, with this extra support we will be able to introduce larger enemy motherships and dreadnoughts, which will have their own turrets and different abilities like the ability to repair damaged fighter crafts or attack at a really long distance.\n$10 000 - Special in-game missions - right now the core gameplay is concentrated on defending the base space station, adding different missions for the player to take part of would surely enrich the overall experience. \n$35 000 - Multiplayer with co-op and competitive modes - co-op would enable up to 4 people to play the main campaign. We haven't thought very deeply on what the competitive side would bring, but we certainly won't want to just add a DM mode and be done with it. It would be something more along the lines of Left 4 Dead and Natural Selection with base building and defensive vs offensive sides.\n1$ HONOR - Your name (or company) will be added to the honorary list on our website.

I go like \"I do design and animation, some advertisement and programming...\" and they are like \"Oh you are an IT person\" and I'm like \"Umm, what? ...Am I?\". \n\nThing is, I have a wide range of fields I specialize in and it's hard to put a finger on one specific thing. But I think my unofficial work title would be: \"Engineer of dynamic, static and interactive media\" \n\nAround 1999 I did my first steps in digital art with Corel Photo-Paint, later came animation, web design, 3D, flash, advertisement, infographics, GUI design and programming. \n\nI'm from Estonia and for the last 5 years I've been working in Estonias biggest news agency doing things described above, before that I worked at an ad agency and before that I actually did some IT related stuff, being a cable and HUB deployer and doing network maintenance. \n\nBut my real passion has always been games. I remember the first video game I ever played was Tetris, I must've been like 3 or 4 years old and I didn't understand how to play it, I thought I had to build a house and I have to leave windows in it. Later on, me and my older brother bought the ZX Spectrum, we had lots of games and the games had to be loaded from cassette tapes. I'll never forget the screeching sound it made when loading a game.\nYou can read more about me and and my rant on video games on ljis17 webpage under the \"team\" section: http://ljis17.com/team/\nI can best be described as a person with many passions and interests, but one of my first passions in life was programming. Throughout my many years of programming, I have created simulations, games, websites and databases. My hobbies and interests include, but are not limited to, gardening, economics, the environment, and engineering projects. \n\nI am a recent graduate of Computer Science, and feel that my education in college has helped me to improve my skills. In the future, preferably near future, I would like to use my skills acquired throughout my life in order to create technology that combines all my passions in order to make the world we live in a more enjoyable and better experience.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur main goal is to get onto Steam Greenlight, which might very well not happen.

The Changing Breeds hunt places where wolves do not tread, from the storm-tossed skies and sun-lost seas, to the jungle depths and broad deserts. Spiders spin their webs, each silken strand reflecting how the world should be. Bloody-handed serpents kill swiftly and vanish into shadow and myth. Hyenas choose the slain and call down the rain as they fight a desperate war for their homeland. The Changing Breeds will take their rightful place in the world, and woe betide anyone who stands in their way.\nThis book brings the Changing Breeds to life, giving players and Storytellers tools to integrate shapeshifters into the World of Darkness. All eleven Changing Breeds are described in detail, along with the three long-extinct lost breeds. Storytellers who want to breathe more life into an antagonist and players who want to portray a different werebeast will find all of the information they need in this book.\nW20 Changing Breeds contains:\nDetails on the eleven Changing Breeds who hunt in modern times, from the Ajaba werehyenas to the Rokea weresharks \nCharacter creation information for each Breed, including Gifts, rites, fetishes, and more besides. \nNew information on the three Lost Breeds: the Apis wereaurochs, Camazotz werebats, and Grondr wereboars. \nExample Chapter Opening Page Spread\nPage Spread From Bastet Section\nBut don't take our word for it.

At least one bookmark, leatherette \"hide\" cover material, special edging for the pages, and a full-color, 220+ page interior that features new stunning color artwork are all part of this Deluxe package.\n\nAs with our successful KSs for Deluxe versions of V20 Companion, V20 Children of the Revolution, Werewolf the Apocalypse Twentieth Anniversary Edition, Mummy: The Curse, and Exalted 3rd Edition, we are posting this in order to give our backers the chance to have a say in the kind of package we'll deliver and to further foster the community of Werewolf fans around the world. The text of W20 Changing Breeds was commented on by our community and subsequently amended by Stew Wilson during the Open Development Process on the W20 Blogs, and, because of their backing during our W20 KS, some of our backers' likenesses will be appearing in the art for this book. We had a blast talking with the community during our previous KSs and fully hope that every backer will enjoy commenting both here and on the WW W20 Blogs: http://whitewolfblogs.com or our Onyx Path Facebook page.\n\n\nWe have a great community and want to hear from more of you, so please comment away!\n\nBecause of the incredible response to the PDFs we offered with our last KSs, we are offering several reward tiers that include collections of classic Werewolf: The Apocalypse books in PDF form. (These are offered as they exist on DriveThruRPG and may be scans of the original printed books, or may have been rebuilt as original electronic files depending on their age). These rewards may also be added to any of the other reward tiers by manually increasing your pledge as noted below.\n\nWe have included two Retailer Reward Tiers, one US and one non-US, because we want to be able to support all the great Retailers out there who have supported WW for these past several decades. We have a special reward price just for Retailers (someone who owns a store that would sell Deluxe W20 Changing Breeds) and anyone thinking of pledging to those Retailer Reward Tiers needs to contact me: richt@theonyxpath.com to confirm that you are operating or representing a store before pledging, please. Any pledges to those Retailer Reward Tiers which do not have confirmations of status will not be honored when sending out Rewards.\n\nWe have US and non-US reward tiers so that the specific shipping costs for physical rewards can be built into the pledges, as there was just too much confusion when we tried to leave it to folks to manually add shipping. We do not, however, try to add in or calculate each countries VAT. That amount, if any, will be an extra charge between you and your customs officials.\n\nIt's pretty easy. Contribute any amount you want, bearing in mind the levels of contribution and their commensurate rewards over there on the right. If we hit our $40K goal, you'll get the reward that goes with your level of contribution.

we're still using these Kickstarter projects to gauge the players' interest in future Werewolf and World of Darkness titles. Using Kickstarter, we're able to produce books more quickly and deliver them directly to the players, skipping the distribution system entirely.

The writing and art is already 99% finished.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the Deluxe W20 Changing Breeds. \nSolution: I was forewarned as to the extremely high costs of shipping such a big book outside the US (and shipping ain't cheap inside the US for that matter), and was able to find ways to work with other shippers to bring down those costs - both to keep the consumer costs for shipping as low as possible, and to allow us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The books will take a long time to produce and anger the backers. \nSolution: We've learned many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. That being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process.

It doesn't include a printed interior, or endpapers, or the right color silk bookmark or gilded page edges. I'm not completely sure I understand why they need to make and send me one with every book, but they are painstaking in the details like you'd want for your Deluxe printer, so OK.

That first volume was on the beginning, and now we are asking backers here on Kickstarter to give us another chance to continue our tale.\nThe Gun Kingdoms is a chaotic time tucked inside the 13th Age of the Nameless Realms were elementally devoid Samaya rule feudal nations that via for power amid a world where their former masters, the Enlightened have been hunted to the brink of extinction.  \nOur series revolves around Captain Kaleb Cross, freebooter and rogue captain of an experimental vessel left over from the great war between the Samaya and the Enlightened.  His crew are his family, and among this rag-tag band of adventures is Skylla, a half-Enlightened slave who has worked her way up to being Kaleb's second in command.\nAfter our first volume, David and I knew what was next, and this painting became our inspiration.  'The Consultant' as it is called, show out intrepid hero, Kaleb, ready for action as an airship drifts behind him.  What better way to show fantastic steampunk action than with airships, and a pulp adventure that follows a crew in search of legendary craft and the treasures they hold.\nIn The Airship of Fools, Kaleb and his crew will be hired to uncover secrets thought lost in the final war between the Samaya and the Enlightened.  This will be an adventure of the highest order, and promises to be another page turning romp through the incredible world of the Gun Kingdoms.\nBelow, you'll get a look at 'The Consultant' and you must also remember that like all Art of the Genre books, illustrations will be key in propelling the tale to a whole new level of enjoyment.  For all you art collectors out there, David's original work will also be available at certain backer levels as well, so get these pieces of history while you can.\n'The Consultant' The painting that inspired the theme of Airship of Fools.\nAlso, if funding goes well, we've dreamed up some outstanding stretch goals just in case!\nAbout Art of the Genre: AotG is an independent small press founded in 2011 by editor Scott Taylor in an attempt to recapture what had been lost in today's bright lights and digital artwork driven marketplace.  The company is founded on the principles of delivering 'fast, fun, reads' just like the old dime store fiction from the 1960s and 70s while using illustrations from classic fantasy artists to capture the feel of the Nameless Realms universe where all company's tales are set.

Strategize together and win or lose as a team. OR, if you\u2019re feeling more a little less Co-Op, and bit more competitive, several players can take control of the Hordes while the others play the Heroes and duke it out from there!\nWe\u2019ve had epic fun playing this game and have brought it to Kickstarter so that you can, too.\nFOUR THINGS we like in a Game Night that we have implemented in The King's Armory:\n1) The ability to ADD or REMOVE PLAYERS in the middle of the game without ruining the game, or even upsetting the game balance! Yup, you read that right! : )  So if you're tired of: \"Sorry, I'm gonna to be late\u201d \u2026or\u2026 \u201cI have an early curfew.\u201d ruining your game night... that is no longer a problem!  You can add or remove a player at the start of any Wave without issue, and the game automatically adjusts its difficulty level for future Waves accordingly!  So an addition or a loss no longer damages game night!  A+!\n2) A game that is easy to learn and play the first time.  Learning 10,000 rules before you can play is not fun to us.  So we made this game with great depth but demanded that it be very easy to pick up. It can be jumped into and learned simply by playing 1 round!  The game largely teaches itself and allows you to make a few minor mistakes early on without dire consequences.\n3) Any # of players. Play with 2, 5, 7, or solo! Someone can\u2019t make it? It\u2019s all good. ~ Got stood up? No sweat: play solo! ~ Someone brought a guest you didn\u2019t expect? Also fine. \n4) Replay Value. Every time you play, you can change all of the following: Hero selection, Map size and arrangement, Monsters fought, Hired Help, Equipment, Reinforcements, Boss, and Armory Weapon! Or, choose your favorites and perfect them. The combinations are endless.\nFinally!  Game Night your way! \n\nGame Play Video ~ Part 1:\nThis video covers: Introduction to The King's Armory, Game Set Up, Hero Selection, and Wave 1, including...\n~Foes Turn: Random Monster Selection, Movement, Attack, and Combat Rules\n~Player's Turn: Action Use, Special Actions, and various Damage Types.\n~Tips for Co-Op Strategies!\nComment Here!\nLet's break that down into some detail...\nIndividual Terrain Tiles allow you to arrange the map differently each time!\nSet it up for your team\u2019s desired difficulty level.  \n                                        A sampling of individual Terrain Tiles!\n\n                              Fully assembled 4x4 (16 tile) Standard Map example.\n                 Border art to be updated further, and will puzzle-interlock to stay in place!\nThe enemies follow the uniquely arranged arrows, which always lead them to their devious goal of breaking into the King's Armory!\nVary your difficulty level: Paths longer and closer together make an easier game; shorter or further apart make for a more challenging one.\nThe unique border system adjusts to the size of your map, keeping it stable while you shoot down some enemy scum!\nMake it an epic campaign with an extra-large map!

They stalwartly tank the enemy monsters, preventing them from advancing and giving the ranged Allies time to take them down. Foot Soldiers have no place being in the towers, they remain on the ground, usually right on the roads. However, like all Hireables, they must stay within a certain range of a tower for security and health recovery.\n                                          The invaluable Foot Soldier!\nArchers are the heart of the damage output. These proficient young ladies get multiple attacks per round and can target foes at great distance!  They \"plink\" their Foes down to size so other Allies can strategically finish them off.  Archers are also fully upgradable.  Keep them on the towers; they have a better view from up there and are safe from Melee attackers.\n                                               The clinch Archer!\nSorcerers are the magically adept.

Heroes run around the board freely and lay down the hurt wherever it is needed.\n\nWith more actions per turn than Hireables, each Hero has more time to use each of his/her 4 special Attack Types & Special Actions.  With no two Heroes sharing the same Attacks or Special Actions, they are each VERY unique, and all play an important part in an effective strategy!\nItching to have another Hero? Love even numbers? Love excessive damage output and general fearlessness?\nThen YOU will want the\u2026\nHere he is, the master of water and ice who will grapple with anything and fears nothing, as he has personally shut the gates to the dark-side before!\nAsphar the Barbarian!\n                                               Asphar the Barbarian!\n\nPreview of Asphar's the master of water and ice's Hero Stat Card!\n                                Prototype of Asphar's Hero Card!\n         (Card art to be redesigned, but this gets you the gist of what you'll have.)\n               Note the Damage and Crit #s!

Combat is resolved with the unique \"power card\" system, designed to have all the excitement of dice-based combat, but with far less randomness. Whoever has the last hero standing wins control of Power City!\nGame design by: Phil Walker-Harding (Designer of Archaeology: The Card Game, Sushi Go!, Pirates of the Spanish Main: Shuffling the Deck and Dungeon Raiders)\nArt and graphic design by: John D-C (See more of John's awesome artwork at www.johnd-c.com)\nAdventureland Games has been publishing board and card games for over 5 years, and has recently released their latest game, Sushi Go! via a crowd-funding campaign.\nWhat you get: 35 hero cards, 18 power cards, 7 team cards, 10 weapon cards, 2 reference cards, 25 wound markers, 4 stun markers, rule book, hero almanac (including origin comic)... plus 3 Kickstarter-exclusive chrome foil hero cards and 2 Kickstarter-exclusive badges!

The drafting is very fun! Gameplay is simple and easy.\" - Tom Vasel, Host of The Dice Tower and prolific game reviewer\n\"The game is fast and satisfying, you will be playing matches in a row. It has the right amount of depth without being complex, it's elegant in its design and it looks beautiful. The game really nails it in every aspect.\" - Yiorgos Golfinopoulos, review on BoardGameGeek\n\"There is plenty of re-playability in having different teams match-up against one another and the added depth of team drafting. I can also see it becoming something of a cult-classic beer 'n' pretzels kind of game at universities and gaming conventions.\"    - Neil Thomson, BoardGameGeek gold reviewer\nCheck out Tom Vasel's full video preview of the game:\nThe heart of the game is the hero cards.They represent one hero in the game, and are modelled after vintage trading cards.

You can either pick one of the set starting teams, or draft your team. Drafting allows you to put almost countless sets of heroes together to try out all sorts of crazy combos and synergies! Drafting works almost like a mini-game before the main event, as the players try to put their best possible team together.\nOnce you have picked your team, it's time to fight! There is a very simple structure to gameplay. The players take it in turn either bringing a hero into play, or using their hand of power cards to trigger one of their heroes' amazing super powers! \nAt the start of each turn, you may also move a hero, based on their movement ability. Getting your team into the right positions to attack is a big part of the tactical play. At the end of each turn, you'll draw a power card.

Right?\nSimple.\nOkay.\nSo here's my plan. I am writing or have written all these great games. And I want to get them out to you as fast as I can, so I can make some great stuff in 2014. So. While you're waiting for my cool new fantasy gaming world or my science fiction action extravaganza, you can be playing these short, GMless roleplaying games.\nI won't lie. These games are not your standard hack and slash adventuring fare. I've designed six games that all deal with different kinds of protagonist drama and pathos.\nI like playing them all. The playtesters love playing them. And I want you to experience them as well.\nThese are NOT mini games. While each is designed to be played in one evening the books are at 50 least page pages each and in some cases may reach 100 pages. With hand out and cards and PDFs, the total will get very high.\nMy last four written books were 256, 312, 400, and 840 pages long.\nWhile these are still be written and put into a readable format, I can assure you, they will not be 12-page pamphlets.\n(Though I will design one of those for $50.)\nYour contributions ensure that there is art inside these books and that they get done on time.\nThis is also the only way to ever get Hardback versions of the books and the special soft cover editions. Exclusive stuff. Includes +1 hit points and a wand of wonder.\nSo here is what you can get:\nRoleplaying children in a post-apocolyptic future. This game was first released in 2005 without any marketing. Everyone who played it loved it. This improved edition includes more advice for play, a new interior design, and rules for building your own post-apoc world.\nGeorge's Children is a GMless roleplaying game played over the course of one day in the life of the children. The game is also zero-prep, so you can start playing within minutes of cracking the PDF. Described as Mad-Max + Lord of the Flies.\nGeorge's Children mixes desolation, fear, anxiety, and hope into a simple and elegant game system that plays out in a few hours.\nFor more information on this 60+ page game:\nhttp://postworldgames.com/2013/07/25/georges-children-2/\nArt by Jon Hodgson.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQdcgFvp4lk\nPurposely misspelled, Dying Memoryes is another zero-prep and GMless roleplaying game. This time, players take on the roles of crewmembers trapped in cryogenic stasis aboard a ship lost in deep space. The spaceship has gone adrift, heading into the orbit of a wayward planet (or a star\u2026 or a nebula). As the ship\u2019s unavoidable and tragic descent to the inhospitable world continues, the crewmen suffer traumatic episodes of fragmented memories from their past, in an attempt to rebuild their account of the past \u2014 their final moments spent trying to formulate who they were and what is happening.\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/218255739/six-gmless-roleplaying-games-by-jim-pinto-post-wor/posts/550525\nArt by jim pinto.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V5Mq9az2fc\n\u201cIn the remote town of Northern Falls, Rebecca Ashwick has been murdered. But no one seems too keen on solving the murder, not even the residents\u2026\u201d\nSet in the fictional town of Northern Falls, Forget-Me-Not allows players to take on the roles of various key figures in town \u2014 the Sheriff, the Town Drunk, the Reporter, etc. \u2014 but no one owns any of the characters. Each scene is played different from the last, as we explore the confusing and weird behaviors of the people unaffected by Rebecca Ashwick\u2019s death.\nInspired by the weird storytelling methods of directors like Lynch, Soldenz, the Polish Brothers, and others, this game takes players into the surreal world of small town heiresses and business owners long-since removed from the fast-paced world miles from their doorstep.\nThe Sheriff enjoys AM radio and lipstick to give you a sense of the game environment.\nThe game comes with 12 NPCs and 12 Distractions/Locations, which are vital to play. Stretch goals include more of each. Here is a sample character card: front/back.\nRoberta is just one of several quirky people living in Northern Falls. The game plays weird, because it's supposed to feel weird. This game definitely qualifies as experimental.\nA printed deck of cards unlocks as a stretch goal and can be used to play instead of the PDF sheet. It is not necessary to play the game, but it makes things run smoother.\nArt by jim pinto and Jeff Wright.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTRTIp3F8hA\nKing Ulfstater is dead.\nTomorrow we set his body ablaze and send the boat out upon the river Volstag.\nTonight. We feast.\nWe revel.\nWe recall all the great things of Ulfstater.\nAnd we avoid squabbling for his throne while the body is still warm.\n\nThe Death of Ulfstater is a roleplaying game set in a fictional village on the edge of Viking Lands. Ulfstater, the King, has passed away and the PCs are his loyal vassals, all saddened by their lord\u2019s passing, but vying for power nonetheless.\nDevoid of a gamemaster, The Death of Ulfstater mixes intrigue, intimidation, viking honor, and bloodshed into a unique game system that plays out in a few hours.\nThe Norns have cut the thread of Ulfstater\u2019s life \u2014 will they cut yours, or will they spin it into the golden life-thread of a king?\nArt by \"TBA.\"\nThe Witch is a zero-prep, GM-less roleplaying story game. The players take on the roles of soldiers, clergy, and fanatics tasked with delivering a suspected witch to a religious order for trial. One of these players plays the role of the witch.\nAs the game progresses, the players are forced to make important decisions about the guilt or innocence of the witch\u2026 and whether or not the witch can be trusted. Tension mounts as the game reaches a climatic conclusion of life or death for the witch.\nThe game includes rules for suspicion, trust, and even the witch's innocence, determined by the actions of the players.\nArt by Eric Lofgren.\nThe Code of Bushido weaves its ways through the sagas and stories of ancient Japan. Monogatari is a GMless roleplaying game about samurai in conflict with this code, struggling to avoid dishonor\u2026 or worse, seppuku.\nNot only does Monogatari include an introductory scenario, but it also includes a printable sheet of 49 cards. The game also includes an \"honor wheel\" so players can impact the micro and macro levels of play.\nA printed deck of quality cards unlocks as a stretch goal. It is not necessary to play the game, but it makes things run smoother.\nArt by \"TBA.\"\nEach stretch goal reached reveals new (secret) stretch goals and unlocks additional reward levels as well.\nUnlocked.\nEveryone backing at $100 or more receives a free copy of Mjolnir, the 18-page PDF of the fabled hammer of Thor.\nUnlocked.\nPreview of a 7th Game (to be released in 2014).\nPreview of a supernatural sandbox-adventure PDF (A Buried Past).\nEveryone backing at $100 or more receives a personalized PDF character sheet for George's Children.\nUnlocked.\nEveryone backing at $75 or more receives a free copy of Mjolnir, the 18-pages PDF of the fabled hammer of Thor.\nEveryone backing at $100 or more receives a free copy of the forthcoming PDF Soap Opera LARP rules.\nIn addition, Monogatari will include cards with a Shakespearean theme, along with a 2+ page write-up on using the game in this context rather than Feudal Japan.\nUnlocked.\nAnyone backing all six games receives a free deck of cards for each game that requires a deck of cards.

Become the head of a newly created \u201cNew Space\u201d company whose goal is to establish a colony on Mars. You begin as a start-up and develop cutting edge aerospace technologies to reach orbit. Flying beyond the vicinity of Earth, blaze the trail into space and leave the competition far behind on your way to victory.\nOur game aims at achieving two goals: promoting the outer space industry and satisfying all fans of economy games. Race To Mars combines the realism of a space-port management sim and approachable gameplay. We assure you that both subject enthusiasts and casual gamers will find this mixture highly entertaining. Our priority is to make an approachable game without compromising its key economic and strategic features. \nOn the main game screen, there will be the firm\u2019s HQ and additional buildings related to the company\u2019s activities. Most of the buildings will be created during the game, in the development phase of various projects, both major and minor ones. For example, a medium-size launch pad will be developed during R&D activities related to the medium-size rocket. \nAs an important game element, the player will have to interact with National Space and Air Office, the military, scan new market offers and monitor the activity of competitors. The authors of the game propose a simplified system called \u201cthe market\u201d. \nSince we aim at delivering the best quality, the game is being developed in close cooperation with scientists from a Polish space industry company Kosmonauta.net.

We will tell you more if we do, but you can expect that the game will be created for different platforms and, thanks to your money, it will happen much faster.

During this process the alien races of the T\u2019mml, Katrik, Serazin Dynasty, and others came into being. Each of the new empires had names, innate abilities tied to their homeworlds, and special cards in the works to add diversity and alien flavor to the game. After multiple revisions of the alien to come, the first two empires to vie for dominance appeared a little bland. The game was still fun with them, but they seemed to have been shorted when compared to their future rivals.

If a player wants to use something that doesn't have numbers, western-style Hindu-Arabic numerals, he must receive the permission of his opponent. Dice that use symbols for three or more of their representative numbers are not allowed. The lowest number on a dice must always be one and the numbers should advance by one each facet.

If a player fails to pay the cost of a Directive during their Build Phase, the Directive is discarded and generates no effect that turn. Directives can only be accessed while in your hand.

That map is everything you need to start exploring the mysteries of the Ninth World, but it had to fit within the book. With your help, we can bring you the maps of Numenera at an even more massive scale, with enhanced printing treatments, and on premium materials--with a level of detail reserved for the most dedicated Ninth World explorers!\nWhat you've unlocked so far...\nThe World Map:\nThis is a map of the Numenera setting's \"Ninth World.\" Specifically, it depicts the regions known to the people of this world as \"The Steadfast\" and \"The Beyond.\" The Standard Edition copies of this poster also feature a Technological Complex on the back--an enigmatic adventuring site filled with fantastic high-tech terrain features and incomprehensible machines, presented at miniatures scale.\nThe Numenera World Map\nThe Technological Complex\nThanks to stretch goals, each copy of the Numenera World Map (in any edition) will include a bonus 11x17 inch double-sided black and white mini-poster designed to let players chart the landscape of the Ninth World as they explore it.

This will be the only way to see this metropolis on such a massive scale--and I have never before made a city map so detailed!

The Standard Edition maps (and only the Standard Edition maps) will be printed double-sided, with a map of a mysterious adventuring location on the back that features a one-inch grid for use with miniatures. You can get these posters folded and packaged in a clear resealable envelope with a cover card insert, or rolled in a tube with no fold lines.\n\n2) PREMIUM LIMITED EDITION - These deluxe versions take the 22x34-inch world map or city map to the highest level: Each special, limited edition print features a high-gloss UV coating for the best possible color depth, and each will be hand-signed and numbered by the artist, then rolled in a tube for shipping. Only 200 World Map prints and 200 City Map prints will be produced; once they sell out, they're gone forever!\n3) STANDARD-SIZE VINYL EDITION - This is a 24x36-inch map--slightly larger than the standard edition, and printed on high-quality vinyl instead of poster stock. In this edition, you can choose between the World map, the City map, the Unlabeled World map, or the Unlabeled City map. This is a Kickstarter exclusive. (Aside from a few for use at conventions, we're printing only enough of these to fulfill these rewards.)\n4) OVERSIZED POSTER EDITION - This huge 31x47-inch poster map is printed on 8 mil satin photo paper. In this edition, you can choose between the World map, the City map, the Unlabeled World map, or the Unlabeled City map. This is also a Kickstarter exclusive that won't be available through retail channels!\n5) MASSIVE VINYL EDITION - This deluxe option presents its map at a whopping 48x72 inches (thats 4 feet high and 6 feet wide!), on durable, high-quality vinyl. In this edition, you can choose between the World map, the City map, the Unlabeled World map, or the Unlabeled City map. This, too, is a Kickstarter exclusive that won't be available in stores!\nShipping is free for all printed rewards sent to domestic backers; overseas backers are asked to cover part of the additional shipping costs.\nDelivery of the printed posters should begin in mid-August, and backers who will be attending Gen Con in Indianapolis from August 15-18 will have the option to pick up the Standard Edition maps in person, if they wish.

We're also seeking the very best print quality possible, and I won't settle for anything less.

I know Kickstarter projects have a reputation for shipping late, but I really wanted this one to set a new standard and I'm embarrassed to be running behind schedule.\n\nA couple of you have asked why the maps are still shipping when the rest of them arrived from the printer last month. In short (and I offer this as an explanation, not an excuse): I found myself poorly equipped to handle the volume of material produced by this project. I've handled a lot of successful Kickstarters before, but never one that became such a runaway hit. When two full pallets of shipping materials arrived, I had to scramble to make room for them in my home office before they could be unpacked and brought in the door. When the maps themselves finished arriving, I was more than a bit overwhelmed. (I'm a one-man operation in a studio focused first and foremost on illustration, rather than shipping and receiving.)\n\nThere has also been an unfortunate complication with the shipping of some International packages: in addition to the extra time it takes to fill out the paperwork, my local post office is also inconsistent in exactly which type of form it wants me to fill out, so I've had to redo that step more than once, occasionally making multiple trips to send the same wave of packages.\n\nAll of that is secondary to the solution, though: This week I'm calling in some help to get back on track. Some close friends are teaming up with me to get the rest of these rewards packed while we take turns running carloads to the post office.\n\nI can't swear that all rewards will finish shipping this week, but we're going to make a huge dent in what's left--and I promise to keep you better informed as we finish out this process.\n\nThank you again for all of your understanding and support of this project!\n\nChris"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update", "update_content": "Hi, folks!\nI've been adding mini-updates to the comments pages, but it has been a while since my last update to all backers, so I wanted to let everyone know how things are going:\nFirst, packaging and shipping the $25 reward tier has taken a lot longer than I expected!

The purpose of this campaign is to help us finance a Limited Edition, as well as some exclusive content for this new release.\nA new edition with improved content\nThe version we are speaking of is an upgrade of the original French version. Initially, it was a softcover book of 80 pages. The English version is twice as big, resulting in a fully colored hardcover book of 196 pages. Discover the full table of content of the Book 2 Travels here.\nStandard Edition and Limited Edition\nDelivery this October!\nWe have worked on this book all through the year, and we are glad to announce that the PDF of Book 2 \u2013 Travels is now finished. The additional content for the Limited Edition is almost finished. Soon, all there will remain to do will be to send it all to our printer!\n\nWe have previously organized two Kickstarter campaigns, and we have learned valuable lessons from them. This time, we have designed a campaign with stretch goals that will not slow down the crafting process. These additional rewards will include PDFs, but also other kinds of bonuses that we hope we will get to reveal. This way, we are certain that we will be able to send you your rewards this October \u2013 perhaps earlier, but let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Making deliveries on time is very important for us!\nAn adventure shared with the French-speaking community\nA unique feature of this campaign is that it has a twin on the European crowdfunding platform Ulule: http://fr.ulule.com/esteren-voyages/\n\nFor this double campaign, we will put a second financing bar where the funds gathered in both campaigns will be combined to unlock new stretch goals! Feel free to go on the Ulule page to speak with the French-speaking community. You can also meet them, as well as other English-speaking fans, on the official forums: http://www.esteren.org/forum/\nAny questions or suggestions?\nIf you have any questions or wish to share your impressions, feel free to post a comment. You can also go to the forums to take part in the discussions there. A crowdfunding campaign is a living project subject to evolutions, and we always welcome feedback!\nHere are the contents of the Limited Edition of Book 2 \u2013 Travels available through the Farl Collector pledge:\nAugmented Book 2 - Travels\nThis 196-page edition will be a hardcover book limited to 600 numbered copies. It includes all the content of the first version of Book 2 \u2013 Travels (descriptions of places, gallery of characters, scenarios, bestiary), with more than 100 pages of fully original additional content: new characters, game aids on locations, additional rules for traveling, an augmented bestiary, and an expansive scenario written by Iris: \u201cA Life Choice.\u201d\n\u201cTravels\u201d Box\nA gorgeous 3-inch-tall box illustrated by Yvan \u201cGawain\u201d Villeneuve, in which you can keep your limited edition books.\nGame aids\nSeveral game aids for the scenario \u201cA Life Choice\u201d (maps and character portraits) in a specially made folder.\nTravel Journal\nFour pages to complement the standard Character Sheet on which the Players can take notes, write down the highlights of their games, and keep track of their traveling equipment.\nNote that this edition (the box and its other contents) will only be available during this Kickstarter campaign and on special events. Retailers may also order some copies, but in very limited amounts (see the \u201cGouvran Merchant\u201d pledge).\nThe higher the contributions to this campaign get, the more bonuses we can finance.\nIn addition to the stretch goals reached by this Kickstarter, other ones will be unlocked according to the total sum obtained by combining the donations from the Kickstarter and Ulule campaigns.\nHere are some pictures summing up the various available pledges. In the next section, you can find a more detailed description of each item.\nIn this Kickstarter campaign, there are two types of options:\nStandard options: Delivery this october with your rewards.\nOnly reserved for those who have chosen a tiers containing physical rewards. To get these options, simply add the required sum to your pledge, no additional shipping costs\nSpecial options: Items from this KS campaign and some special items. Second delivery later in 2014.\nTo get these options, simply add the required sum to your pledge + add $20 for shipping for US & Europe or $60 for internationnal.\nIf you purchase $120.00 in options above your base pledge level (standard and special options combined), you will get your second delivery for free. Also; to avoid this extra shipping cost,\nyou can renounce to your october 2013 delivery (see below).\nFor our new campaign, we have decided to focus on delivering as soon as possible. This is a real challenge for us: all the files have been prepared to be ready in due time. We do not want to delay delivery because of too much stretch goals with physical rewards.We explained this in this update.\nActually, the only reasonable solution to add physical rewards is to schedule two delivery dates: one in October, as planned (Standard options with the green label), and one much later in 2014, with all of the other bonuses (Specials options with purple label).\nIf you have any question about each items, look at the paragraph below \"description of the items\".\nWe give you two ways to avoid additional shipping cost:\nYou take $120 options in total above your base pledge level, including Standard options AND Special option. For example, if you take $80 of Standard option + $40 of Special option, you will avoid extra shipping and you will get two deliveries without additonal fees.\nRenounce to your october 2013 delivery and kindly wait for the second delivery, later in 2014, with ALL your rewards in once : your reward + standard options + special options. Beware! Delivery can be very late because we can not accurately predict the creation time. Be delivered in December 2014, a year and a half from now, is a possibility. Of course this is the worst case but it can happen so please think about it.\nAt the end of the Kickstarter campaign, we will send you a survey in which you will be asked to list exactly what you have chosen, the number of deliveries chosen, etc.\nThis very limited offer will give you the opportunity to get an original drawing (8 inches x 6 inches on fine art paper) made by Gawain. You will receive this unique piece of art with your reward. You can choose the theme of the illustration, which you will be asked to describe in a few words. For example, \u201can illustration of the Temple,\u201d \u201can Osag warrior,\u201d etc. With this pledge, you can help an artist live off his art!

His reward was Book 1 \u2013 Universe Limited Edition and Book 0 \u2013 Prologue Limited Edition with some special items (Universe Artworks; Prologue Artworks, clues, game master kit and screen, and more\u2026) :\nYou don't know what Shadows of Esteren is about? This section was made for you!\nShadows of Esteren is a medieval role-playing game, with an emphasis on the horrific and the Gothic. Drawing inspiration from Celtic myths, this universe has a discreetly fantastic side hidden under a bleak, realistic surface. This world is populated with humans who have to cope with tough daily lives, and face a supernatural threat lurking in the dark. With the focus of its adventures being investigation and survival, Shadows of Esteren is a game that favors an immersive mood and interactions among the Players.\nThis particular atmosphere is drawn from several sources of inspiration: the harshness and romanticism of Mel Gibson\u2019s Braveheart; the universes of Tim Burton, particularly the one of Sleepy Hollow; Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke; as well as Berserk, the manga by Kentaro Miura. Regarding role-playing, Shadows of Esteren would be somewhere between Ravenloft, Game of Thrones and Call Of Cthulhu.\n\nWe have also put online an extract from the PDF of the core book, Book 1 \u2013 Universe. You can download it freely here.\nMusic is a very important aspect in Esteren. Here are some extracts: a bonus track from the first album released and two excerpts from the next album, the OST of Dearg, the official campaign.\nThe game system of Shadows of Esteren has been designed to support the atmosphere and encourage interactions among the Characters. Therefore, it relies on simple, intuitive mechanics so as not to burden the narration, particularly during combats, which are meant to be quick and violent. A particular importance has been given to the creation of the Characters, and the evolution of their mental condition. In Book 1 Universe, the game system takes about a hundred pages out of the 280 that make up the book.\n\nHere are the main characteristics of this game system:\nA Detailed Character Creation. The creation of a PC goes through ten steps. The Characters are designed \u201cinside-out\u201d: you determine his psychology with 5 Ways that define how the Character sees and affects the world. Thus, there are no attributes such as Strength, Dexterity and so on, but there are Combativeness, Creativity, Empathy, Reason, and Conviction. By default, all the Characters are equally strong, fast, good-looking, etc. However a Character can purchase Advantages and Disadvantages to flesh out some of these physical attributes (\u201cStrong\u201d, \u201cWeak\u201d, \u201cHawkeye\u201d, etc.), or provide him with allies, extra funds, etc... Skills are then picked according to several stages of his life (youth, professional training, miscellaneous activities).\nThe System of the Ways. The Ways are characteristics that determine the major traits of the Character\u2019s personality: the Player allocates the scores 1, 2,3,4,5 among the 5 Ways. Ways are rated from 1 to 5: 1-2 is considered Minor, 4-5 is considered Major. Therefore, a Character will have 2 Major Ways, 2 Minor Ways and an average one. This makes it possible to roughly determine the way he thinks, his emotional tendencies, etc...\n\nAdditionally, there are five Faults, one for each Way: Passion (Combativeness), Subversion (Creativity), Influence (Empathy), Doubt (Reason), and Guilt (Conviction). The main aim of these characteristics is to give references for role-playing, but the Leader (GM) can ask a Player to make a Test roll in one of his Character's Major Faults to see if his Fault gets the better of him in a heated situation.\n\nAlso, a Character chooses 1 Flaw and 1 Quality based on his Major or Minor Ways (a Major Way can imply both a Flaw and a Quality). As shown in the example below, a Major rating in Combativeness can result in an Optimistic behavior, but also an impulsive one.\n\nExample for Combativeness:\n\nQuality:\nMajor Rating: combative, optimistic, dynamic, brave, pugnacious, etc.\nMinor Rating: calm, phlegmatic, cool-headed, peaceful, etc.\n\nFlaw:\nMajor Rating: impulsive, presumptuous, prideful, stubborn, arrogant, boastful, etc.\nMinor Rating: pessimistic, spineless, sad, weak-willed, fearful, self-conscious, coward, etc.\nA Resolution System Based on a D10. When a resolution roll is required, the Player adds the Character's rating in the appropriate skill + his rating in the associated Way + 1d10, and must beat a given Threshold. The margin determines the quality of success or failure. There are critical successes and failures as well. This resolution system is used for every aspect of the game, from fighting to using skills and calling upon mystical powers.\nQuick and Violent Combats. Combat is clearly deadly. Fighting attitudes have been designed to define how the Character fights. Moreover, the amount of Health Points defined at the creation of the PC (which is most of the time the same for every Character) does not increase as the PC improves in the various skill fields. The basic principle is that the human body is fragile: for example, close combat remains dangerous, no matter how good a PC is in a given domain.\nA Complete Sanity System. Dying is not the only danger that threatens the PCs: their psyche can be sorely tested, and they can even sink into madness. This is an important aspect of the game: where the combat system has been summed up in only three pages, the sanity system plays a much more important part and provides several tools to embody a psychically unstable PC. From the creation of his Character, the Player chooses a latent pathology for him, which may come to light if mental traumas become too heavy.\nThree Types of \"Magic\". Although Shadows of Esteren is defined as a low-fantasy universe, supernatural elements still exist. Magical powers are meant to be most often rare, but powerful, and their use is never without consequences. The game system details the Demorth\u00e8n arts (druidic/animistic tradition); the Miracles of the Temple, granted by the One God to the Elect; and Magience, a science using \u201cFlux\u201d, a fuel harvested from nature.\nThe illustrations and the visual atmosphere of Shadows of Esteren are a very important aspect of the project. We have wished for the illustrations to bring a meaningful support to the imagination of the Leaders and Players, once more with the objective of optimizing the mood during the sessions.\nHere are a few samples:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter two successful Kickstarter campaigns (one for Book 0 \u2013 Prologue and one for Book 1 \u2013 Universe), we are aware of logistics-related difficulties, but also of how tricky it can be to propose stretch goals that end up hampering the whole process... For this new campaign, we are confident that we will be able to realize the content announced in the pledges in due time. For this campaign, we are not taking chances.

A possible cover is shown above.\nI'll be assembling fifteen paintings on the themes of The Big Aha---and I have some fairly definite ideas for the images.  With your support, I'll have the time and the motivation to create as many new paintings as needed, and to repurpose those of my old ones that are a good fit.\nMy plan is to offer a full-color hardback edition of The Big Aha at the $100 pledge level. The $50 pledge level paperback will include these same chapter illos but in black and white form.  And of course the paperback cover will be color. As for the ebook editions---they'll be in color form as well.  (See the FAQ below for more info on ebook editions.)\n* If we reach my next stretch goal of $10,000, I'll create a new and improved edition of my art book, Better Worlds with all the new Big Aha paintings included!  It'll come to 100 paintings in all.\n* My next stretch goal is $11,000.  If we make it this far, I'll have an art show of the Big Aha paintings, along with a launch party for book in San Francisco.  I'll either find a gallery to hang  this event for me, or I'll rent a space for a pop-up show and organize the event myself.\nThe Plan\nOver the years, I've published about twenty novels with big, commercial publishers.

I'll be giving out some art prints of the paintings, and for top end rewards, I'll give out some of the original paintings, and even the complete set of my working drawings for The Big Aha.\nI'm a wordy guy---and when I'm working on a novel, I also create a book-length set of notes about my writing process, including numerous drawings and photos, plus images of any paintings I produce along the way.  I'll be making an ebook and a limited edition illustrated hardback of my Notes for The Big Aha, and I'll also be giving these out as rewards.\nSummary of the Big Aha Novel\n\"The Lovers,\" One of my Paintings for THE BIG AHA\nSo...what's The Big Aha about?  Here's a brief summary.\nThe Big Aha  is a science fiction novel with a literary touch.  It's set in Louisville, Kentucky. The book stars a thirtyish man, Zad, and his wife, Jane. They\u2019re having marital problems. Zad is an artist.  Jane runs a PR company called Jane Says.  Jane thinks Zad has gotten boring.\nIt's the late twenty-first century, and machines have been replaced by  gene-tweaked plants and animals. Knives grow on trees, you use squidskin for a video display, you ride on the backs of giant spiders, and you have a living horn of plenty that dumps food onto your table.\nThe book's action has to do with a new invention called quantum wetware. Given that my characters are artists, seekers, and party people, they use qwet to wedge their minds into a cosmic mode where they're able to have telepathy.\nThis is fun for awhile, but then leathery, floating mouths start appearing in the air---and swallowing people.  The alien behind the attacks lives in a parallel world filled with creatures like those from our fairy tales.\nZad and Jane go to the other world to do battle with the threat, the monster follows them home---and we reach a showdown at the Churchill Downs racetrack in Louisville.  In the end, our characters attain a Big Aha experience---an ultimate vision of how the world works.  Or maybe not.\nImages for the BIG AHA Project\nOther Titles From Transreal Books\nFour More of My Paintings for THE BIG AHA\nOnscreen Image of Pages from NOTES FOR THE BIG AHA", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Big Aha will be my 21st science fiction novel, and I'm about 80% done writing it, so I'm fully confident that I'll finish it.

We won't let you down! Now let's make a movie!!\nKeep following us at www.firecity.com for all the latest updates!\nTom, Brian & Michael-\nWHY ARE WE DOING THIS?\nMovies are getting bigger and more expensive, but they\u2019re not getting any better, they\u2019re getting worse. Studios have abandoned the art and the idea of saying something important that lasts. These movies are forgettable, often soulless, and that\u2019s sad to us.\nThat\u2019s why when we sat down to write a screenplay for a film called Fire City, we sculpted something personal and meaningful to us. We both have daughters and the heart of the story was about protecting them, protecting their innocence, about the sacrifices you make to do so. As fathers, we\u2019re forced to confront our worst fears and stare into the face of evil. As creators, we were compelled to explore that fear, to try to understand that evil, the very nature of evil itself. Suffice to say, we tried to face our demons. Just so happened that some of those demons had massive wings, giant curled horns and putrid breath.\nWe pooled together our money and filmed test footage for Fire City. Miraculously, the studios and others got wind of our footage. But they didn\u2019t want the creators, they wanted the rights. They made us small offers for them to own the world, to put it through their machine to make yet another soulless, forgettable film. We felt we owed it to ourselves to say no to those offers and to try to make it ourselves. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re here, asking you to help us (Brian & Michael) make a great film, something that will make our families proud and make other families want to go see it.\n(scene from test footage of Fire City)\nTHE STORY OF DEMONS\nThe Interpreter Of Signs is the first feature film of the 4-film franchise. It is a demon fantasy thriller set against the noir backdrop of Fire City, a shadowy atmospheric world, where demons live among humans who can\u2019t see them for what they are. This first film asks, when you embody evil incarnate, and give it not just a face, but many faces, a society, a history, mundane jobs and worldly humdrum routine to go along with its otherworldly attributes, how does it behave? Does it run amok or does it find equilibrium and settle into the slow burn of day-to-day existence? And if the latter, what happens when this equilibrium is suddenly destroyed?\nOur story follows Atum Vine, a 700-year-old demon, who looks just shy of 30, with a bad attitude and an 8-foot wingspan. To the humans who live unknowingly among demons in a beat-up tenement building, Vine is the drug dealer at the end of the hall. But to the demons on the floor, Vine is a procurer of human misery, which demons need to survive.\n     While it is true that some demons misbehave, most of them abide by the Balance, a kind of unwritten rule that\u2019s been around since the beginning of time: feed off human misery, don\u2019t cause it. Humans are capable of creating plenty of misery on their own.\n     The humans on Vine\u2019s floor are average, which is to say, selfish, abusive, deceitful, and mean-spirited. The demons on the other hand are moderate and cautious. Mostly. They just want their fair share. And they pay Vine to get it for them. The way Vine sees it, just because he\u2019s evil incarnate doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not a positive force in the grand scheme of things. He\u2019s a regulator, if you will, perpetuating suffering but not letting it get out of hand. If it weren\u2019t for him, there would be dead junkies everywhere, and that\u2019s no good for anybody.\n     Between the humans living in the apartments around them and the parade of suffering drug-users marching nightly down the hall to Vine\u2019s doorstep, life for the demons on the floor is about as good as it gets. Until\u2026\nEverything changes.\nVine\u2019s steady flow of clientele shuts off like a faucet. And the humans in the building suddenly reform their despicable ways. The alcoholic mother stops drinking. The wife-beater stops beating. The skeevy mother\u2019s boyfriend becomes a model father figure. The Balance is broken, and Vine and the demons around him begin to starve.\n     Vine consults Cornelia, an interpreter of signs, fortune teller in the demon world and guardian of the Balance. Cornelia reasons it is a curse. Vine believes it is a vendetta against him by a drug lord named Tarqus, a giant molluck demon with four black eyes and curling horns, who runs drugs out of a demon nightclub.\nStacy Haiduk, as the Interpreter, reveals herself in the short film \"Fire City: King of Miseries\" directed by Tom Woodruff, Jr.\n     Vine heads to the nightclub and, after a standoff, discovers that Tarqus not only isn\u2019t the culprit, but that Tarqus and his gang are starving too. Ironically, Tarqus believes it is Vine who is at fault.\n     Cornelia consults an oracle and discovers that the source of the curse is in the building itself. One of the demons on the floor has betrayed them. Vine goes toe-to-toe with the demons he once thought of as brethren, but each clue is false, every lead is a dead end, and his best suspect ends up starving horribly to death.\nThe Interpreter spreads the cards for the querent Christopher, played by John Robinson, in the short film \"Fire City: King of Miseries\" directed by Tom Woodruff, Jr.\n     The other demons are demoralized. One even tries to attack a human, but it is no use. The victim\u2019s smile never fades, the wounds heal instantly, happiness abounds, as if the attack never happened.\n     It is then that they confirm demons are starving everywhere. The phenomenon is spreading. And Vine begins to doubt. Perhaps it is not a curse, but this is how things are meant to be. It is Demonkind that is the curse, and the world has devised a way to cure itself.\n      Cornelia rejects this line of reasoning. A human without suffering is as unnatural as a demon with a conscience. Determined to restore Balance to the world, Cornelia consults a special oracle, and claims the Balance can be restored by killing Sara, the 11-year-old girl who lives down the hall and who trusts Vine. It must be Vine who kills her. Such a betrayal perpetrated on such an innocent human will break the spell the humans are under. Cornelia has foreseen it.\nOur original demon tarot card set, as seen in the short film \"Fire City: King of Miseries,\" artwork by Kurt Komoda\n     Faced with killing the only innocent human he\u2019s ever known, Vine interprets the signs on his own and makes a decision no demon has ever made. Somehow, in the dark recesses of his black soul, a tiny spark of light emerges. Vine rejects his own nature and fights against his own kind in order to save Sara. Bloodied and battered, he wins the day. He realizes it was evolution after all, and even he has evolved, if only to author his own extinction.\n     But evolution is a painful process. And once Sara is safe and the demons in the building are vanquished, Vine discovers he has been betrayed by the most unlikely character of all. He was a pawn the entire time in a larger plan, one that threatens every living thing on earth, human and demon alike.\nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS\nWe\u2019ve been at this for almost three years.

His writing reflects this aesthetic. Brian and his writing partner were the first writers to simultaneously win both of Creative Screenwriting Magazine\u2019s TV competitions in 2007, was in the top 5% in the Warner Brothers Fellowship, and also semi-finaled in the Academy\u2019s Nicholl Fellowship. Brian had the opportunity to write on spec for Twisted Pictures (known for the Saw franchise), though nothing was produced as a result. Brian edited the book Encyclopaedia of Hell, published by Feral House, 2011. Brian has worked in all facets of TV and film production, including assisting the writer's room and on-set for the hit TV series Frasier, AD\u2019ing for Cinemax, location scouting for MTV, and art department for notable horror director, Kevin Tenney. Brian lives in Woodland Hills with his wife and two small children and is in his fifth year of terrorizing the neighbors with his animated Halloween decorations.\nMichael Hayes grew up in the suburbs of Baltimore, Maryland, and made a short film when he was 12 using his grandfather\u2019s hand-crank Kodak Zoom 8 Reflex as his camera and his little sister and her friends as actors. Since then, his love of film has deepened even as his range of interests has broadened. Hayes started drumming in high school and later received a Bachelor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music in Boston. He has played in bands ranging from dinner jazz to techno grunge to a Led Zeppelin cover band, but gave up music for family life after the birth of his first daughter. Restless for a creative outlet, he began writing and graduated with an MFA from Brown University in 2002, winning the John Hawkes Award for Fiction in that same year. After publishing a few short stories in literary journals, Hayes decided to combine his two passions and brought his family to Los Angeles in 2005 and began screenwriting in earnest, placing in competitions, and finaling in the 2010 Page Awards. In 2008, he wrote, produced and directed a short film, entitled The Night Grift, which premiered at the Vine Shorts Fest in Santa Monica. Hayes continues to strive to create, grow, and feed his passion for story and film with humility, confidence and an iron will to make something out of nothing.\nACADEMY AWARD-WINNING Creature Designer, Tom Woodruff Jr., brings 20-plus years of experience and dozens of big-budget studio projects under his belt, as well as his creature effects house, Amalgamated Dynamics Inc with partner Alec Gillis. ADI\u2019s movies include the X-Men: First Class, Wolverine, Spiderman, Alien 3, Alien versus Predator, and most recently Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.\n     After years working under Stan Winston, the godfather of special effects, known for everything from Aliens to Terminator to Avatar, Tom Woodruff Jr. partnered with Alec Gillis to create Amalgamated Dynamics Inc. in the late 1980\u2019s.Their first film was Tremors, followed by David Fincher\u2019s sequel, Alien 3. ADI quickly grew to become one of the major character effects companies in the business today, with their work gathering numerous accolades and awards including an Academy Award for Death Becomes Her and multiple Academy Award nominations for Starship Troopers and Alien 3.\nTom also played the demon \u201cRufus\u201d in the January 2011 footage of Fire City: A Demon In The Darkness, and is looking forward to helming its prequel, The Interpreter Of Signs.\nFeatured in the 2010 edition of \u201cGeneration Next\u201d in the Cinematography trade magazine, ICG, Rob is described as one of the talents to watch under the age of 35. Rob\u2019s films have been the official selection at Tribeca Film Festival (2008 & 2009) and received honorable mention at Sundance (2004 & 2008). Last year, Rob had films at both Sundance and Cannes.\nA seasoned Producer, Line Producer, and UPM, Mr. Murphy has a long resume of both studio and independent movies, including as UPM on Enough with Jennifer Lopez and as co-producer & UPM on Powder with Mary Steenburgen and Jeff Goldblum; he also worked on horror cult classics, including as co-producer on Joss Whedon'sBuffy The Vampire Slayer with Kristy Swanson, Donald Sutherland and Hilary Swank, and as Executive in Charge of Production on Re-Animator. In television, Mr. Murphy produced ABC\u2019s horror-based drama The Gates, was UPM & Associate Producer on the horror classic HBO\u2019s Tales From The Crypt, and Line Producer on FX's current hit show, The Bridge.\nWith dozens of commercial shoots under his belt, Dayne is a genius at executing dark horror design on time and on budget. Dayne was responsible for the gritty dark look of the hallway and rooms in the 2011 Fire City: A Demon In The Darkness promotional footage.\nChris brings over 15 years of experience to feature film sound design, supervision, and mixing. With 60-plus feature film credits to his name, including titles like The Expendables 1 and 2, Lawless, and The Matrix Reloaded, he offers a creative intuition and distinction uniquely tailored to each filmmaker\u2019s artistic vision. Outside the world of big-budget productions, Chris contributes sound design to many successful independent and foreign films including titles like the past Cannes Palme d\u2019Or winner, Gomorrah. In addition to Cannes, his work can be heard on films showcased at festivals including Toronto, Sundance, South by Southwest, and Tribeca, among many others. Chris is also credited with a Japanese Academy Award nomination for his work overseas. Creating soundtracks for these films develops a unique sensibility and technique, and allows true freedom of expression that is not always possible in the traditional Hollywood studio system. For this very reason, alongside the honor and privilege of working with some of the industry\u2019s most talented artists and storytellers, Chris is a huge advocate of collaborating with first time filmmakers. Moreover, he is no stranger to the dark and supernatural film world with over 20 credits attributed to that genre. For Chris, not only does sound design complement the visual aspect of a motion picture, but it proves to be its own character \u2013 it has its own role and voice. Through this, sound supplies a major component in how the story unfolds, its tone and atmosphere, and how the audience relates to the world of the film.\nWHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?\nOn screen. It's people working for the love of the project. $100,000 will cover basic materials and rentals, plus minimum wage for most of our crew. About 70% will go to production and 30% to post-production. The budget pays for costumes, cameras and meals for the crew during their 12+ hour days.\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\nWith more funding, we'll have more and better demons, including full creature suits rather than make-up prosthetics, wire work so that some demons can fly like they were made to, more stunts to see the demons fight.

Last year we filmed about 30 roleplaying game sessions, and one of those stood out above the rest as a session with a clearly cinematic story. What\u2019s unique and exciting about this project is that the screenplay is an adaptation of a story and characters created through roleplaying.\nDon\u2019t play roleplaying games but like dark tales? You\u2019ll love this film, too! It contains bitter family rivalries, unexpected betrayals, a nasty and manipulative villain, lies and deceit, and perhaps a horrifying hanging...or two. For fans of dark works, it\u2019s delicious! Naturally, this project only succeeds if what we create is appealing to someone who doesn\u2019t care at all about games. If you\u2019re a film buff, it\u2019s crucial we create a work you find compelling on its own merits, and we believe we can do just that.\nI'm intrigued! Tell me more...\nThe game that launched the tale was Fiasco, but the game was played in a dramatic fashion instead of a more common comedic way. The players included Ben Robbins, the designer of Microscope, and Seattle-based story gamers Caroline Hobbs, Jerome Vernich, and Pat Kemp. We\u2019ve completed a screenplay adaptation of this gaming session, and we\u2019ve brought together a talented film crew to put this project together.\nCaroline Hobbs and Ben Robbins in the Fiasco game session that inspired this film.\nWhen completed, The Devil Walks in Salem will be a \u201clong short film,\u201d roughly 30 minutes in length. We will film it in Washington State using local cast and crew. So, if you\u2019re local to Seattle and you\u2019d like to actually be in the film, it includes an \u201cangry town mob\u201d scene where Kickstarter backers who select that level of pledging get to yell \u201chang her!\u201d or \u201cburn the witch!\u201d and join the fun by wearing period costumes!\nAs another part of this project, we\u2019ll finish a documentary on story gamers, plus we\u2019ll put together footage of the entire Fiasco game session so serious gamers can watch the actual game play out\u2014I know it sure upped my game to watch these talented story gamers in action. We\u2019ll also provide a transcript of the game that inspired the screenplay alongside the shooting script so you can see precisely how the game was adapted to the screenplay. Further, we\u2019ll have bonus interviews with the cast as well as with Ben Robbins, who organized the game, and designer Jason Morningstar, who will share his reaction to how his game, Fiasco, was adapted to an unusually dramatic style.\nWhat is Fiasco?\nFiasco is a roleplaying game designed by Diana Jones Award winner, Jason Morningstar. Traditional roleplaying games tend to focus more on mechanics and the accumulation of power through gold, magic items, and \u201cleveling up.\u201d Fiasco is a game where the emphasis is on story creation. Fiasco also shuns the traditional notion of requiring a game master; the players collaborate with one other to create a wholly original story, and the mechanics are focused around rights of narration.\nFiasco, by Jason Morningstar\nWhy Kickstarter?\nUsing story games to develop a script is a new concept, and community-based funding allows us to explore this idea of merging story games with cinema. So, with your help, we can afford to hire the cast and crew to make this the best film possible.\nCome join us in making the dream of creating a movie out of an exciting gaming session a reality. Participate at any level that works for you, and together we\u2019ll make gaming history. Not only will you receive cool rewards for joining our little filmmaking \u201cclub,\u201d you\u2019ll know that without you, this film would never have been produced.\nWhile I believe this project will be well-received by the gaming community, I also hope it will help make roleplaying games more accessible to those who are curious about what happens in the basements of gamers around the world. In other words, I hope we provide a showcase for what roleplaying is all about.\nWhether you\u2019re a film buff or a gamer, I hope this project inspires you as much as it inspires me.\nVision for the Future\nI\u2019ve enthusiastically played roleplaying games since 1978. I merged this passion with my career in 1990 when I founded Wizards of the Coast and authored that company\u2019s first product, The Primal Order, a treatise on mythology in gaming. Then in 1997, we acquired TSR, the publishers of Dungeons & Dragons, and I had the opportunity to publish D&D 3.0, one of the most successful D&D editions of all time. During the last decade, I\u2019ve taken a deep dive into expanding my passion into story games.\nYet one thing that\u2019s always troubled me about roleplaying games is that the experience is ephemeral. Just last night (at the time of this writing), I was dining with some local gamers, and Ryan Macklin described an incredible session he had played recently, which led to us discus how roleplaying experiences can never be adequately shared with others. Wil Wheaton, Zak Smith, and others, including me, have explored this by filming roleplaying sessions, which is great but is greatly limited by the patience of the audience for watching what Jeff Grubb calls, \u201cTwenty minutes of excitement crammed into four hours.\u201d\nPerhaps the desire to share memorable roleplaying experiences could be addressed (albeit to a limited extent) through screenplay adaptations? This is the underlying question I want to address with this this film and with future projects.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough I\u2019m relatively new to filmmaking, this isn\u2019t my first film production since graduating from film school.

We are Luke Crane, Chris Allingham, Thor Olavsrud and, of course, Christopher Moeller. \nFor the past four years, we've been quietly and steadily working on a new comic written and painted by Chris. This new story is the third installment in the Iron Empires series which started in the early 90s. \nCovers of Dark Horse editions of the Iron Empires graphic novels\nVoid is the third fully painted graphic novel set in the gothic science fiction setting of the Iron Empires. These stories take us into a precarious future, where prideful, quarreling human empires stand on the edge of extinction.  Void is set in the Comoran Worlds, where starship captain Vasa Sunder faces dangers posed by his leaders, his military opponents, and his own pride.  \nDownload a preview of the entire first chapter of the graphic novel, here.\nThe book itself is a 112-page hardcover graphic novel: 6.625\" x 10.25\".

It inspired us to create and self-publish. \nYears later Fate has conspired to give us the chance to bring a new graphic novel to life. We hope that this starts the cycle anew and inspires another generation to create awesome stuff and get it out into the world. \nFor the past four years we've been paying Chris a page rate out of our own pockets so he could continue to make a living while working on this new book.  We now have a gorgeous graphic novel with an exciting story.\nSo we're asking for your help. We could use a boost to get this book printed, into your hands and into stores all over the world. \nUnderstand, every donation to our cause brings with it heavy responsibilities.

The world is grounded in a realistic tone mixed with fantasy elements. \nThere's a saying that goes \"science kills magic.\" What makes this era so appealing to us as storytellers is that anything was possible. The world was not fully discovered, science was still in its infancy, and the possibility of creatures and monsters were very real. \n\nThis was a time when creatures that were once considered mythological or fictitious were actually being discovered. Monsters were being excavated in the golden era of paleontology. The Okapi or as it was called \"the African Unicorn\" once considered a mythic creature, was found in the Congo in 1901, and was thereafter adopted as an emblem by the International Society of Cryptozoology.\nLeft to Right, The Okapi, Giant Squid, Tasmanian Tiger, Rhino\nIn the early turn of the century conservation and hunting crossed paths.

If we don't reach our goal, we receive no money from anyone that has pledged.\n(Carter Jenkins - River, Jake the Snake Roberts - Jed, and Sidney Alison - Parker)\nLiving in Atlanta for the last few years, I've come across a handful of fascinating stories from local homeless men and women and recovering addicts. I wanted to take these elements and build them into a redemption story with a touch of sci-fi to explore themes about materialism, self-control, and the pull between different expectations within our world. Low-income Atlanta presents a visceral texture, aesthetic, and history that provides us with a unique backdrop for these stories, rarely shown on film. I've spent 2 years working in the Atlanta film industry meeting talented peers that share my vision for the movie. Six long months went into forging a well thought-out script and finding the right actors, and now we're finally shooting.\nHeavy Water follows the story of River, a recovering addict recently released from prison, played by Carter Jenkins. Carter has proven to be an incredible asset to the film with a massive passion, impressive ability, and previous credits from films and T.V. shows such as Surface, Aliens in the Attic, and Valentine's Day. The film opens with River desperately trying to reintegrate into society and make enough money to keep his home, pay for his mentally distressed younger brother, and escape the control of his domineering uncle. When all options disappear and times grow harder, an old friend provides River with what seems to be the perfect solution.\nJed, played by Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, offers the money, authority, and protection River desires with only one demand: River must integrate into \"The Family\", an eclectic group of street urchins and the homeless rallied behind a psychiatric treatment known only as \"The Gift\". With a bit of molding, Jake's experience as a professional wrestler translated into strong performances and brought a powerful presence to his character. His ability to improvise, take direction, and become the character shines through in his depiction of Jed. As River moves deeper into Jed's clandestine universe, he uncovers a disturbing truth about the world on which he now relies.\nStay tuned as we post photos and blurbs for the rest of the leading cast!\nWe just finished our final day of principal photography, and are about to enter post-production.  We started out with a small budget and have stretched it incredibly far, working with talented actors and a crew of over 35 incredibly skilled artists.  We've secured a huge amount of resources from the local industry: two red cameras, Zeiss Super speeds, a two-ton lighting package, expansive and beautiful locations, police cars, factories, amazing props, and an art department that's re-shaping and defining the world. We've managed to create a unique and beautiful aesthetic, and a powerful story being told to the best of our abilities.  Now we're reaching the end of our funds, and we're looking for support from people who want to be a part of the film for our post-production, pick-ups, and finding distribution.\nThere is a massive learning curve when making a low-budget indie, and we can't wait to share some of the things we have learned. As we move towards post production and pick-ups, a lengthy and dedicated process, every dollar will help push us towards completion.  With fans and fellow filmmakers in mind, we've done our very best to make your contribution worth while.\nFirst, our film.  We want you guys to see it, so we're making that one of the early rewards.\nSecond, behind the scenes.  We're showing you everything we can.  We're interviewing actors about their methods and obstacles. We're talking about lighting and shot design with our cinematographer, showing you some of our set-ups, talking about our challenges making things look incredible, and how we dealt with them.  We're going into production design, and how to transform a place in to something that works aesthetically and practically.  Color correction, editing, sound design, you name it.  We're trying to show you everything we know in a series of behind the scenes videos.\nThird, cool stuff.  Posters, scripts, a photo of us, a signed photo from Jake, and some beautiful prints from our on-set photographers (many of which can be seen here: https://www.facebook.com/heavywatermovie ) \nFourth, a chance to come hang out with us, watch our film on the big screen, Skype with us, and even have a screening in your town. \nEverything helps, and everything is appreciated.  The film world is undergoing a massive change, making independent films like this possible if enough people get behind it.  Please share this with your friends, like us on facebook, watch our videos, and be connected.  We appreciate all of you deeply, and hope being a part of this ends up meaning something to you.

It features LILY, a teenage, reanimated, patchwork corpse who must fight to the death in a gladiatorial-style tournament against other monsters to decide the fate of the world.

Meanwhile, James continues to freelance for Zenescope Comics while working on other projects with a number of comics luminaries. Great things are on the comics horizon for me, as well.

It's amazing just how much of a deep game is inside a deck of cards!\" Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower\n\"What makes The Agents such a joy for me is how small it is and yet how very large and complex it feels when playing it. A very interesting and engaging game that grabbed me by the nose and hasn\u2019t let go. Simply excellent. 5/5\" Father Geek\n\"The Agents is a bloody good game. So good that I\u2019ve actually chucked my own money into the Kickstarter campaign. I tell you.

You shan\u2019t be disappointed.\" Little Metal Dog\n\"The Agents is one of the better games I\u2019ve played this year.\" Purple Pawn\n\"A few things about The Agents. One, it\u2019s awesome and you should go back it. Seriously, I really like this game.\" Board Game Quest\n\u201cThe Agents is a unique, in-depth card game that will give your brain a workout.\" Dad's Gaming Addiction\n\"Highly tense, very action filled... there is a lot to this little card game and a real joy to put it through its paces.\" Crits Happen\n\"There's so much strategy in this game - it's ridiculous.\" Bower's Game Corner\n\"This game of intrigue and suspense is surprisingly deep and full of tension, but can also be a lot of fun.\" Perpetual Geek\n\"The game, from start to finish is a wonderful experience. Saar has something special here.\" Chevee Dodd\nThe Agents is a brand new strategic card game that introduces a unique \u2018Double-edged cards\u2019 mechanic into the undercover world of covert operations and espionage.\nAs the Agency shuts down, dismissed and disbanded Agents all around the world are trying to figure out what\u2019s next. Left without a cause, they team up and turn against each other.\nYou must enlist and lead your own faction of highly skilled professionals into an uncertain territory of betrayal and deception. Show no mercy, reveal no secrets.\nThe Agents is a deceptively simple card game; easy to learn, set up and start playing, but underpinned by intricate decision-making gameplay. Players must join their Agents into Factions, assign Missions and take their opponents down, to gather intel and win the most points.\nFeaturing the captivating artwork of collaborator Danny Morison (aka Dark Mechanic), \u2018The Agents\u2019 will challenge your imagination and brain power as you plan, plot and scheme your way to victory.\nThe Agents gameplay is based on a unique, new mechanic we like to call \u2018Double-edged Cards\u2019. Each Agent card features a \u2018command\u2019 on one end of the card and \u2018points\u2019 on the other end. However, the direction in which you place the card will determine from which asset you benefit. If you choose to perform the command, one of your opponents will get the points. If you keep the points for yourself, an opponent gets to perform the command.\nThroughout the game, you\u2019ll need both commands and points to advance. Commands will allow you to manipulate Agents, control your Factions, and influence other players. But you\u2019ll need points to buy more Agents and Missions. And ultimately, the player with the most points wins.\nDeciding how to place each card will require strategic precision and calculated foresight, as you try to further your own goals, and prevent your opponents from reaching theirs.\nCheck out the Crits Happen preview of The Agents:\nFor your support we would like to reward you with exclusive Kickstarter promos, exciting expansion packs and other treats and surprises.\nThe base-set includes 36 Agent cards, 20 Mission cards and 32 double sided points cards. Additionally, as a Kickstarter exclusive, we are bundling every base-set with 8 Commander promo cards. AND you'll get ALL the unlocked stretch goals (including extra Agents in Base Renovations and additional Missions in Black Ops!)\nThe Agents was designed to appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers, and as a highly expandable game. Each expansion adds a different depth to the game mechanic and promotes new strategies and player interactions.\nFor those of you who want to touch and feel The Art of The Agents, we have Danny's incredible illustrations in physical form:\nDying to have an Agent on you?

From flexible screen interfaces, to ring device controllers, and from game-theory platforms to card games with a twist, Saar's mind comes up with weird and wonderful ideas all centered on making the 'user experience' as fun, rewarding and engaging as possible. With a background in intellectual property and advertising and a day job running a start-up, Saar is now turning his first love - gaming - into his full time passion.\nDanny Morison (agent \"Dark Mechanic\") - Illustrator of The Agents, Danny was brought up on a diet of 80's cartoons, lots of Transformers and also an early fixation with dinosaurs, so he began drawing from a very early age. He loves science fiction and fantasy, and especially how you could create worlds and characters with just your hands and imagination. After leaving university with an Illustration degree under his belt, Danny since worked as a storyboarder, character designer, concept artist, illustrator and poster and flyer designer, but never gave up his initial love of science fiction and fantasy. His style is maybe a bit different to the industry standard but he hopes to one day be able to live off what he loves doing most - creating fantastical worlds, colorful illustrations and drawing really, really big robots!\nWe're on Kickstarter to raise the funds to produce and publish The Agents. So far, we've invested our own money in the game design, artwork, prototype printing and all other associated costs of getting the game created and tested. But now we need some help! We still need to complete some of the artwork for our expansion packs as well as some of the packaging art. And after that, we need to cover costs of the printing, packaging, shipping, stretch goals, KS exclusives and so on. With your support, we can make it happen!\nWe want to take a minute to assure you that we are confident that if we meet our target, we will be able to honor our commitment to produce and deliver The Agents. We\u2019ve spent months planning the production of the game, choosing manufacturing and logistics partners and working out the minimum acceptable amount that we need to fulfill our promises to you. Whilst we are aware that Kickstarter, like life itself, comes with no guarantees, we just wanted to let *you* know that *we* know how much trust and goodwill comes with each and every backer\u2019s pledge, and we don\u2019t take that for granted.

Developers can run out of time, producers can run out of money, key personnel can run out the door to join the circus, early ambitions can turn out to be impractical, and there's the situation where everything goes to plan but the plan stinks.\n\nWell, I don't think we're going to run out of time, because all the hard slog has been completed and we're now into perfection phase. I don't think we're going to run out of money, with your help, because the development, the music, the translations and the artwork are all paid for, and this funding is about putting you, the backer, into the game, and about putting the votes of our most loyal Kickstarter backers into practice. And our team is stable, experienced and besides we've already joined the circus.\n\nSince I started the first ever video games company in the UK, my team has never failed to deliver on time every time. This time it's no different and I believe the risk of failing to complete the project is very low indeed. If I happen to drop dead, go mad or disappear, then my colleagues will take over seamlessly.\n\nEssentially, this is the game I have wanted to make since 1983, ever since I ran up against the technical limitations to my future-vision first time round. All I had to do was wait 30 years for the technology to catch up, and for Kickstarter to put me in touch with you. I want to make this game not for myself, but for all of us. So, maybe the only real risk for you to consider is that Deus Ex Machina 2 stinks. \n\nRight at the start, thirty years ago, I took the risk of defying the norms and busting the templates of conventional gaming, by producing Deus Ex Machina as an interactive movie, played in real time to a perfectly synchronized rock music soundtrack. And now I pledge to do everything I can to turn that original vision into reality at last.\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to you for taking the time to read this. If you're considering backing the project then I hope you enjoy the ride and I look forward to welcoming you aboard with open arms.

It inherits the spirit of classic cinematic adventures like Out of This World or Flashback, and the gameplay mechanics of classic platformer adventures like Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus, or Heart of Darkness. However, we want it to go one step forward, and so we have brought together all the key features in those games to create a unique title focused on calm puzzle resolution but with a modern and dynamic control over the character.\nThe main characters of the Atipax tribe: The Wakcha\nThe most important feature of the gameplay comes from a very specific ability of Teku, the main character: instead of a hand, he carries a candle that can be lit at certain spots, and he must do whatever he can to prevent it from being extinguished. The flame of the candle is key to solving many of the puzzles, as well as uncovering lots of secrets and clues.\nBut we didn't want the gameplay to drive the entire design of Candle. We love games that have a personal touch, games that do not only deliver a fresh and polished gameplay, but a different and interesting art style. This is why we came up with a risky and difficult idea: to create the entire graphics of the game in a traditional handmade way - not just faking it using the most common digital painting tools.\nWe paint the entire graphics of the game with watercolors and ink, and then we scan all that stuff in order to build the sprites of the environments, items, menus, etc. Also, the animations of every character and animal in the game are not digital, instead we draw and paint them frame-by-frame, then we scan every single image and build the spritesheets for the animations. Once we have all this working in Unity 4, we set up each level, each scene and each character and so we get a nice handmade look for the visuals. And so, everything lives within the game.\nIt wasn't easy to achieve this result. We knew since the early development stages that we wanted this to be our own art direction. There are, however, few-to-zero references out there on how to deal with such a process, and that's why we believe that our method can truly give a personal and unique feeling to our games. If there's one feature that we would be glad if people talked about, that's the one.\nTo support this art style, we are building the narrative in a different and distinctive way. We want it to have mature contents told as a child story, shrouded in innocence and ingenuity. We call it an \u201cadult tale\u201d, and we hope that all of you enjoy this vision.\nCandle goes to Wii U!\nAlso, we have recently been approved as official Wii U developers, so we are designing exclusive features for Candle on that platform. We love Nintendo platforms since our childhood has been full of them, so it was natural for us to go for it. We are already thinking about dedicated gameplay on Wii U - we are not doing any kind of quick port. We will design specific gameplay features for its gamepad: all the menus, inventory and minigames will be tactile-controled on the touchscreen, as well as other unique actions concerning Teku's candle.\nAnd finally, check out a bunch of Candle's OST themes!\nPrepare your teeth!\nSo, what do we have to say in gaming? As an independent studio, we can take certain creative risks that many others can't. Indie games have proved that it is still possible to deliver creative, unique and fresh experiences that can truly be loved throughout the world, despite their minimal budgets. We want to make the kind of games we would love to play. We want the player to feel part of the story, to enjoy not just playing, but experiencing the game in the way the world looks and how the animations play. To sum it up, our goals as an indie team are: art, experimentation and innovative gameplay mechanics. With your help, we can achieve our wildest dreams!\nIf we meet our initial goal soon enough we may be able to consider some new stretch goals. We would love to localize the game into more languages (for now, we have confirmed the game to be available in both English & Spanish), and of course we would love to add more content to the game such as new worlds, characters and puzzles. Also, the guys at CINEMASENS, who helped us with the pitch video for the campaign, asked us to shoot an exclusive in-depth look at the development. If we could fund it, we would add it as an unlockable making-of video inside the game. If somehow you guys make this the most successful crowdfunding campaign ever we would even consider taking Candle to other platforms (even consoles). You know, the sky is the limit!\nIf you want Candle to be released on Steam, please help us on Greenlight. We support the Kicking it Forward initiative.\nYou can also track our game on IndieDB.\nTeku Studios is (for now!) a 7-people team. We are Miguel, Jose, Pascu, Elena, Iker, Gelo & Juan Diego. Most of us met some years ago at the University of Zaragoza, and we soon found out that we shared a common passion: we loved videogames. We knew that, one way or another, we needed to do something about it, and so our adventure began.\nAt first, the \"team\" was just Jose and Miguel making stuff in their rooms. We started out with very early concepts for our first game (it wasn't even similar to Candle!), and in a few months Elena and Pascu joined the crew to help us make our ideas grow. Then, everything started to change into a more serious, professional game and we even earned some prizes for that very early vision. That's when we decided to go professional: we founded Teku Studios, got ourselves a little studio to work at, licensed Unity 4, and began the full development cycle for Candle (it was Summer 2012).\nAgain, we worked as hard as we could to make it happen. We coded, painted, animated and debugged 24/7, and invested the prize's money to have the best equipment we could get. Candle grew very quickly and it soon became a very serious game with lots of potential. In early 2013, Juan Diego and Iker read some news about Teku Studios in the local media and reached to us to see if they could help our development. We saw their CV's and got SHOCKED with their experience and credentials, and so they joined the team that very month.\nThe last member of our crew is Gelo, a writer who met us via a mutual friend and was willing to help us with the English version of the narrator dialogs. Of course, he joined us immediately.\nAnd that's our story (so far). We are a growing indie team, dedicated to our passion and working countless hours without any kind of pay just to see Candle become a full game. And of course, we thank you for your help. With it, we will be able to make this our job for many, many years!\nMiguel and Juan Diego are Software Engineers. In fact, they're just the crazy and nerdy side of Teku Studios.\nJose, Elena and Iker have an Arts Degree. They're the triple passion trifecta of Teku Studios.\nGelo is our Wordmaster. When a character needs a voice, we turn to him. He helps us with the campaign as well.\nAnd Pascu... We love Pascu! As the composer, he brings joy and warmth to our hearts in times of need.\nIf you still wish to know more about us, feel free to visit our website and check out our bios. 100% true stories!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are fully committed to this development. We want to have it done this January 2014, but if the final money raised exceeds our expectations, we may have to delay the scheduled release date a few months in order to keep our promises (e.g. adding more contents).\n\nAlso, since this game is our precious baby, we want it to be more than perfect.

Please contact us with any questions!\nV3G is a brand new game studio, located in Indianapolis, Indiana, but we\u2019re guessing you already knew that if you've watched the video. What you may not know is that we have the capability to uniquely develop for both traditional and digital mediums. How so, you ask? \nWe're part of a small interactive agency creating marketing and B2B applications for companies large and small. We enjoy our work, and think we do it pretty well. But we want to grow and expand our capabilities, by creating things for ourselves, not just the next client to walk through the door.\nIt's also because we have some very talented people working for us that share a singular vision regarding gaming. Our view is that a digital game does not necessarily have to mirror the traditional one. We believe that games should be tailored to embrace and harness the medium in which they are produced. And above all else, our shared desire is to create great games and experiences with friends and family \u2013 regardless of where or how you play them.\nTo learn more about V3G, visit our site: www.vision3games.com\nTo stay up-to-date on IncrediBrawl, follow us on Facebook or Twitter.\nCheck out some behind-the-scenes videos on our YouTube channel.\nTo learn more about our agency side, visit: www.vision3creative.com \nWe've chosen Kickstarter over more traditional means of funding because we feel it's perfect for what we're trying to do - break into the game business while finding fans and earning support from the get-go. \nWhile we believe in IncrediBrawl, and have already invested hundreds and hundreds of hours in development, art and design, we also know that $15k isn't enough to print the game we want to make. We need to know if the gaming public is interested in both IncrediBrawl, and in our unique approach to game development. We've got big ideas for where we can take this hybrid approach to gaming, and we want you to be a part of that! We hope that you will view your involvement as more than just a pledge, and instead consider it an investment in V3G.\nFrom a practical standpoint, we need to know how many copies to print, and get a better idea for what the demand may be like as we bring IncrediBrawl to game stores worldwide. We want to use the highest quality components possible, and add lots of nice \"extras\" to the base game that will make it stand tall next to any game on your shelf.\nWhile we want this Kickstarter to be super-successful, and hope it will be, we aren't doing this to try and make a huge profit. Anything left over once all the bills are paid will be poured directly back into V3G, to fund development of the digital version of IncrediBrawl, as well as support future traditional game projects. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is the first traditional game project for V3G, it is not the first project we've managed from beginning to end. We're used to handling large projects for clients on a daily basis, with tight budgets and dates that can't be missed, no different than this Kickstarter campaign. Furthermore, because we're an established company already, you don't have to worry about whether or not we'll deliver, or where your Kickstarter funds are really going.\n\nIncrediBrawl is completely designed and illustrated, except for any stretch goal rewards that may be earned during the course of this Kickstarter. Our printer is selected, and ready to begin, as soon as we can get them the files. We have several options for fulfillment and distribution lined up as well, based on the success level of this campaign.\n\nBarring any unforeseen circumstances, our goal is to bring IncrediBrawl to you as quickly as possible.

Contained therein will be the first volume of the secret history of the end of magic, called Light and Shadow.\nThe Story\nA thousand years ago in the wilds of northern Europe, the necromancer Marduke, Lord of the Sorrian Plateau, was defeated. His monsters were all destroyed, including the dragon ILL, and his fortress of Blackwater Hold was leveled. Marduke\u2019s body was dismembered and burned, and the ashes sent to the four corners of world. The caverns beneath the castle were sealed and buried and all records of the foreign-born sorcerer were stripped from the histories. So it was that Marduke the Death Caller passed from all memory\u2026.exactly as he planned.\nLight and Shadow is contemporary fantasy that takes place in our familiar, modern world. For a more complete synopsis of Book 1, info of the World of Light and Shadow and the Dragon ILL go here: http://www.lightandshadowbooks.com/\nThis project can't happen without you.\nThe story is already complete but in script form. As a filmmaker, I\u2019ve just always written stories in this format without giving it much thought. If I could make the film, great. If not, I could try to sell the script. Although I will no doubt pitch this as a movie as some point, I am really getting into the book as a work of art in and of itself and I am excited to see if there is the support out there for my brand of fantasy fiction.  \nIf I sell it as is, it could end up as studio slush or worse, it could get made and it would get compromised. Either way, I would be separated from the process with little incentive to work further on the story.\nIf I go self publish, I won\u2019t be able to do a run of a physical book (especially not what I have planned) and I will have to find some money to get an editor for the finished piece regardless. There is no shortage of poorly edited ebooks out there.  I would end up doing the cover and all the associated artwork myself.  I\u2019m no sloutch on the art front, but I would miss out on the opportunity to work with the great artists that are on board to work on the project. So it's a matter of time, resources and how big a splash I can make with the release....and I need your help.\nWith funding I will complete the novel of Light and Shadow and do a single run of a leather-bound hardcover edition (numbered) that will look like an ancient tome you just recovered from a dusty library. The book will be filled with Durer engraving-style illustrations depicting various scenes and the interior will all be carefully laid out with decorative borders, chapter markers and icons. The unit price will be high, but if I am going to print something I want it to be cool and serve the story. I will translate this quality down to the ebook which will contain all the bonus art and as much interactivity as we can muster. I'm an old Director multimedia programmer so I'm eager to see what I can go with these tools.\nIf you've seen a bad science fiction or fantasy movie in the last couple of years and wondered aloud, \"Why are these stories so bad?\", then you owe it to yourself to at least give me a dollar. \nPlus the book will be full of art by these two, which by itself would be worth the price.\nArtists\nNicole Cardiff is a skilled Illustrator and digital painter who will be doing a series of Durer engraving-style illustrations for the book itself.\nNicole Cardiff\nEddie Del Rio is a concept artist who will be doing one to eight concept paintings for the book. His past clients include LucasArts, THQ, Activision, 2K, Lucasfilm, and Walt Disney Imagineering. \nEddie Del Rio\nAt the patron level reward you get to take home one of Eddie's original paintings! If I raise enough money he will do a series of eight and all the backers will get digital copies.Here is where the money will go in no particular order:\n\u2022 Finishing the novel\n\u2022 Editing, Layout and PrePress\n\u2022 Ebook authoring and publication\n\u2022 Durer Engraving Illustrations\n\u2022 Limited run of Special Edition Hard Cover\n\u2022 Conceptual Artist (8 tableau paintings)\n\u2022 Prize Fullfillment (run of pins, Tshirts, posters, etc )\n\u2022 Website Hosting (press and social outreach)\nRewards\nI will be doing limited runs of speciality products just for the campaign including posters, T-shirts, pins and cloaks. If there are enough orders for T-shirts and cloaks and I will have them created locally in Los Angeles and there will be more options for colors, types of printing, and I will open up additional designs in stretch goals.\nThanks for taking the time.

The digital boxed also includes two notable exclusives: the RED AEGIS Hacker's Guide and RED AEGIS Unleashed (see descriptions below). Finally, the Digital Boxed Set also grants you access to the Red Aegis Online Tools (character builder, lineage designer, and so on).\nRED AEGIS Hacker's Guide: This accessory contains system \"hacks\" for incorporating RED AEGIS into other game systems. Initial target is the Pathfinder roleplaying game, with additional systems added with stretch goals.\nRED AEGIS Unleashed: An epic-sized adventure path that spans 9 time periods (through stretch goals). Each adventure is accompanied by a novelette that ties into the adventure arc. The first module will be penned by Brian R. James and Ed Greenwood.\nRED AEGIS Tactics: A tactical skirmish game that is designed for 2-6 players. Players construct an army using everything from axe-wielding barbarians, to spell-slinging archmages--from incredulous biker gang vagabonds, to futuristic space soldiers. This is truly the battle of all ages. Construct your army, deploy to the fields of battle, and defend the prestige of your legacy.\nPyralithos\nJoin us in designing a tabletop roleplaying experience that you've never seen before!\nRED AEGIS is an alternative take on the traditional roleplaying game. This is not just a game about fighting monsters and pillaging ancient ruins for treasure (though we have that too!).\nRED AEGIS is an epic, millennia-spanning, strategic roleplaying game where you claim your birthright, rally loyal followers to your cause, and forge a dynasty to stand the test of time.\nIn RED AEGIS you command successive generations of heroes from the setting's ancient past to the far future\u2013from axe-wielding barbarians to space marines packing gravity hammers, and everything in between.\nRED AEGIS is about making difficult choices. These decisions will impact not only your tribe's future, but also the fate of your descendants and the world they inhabit.\nWe're excited to share with you our vision of epic storytelling. Vorpal Games is devoted to hiring the best talent in the industry to make that vision a reality.\nMacuilanx\nThe Game\nIn addition to familiar tropes you'd expect from playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons\u00ae, RED AEGIS is also infused with millennia-spanning tactical strategy, inspired by games like Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae and X-COM\u00ae.\nThe story of a RED AEGIS campaign is revealed over ten gaming sessions, where you command successive generations of heroes from the world\u2019s ancient past to the far future. \nIn RED AEGIS all heroes die. Whether on the field of battle or of old age, your character will eventually die. At the start of each game session you play a new character, a descendant of your starting character\u2019s bloodline.\nIn RED AEGIS your character abilities are not tied to the individual hero you are playing. Rather, your skills and powers are inherited from and infused with your bloodline, passed from one generation to the next.\nLEARN ABOUT GAME PLAY\nOne of our major motivations with our gameplay experience is to have hundreds, if not thousands, of years pass between each session. Your character in the new session will be a descendant of your past character and will inherent characteristics of the applied dynasty. For example; if in the past your ancestor slayed the great Minotaur lord Kogulous, you would not only gain in-game story-based rewards for such a feat, you would also earn additional Prestige to use in the construction of your descendants in following sessions. Prestige is a value pool that is increased based upon the actions and exploits of your character. One might view this as a type of experience pool, and they wouldn\u2019t be incorrect. Different players would earn at different rates, depending on their actions in the campaign, as well as other factors that we\u2019re not ready to release just yet. In addition, we are implementing a dynamic system by which the storyteller/dungeon master/game master might change from session to session. We refer to this as the Arbiter. The Arbiter will be a role that players will aspire to become, due to the increase in Prestige and other story-based rewards. This process is governed by an element of the game that revolves around the RED AEGIS itself.\nAnother interesting aspect you may enjoy: as your descendants traverse the timeline your characters will be defined not by equipment (as is in traditional tabletop RPGS), rather by your followers. Followers will have specific skill-sets and professions that will aid your character, and will help define them as your dynasty evolves. This is going to allow for an immense amount of customization, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re eager to show off once completed.\nIkomatshe\nThe Products\nRED AEGIS Player's Guide: An introductory guide to the Red Aegis Roleplaying Game, featuring a complete, learn-as-you-go adventure and a printable character sheet for your custom bloodline.\nRED AEGIS RPG Corebook: A lovingly crafted, hardcover sourcebook with high quality maps and illustrations scattered throughout. The book will contain complete rules to build your bloodline, as well as guidance for designing custom monsters and encounters set in the RED AEGIS universe.\nSample Products (Not Final)\nThe System\nThe RED AEGIS Roleplaying Game is powered by the LGS (Loremaster Game System\u2122) \u2013a customizable tabletop game engine that supports multiple genres and play-styles.\nUnlike most other systems, the LGS encourages the selection of a new game master for each session, allowing for a truly unique experience whereby the actions of the game master are encoded into your shared story!\nHoarthostat\nThe World\nThe starting region characters will explore during the game's first age is known to the indigenous tribes as Namarune. This is the cradle of civilization in the Red Aegis setting, and it serves as the region where your tribe will take its formative steps toward building a dynasty and an empire to stand the test of time.\nThe tribes of Namarune have always feared the world anchors\u2013those crimson, impossibly massive stone monoliths that have stood, inscrutable, since the dawn of time. To approach one was forbidden and taboo. To ignore the omens would be to invite the wrath of the gods down upon yourself and your tribe. \nYet despite the warnings, each generation witnessed a foolish few that would make a pilgrimage to one the ancient monoliths in defiance of reason and self-preservation. The few that returned, if any, would often ramble of unimaginable wonders and lament of god-like powers wielded ever so briefly. Many of these individuals came to be shunned by their superstitious clan mates and driven into exile, while a rare few would be raised up and heralded as hero-kings. \nDuring the first arc of the campaign, the player characters gather at one of the fabled monoliths, where they are imbued with fantastic powers and a mandate for greatness.\nWhich destiny will befall you when heeding the call of the Red Aegis?\nNamrune: Age of Monoliths (click image to view map animation)\n\"No civilization lasts forever, and a society is most treacherous when facing its extinction. Countless inscrutable ruins dot the countryside of Namarune, like ichor-filled sores on a plague-ridden corpse. It\u2019s curious that the most magnificent of these fallen structures often rest within sight of a world anchor\u2014those most holy of stone monuments from which our own civilization was given rise.\"\nReward Add-Ons\nYou can add on individual copies of the Red Aegis RPG to any pledge that already is shipping a physical book by manually adding the appropriate amount on the pledge page:\n+$15 for each additional softcover Red Aegis Player's Guide.

But contributing to online polls and filling out beta surveys only goes so far. For a few of you, that sort of impersonal feedback is not enough. You want to be more directly in contact with the designers and help shape the mechanics or lore of the game.\nBackers at the Associate Game Designer level will be given a small section of the Corebook to design. Other RPG Kickstarters may allow you a token task like naming an NPC, or a city, or some such, but this opportunity is much grander than that. Who knows, if you complete your assignment as tasked and on deadline, you may even find additional, paying contracts in your future.\nThe extra cost associated with this reward level is really for the one-on-one mentoring the backer will have with an established game designer, who will offer advice, critique design work, and so on. There should be no pressure for a backer to turn over a perfect design.

Some of the latter could be especially interesting for backers of the kickstarter, since some of them have been reserved for the creator pledge level. The team is looking forward to working with the backers to create some cool and unique archetypes. :-)\nCheck out UPDATE #20 for more information!\nEvery pledger for the Digital Rulebook Plus and the Rulebook Plus onwards will receive a pdf of this sourcebook for free as soon as it is available.\n\u00a350,000 UNLOCKED ADD-ON!!! -  THE MERCURY SOURCEBOOK PRINT EDITION!

These tales seem to have some grain of truth, but a recent discovery of an ancient inscription hints that the legends may be more accurate than previously suspected. A local guide offers to take you to the ancient ruins of their capital city. But can the guide be trusted? Explorers tell of other expeditions led into the desert, never to return.

Our objective was to create maps that were fine to look at and re-arrangable, so that we could get the maximum use out of each piece of paper.\nIt was easy to find high quality maps, but they were expensive, and were often too specific and could only be used in certain situations. We wanted a great, standard set of maps that covered the stereotypes; typical situations we found ourselves in repeatedly, such as an ambush along a road, crossing a bridge, traveling through a cave, etc.\nOur Maps\nWe created a series of full color, high quality, 11x17 maps that are designed to fit together (typically in pairs) and that are specifically engineered to be rotated and rearranged, creating alternate layouts. Using this technique, you can cater to most types of encounters a party will face in a typical fantasy roleplaying game with fewer total maps scattered about your table. Let me give you an example:\nHere are two 'cellar' maps:\nand\nWhen you put the maps together, you get a winding layout with many entrances and exits. This is good for chases and sneaking around.\nbut if you reverse the pages, you now create a layout that is open and spacious; which is better for a large battle.\nIn addition, these maps have doors that are placed at a common distance from the edge, so that many maps (even if they were not designed specifically to line up) will fit together and allow your party to move between them seamlessly.\nNew Textures\nWe've recently begun using hand-drawn and higher resolution textures. We're toying with a lot of possibilities, but here are some quick results:\nWine Cellar Old/New Comparison 1\nWine Cellar Old/New Comparison 2\nHere are 3 \"Dungeon\" Tiles:\nDungeon Entrance\nDungeon Center\nDungeon BossRoom\nWe've named these \"Dungeon Entrance, Center and Boss Room\". Typically, players will start in the lit staircase in the entrance, and from here they have a wide variety of directions they can go. The center allows players a large open space to battle, with lots of high and low ground and coverage points, and the boss room is a big open area where players can engage a big enemy. We chose not to make a simple \"tile\" system where everything has gobs of doorways. Completely pre-constructed layouts have no versatility. A tile system has so much versatility that everything looks stupid, and none of the situations are ever all that tactical.\nOur system does everything - Various entry and exit points that are set to standard positions. You can tile them, but every \"pairing\" was specifically crafted to offer something useful, that the players may actually want - The typical case with these 3 rooms would be to simply line them up! Using a marker or object to block the top middle path, the players have a large winding battle over a lot of ground with crooks, shadows, lots of interesting elevation, ledges they can jump down (or up, if they are skilled) with pillars to crouch behind, all leading up to a boss fight.\nHowever, note the versatility, and how each layout actually offers you a scenario where something interesting is occuring:\nDungeon Layouts\nAnd this is with only THREE maps. Add more maps, some flats and hallways, and you're sure to be able to place a few pieces down and have a great battle.\nSo you can see how maps can be reversed, rotated and rearranged. Once more tiles are completed, you'll be able to make much larger battles, and your maps will have more diversity. But even if you just choose 2 random maps, you'll have an ideal Battle Map.\nWhat we believe is that 99% of players will be using 2 maps at a time, for a total 22\"x34\" battle space. A larger area does not appeal to them because they either cannot fit it on their table, or so much of that space isn't being used in the battle to be irrelevant. With this system, you CAN make bigger battles, but it is specifically focused on these 2-map scenarios where your players have an objective. Once you complete that objective \"reach the boss room door\" players will usually re-situate their map anyway. Or in many cases, they are only playing out the key battle in the dungeon, not sprawling a giant map for the entire dungeon when no combat even occurred. For each major scene, you can select exactly what you want and set parameters.\nPrint Quality and Durability\nThese maps are printed on heavy cardstock and then UV coated, creating a very nice and durable map that is partially resistant to spills. If you spill on a normal flimsy map, it can be completely destroyed. With these maps, the edges might still be damaged, but your map will often survive.\nAdditionally, for an Add-On cost, you can have all of your maps Laminated. This with further protect them and even allow you to write on them with some dry/wet erase markers. Since all markers are slightly different, make sure you test your markers in a small corner of the map beforehand.\nWhat Will You Get?\nIf you pledge at the basic level, you will get a 12-page map pack, filled with classic maps that every adventuring party needs. Most of these will be interchangeable maps. There are also some bonus maps unlocked with rewards.\n2 Cellar Maps (Shown)\n2-Page Tavern\n3 Dungeon Maps (Shown)\n1 Jail Map (same tileset as Dungeon Maps)\n2 Cave Maps\n2 Forest Road Maps (Straight Road, Plains/Forest)\n+2 Forest Maps (Backer Goal Achieved!

For starters, you will get the Expanded Map Pack, with Double-Sided Maps and Laminated if you wish, as well as a sneak peak at all of our upcoming Arcknight products. Next, we'll send you a fully playable prototype version of our upcoming Tactics / Roleplaying Boardgame, Dungeon Rumble. Lastly, Arcknight's Lead Designer and Art Director will work directly with you and CREATE YOUR OWN MAP. That's right, any map you want, we'll work together to design and build it, right over skype / chat / text / email, anything you want.\nYou suggest it, and we'll go through the preliminary design stages together, and bring it to life. As we develop the map, you'll get progress reports, and when it's finished you'll receive a limited edition and signed version of your suggested map. If you're looking for something a little more specific for an upcoming adventure, or haven't been able to find a certain type of map, we'll make it for you! There's only one exception, the map needs to be general purpose enough that other players could make use of it in their games as well. Perhaps you'd like a graveyard, a barracks, an office for a chancellor, or a king's throne room? You've got it. From here, every Expanded Map Pack will include a copy of your map as an additional bonus, along with a custom thank you and acknowledgement of your support. We've limited this option for now, because we're worried if we have many takers, we just wont be able to make our timeline goals. This isn't an \"eventually\" kickstarter project. If we're funded, we'll complete these alterations and new maps quickly, and get them to you within several months.\nAdd-Ons\nYou're going to get a LOT with the extended Map Pack. As an example, the Cellar, Jail, and generic 'Dungeon' maps will all interconnect, so you can make some large fields. That being said, there will always be people with custom desires.\nWithout complicating Kickstarter or making a long list of irritating Backer Tiers, I'd like to instead offer some Add-On options. Add these amounts to your Pledge, and you'll be able to identify what extras you'd like when the survey's go out after the kickstarter completes.\nUpgrade A Map Bundle to be Double Sided (Duplex) - We've reached our $10k Goal! This means every backer will receive their Pre-Set maps double sided (this includes the Colosseum, Tavern, Highland Home, etc.) If you would like the rest of your reversible, normal maps to be double-sided with alternate options on the back as well: such as the Dungeon, Forest Road, Cellar, and Cave maps, add +$10.00 to your Pledge for the Basic Map Pack, and +$15.00 to your Pledge for the Extended Map Pack. Since the Extended Map Pack has many Pre-Set Maps, this add-on is discounted for the Extended Map Pack accordingly. Other rewards, such as the Backer Goals that grant you bonus maps, will be double-sided as well if you've upgraded your Map Bundle for double-sided maps.\nInstead of B-sides, you may instead choose to have Grid Squares on the front of your maps, and Hexes on the back of your maps, if you upgrade to double-sided maps.\nLaminate all of your Maps - For $10.00 we will laminate every map in your order (Add only $5.00 for the Standard Map Pack). Lamination will further protect our maps, and with high quality dry/wet erase markers you can draw directly on the maps. (Since all markers are different, make sure to test your markers in a small corner of your map.)\nAdd Additional Specific Maps - For every +$3.00 you add to your pledge, you can specifically pick any 2 additional 11x17 map pages to be included in your bundle. Remember that most maps are designed in pairs (+$1.50 a map page). We can do this any number of times to save shipping, so long as your Maps fit in the USPS package. If they do not fit, we will contact you and inform you of your options.\nStretch Goal - $5000 - ACCOMPLISHED!\nWe've reached our first Stretch goal of $5000! All backers will had an additional 2-page Pre-Set Map of a Bandit Fortress thrown into their order. This map will be a classic fort that players may assault or defend, with towers, walls and the great style you expect of all our Arcknight Maps.\nStretch Goal - $10000 - ACCOMPLISHED!\nWe've reached $10k! We're throwing in 2 extra pages of Dungeon Maps (A straight hallway and a curved hallway with adjoining rooms) in the same tile-set as our other Dungeon Maps, so you can build even larger dungeons and have more options. Additionally, everyone's Pre-Set maps will be printed double sided. Pre-Set maps include the Colosseum, Bandit Fortress, Manor, Highland Home, etc. The A-side of these pieces will be the standard Pre-Set map, while the B-side of each piece will offer alternate layouts, and additional landmarks to be interchanged with the map. For instance, Coliseum B-sides may contain fallen pillars and destroyed walls, providing alternate routes with rocky terrain. The Manor B-sides might convert the 2-story thin Manor into a wider single story, with additional quarters, and a stable. And the Bandit Fortress B-sides could provide additional ways in or out of the keep undetected. These are just suggestions, but you can count on us to be forthcoming with our process as we design these maps, and keep with the same high quality and versatility we've shown in all our maps.\nInstead of B-sides, you may instead choose to have Grid Squares on the front of your maps, and Hexes on the back of your maps, if you upgrade to double-sided maps.\nStretch Goal - $15000 - No Longer Available.\nWe've abandoned our $15,000 stretch goal. Instead, all backers will be given a 2-Page Pre-Set Graveyard as a special thanks, whether we make 15k or not as an apology.\nNew Backer Goals\nACCOMPLISHED!! We reached 100 Likes for Arcknight on Facebook. All of our backers will receive an extra 2 pages of Forest Maps. Extra maps means extra options when it comes to normal encounters on forests and along roads. These may not be the most glamorous, but in our experience they're among the most used maps in every campaign!\nAt 300 Likes for Arcknight on Facebook every Backer will receive an additional 2 pages of Maps in the Dungeon Tileset as well. These maps are designed to fit with the current Cellar, Dungeon, and Jail maps, and will connect with any future Dungeon and Laboratory maps as well.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe have a handful of older maps without lighting, texturing and effects. They are decent enough for amateur purposes, but are not a professionally finished product. Finishing these maps and creating entirely new ones is a time consuming process, and we will tackle this based on the feedback we get from you, the backers. Apart from restyling a few older maps, our new maps will be rotatable and interchangeable. This concept has been a smashing success, and we will be keeping this idea going forward with our new maps.\nWhat do you mean by Lighting and Texturing?\nLet me show you. Here is a standard version of the cellar map from above, without custom lighting and effects:\nAs you can see, it's just not that interesting. It doesn't come alive or illicit any mood or impact.\nHere is another example of an early ship map with little custom lighting and editing:\nand here's a similar ship with custom lighting and effects:\nSay what you will about the difference in layout, but the second ship is vivid and compelling, and if this kickstarter is successfully funded we'll be bringing all of our maps to life in this way, printing them in large batches, and delivering them to your doorstep.\nShow Us More\nGladly.\nHighland Home\nColosseum\nHere is an example of an unfinished 'Crypt' style map, and how it can be tiled. Throw in a few signature rooms, like a tomb, and you've really got something!\n2 - Page Crypt\n4 - Page Crypt\n6-Page Crypt\nHere are a number of older maps that have not been reworked yet. These will give you an understanding of what you will get if you back this project. These maps, and more, will be redrawn with dynamic lighting, glows and effects. In addition, their layout and format will be altered where possible to become modular, rotatable and interchangeable (if they weren't already, although as you can see many of them were.)\nSample Cave Maps\nColiseum Map\nForest Maps\nManor\nTavern Map\nBridge / Grass\nRiverbend\nGuarded Bridge\n\n\n\n\nGrid Square or Hexes, at your request.\nFrankly, hexes are superior in most ways. For our own purposes, we convert all maps to Hex, and convert all games that use grid into hexes with house rules. That's why you'll see most of these maps with Hex instead of Grid Squares. However, we also understand there are some major reasons why people use Grid squares: There's a nostalgic factor, some people simply prefer it, and more importantly, some games have adopted the Grid Square as their official standard, and converting the rules can be annoying.\nIf you back our kickstarter, we will print your maps in either Hex or Grid Squares at your request. After the kickstarter is successfully backed, we'll send you a survey, and you can tell us what you'd like. We can also print them gridless, for use with transparent overlays.\nJust let us know what you need, and we'll do our best.\nWe can also print the grid at custom sizes upon request.\nWhat size are your Grids?\nBoth grid and hexes are just about 1\" in size. Hexes are 1\" from edge to edge, and ~1.1 inches tip to tip. The full hex area of our (2x) 11x17 maps is 20x22 hexes. This size fits most miniatures. Here is a cellphone picture taken during a game:\nThe miniatures we use are from various sources, and they all fit nicely. \nWe can also print the grid at custom sizes upon request.\nAlso, don't forget to Like us on Facebook:  Arcknight or search for Arcknight.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere really are no risks. We have created several complete maps that we're very happy with, and we already have the means to print and coat them.\n\nWith your support we'll invest the remaining time needed to finish new maps, refit our old layout style, and add lighting and effects.\n\nShipping will be sent out using 17 1\u20444 x 11 1\u20444\" Kraft Easy-Fold Mailers, which will snuggly fit around and protect your maps.\n\nClassic Map bundles will either use a thin Mailer, large protective bubble-wrap envelope, or tyvek envelope, whichever ends up being most appropriate to the final pack's thickness.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Roleplaying Spell Effects - A perfect compliment to Roleplaying Maps!", "update_content": "Hi Guys,\nWe've got a new kickstarter that should directly appeal to almost all of you!

And there aren't great choices in that matter.

Keep in mind, one of the tier options for the new kickstarter will be pitched specifically to our current kickstarter backers, a tier that will give \"everything we've made that you didn't get from the first kickstarter\". Specifically, this means if you back the next kickstarter, you'll get any of the missing pages from these new retail packs.\n\nThese new city streets pages have 'slums' and tighter groupings of buildings, and large key buildings, and a bunch of different alleyways for different types of encounters\u2026 and we decided to try some retexturing and rework the ground, along with a few philosophical changes in the layouts - these have narrow alleys you can clearly fit down. Sometimes wide alleys you may even be able to get around enemies in. Then there's very thin gaps between buildings we've visually made so it's really a GM's call whether you can squeeze through. We removed the 1 hex 'gap' on the edge of a number of maps, so you can push buildings up against each other, or pair them with a map that has a gap for a small alley, or pair 2 gaps for a wide alley. The choices are much more complex now.\nAside from that, I always felt the City Streets were fantastic, but just a little \"stiff\". So we started tweaking at the look.

Thanks!\nNEWS:\nShooting for Seven! We're double funded! 200% (Thanks!) Now we're aiming for a $7k Stretch Goal. At that point you'll get individual character illustrations for Jokers, Kings, Queens, and Jacks, plus a separate illo for each suit of number cards--and a unique Kickstarter-only cover illo! So please spread the link: www.clashingblades.com. \nWe've Got Your Back! We've committed to publishing all three deck back colors. (See below.) At campaign's end you can choose among them. Pledge for more than one deck, and we'll ship whatever mix you like!\nSuit Illustrations Locked! We've committed to printing full-color suit faces. See the illustrations further down this page. \nInternational Shipping! Though the pledge levels say \"Ships within the US only,\" we can ship to most overseas locations. (See the FAQ at the bottom of this page.)\nWhat's It About?\nThe Clashing Blades! game is a result of college fencing classes and a love of swashbuckling movies and anime. It distills that thrust-and-parry action into a competition using poker cards. The game is relatively easy to learn (get a PDF of the rule cards here, and watch the video demo below), but there's a surprising amount of strategy involved. No two opponents play exactly alike.\nThe cards will be printed in the USA and sold through DriveThruCards.com. We've published six other game decks and a booster pack with that company, so we know their quality is good. \nUnlike most games there, however, our decks come with rules cards included. No need to download a separate PDF. And for this Kickstarter project, we're packing each deck in a free, stackable, clear plastic deckbox. \nWhy This Kickstarter?\nPopcorn Press has already paid for the card-back illustration. (We'd love to know which version you prefer.) And we've already commissioned special sword-fighting pips for the four suits. So we're committed to publishing the game regardless of how well this Kickstarter project does. \nBut we'd love to go beyond those pips to lavishly illustrate the card faces. As the Stretch Goals below reveal, we're aiming for a unique illustration for the number cards in each suit, plus unique jacks, queens, kings, and jokers. So the more Stretch Goals we meet, the more beautiful your decks will be. \nThis is also a good time to mention that your decks will say \"Kickstarter Version!\" on the cover card, marking you as a hero who backed the game before it became commercially available. \nTake the survey. Give us your opinion.\nAbout the Publisher\nPopcorn Press is a small publisher that has been around since 2006. We started out publishing books and ebooks. September 2012 saw our first card-game project: Invasion of the Saucer People! , here on Kickstarter. Since then we've published Wolf Man's Curse, Monster Con, Return of Monster Con, Son of Monster Con, and the Monster Con: Cthulhu Pack. We have many more game projects planned for the future. (You might also like our annual Halloween book project, including last year's Cthulhu Haiku, which was launched here on Kickstarter.)\nAbout the Designer\nLester Smith is an Origins-award-winning game designer of Dragon Dice, as well as of the long-running Dark Conspiracy role-playing game, among other things. You can learn more about him at www.lestersmith.com.\nPips for the suits\nAbout the Artist\nRay Corwell II is a relative newcomer to hobby-game illustration, but his skill and talent are amazing. You can view more of his work and contact him at ronindude.deviantart.com.\nSuit illustrations\nOur Goals\nAs our pledge totals reach each level below, every backer's decks will include the new art listed. So please spread the word! Point your friends to www.clashingblades.com. \n$800 - Basic Success - LOCKED! \nAt this level, you get a Kickstarter-exclusive edition of the game before the standard edition is released to the general public. \n$1,600 - Illustrated Suits - LOCKED!Each suit gets its own character illustration: spades and hearts will each have a unique illustration of the male; clubs and diamonds will each have a unique illo of the female. \n$2,300 - Unique Jokers\nOne joker will get a unique illo of the male missing his blade, the other of the female having disarmed him.\n$3,800 - Unique Kings\nEach king will have a unique illustration featuring the male. \n$5,300 - Unique Queens\nEach queen will have a unique illustration featuring the female. \n$6,800 - Unique Jacks\nEach jack will have a unique illustration featuring the male. \n$7,000 - Bonus Cover\nWe'll commission Ray to do a special cover illustration, limited to Kickstarter decks only. \nSketch for Kickstarter-exclusive cover Stretch Goal\nAnd Beyond?\nThose are our goals so far. But we're open to suggestions. We'd love to hear from you. \nLast Requests\nLet us know if you have any questions or comments. And please spread the word.

It's focused on the intergalactic story of a teenage girl caught between the need to avenge her murdered loved ones and the sense of duty instilled in her by those who rescued her from a life of slavery.\nExploring themes of self-discovery, independence, and trust, Horizon\u2019s End is a 120 page, full color, original graphic novel. With your support, it will be the first in a series of stories that depict our heroine's adventures as she balances her personal goals of vengeance with galactic society's need for her to become the hero she never wanted to be. In the end, Horizon\u2019s End is a story about people that just happens to take place in a science fiction setting.\nDarryl Banks' promo image - colored by Moose Baumann\nThe Story\nSet in the far reaches of our universe, Horizon's End is a traditional tale of good versus evil with a Sci-Fi twist. We first meet Andara on the remote, backwater planet Usyel, as she and her mentor, Caido, attempt to free the pre-industrialized people from the Black Dominion - an intergalactic syndicate that preys on weak societies that haven't yet reached first-contact with off-world life.\nThe story quickly takes a tragic turn, though, as Andara finds herself alone on this hostile world, surrounded by a xenophobic race of aliens that simply see her as another invader. Our heroine soon learns that there's more to being a hero than charging in and smashing heads together. And she has to decide whether she can put the needs of an entire planet before her growing urge to simply mete out her revenge and move on.\nAndara is, essentially, a rebellious teenager without a safety net. She\u2019s thrown into a situation where she can\u2019t rely on anyone. She has to depend on her wits to survive, while becoming an inspiration to others. And she has to do all this while dealing with her insecurities and, maybe more importantly, attempting to corral those inner demons of revenge. Maturity can\u2019t be taught. It\u2019s something a person learns on their own, when they\u2019re ready. As clich\u00e9 as it may sound, this is a coming-of-age story wrapped in a nice space opera bow.\nThe Characters\nAndara:\nAndara's concept design with flat colors\nOrphaned during the Black Dominion\u2019s invasion of her planet, Andara was rescued and taken in by Caido. She is the embodiment of anyone who\u2019s ever been wronged and left with a near uncontrollable rage. Her true journey, then, lies in learning the repercussions of giving in to that anger and how to pick up the pieces when that fury only leads to more suffering.\nBent on revenge, her arrival on Usyel sets our story in motion, where she finds herself once again abandoned in a hostile environment. This time, though, no one\u2019s coming to rescue her. \nCaido:\nCaido's concept design with enhanced colors\nAs one of the most experienced and battle savvy members of his order, Caido is often tasked with carrying out missions most would view as impossible. Recently that task was training a young girl who was more interested in seeking vengeance for herself rather than justice for the universe. But he took that challenge on willingly, and to his surprise, he quickly found a new sense of purpose as Andara's surrogate father.\nKlique:\nKlique's concept design with flat colors\nLike Andara, Klique learns the difficulties of growing up and the importance of family, all while dealing with the trials life throws at him. Unlike the majority of his native Usylian brothers and sisters, though, Klique is not willing to simply kneel down and obey his Black Dominion masters. And although his dissension has been minor and gone nearly unnoticed by his subjugators, he\u2019s hatching a plan they won\u2019t be able to ignore. But what sort of misery will he unleash when he tries to turn his world\u2019s most precious commodity into its most dangerous weapon?\nProlijo:\nProlijo's concept design (plus the Black Dominion Logo) with flat colors\nA commanding officer in the Black Dominion, and one of the field leaders in the Usylian campaign, Prolijo is an accomplished soldier with long term, career aspirations. But will even the Dominion's advanced weapons and technology be enough to face down a pair of super powered invaders? One thing's for sure, Prolijo's not afraid to find out. And he will.\nThe Creative Team\nCreated and written by Daron Kappauff & Chris Delloiacono, two accomplished short fiction writers and former comic journalists, Horizon's End is brought to life by comic veterans Darryl Banks, Moose Baumann, Troy Peteri, Stephane Roux & Dave Lanphear. The graphic novel will also feature a Foreward by comic writing legend Ron Marz, as well as a handful of pinups by comic professionals.\nDaron Kappauff is an English professor and proposal writer with a BA in Literature and an MFA in writing. He's published both short fiction and poetry and was a finalist in Blank Slate Press' 2012 New Novelist Talent Hunt.\nChris Delloiacono is an elementary school teacher with a BA in Marketing and a specialization in History. He's published a short story, and his first novel is currently being serialized.\nThe pair also wrote and edited columns and reviews at 411mania.com & Comicsnexus.com  for years. They can be contacted on Twitter at @daronk77 & @acegecko respectfully, or at Horizon's End's official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Horizons-End/281816161954456?fref=ts\nDarryl Banks is best known for his work penciling DC Comic's Green Lantern and for being the co-creator of Green Lantern: Kyle Rayner. Darryl has been working outside of comics for a while now, designing statues and toys. Horizon's End will mark his triumphant return to the comic industry. He can be found at @RealBankster on Twitter.\nMoose Baumann has been a staple in the comic industry for the past 20 years. He's colored just about every character in DC's pantheon, including Green Lantern, which he worked on with Darryl. Besides Horizon's End he's currently coloring Bloodhound for Dark Horse and X-O Manowar for Valiant. Check him out on Twitter at @MooseBaumann.\nTroy Peteri has lettered more comics than the entire team can count together, including every title from Amazing Spider-Man to Witchblade. He's also writing 77 Hero Plaza, a weekly webcomic for Mark Waid's www.thrillbent.com, launching summer 2013. He can also be found lettering the Internet on Twitter at @troypeteri.\nStephane Roux is probably best known for his work on DC's Zatanna, where he did the majority of the series' covers as well as the interior art for the first few issues. For Horizon's End, Stephane contributed the beautiful cover for the book seen below. His Twitter handle is @stephanerouxart - check him out.\nDave Lanphear is an award winning letterer and cartoonist extraordinaire. He's the co-creator and artist for the Thrillbent series 77 Hero Plaza, with Troy Peteri, and he's Horizon End's Title/Logo and graphic designer. He can be contacted on Twitter at @artmonkeys.\nStephane Roux's Cover - colored by Moose Baumann\nThe Project\nA message from the creative team\nHorizon\u2019s End has been a labor of love for Chris and me for a few years now. We spent a lot of time creating the worlds and history of our universe, as well as compelling characters that we hope will resonate with our readers. Unfortunately, we ran into an incredible amount of difficulties in getting a (non-established) art team together to get the book produced. After running into a series of issues for a number of years, we decided to try our hand at putting together a team of industry pros, which is also the reason we brought the project to Kickstarter \u2013 creating high quality comic art isn't cheap.\nDarryl Banks sketching away for a fan\nDarryl was the first piece of the puzzle. Chris and I have been fans of Darryl\u2019s work for almost 20 years now. In the early days of the project, we would often talk about how we felt Darryl would be a perfect fit for the book. And even though Darryl hasn't been working in the industry for awhile, we never even considered asking another professional artist to do the project. So seeing Darryl bring our characters to life has been nothing short of a dream come true.\nThe next piece of the puzzle was finding a colorist who could bring Darryl\u2019s wonderful pencils to vibrant life. And who\u2019s better at that than Darryl\u2019s one time Green Lantern collaborator, Moose Baumann? No one. Period. Our lettering machine, Troy Peteri, followed, based on a recommendation from Ron Marz. And Troy then introduced us to his lettering mentor Dave Lanphear. In addition to Dave creating our fantastic title design, Ron, Troy & Dave have been invaluable in helping us navigate the complexity of producing a comic.\nRon Marz & Daron at C2E2 2013\nHaving Stephane Roux create the cover image for the book was the cherry topping an incredible journey that started on the day Darryl agreed to do the book. I had been acquainted with Stephane for a number of years, but I never thought about asking him to help with the project. But then at C2E2 this year, I was swept up in the momentum we had created, and Stephane and I started discussing the project. That conversation then led to the wonderful image above.\nSo now that you know how we got to this point, here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to thank you for helping us cross the finish line. Horizon\u2019s End will be a full color, soft cover graphic novel clocking in at 120 pages. (Update: the graphic novel will now be a Hard Cover!) The book will be the equivalent of a 5-issue trade paperback, and it will tell our entire first story. The graphic novel will also include an Introduction by Ron Marz; a Pinup Gallery, consisting of sketches from a variety of professional comic artists; and a section thanking everyone who supported the project. The best part is these extras will be exclusive to the Kickstarter print run of the book (this includes the Hard Cover edition). Limiting these features to this printing is a small token of our appreciation. We want each and every backer to know how much we appreciate you putting your faith in us, and what\u2019s better than exclusives?\nLastly, as this is our first attempt at a Kickstarter - both as a team, as well as for most of us individually, we want you to know we're 100% committed to seeing it through and getting the book into your hands. With that said, we would greatly appreciate any assistance in spreading the word about our campaign via Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, or good old fashioned word of mouth. Tell everyone you know, even your grandma - hell especially your grandma. She loves science fiction, right? (Definitely let us know if your grandma decides to back us.)\nChris doesn't always get my humor...\nSigning off on behalf of the entire creative team, I simply want to say thank you for checking out our project, and especially for supporting us and helping make this dream a reality. \n-Daron\nAn interior Horizon's End page penciled by Darryl Banks - \"Andara & Prolijo get acquainted\"\nStretch Goals\nOn the chance that all you awesome backers get us to our initial funding goal, we have a series of stretch goals in place to increase the overall value of the project. \nTo get us started:\n$50,000 Unlocks a new Digital Short Story Collection. When we unlock this stretch goal, everyone at the $10 level or above will get a copy of this book which will feature new stories taking place in the Horizon's End universe. The initial version of the book will feature two stories, each one written by one of the project's writers.\n$60,000 Unlocks +10 pages in the graphic novel. That's right, at this goal level we'll bump the total page count of the book up to 130 pages. And of these extra pages, the majority (if not all of them) will be actual story pages. Who doesn't want more comic for their money?\nThe Rewards\nWhile you should be able to imagine what the finished poster and graphic novel rewards are going to look like based on all the art above (if you can't, you really need to get your imagination checked), the following are examples of what some of the sketch and original art rewards might look like.\nFrom Darryl Banks' sketch book\nFrom Adam & Comfort's sketch book\nFrom Mike Grell's sketch book\nFrom Todd Nauck's sketch book\nFrom Mikel Janin's sketch book\nFrom Chris Mooneyham's sketchbook\nThe page below, from Darryl's most recent comic work - Green Lantern Retro Active, further exemplifies Darryl's interior pencil work. This should give you an idea of what you might get if you choose one of the original page reward options. (It should also further highlight how amazing the interior pages of Horizon's End will look.)\n*Sketch Reward Disclaimer \nThe language of the sketch rewards indicates that they will all be used as pin-ups in the finished graphic novel. Now, while our goal is to use them all, variables like available space and print-ability of the various sketches may limit us to how many we can actually use. It is our goal, though, to try and get them all in.\nSimilarly, it should be noted that you are not restricted to the four characters presented in the characters section above for your sketches. Once we're funded we will continue to post updates with new character designs and more art from the book. If you're so inclined you can choose a future character for your sketch.\n**Shipping**\nIt's FREE for all rewards sent within the United States!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest challenge will be getting everything done in time for our estimated delivery date. With a full team of working professionals, who have various projects in and out of the comic industry, coordinating everyone's deadlines will be our biggest hurdle. To combat this, we've tried to give ourselves enough lead time, but like all things in the comic industry, nothing is certain. We will continue updating throughout the process, and we'll let everyone know if we run into any complications.\n\nFinancially speaking, we don't really foresee any risks. We've evaluated all of our costs, and our goal amount reflects that. The largest portion of our funding will go to paying our art team so they can continue to produce top notch work and make the art in Horizon's End jump off the page. The next largest part of the funding will go to printing. We already have an established relationship with a professional, industry printing company, and we've budgeted our printing costs based on their estimates. The remainder of the funding will go to shipping costs, Kickstarter fees, and reward creation.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Horizon's End Comics\n2 created \u00b7 20 backed\nDARON KAPPAUFF is an English professor and copy writer in St. Louis Missouri.

And what can he do about it? \nWith the world being torn apart before his very eyes, astronaut Jason Gustafson has no way to get home, and his oxygen is quickly depleting.\nThe story is one that speaks of the human spirit, and how the desire to live can push us even when we don't think we can take another step.\nPage 1 for Last Breath\nThe creative team\nSam Eggleston is the writer of Last Breath. He has been a professional award-winning journalist and columnist since 2000 and a full-time freelance writer and editor since 2008. He has been an avid reader of comic books most of his life and has written several scripts for comics slated to publish in the next year. He also edited Mark McKenna's Combat Jacks, which was originally published in 2012. \nJason Baroody is mostly known for his work in the comic book industry. He's had several comics published, AIT/PlanetLar, Image, 5Finity/Moonstone, Sixgun Comics to name a few. He's written several articles and illustrated advertisements for multiple comics related magazines as well as film artwork for Illuminati Pictures. He\u2019s a founding member of TEN TON STUDIOS and once worked and owned a small independent comic book publisher Disgruntled Fanboy Comics. His work can be viewed here.\nJosh Oakes is relatively new to the comics industry, but you can't tell from the quality inks he turns in on each and every page. His inking work can be seen in his Deviant Art gallery.\nJohn Hunt has been working in the comics industry as a letterer and a colorist for quite sometime. His credits begin back in 2004 when he worked on Tokyo Pop's \"Girls Got Game\" and as a letterer includes Marvel Super Heroes Magazine, Combat Jacks, Nurato, Seekers and more. As a colorist, you've seen his work in numerous IDW Star Trek series, the World's Deadliest Sharks graphic novel and Charmed, among others. View some of his work here.\nMark McKenna recently agreed to do the inks for the cover (example of the cover is coming soon). McKenna is a legendary inker, having more than 450 titles to his name and more than 7,000 pages. He is also an Inkwell Hall of Fame award recipient and recently launched his own titles, Banana Tails and Combat Jacks. The latter he worked on with Baroody, Hunt and Eggleston, among others.

Knowing how supportive the comic community can be on a crowd-funding site such as this, Eggleston, Baroody and Oakes made the decision to turn to the legion of comic fans out there and ask for a little help in getting their comic launched.\nYou have lots of choices when it comes to choosing a comic to back, but we're hoping to be able to pique your interest with a solid story, quality art and a compelling protagonist.\nA sample panel from one of the pages of Last Breath.\nBut why are you asking for the amount you're asking for?\nTruth be told, none of us began this journey looking for a payout, and anyone in the know about the cost of creating comics can tell you that there is no room for profit being built into what we're asking for. The $4,500 will be used to cover the cost of having the pages finished (drawing, inks, gray tones, lettering) and getting a limited number of comics printed. Additionally, the costs associated with Kickstarter and Amazon payments have been built in, as well as the creation and shipping of the rewards.\nDo you have any stretch goals?\nOh, for sure. If we're able to make it to $5,500, then we will have additional copies of the book printed to hopefully sell online and via local comic book stores. \nIf we reach $6,500, we will likely get the entire interior colored as well, and if we reach $7,000 and beyond, we will use the additional funds to begin work toward additional comic projects.\n\nSome of the rewards\nHere are a couple of the rewards that we have ready to go already.\nThese sketch cover rewards are still available.\nThese sketch cover rewards have all been claimed.\nAdd ons\nAt the request of a couple of backers, we have decided to put \"add on\" rewards on the list. The way this works is you add the amount of the corresponding reward (listed below) to your current pledge and then drop us a note and let us know you'd like to have an add on and which one(s).\n\nExtra issue(s) of LAST BREATH: $10 each (unlimited) -- Larger quantities can be discussed at discount pricing, of course.\n\nHeadshot of your favorite character by Jason Baroody or Brian Lopez-Santos: $20 each (unlimited) -- This will be on 9x12 paper and is a shoulders-and-up shot of any character you choose.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any project, there are challenges and risks.

This game uses a custom, easy to use, 1d10 skill based system that we have been developing for the past two years. We decided to throw away the confusing experience point system during development. In Outbreak you level up once per game session so you can have a smoother game session and not have to keep tabs on thousands of experience points. \nOutbreak uses a point based character creation system based on 5 attributes.  Those attributes are physique, coordination, aptitude, psyche, and vitality. Attributes are used to shape your character to be whatever type of survivor you want.  Attributes also enhance learned skills, such as mechanics, first-aid, observation, and many more.   All these skills will help your character to adapt and survive against the elements of various apocalyptic environments. You can shape your skills any way you wish with attribute points that you unlock when you level up. \nIncluded in Outbreak are various custom GM Templates to shape the game how you see fit.  We use the same templates in the book to create all of our weapons, vehicles, and enemies. These templates help you play out any modern apocalypse of your choice. The most important template though is the one included for designing your very own custom apocalypse. \nHere are some links to a list of some general information about the game so far. Keep in mind this information is in a very rough draft without proper format and illustrations. \nGeneral Information\nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_7HQOv3jedMWWRESXZtUGl3WnM/edit?usp=sharing\nCombat Mechanics\nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_7HQOv3jedMVWZZTUZWVThTWGM/edit?usp=sharing\nAttacking and Dealing Damage\nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_7HQOv3jedMbzQyNzlUem00VHM/edit?usp=sharing\nKickstarter Exclusive\nFor Kickstarter we will be providing you with the limited printing of the Special Edition book for the same value of the Normal Edition book with a ton of extra content. The normal edition book will be unlocked when the Special Edition copies run out and will be the only edition available for sale on our website post-funding. The Special Edition book will not be printed again after Kickstarter so get it while you can! \nTypes of apocalyptic scenarios pre-created in the Outbreak Guide\nEconomic Collapse\nAlien Invasion\nRobot Uprising\nZombie Outbreak\nNuclear Winter\nViral Epidemic**\n**Viral Epidemic is only available in the SPECIAL EDITION book\nWait. I get to create my own apocalypse? \nOh yes. We have a template set up so you can design your own apocalyptic setting if you're up for it! We leave some of the discovery up to you! But for those that want to play a pre-made apocalyptic setting, we have 6 made for you in the Special Edition book. \nDo you want to create an apocalypse of mutated bugs that start attacking everyone or perhaps you would like to play in a world where nature has claimed its territory once again? You can do this with the apocalypse creator template. \nI suppose it is technically possible to combine all of the apocalyptic scenarios at the same time but...wait...no that would be awesome. Go ahead and try it if you wish :)\nSpecial Rules for the different apocalyptic scenarios\nEach apocalypse section will come with its own set of rules and guidelines, enemies, back story, form of currency (if any), apocalypse specific weapons and items, and other information for playing whichever apocalypse you choose. This means that your experience playing a zombie outbreak apocalypse will be different from playing a nuclear winter scenario or alien invasion. Each section is diverse and different from the last so you will always have a fresh experience when switching between scenarios. \nA good example of the diversity we bring to each apocalypse can be seen by taking a look at the zombie section. With the zombie outbreak we have rules for becoming infected, playing a zombie character, zombie horde rules, specific factions and enemies that might appear in a zombie outbreak, and more. The other apocalyptic settings have specific information that is unique to that setting.\nThe Difficulty\nThis game is meant to be difficult. It's meant to be scary. It's just like trying to survive an apocalypse. Just because you are the highest level in the game, does not mean that you are \"overpowered,\" it just means you will perform as a better, more skilled survivor. Leveling up just gives you a few more tools to try to survive another day in this cruel and unforgiving world. A sniper shot to the head or a pack of zombies trying to eat you is most likely going to leave you dead on the ground no matter what level you are. The constant threat of death whether it be from starvation, enemies attacking you, or disease makes this game extremely exciting and the rewards that much more satisfying. This is the kind of game that requires team work to survive which also makes playing with your friends a lot more fun, creative, and memorable. \nBut just because this game is a challenge to play does not mean that the rules to learn how to play are difficult. We have crafted the system of rules in a way that makes the game extremely easy to pick up for those who are just starting to learn how to play Tabletop Role Playing Games or those that are already used to them. \nWhat if I want an easier game play experience? \nSome of the rules like keeping up with food or making sure you drink enough water to not become dehydrated are just some of the many options that add flavor to those hardcore role-players out there. We'll be specific in which sections are not required for play in the guide. \nKiller Robot by Leigh Walls\nCharacter Creation\nThe first step in Outbreak's character creation system is allocating points to your attributes to make your survivor more tuned to how you want to play the game. If you want be geared more toward the person that has the smarts in the group, or the character less likely to go insane, or the sharpshooter who has precise aiming, you can do that depending on how you allocate points when you level up. \nAlong with that you will gain 1 enhancement per level up that makes your character more successful when dealing with certain situations. For example we have the enhancement called Double Tap which is a zombie outbreak specific enhancement that let's you immediately kill a zombie behind the first zombie you kill with a sniper rifle. Another example is a general enhancement that works for all apocalyptic settings like Things That Go Boom which causes explosives to be twice as effective. \nWeapons and Gear\nThere are tons of options for weapons and gear in Outbreak. We have over 80 guns, melee weapons, and explosives to choose from so far. Gun categories alone include hand guns, sub-machine guns, light machine guns, snipers, shotguns, and special weapons (like .50 caliber machine guns or crossbows). We use statistics on real life guns to come up with the stats on the guns we use in the game to make the game more realistic as well. Each of these weapons has the option for customization with attachments and special ammunition types. \nFor gear we have various types of armor (like bullet proof or ballistic vests and helmets) and a huge list of survival equipment to choose from that come with their own in game stats. Examples include different sized packs for holding more items, a vast array of survival tools, cooking equipment, and the list goes on and on. \nA link to a list of weapons: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_7HQOv3jedMSEdLcTlFM0FWUU0/edit?usp=sharing\nArsenal by Carrie Gibson\nCrafting\nWe feel that crafting would be a big part of any apocalyptic situation so we put a special emphasis on it in our game. You can craft makeshift weapons, barricades, buildings, and custom items.\nWe have a huge list of materials to choose from when crafting items and weapons that are split up into units of materials based on size. You can use those units of materials and put them through a special crafting machine we made in Outbreak specifically for creating items that would be difficult to figure out how to make on your own. For example if you take 1 unit of brass and put it through our machine you can use your engineer in the group to make thousands of bullet casings for making home made bullets. Or if you want to use a couple stacked units of steel you could potential create a suit of armor. Using this machine is not the only way to craft items but it is very helpful when a player cannot figure out how to express making something.\nThese units do have weight and HP to them so you can also get a rough estimate of how much the things you want to create weigh. If you go ahead and make a suit of armor, because of weight and HP stats for steel, you'll have a rough estimate of how much that suit might weigh and how much HP it would provide you. \nBuildings and barricades are made using units of material as well except when building these things time is a huge factor. You will have to decide if the time to put up a wooden barricade on a door or adding an expansion to your survival bunker is worth it because time is a precious commodity in Outbreak where starvation and dehydration are constantly tapping you on the shoulder. \nKnowledge Skills\nWe thought it would be fun to put knowledge skills in the game that would let you gain access to tons of survival knowledge and do some pretty insane and creative things. We ultimately decided those skills were going to be Chemistry, Biology, and Engineering. Players choose to have access to one of these knowledge skills at the start of the game and can choose to level them up if players put points into their aptitude attribute. \nTo give you an idea of some of the crazy stuff you can do with these skills I'll give an example of my favorite knowledge skill: Engineering. In one of the play test campaigns we were running, one of the players used materials and components to create a mecha robot that he could control. He was one zombie killing machine! \nLeveling up your character\nOutbreak has 10 levels your character can achieve starting at level 1. Every level you gain either 1 or 2 points to put into your attributes for a total of 15 points by level 10. Your attributes (physique, coordination, etc.) all start out with 1 point in each category and have a max of 10 slots to allocate points into when you level up. This means even at level 10 you will not be able to max out every attribute so you'll have to plan carefully according to how you want to play. \nAttributes have a variety of effects depending on the attribute. When you put points into these attributes your character gains certain benefits like HP, increased carried weight limit, better accuracy with weapons, and other things. \nEach attribute is paired up with a couple learned skills. For instance vitality is paired up with the nature, survival, and first aid learned skills. These learned skills get better depending on how many points you allocate to which attribute. \nAlongside attributes and learned skills, we have enhancements. You gain one enhancement for your character per level starting at level 1. Enhancements are little perks that make your character unique and more adaptable to surviving very specific situations. There is a general list of enhancements that work for all apocalyptic scenarios and a list of enhancements per apocalyptic scenario.\nThat's it! That's all you have to worry about when you level up. There will be no experience calculations or anything like that. \nThe option for streamlined scavenging and combat\nIn Outbreak we have a system that lets GMs quick search a building depending on the building size, how many rooms, etc. Along with that we have a massive list of loot that you can roll for in various tiers from Ok, Average, Great, and Perfect loot types. This is extremely useful for those GM's that don't have every little reward planned out in every location. While you're scavenging we also have a quick combat system that works with the quick search if the GM decides the building you want to go in has enemies. Keep in mind this is NOT the primary way of combat and searching for things. This is just a method the GM can use if he or she has not planned every detail of an area in the game that players want to explore. That sounds about like every game right? \nExample\nYour group of survivors is heading toward some objective and see a building off in the distance away from the main path. To the dismay of your GM, your group decides to go way off course and search for supplies in this giant building that the GM has not planned for at all. When you enter the building the streamlined combat system can be activated for the first floor of the building unless the GM wants to improvise the search. \nIf the GM decides to activate quick combat/ quick search, this sets up how many enemies are on that floor or in the area, the attack process of your group dealing with those enemies, and the damage and effects after combat with a few quick rolls using some tables. After that, depending on the size of the room and some other factors you can then roll for loot (if the GM does not make you fight through the rest of the building first). This way you do not have to spend an hour searching through every building just to try to find some supplies and can get moving toward the main objective. Of course using the quick search/ quick combat system is completely optional and not required to play the game.\nAlien by Leigh Walls\nThe Core Rule Book\nThis 8.5 x 11\" hardcover source book will consist of everything that you will need to play the game including sections for different apocalyptic scenarios, an NPC section, an enemies section, various game play information, a player\u2019s section, and a GM\u2019s section all in full color. This will be about 250 full color pages depending on how the book is formatted. \nThe Normal edition book will be unlocked once the Special Edition copies are about to run out. These will be valued at $45 and will be the same books we sell post-Kickstarter on our website. These books will have less content than our Special Edition Kickstarter Exclusive copies.\nThe SPECIAL EDITION Rule Book EXCLUSIVE to Kickstarter (limited printing of just under 1000 copies)\nThis 8.5 x 11\" hardcover source book will consist of everything that you will need to play the game including sections for different apocalyptic scenarios, an NPC section, an enemies section, general game play information, a player\u2019s section, and a GM\u2019s section all in full color just like the Normal Edition book but this edition will have a concept art section, additional enemies and items, a special edition cover art, more NPCs, the Viral Epidemic apocalypse, and more illustrations. This will be about 300 pages depending on how the book is formatted.  This is limited to Kickstarter so get them while they last! What are you waiting for? Snag one! \nOh! I almost forgot! Those of you that back the Special Edition book will have your name put on a page in the front of the book under a super special thank you section as well as a thank you page on our website! The cover art for the special edition book is below. \nSPECIAL EDITION Cover Art by Joe Badon\nMeet the Artists! \nThe characters and illustrations in Outbreak will be drawn by our extremely talented group of artists in full color. Below is a list of the artists that will be working on this project with us and supplying some superb art work. Since we will have multiple artists working on the book with us, we will have a variety of art styles to enjoy, bringing a bit of added flavor to the game. We will be splitting up the artists to work on specific parts of the game such as an artist for characters, an artist for environment shots, etc to have a cleaner flow of artwork during the creation process.\nCarrie Gibson\nCarrie is a senior graphic design major at the University of Arkansas, but has been making art all her life. She enjoys illustration, design, web design, and soon hopes to break into the world of comics.\nLeigh Walls - http://leighwalls-artist.deviantart.com/\nLeigh Walls is a New York based artist/writer/painter who was born and raised to make comics. He counts among his many influences Sam Keith, Bill Sienkievicz and Erik Larsen and someday soon hopes to create the next great American graphic novel. You can see his work at www.leighwalls-artist.deviantart.com.\nJoe Badon - http://joebadon.blogspot.com/\nJoe has been working as a full time freelance illustrator since 2009. He has worked on projects for Assailant Comics, Angry Fruit Salad Comics, devhub.com, Sore Thumb Press, Red Moon Comics, Candy or Medicine Comix, Flying Tiger Comics, Silber Media, Red Leaf Comics, Vein Armor Publishing, Amish Drive-by Presents, and on many other commercial and private commissions. He is always available for commission work. You can check out his portfolio at: joebadon.blogspot.com\nEric Douthitt - http://www.artwanted.com/artist.cfm?artid=15096\nEric has illustrated a number of comic books over the last 7 years including American Sentinels, Issues 1,2, and 3. Recently Eric has been working with Blackfall Press on a book called Cold Steel Wardens. \nThe Reaper Zombie by Joe Badon\nThe SUPPLY CACHE tier (Briefcase Board tier)\nIn this tier we are offering our hand made portable gaming board. This Briefcase Board folds out to unveil a plexiglass grid surface to play tabletop RPG's on. These Briefcase Boards allow you to replace the gaming surface to apply any grid type you want. The board includes storage for small items like markers, dice, pens, etc and storage for books and paper. The board is mainly wooden with comfortable rope handles. They take about a week each to make (since they are hand made). Since we are making them one at a time, with our bare hands, some of you could receive your board in the mail 1-2 months after the funding period. Some will take a little longer. \nShipping costs are extra so if you order this tier make sure to email us to get an appropriate shipping quote. Just add the shipping costs to your pledge and you will be good to go. We will ship internationally but keep in mind that will be rather expensive since the board does weigh about 23 pounds.\nAdditions: We do offer additions to these boards since they are custom made products. Add $30 and we will give you an additional grid surface of choice. The first grid surface is free and up to you to choose which grid type you want. We will also stain the wood whatever color you want for free. \nIf you would like to back the Briefcase Board in a tier that does not include it just add $200 plus shipping costs (which you can find by emailing us the location it will be shipped) to your order and we will create one for you after the funding period. Add additional costs if you would like the extras that are involved in making the board. \nThe Interactive Character Sheet\nThis is an interactive Microsoft Excel character sheet that uses custom formulas in order to have a much smoother game play experience. This sheet automatically calculates a variety of aspects of the game. This is extremely useful for those who want to play more and write less.\nKeep in mind this is in alpha stage and will be working on it constantly as well as updating it with better looks and new and improved formulas after the funding goal. The updated sheets will be sent to those who backed the LOOT BOX tier on Kickstarter through email or download on our website as soon as the PDF for the game is available. The sheet that you see on the video is in alpha stage and will have many improvements the time the game is released to everyone. \nThose who want to purchase the character sheet after Kickstarter will have to purchase a season pass to the character sheet for $20.  As a reminder, backing the LOOT BOX will give you access to ALL of the future updated character sheets for FREE. Check out the video below to see a preview of our work in progress. \nRemember this does not come with any tier so if you would like to purchase the interactive character sheet you will have to back the LOOT BOX tier along with the game. This let's us keep track of who orders the sheet a lot easier. Thanks!\nFor the best viewing of this video please watch in 1080p on YouTube. \nWhat will we be doing during the time of post-funding?\nWe will be working on art, finishing up the little bits of information we have left for the guide, and formatting it.  While we are doing this we will be play testing it like crazy. After all that is done we will print it out and send it out.\nWe will be providing constant updates of our status on everything to keep you as much in the loop as possible. Essentially when we know something new, so will you. Who knows, it\u2019s possible we could get you the book even earlier than the expected time. The time that is set right now is just to give us enough time to deal with any issues that might arise. Sort of like a buffer.\nThe basic time-line post funding\nMonth 1-6\nDuring this time we will be finishing up the information on the guide, play-testing it, and piecing everything together. At the same time this is going on, our team of artists will be working on the rest of the art for the book. We will also start to develop our website so we can have a better line of communication for our backers and show off some things like game information and art as it comes in. We may even post some game footage of play testing so you can get a feel of what the game might play like.\nMonth 7-8\nThis is the time final revision will be going on. We will be doing our final touch ups before we send the guide to an editor to professionally piece the guide together. \nMonth 9-10\nDuring this time we will be sending the digital files of the book to the printer to be made and shipped to our location to then be shipped off individually to each of you. Chances are we will be sending the PDF to everyone a good month or so before the books are sent out so everyone can get playing early. All of this will be clear during our updates. \nMonth 10\nOn month 10, we will be shipping out all of the physical copies of the books to everyone so you can enjoy the game and begin taking part in your apocalyptic journey. \nKeep in mind we could very well finish a month or two earlier than May but we feel it is good to have a good buffer in case anything pops up unexpectedly that we need to deal with. \nStealth by Leigh Walls\n$20,000 - The Survivor Narrative\nIf we reach $20,000 we will get to work on creating a narrative woven throughout the book of a survivor and his journey through the post-apocalyptic world. Every new entry of this survivor's narrative will not only provide a new and interesting story, but will also show him physically changing as you flip through the pages. This will be in the Special Edition and Normal Edition books. \n$25,000 - Game Maps\nIf we reach this goal we will be working with a Tabletop Role Playing Game cartographer to create a series of top down grid maps of various places that might be popular to explore in an apocalyptic setting. This will be a separate section included in the book. This will be available in the Special Edition and Normal Edition books. \nZombie Parade by Carrie Gibson\nProfessional Formatting and Editing\nWe will be sending our game to an editor to proof read and edit the game as professionally as possible after the final draft of the game is completed. After editing the game will be sent off to be formatted. \n$15,000 for what exactly? \nFor the printing company we have chosen we have to order in quantities of 1000 which is the biggest chunk of change we have to raise. On top of that a large chunk of that change is going towards the artwork in the book by some of our professional artists as well as professional formatting. We will spare no expense on the quality of our book which will cost a little bit of money. What is left after all of that will be for shipping costs. \nIf we make a considerable amount past the funding goal, most of that will be put to good use in expansion books for the game. Some will inevitably be going into living costs (because we like to eat and pay bills too) but a large chunk will be going straight back into the game and other tabletop products.\nPlease help us spread the word!\nIf you know anyone who might be interested in a game like this, such as your friends, family,  or co-workers, please let them in on it. We can only broadcast this thing so much, so we need YOUR help. We would really appreciate it! \nThe \"All or Nothing\" Kickstarter Method\nIt's important to keep in mind that Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding site. That means that if we do not reach the goal we get nothing. This means that the book will not be created for other people to enjoy unless you amazing people back our game. We would really like to see this made and only YOU can help us do that be backing our book today! \nInternational Shipping\nIf you are wanting to ship outside of the United States please contact us through email for an appropriate shipping quote. Thank you! \nIf you wish to calculate your own international shipping costs, we will be using USPS shipping from Fayetteville, AR, USA, 72701 using the \"package\" option. The item weighs 1lbs. \nFriends playing Outbreak by Eric Douthitt\nContact Information\nFacebook page for Outbreak: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Outbreak-A-Post-Apocalyptic-RPG-Source-Book/439078692795280\nThis page will allow you to keep up with the latest developments for Outbreak\nFacebook page for Cosmic Compass Creations: https://www.facebook.com/CosmicCompassCreations\nEmail: cosmiccompasscreations@gmail.com\nWebsite: cosmiccompasscreations.com\nIf any of you bloggers out there or anyone else would like to contact us for questions about the game and what we are doing at Cosmic Compass Creations, feel free to email us and we'll try to answer any and all questions you might have :)\nFeel free to talk about Outbreak or ask questions over at our crowdfundingforum.com page by clicking HERE", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI would say that the only real challenge is re-playtesting through everything before we send it to the editor.

Growing up and trying to fit in while navigating the halls of high school is an experience everyone around the world can relate to. At times this struggle is humorous, exhilarating, painful, inspiring and sometimes it's even heart-breaking. I've felt it all - and these experiences have been so meaningful that I decided to write about them.\nIt was a great deal of work creating a screenplay. At first, I had no clue what I was doing. But I knew I had a great story and a rich world of characters to build from. There's a story in every classroom and every hallway. So with a little encouragement from my friends and teachers; I kept writing and writing and writing. Earlier this year, I'm really proud to say that after many months of hard work, I finally completed Senior Project.\nBut we're not done...!\nWe need some help from YOU. We want you to be part of this experience. We'd love it if you could help us make this film. Please contribute so we can get this project up and running. Please give whatever you can.

I'll do 5 more chapters of Headlocked! I'll wrangle up a few more awesome guest wrestler contributors (got a bunch on deck believe it or not). And we'll just do the next one right here (we'll ship em separately of course)! \nWelcome to the Headlocked: The Last Territory Kickstarter!\nWhat is Headlocked?\nIn one sentence, it's a wrestling cable drama in a comic book!\nHeadlocked is a coming-of-age story chronicling a college theater major's quest to become a professional wrestler. It begins from the moment he unexpectedly falls in love with wrestling and follows his journey through the insanity of the wrestling business as he chases his dream of making it to the bright lights and the big stage of the WFW.\nOn a deeper level, Headlocked is an examination of wrestling as an art form. Our main character, Mike Hartmann, is a college theater major that drops out of school to try and break into the wrestling business. So the reader will learn more about the craft of wrestling through the eyes of a performance artist.\nTo further our theme of wrestling as art, we use wrestlers to contribute to the book artistically. Our interior artist, Michel Mulipola, is a wrestler from New Zealand. And our cover artist, you might have heard of him....\nWWE Hall of Famer, Jerry \"The King\" Lawler!\nIf you read further, you'll see we have a metric ton of awesome guest contributors from the world of comics and wrestling lined up to help make this even better! \nWhy Headlocked?\nFor almost 30 years, I've been a student of wrestling and comics. I've always considered them to be two very underutilized storytelling mediums.  When I decided I wanted to start writing comics, it was only natural that I wrote about wrestling. Of course, over the years, I've suffered through a ton of horrible, horrible wrestling comics (not going to name names, but you all know what I'm talking about) so I thought I'd make one that I, as a wrestling fan, would want to read. \nIf you've been a fan of wrestling for any length of time, you're often called upon to defend your fandom. My other goal with Headlocked, when it's all said and done, is to be my defense of wrestling...all the reasons why people fall in love with it....served up inside of an entertaining story about a boy chasing his dream.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe launched Headlocked a few years back. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. Wrestlers, wrestling fans, comic fans....even people who didn't like wrestling could relate to the story of a kid striking out to chase his dreams.\nBut here's a dirty little secret about comics: They're expensive to make. And why not? It's art....hand-crafted by artists. But in comparison to the costs, they don't generally command a high price point.\nSo, for a comic to survive, you need a certain number of readers.\nTo get readers, you need awareness. And this is where it gets tricky...\nBoth the wrestling and the comics industry are dominated by a very small handful of companies....so to get the necessary retail and media support to produce a successful comic book without being supported by those companies is extremely difficult.\nAs you can see in the entertainment business these days, it's not easy to get support for anything that's not a sequel, a remake, a reboot, star-driven, or attached to a license...and the comic book business is no different. \nThis is why we brought this project to Kickstarter.\nWe're very proud of the work we've produced and we think it deserves a bigger audience. We think a lot of people will dig it. We think if you're a fan of wrestling and comics, you deserve a product created by people that are just as passionate about it as you are. No wrestlers fighting demons, no licensed cash grabs, and no beating up naked Santa Claus...just a good story about wrestling, created by people who love wrestling.\nThe Last Territory\n(NOTE: Even though this is our second story arc, you don't have to have read the first arc to follow this story)\nIn The Last Territory, Hartmann's journey brings him to Texas and Kings of Texas Championship Wrestling. Built around the ultimate regional superstar, Magnificent Mark Steele, it's the last surviving wrestling territory in the country. Because they still draw strong crowds, the WFW uses it as a developmental promotion to prepare their talent before bringing them up to the \"big leagues.\" It's a heavy dose of the old-school \"smoky arena\" days mashed up with modern corporate wrestling politics. In this type of environment, we'll meet wrestlers at every level of their career: rising stars, veterans getting repackaged, superstars on injury rehab, territory lifers, and the hopeless dreamers. With all these guys literally one call away from making it to \"the show,\" you can bet there's going to be some drama! \nOf course, this new setting raises all kinds of questions. Why is Hartmann there? What caused him to leave Philadelphia? Don't worry...all will be revealed! \nWho the heck are you guys?\nMichael Kingston - Ever since George The Animal Steele completely transfixed me as an eight year old boy, I've been in love with wrestling...in all its forms...from big arenas to high school gyms. I can't even begin to tell you the miles I've put on my car driving all over the east coast to watch indy wrestling shows. And from the first issue of Spider-man I bought from a spinner rack in Kinney Drugs, I've had an equally passionate love affair with comics. Over the years, my tastes have changed but I've never lost my love for the medium of sequential art.\nMichel Mulipola - Michel Mulipola is a Samoan comic book artist/professional wrestler/comic book store clerk based in Auckland, New Zealand. He's been wrestling for New Zealand's premiere promotion, Impact Pro Wrestling, for almost 8 years. As well as doing artwork for Headlocked, he has done work for The Gutters webcomic and various other projects. He can usually be found drawing comics at the comic book store he runs, Arkham City Comics, in Auckland.\nHeadlocked Artist Michel Mulipola laying the smackdown!\nAnd here he is in his more mild mannered alter ego!\nChuck Obach - Chuck is, in his own words, a self taught Comic Book Colorist and an advocate of the Jedi Force \"look ma' no hands\" coloring technique.\nAs you can see, when he and Michel put their artistic talents together, they make absolute magic on the page! \nJason Arthur - Jason Arthur is a super talented designer and letterer that's been with the team since Day 1. He's got credits from damn near everyone in the industry from DC, Image, Dark Horse, Top Cow, BOOM, and others.\nJerry \"The King\" Lawler - If you're looking at this, I'm pretty sure you know who \"The King\" is. Many people know him as a wrestling legend, the voice of WWE Raw, and the man who slapped Andy Kaufmann on David Letterman.  But not many people realize that The King's first love was actually art, and it was always his dream to be a comic book cover artist. His first published comic book cover ever was for Headlocked: The Tryout #1 and he also painted the cover to our collected edition.\nWriter Mike Kingston and \"The King\" w/ his cover to \"The Tryout\" #1\nSpecial guest creators!\nLuckily over the years, we've managed to impress a few people with our book. People who, like us, are passionate about wrestling, comics, and art. They like what we're doing and they've agreed to contribute to Headlocked to help get as many eyeballs on the project as we possibly can. \nAll of the content from our special guest contributors is Kickstarter exclusive! When we reprint these stories for conventions, it won't have any of the wrestler-generated content, including the Lawler cover. That's our gift to you for helping support our project at this critical juncture! \nKen Anderson - Impact Wrestling Superstar, the former Mr. Kennedy and the current VP of Aces & 8's, actor, and artist. Ken will be contributing a Kickstarter exclusive pinup.\nSinn Bodhi - former WWE/TNA star, currently an amazing tattoo artist. Self-published his own comic book called Fred the Possessed Flower in 1999. Sinn will be contributing a Kickstarter exclusive pinup.\n\"Fallen Angel\" Christopher Daniels - Impact Wrestling Superstar. One half of Bad Influence with Frankie Kazarian and one of the biggest comic book fans in the wrestling business. Chris will be contributing a Kickstarter exclusive short story.\nShane \"Hurricane\" Helms- former WWE/WCW star, longest reigning crusierweight champion in history, and wrestling's first superhero!  Shane will providing a Kickstarter exclusive short story. \nBeth Phoenix - This retired WWE diva is now a professional artist, launching her own studio called GlamCanvas earlier this year. Beth wil be contributing a Kickstarter exclusive pinup.\nJill Thompson - multiple Eisner award winning artist best known for her work on Scary Godmother, Sandman, and Beasts of Burden. She's designed T-shirts for CM Punk and gear for Daniel Bryan. Jill will be providing the chapter breaks between the five chapters of this book.\nJill's work from Beasts of Burden/Hellboy Crossover\nPretty sure you've seen this shirt. That's Jill's art and design!\nRob Van Dam - WWE superstar, comedian, actor, and author. Mr. Monday Night is also a noted comic book fan and has published his own story, Soldiers of Karma. Rob will be contributing a Kickstarter exclusive short story.\nSo how's this all gonna work? \nWe're trying to make is a 150 pg. graphic novel consisting of 5 chapters of Headlocked: The Last Territory. Jerry Lawler is painting the cover and Jill Thompson is providing the chapter breaks. We're also featuring Kickstarter Exclusive short stories from RVD, Hurricane, and Christopher Daniels as well as Kickstarter Exclusive art from Ken Anderson, Beth Phoenix, and Sinn Bodhi. While the story of Headlocked is Mike Hartmann's, the wrestler content will help shape the Headlocked universe at large, giving us places to take Hartmann down the road. \nWHAT ARE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS PAYING FOR?\n8% of our pledge total is to pay for Kickstarter and Amazon Payment fees.\n17% is budgeted to pay for reward production, printing, and shipping costs.\n75% is budgeted to pay for the art for the three full-time artists on the project to produce 150 pages of professional quality art.\nEvery dime pledged beyond our total will go into the continuation of Headlocked by funding more art to further the story. There won't be holofoil covers, polybags, stickers, gatefold covers, glow-in-the dark inks, posters, or buttons...just more story!\nHeadlocked Retro T-Shirt.

Starting out as a rookie and then moving up the ranks, players face adrenaline charged scenarios and conduct real police procedures while solving crimes and arresting perpetrators.  \nGameplay Concept Sketch - Bar Fight\nGameplay Concept Sketch - Non-Lethal Force Being Used\nIn-Game Screenshot - On Patrol\nWritten by Jim Walls and some of today's brightest Hollywood talent, Precinct features a gripping crime story based on true accounts of real police cases. As players clean up the crime ridden streets, the plot thickens with corrupt cops, greedy public officials, and a deadly struggle for control of Fraser Canyon's criminal underground.\nGameplay Concept Sketch - Alley Confrontation\nGameplay Concept Sketch - Weapon Drawn\nPlaying in the first person perspective, Precinct's real-time 3D environments and gameplay deliver significant realism to the classic police adventure style Jim is famous for creating. Along with staple elements such as adventure and puzzles, players also encounter intense fast action gameplay sequences that include shootouts, high speed car chases, investigations, foot pursuits, hand-to-hand combat, and more.\nIn-Game Screenshot - Arriving at Scene\nJim is leading an effort to successfully combine original Sierra-style adventure with modern video game technology. The Precinct team is poised to redefine the cop-game genre by making a game that both classic and modern gamers can enjoy.\nIn-Game Screenshot - Approaching Crime Scene\nPrecinct will be released as a DRM-free digital download for PC and Mac with distribution across platforms such as Steam and our own website. If our stretch goals are met, we will be able to release Precinct on additional platforms (more about stretch goals below).\nOUR CAMPAIGN  Every Kickstarter dollar you give goes directly towards developing Precinct. We want to skip the traditional publishing model to make the best game possible for the fans of the original adventure Police Quest series.  \nWe put considerable effort into creating an exclusive suite of rewards for our backers (see the right of this page) including a high quality Precinct badge, a visit with Jim, police whistle, Special Operating Procedures Manual, a visit to the game studio, and more. These rewards are completely unique to Precinct and can't be found anywhere else. We hope you like them!\nWe can't make this game without you. Please pledge whatever you can to make this game a reality. We GREATLY appreciate all that have backed us so far. Thank you so very much!\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign we will be posting lots of new content; we will publish new videos that detail the Sierra days as well as show you some behind-the-scenes footage of the making of Precinct. We will also give you an in-depth look at Jim Walls, Police Quest and Sierra.\nSTRETCH GOALS  If we are successful with our Kickstarter we are going to be able to make a great game.  However, the more money we get, the better the game will be.  Every dime we receive goes directly towards building Precinct!\n$600,000 (Awesomer) - At this level, we will be able to provide a more immersive gameplay experience.  We will be able to produce hours of additional content and achieve a higher level of detail and beauty throughout the game.\n$700,000 (Mega Awesome) - If we get to this level, we will be able to include more locations, more characters, a deeper story, and deliver a very high level of polish.  We expect to release a Linux version at this level as well -- if we hit this goal we will dedicate an engineer, tester and art person to Linux.\n$800,000 (Badonk) - This level allows us to pretty much do everything we want to do for Precinct.  In addition to more gameplay, more characters, more story, more polish, we expect to bring Precinct to iOS, Android, XBLA and PSN as well.  You can also expect subtitled versions for the French, Italian, German and Spanish markets at this level too.\nHISTORY\nABOUT SIERRA Located in the small mountain town of Oakhurst, CA, Sierra On-line was founded in 1979 by husband and wife team Ken and Roberta Williams. Through Ken and Roberta\u2019s hard work, vision, and talent, Sierra became a pioneering force that was instrumental in shaping the video game industry and bringing home computer games to mainstream culture. Since the 1990\u2019s, several mergers, acquisitions, layoffs, liquidations, and the departure of Ken and Roberta effectively rendered Sierra defunct. The company\u2019s brand and remaining assets were last owned by Activision.\n\"There are few more storied franchises in adventure gaming than Sierra's Police Quest series.\" - Kotaku\nPolice Quest is a trademark of Activision Publishing, Inc. All rights reserved.\nCREATING POLICE QUEST Jim is a retired California Highway Patrol officer who left the force in 1984 after being traumatized in a violent shootout. During his recovery from the incident, Jim serendipitously met video game pioneer Ken Williams who was in the early days of growing Sierra On-line with his wife and company co-founder Roberta Williams. Ken asked Jim to design gameplay and write a story for a realistic police adventure series Ken wanted to make. Police Quest was born.\nJim Walls (second from right) with the early Sierra On-line design team. Company co-founder Roberta Williams in front.\nUpon its release, Police Quest was an instant hit, wowing early gamers with a unique point-and-click adventure style and unprecedented realism for the time. Police Quest went on to have five sequels, selling millions of copies.\nMost games fade to black in the game industry but the interest in Police Quest still burns brightly almost thirty years later. Possibly because of its deep storyline and the dedication it takes to play Police Quest successfully, the series has amassed a legion of fans from all over the world.\nPRINCIPAL TEAM\nJim with wife Kristy\nJIM WALLS Jim has been in the video game business for almost 20 years and is considered one of the original pioneers of the adventure game genre. His game titles include Police Quest 1, 2 and 3, Codename Iceman, Blue Force, Blade Runner, Pirates \u2013 Legend of Black Kat, and Earth and Beyond.\nPrecinct Executive Producer, Robert Lindsley\nROBERT LINDSLEY  Robert began working at Sierra On-line at just fifteen years old. Although already precociously well versed in programming, Ken and Roberta Williams brought Robert into the company to help box games and copy floppy discs.  Robert was eventually given a shot at programming and it wasn't wasted on him.  Robert soon began coding professionally and eventually began producing.  At Sierra, Robert worked on several classic Sierra titles including King's Quest V & VI, Laura Bow 2, Mixed Up Mother Goose, and Phantasmagoria 2.  After Sierra, Robert worked for Microsoft Games where he wound up on Microsoft's Xbox launch team.  Robert has also led development at Atari and Harmonix, shipping over 80 games in his career.  Most recently, Robert's credits include Rock Band, Ghostbusters, and Dance Central.  Robert is currently Jim's partner for this project. \nPrecinct Art Director, Scott Butler\nSCOTT BUTLER  An early employee of the pioneering game studio Argonaut Software, Scott has worked in the video games business for over 24 years. 11 of those years were spent at Sony Computer Entertainment as a senior artist and art director. Scott has shipped over 50 games in his career, including Kingsley's Adventure (PS1), Croc: Legend of the Gobbos (PS1 & Sega Saturn), Neopets: The Wand of Wishing (PSP), Eyetoy: Play (PS2), and Ren & Stimpy (SNES). At just 17 years old in 1989, Scott began his career making games for the Amiga and Timex Sinclair computers. Over the years, as game technology, tools, and business models have evolved, so has Scott. He has worked on virtually every game platform possible, Scott holds a US patent for a game engine technology he invented in 2009.\nPrecinct Production Director, Jason Crawford\nJASON CRAWFORD Jason has spent nearly two decades as an entrepreneur and creative professional in technology.

Our entire team is intensely aware of this issue and know we must be vigilant in managing it responsibly. Leading this effort is Precinct's Executive Producer, Robert Lindsley, who has over 20 years experience producing video games. Working on small games up to hundred-million dollar AAA titles, Robert has a proven and unbeatable track record for shipping products on-time and on-budget. As with any game development project, Precinct will undoubtedly throw out its own unique challenges but those challenges will be met by a team of seasoned video game industry veterans that know how to solve problems effectively and responsibly.\n\nTECH & PRODUCTION DESIGN\nIt's going to be an enormous undertaking building a lot of our own tech and tools above the already robust Unity3D platform. We created a game prototype of the world that not only shows off the art style, it was as an exercise to vet if Unity3D and our proprietary game editor will be possible given our minimum budget range.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAlthough upgraded to modern gameplay standards, we believe audiences will enjoy the fun of a realistic police adventure because of Jim's past success with Police Quest. \"If you've played Police Quest, you know exactly what Jim Walls is like, because that game is Jim Walls.\" - Al Lowe, creator of Leisure Suit Larry and programmer on Police Quest.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jim Walls\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nExcept for the few short years I lived in Nevada, California has always been my home.

I am a product designer, food connoisseur, and father. \n\nThe idea of Visionnaire came about on the day my son was born. It was a scary feeling knowing I had just become a father. There I was, with a pen in hand about to sign my son's birth certificate. I felt like it was a moment that lasted forever. I knew as soon as I signed that piece of paper, it was official. I looked at the birth certificate and looked at the pen in my hand. \"Johnny's Bait and Tackle\" was written on the edge of the cheaply made pen. How did this pen end up at a Kaiser hospital? It was an odd feeling signing a document of such significant sentimental value with a pen that advertised bait and tackle gear.\nFrom then on, I decided to create the ultimate pen. Just like a pocket knife or wedding ring, a pen should have the same sense of value. It should be something that can be handed down generations. Writing with Visionnaire is an experience, and when the cap clicks shut, it should capture that experience much like a journal or diary. Every time you pick up the pen, there is a distinct connection between you and the object itself. Not only does a pen have to have functionality, it needs to have soul.\nI wanted to create a timeless piece that could be passed onto my son, a meaningful piece of art that he can use and cherish. Perhaps my son would have it in his hands when it comes time signing his son's birth certificate.\nHandcrafted Precision Nib\nBELOW WHOLESALE PRICING\nIt all starts with a pen, a piece of paper, and a vision.\nWith the help of crowd-sourcing, we are able to make our dreams come to life.

Our goal is simple, to provide a high-quality fountain pen for the Visionnaires of today.\n\nFuture Pricing: Visionnaire will be retailed at $80 after Kickstarter funding is completed.\n\n\nManufacturing and Quality\nI wanted to create a minimalistic design that was timeless.  I wanted the name of the pen to have presence as well as definition.  To design Visionnaire, I sought professional help from Theory Mob.  Vincent Ng, a designer for Theory Mob, really helped me to understand the aspects of turning a design into a solidified product.  Feel free to explore the early renderings of the Visionnaire.\n\nWith Theory Mob, we have spent the past 6 months finalizing the design of Visionnaire as well as preparing manufacturing.  We were able to partner and work with one of the best manufacturer in the industry. Our manufacturer have spent the past 25 years perfecting fine writing instruments for the top high end industry leaders.

After upgrading the ink converter, and adding additional ink cartridges, I still had some additional savings left over. My projections for the Visionnaire project were towards the goal of $15,000 and the project was INCREDIBLY OVERFUNDED BY 2163%!  I felt that the only solution to this was to put all of the extra funds BACK INTO the Visionnaire project.  \n\n\nI looked into different aspects of the pen that can be improved and also analyzed it with the available funds I have left.  To be quite frank, I am very happy with the quality of the build, as well as the design of the pen. Then the idea of protecting the pen came to mind.  I then secretly spent the past several weeks looking into different solutions of boxing/packaging the Visionnaire pen.  \n\n\nAfter going through with several boxing prototypes, I just was NOT happy with it.  The standard pen box did not have the same esthetic and design feel that the Visionnaire pen deserved.  I asked my close friend Vincent Pilot Ng (product designer/TheoryMob) to help design a packaging that would be minimal, sleek, and also environmentally friendly.  It also had to be light to ship, as well as strong and durable to protect the Visionnaire pen. Designing the build of the packaging was my main concern however it had to fit into the remaining extra funds I had left. \n\n\nAfter numerous trials and errors and testing out different packaging companies, we finally settled on the packaging we were very satisfied with. I had put the extra funds into manufacturing 8,000 Visionnaire tubes for all of the kickstarter backers. \n\nWe decided to go with a sleek cigar-tube made from recycled card-stock paper. The custom tube was designed to fit the Visionnaire pen snug and perfectly. The Visionnaire tube itself, is constructed durable and strong while its esthetics greatly represents its product in minimalistic form. The Visionnaire pen will be protected by a microfiber sleeve inside the tube packaging. And the tube will be laced in matte black finish with the Visionnaire logo is printed in silver lining. \n\n\nThis Kickstarter has truly been an amazing experience that I will never forget.  I honestly believe that it is because of a strong supporting community that allows normal guys like me to accomplish amazing feats.  I want to personally thank you for your contribution to building my dream and more importantly, your faith in my vision. I have put my heart into every aspect of the Visionnaire project and I hope that by using the Visionnaire pen, it can help build your dreams as well.

All the early bird backers will be shipped out first. Please keep in mind that I have almost 8000 Visionnaire pens to send out. Please bare with me as I wish for everyone to receive it asap and I will make it as streamline as possible! I will be working with Vincent Pilot Ng from HALO and some of his team members. He is very experienced in the logistics of shipping in large volumes.\n\nGreat news! I was able to secure a large production order of all the ink cartridges at a low wholesale price. This means I was able to put the additional money into adding EXTRA INK CARTRIDGES for everyone as well as packaging them into a neat little box! I've included a rendering of the ink box that I designed. Hopefully they look just as good in real life as it does in the picture. (Originally we had come across some issues with shipping the ink cartridges by plane because it was a large amount of liquid. However we had the problem resolved by switching to a different logistics company.) I expect everything to go smoothly and also ship out earlier than expected. :D\n\nJust another friendly reminder, I will be sending out the survey in about 2-3 weeks (early October) to collect all necessary information including the best shipping address and options for the Visionnaire pen. I will include an \"additional comments\" section for those who have adjusted pledges.\n\nThank you again for all the support and I can not wait to get started on shipping these out asap!

Whether you're a writer, a designer, an artist, a business man, or even a student, I genuinely hope that it allows you to discover something new.

You have to build the defense more, more and more. We have decided to mix this wonderful genre with RPG elements, 3D and other surprising gameplay features. In addition we have decided to make Tower Defense a multiplayer game for ourselves, for you and for all other gamers who are interested in more than a simple tower defense strategy. So, let's do this. Let us develop something we are all passionate about: tower defense game mixed with other genres. All gamers will have to think about it. This game is for PC, iOS and Android and can also be played via all browsers with Unity web player. \n\n\"And everything was all-in-one-piece replacing and complementing each other. And there was a world of harmony and understanding. Once, so long ago that even the forces of chaos can't recall the name of the time, place and state, the One who perceived evil came into the world. And he divided the harmony, understanding, and order in the mysterious way. And the whole was divided into parts, and these parts were called the elements of Fire, Water, Earth and Air. In order to maintain control, the dual structure was created. One part of the structure represents the Order, and the other represents the Chaos. This structure has been called Equilibrium, because only together they  can control any of the elements. And at the predicted time the One will come who will reassemble the elements together by the Equilibrium and bring back the harmony of the world.\"\n\"However, the time has not come yet. And mages of the elements are fighting and inflicting the countless hordes on each other. And each of them is striving to become the first and remain the only one. They are locked in their impregnable Towers. And from there they try to grab all the structures on either side of Equilibrium. And each of them has their own continent. And only at one, the fifth continent, all the elements of the whole can be joined in the battle. There, to their cost, the race has settled, that was called humans. And once a year they have to fend off innumerable hordes. Because the ancestors said that here will appear the one who can unite the elements and restore the harmony in the world.\"\nA few words about the Hero or about RPG component: A protagonist in \"Towers.Evolution\" is a hero who is receiving an experience and other bonuses. A player is a protagonist in mini games and a basis for conducting the charges for the achievements, bonuses and specializations in the main game. A protagonist can be chosen in Menu, after deciding on the side of Towers or Monsters. The protagonist for Towers is Chief on Rhino or Shaman of the Tribe. The protagonist for Monsters is Mage (last but one unit) or Dragon (the last unit on the line). The differences between the characters is that some of them provide additional physical skills (Chief and Elemental Dragon), and the others provide magical skills (Shaman or Elemental Mage). Also, they provide additional bonuses when choosing matching hero specializations. With neutral specializations there are no bonuses, and with the opposite specializations there is a little minus. Below is the Hero screen concept, Chief on Rhino and Shaman of the Tribe.\nThe characters have the amplified characteristics. Two of them are common for any character, and two are unique for every category.\n\u201cTowers Evolution\u201d is all about using your towers (units), runes and specializations to the greatest possible effect. In order to win, you will need to consider such factors as the positioning, attack range, special abilities of towers, speed, armor and special abilities of monsters, as well as the equipment upgrades. Usage of the right runes and properly chosen specialization will help you to win.   \nSome units of the elements in the game have the unique characteristics that set them apart from all other units and give them the unique abilities. You can further individualize them by assigning specific upgrades and using specializations. Most units allow for four leveled upgrades. The fourth is with two options to choose from. \nThere are three types of runes in the game: \nGrey Runes\nHuman Runes \nElemental Runes (Fire, Water, Earth and Air). \nAnyone can use Grey Runes. Human Runes can be used only by humans, as the name implies. And the Elemental Runes can be used only by the Mage of the respective Element. Use of the specific set of runes in the midst of the battle can rescue even if the situation is desperate. The Rune used in a proper time has a power to reverse situation to your favor, if the opponent won\u2019t possess a counter spell. Also, the power of the Rune will depend on you, as it is directly connected with the accuracy of its inscription in the battle. The more accurately the rune is being inscribed, the stronger is its effect on the playing field. You are the one who chooses the runes that should be used in the battle. It has the power to influence the battle drastically. The Tree of Runes will help you to discover even more powerful Runes. And the use of Rune words will create a totally unique effect.  \nThere are also three kind of specialization in the game: \nTower \nMagical \nNeutral  \n\nSpecialization depends only from your game style, and affects directly the behavior of your units or towers on the battlefield, how accurately they shoot, how fast they run and so on. Only you decide whether to learn Defense, Offense or keep the balance and attempt to succeed without going to extremes.\nFight for the people\u2019s side, use the power of bone runes and people\u2019s Towers. For the Magician side, use the power of monsters and runes of one of the 4 elements (Water, Fire, Air or Earth). In both cases use the specializations and other features. Try Rune battle. Use the power of rune words. And more\u2026\nIn Multiplayer mode, as well as in Single Player Campaign, you choose one of the sides: Mages or Towers. After that, you build your defense, if Towers were chosen, and keep your opponent from destroying the castle. When Mage is chosen, you should make up a detachment of creatures and destroy the enemy\u2019s castle with the help of Runes and Specializations. The outcome of the battle, victory or defeat depends only upon your choices, upon combinations of creatures, runs and specialization. The more accurately were chosen the specializations, runes and creatures for the battle, the more persuasive and fast will be your victory. However, your opponent keeps the eyes open for sure.\n So, who will you become, a loser or a champion? The choice is yours!\nStandard \u2013 a regular battle, where a player earns only experience and general game resources.\nBonus \u2013 a contest is held with computer or other player for a specific bonus (rune, card, crystal, etc.) A bonus depends on the map chosen for the contest, and also on the level of complexity: one battle, few battles in a row, etc.\nRating \u2013 Initially a player has a standard rating 10. After joining the rating battle system it is increasing after victories over the other players, or decreasing after defeats. Staying at Top 100, Top 50 and Top 10 will also add additional bonuses. \nTotalizer \u2013 a contest that is being held on the specialized maps (Arena). Before the battle starts, the player can stake on the battle. There are three kinds of stakes: Elemental Runes, World Crystals and Gold. After the end of the battle, the charges are conducted for the players who participated in Totalizer. Charges are conducted in accordance with the common rules: defeated users are deprived of the stakes, and the winners receive the resources according to the stakes chosen before the battle.\nTournament \u2013 a battle type which involves a certain amount of preregistered players. This tournament is held according with the Olympic system. There are two kinds of rewards: reward from the tournament organizers, and also a specific percentage from the tournament registration fund. Registration fee is being paid by the player to the fund when registering for the tournament. Reward type is being declared in the tournament regulations before carrying it out, and is counted as one of the game resources: Elemental Runes, World Crystals or Game Gold.\nArtfulBits is an independent developer. We did not receive any outside investments. About 50% of the game is ready right now, but the resources are running low. And that's why we need your help. Your contribution will make this project possible. It will ensure our vision of a great game.\nWe\u2019ve created an alpha stage version of the game and attempted to find a publisher in order to finance the project. Unfortunately, most of the industry either offered us a budget that would have been too low and meant cut-backs on our vision of what the game could be, or offered us to finish the game by our own means, and only then they will publish it. Kickstarter offers us the opportunity to make the game we have envisioned - all options included. And not by order of a publisher, but backed by you, the players! If we can carry it out, it will be well worth the wait.\nWe will publish \u201cTowers.Evolution\u201d ourselves through the digital channels, in order to retain control over the story and the gameplay from the beginning to the end, in all eras from Stone age to Modern era. With Kickstarter, not only we can invite the gamers to play the Towers.Evolution, but it will also let us not to compromise. In addition, we can maintain an open dialogue with the community during the production process.\nWith total transparency into the development process, our pledgers will have the chance to closely follow the progress of the next era in \u201cTowers.Evolution\u201d. And we will have the opportunity to talk directly to our supporters, and hopefully to provide you with broad insights into our production.\nOne of the most obvious ways to help us to make \u201cTowers.Evolution\u201d a reality is to back us as much as you can. In addition, of course, you can tell everyone you know about what we're trying to do here. Spread the word through whatever social channels you have. Share the link to this kickstarter project with all of your friends. Another thing you can do to really help this effort is to become involved into\u201cTowers.Evolution\u201d community. By becoming a part of this community you will help to enliven our vision of the game to make it more interesting and wonderful.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n--- Strength ---\n\n* 8 years in IT industry, last 4 years in mobile development\n* Several games developed and released for customers and own brands\n* Our management is able to analyse gaming trends and take advantage of them\n* Experienced team in staff with knowledge of several technologies\nexperience of own software product making (desktop, web, mobile)\ndiversified incomes in company account\n* Game complete on 53%\n\n--- Weakness ---\n\n* Lack of finances to finalize development and market the game to the fullest creative extent\n* Part of the team are right now sub-contractors (freelancers). 3D modelling, animations, sound.\n\n-- Opportunities --\n\n* Mobile market grow very fast\n* Potential relations with publishers and reporters from different game portals and magazines, could create significant revenue and publicity\nreviewed pre-release can increase \u201cfirst day\u201d sales\n* reaching of 100k installs on devices will boost company grow and future releases of next game in set\n\n--- Threats ---\n\n* Big competition on market, more than 300 applications released each day (risk: normal)\n* Bad reviews from the mobile game review websites (risk: normal)\n* Programming could take longer than expected, and as a result will increase expenses (risk: low)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "ArtfulBits Inc.\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nArtfulBits Inc focuses on the custom software development for a variety of mobile technologies: Android, iOS, BlackBerry, WF 8.

It started out as an idea for a short film, but once the script was complete it was decided it needed to be made into a feature.

Some specific challenges that we take on with this film are that we are an independent production. Being indie means that most of our cast and crew still work other jobs to make ends meet as we do not have the funds to pay people. They are doing this project out of the belief of it and give their time freely. That means that schedules may change. As a small crew, a lot of tasks of a normal production that are handled by multiple people or whole departments are being executed by one or two people. So, some things just take longer to get done than we would like. However, we always finish what we start. Not only do we have the risks mentioned above, but we also have the challenges of any normal production which means that cameras could break, lighting could fail on us, locked down locations may need to be changed last minute, etc. We are essentially taking on a normal production weight with the addition of being a shoe-string production. We are also shooting on a Missouri farm away from immediate film resources that could help aid us in the production process should something come up. Which have I mentioned... we love challenges! We love taking on challenges and figuring out new approaches to situations. It's part of the fun of any production (at least for us).\nThe upside to all this is that we are a small indie crew so that means our budget can be immensely cheaper than big studio productions. We can also go places and try things that some big productions just can't do because of the size of their crew. That means we can be spontaneous, inventive, and flexible when making this movie. We plan on taking on any challenges we come across as an opportunity for the production to grow and by the end of the process we will have a project that we know we did everything to help it succeed and something we made out of passion and hard work.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Diane Baldwin\nFirst created \u00b7 7 backed\nDiane is an actress/model living in Los Angeles.

The script concerns a struggling yet forceful single mother and her shy son as they start life over by moving in with her estranged hermit father in the backwoods of a small town as the local discovery of deadly offspring mutations spread from animals to humans.\nIt's a cause: \nIn 1995, hideously deformed frogs began popping up in Minnesota ponds.  Over the next few years, thousands were discovered.Some frog populations were as much as 70% deformed.  The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency came up with many possible theories for the cause but nothing definite.  It was known as something in the water.  In 2001, the U.S. Government pulled all further research funding.  The malformations spread to other states and even other countries such as most recently, India and China.  The current likely theories are parasites and pesticides or a combination of the two.\nThe problem continues to grow\u2026\nIt's helping promote practical makeup/creature FX in movies:\nCG (computer generated) FX is a great tool and often helpful to practical makeup/creature FX in the form of enhancements.  However in films of ALL budget sizes we see way too much CG that would have been done better as something physical.  When we see a bad CG character, poorly done CG blood or gore work it really takes us out of the film.  We feel like we just saw some video game instead of a dramatic experience.  We know a lot of others that feel the same way.  100% of the FX in STRANGE NATURE will utilize practical FX.\nJust a few of the many FX in the film.\nThe Budget:\nThe money raised will go directly toward:\n-Casting both in Los Angeles and mostly in Minnesota\n-Makeup/Creature FX supplies\n-Production insurance\n-Setting up a production office in MN\n-Talented crew, cast\n-Meals and lodging\n-Camera, grip, lighting equipment\n-Post production, editing\n-Sound mixing\n-Original score\n-Film festival fees\n*Remember, if we don't reach the entire financial goal the project gets nothing and you will NOT be charged!\nWhat we've done so far:\n-An entire nightmare sequence from the script has already been shot, edited, scored and completed.\n-All winter exteriors in Minnesota have already been shot.\n- Deformed frog footage has been shot.  Live severely deformed frogs were supplied to us by one of the leading U.S. ecologists involved in the mysterious cases of widespread frog deformities.\n-For the news \u201cbroadcast\u201d footage needed for the film, we have already shot all of the footage at a Duluth news station using real newscasters using the station\u2019s news cameras.\n-70% of all makeup/creature fx already completed for the film by myself and other industry professionals.\n-70% of all shooting locations for the film in MN are already secured at little to no cost.\n-Numerous leading U.S. Ecological scientists supporting the film as it relates to their efforts of finding this mystery water mutation cause.  One scientist has already supplied us with severely malformed frogs to exhibit in the film.\n-Hit song by the film\u2019s protagonist, Kim Sweet, \u201cSweeter Than Kandy\u201d already created. \n-WWE Wrestling Superstar, John \"Nitro\" Morrision has recently signed on for a substantial supporting role in the film.\nPlan of attack:\nThe film will be shot this fall in Duluth and surrounding areas of Minnesota from mid-September to mid-October.  This time frame will capture the gorgeous look of the fall colors on to the deadness of bare trees.  \nOnce filming has wrapped we will jump immediately into post-production back in Los Angeles.  We will edit the film for 3 months with a January 30th deadline.  The original score will be composed at the same time along with the same deadline.  \nAs soon as we have a rough cut we will begin submitting to film festivals for consideration.  The hope is that several distributors at these film festivals will be interested in the film and we go with whoever will give the film the most attention and really get it out there to the world.  The recent casting addition of WWE Wrestling Superstar, John \"Nitro\" Morrision will also help bring in a substantial wrestling following which will be appreciated by distributors.\nIf we are not satisfied with offers from distributors at festivals, we will approach distributors directly with whom Jim has numerous contacts with from working on makeup FX for dozens of genre pictures.  \nWhy Kickstarter?\nTo keep the film as it should be.\nWe've had interest from producers to film everywhere from Bulgaria to Louisiana.  This is a Minnesota story.  The story was written for specific locations in Minnesota.  That's where writer/director, Jim Ojala, is originally from and that is where he has a fantastic support system.  That area also has a very specific beauty that very few have captured in narrative features before.   Minnesota is where it needs to stay.\nWe've also had interest from producers if some major things could be changed.  Like the lead protagonist, Kim, is not a single mother in her 30's with a past but maybe a hot girl in her early 20's.  Or maybe the deformed animals turn out to be aliens!  That's stupid.  We've taken a lot of constructive criticisms from industry professionals to make the script the best it can possibly be and we stand by it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOkay, a lot can go wrong on a feature film...especially a director's first feature film. Here are some examples and how we plan to remedy:\n\n-Location problems:\n\nWe are filming in MN with real locations that are provided by friends and family so chances of losing those locations would be very minimal. As far as public locations go, we already have the support of the local film board as well as Duluth Mayor Don Ness. Heck, our writer/director went to high school with him!\n\n-Weather problems:\n\nSo far the extended forecast doesn't show any specific problems for this fall's shoot in MN. However if we get closer and find that there will be heavy rain during our shooting schedule we will simply have to push to next summer. All finances will be kept in an account where it can build interest. We would continue all facets of pre-production until then. \n\n-FX problems:\n\nPractical makeup and creature FX can be very complicated elements of a shoot. This film will include numerous creature/animal puppets as well. A lot can go wrong with puppets especially when animatronics are involved. That's why we are building all creature puppet mechanisms as simply as possible so if anything does go wrong when we're on location it's nothing we can't fix in a reasonable amount of time with parts that we can get at any hardware store. \n\n-Money:\n\n We are raising enough funds to get us through the post-production phase of the film. If unforeseen circumstances cause the production phase to become more costly we will reach out to potential private investors noting Minnesota's Snowbate rebate plan as well as the U.S. Government's Sec. 181 Tax Incentive for U.S.based production film investors. Beyond that we will be forced to use funds from post-production to complete production. At that point we will cut a captivating trailer from the footage and reach out again to private investors and distribution companies for completion funds. It's a lot easier to raise completion funds when you have something dynamic to show.\n\nThat covers a lot of the biggies. Anything else that arises we feel confident that with our team's combined experience, skills and energy that we can solve any obstacle that should present itself.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jim Ojala\n2 created \u00b7 12 backed\nBased on the success of his Duluth, MN co-creation cable access My Three Scums series, Jim landed his first film job with Troma Studios in...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Original Backers We Need YOU!", "update_content": "Today there is a fantastic new article in the Duluth News Tribune promoting\n STRANGE NATURE film production in Duluth, MN as well as Writer/Director, Jim Ojala. \n The article also announces a benefit concert that will be held on October 4th in Duluth featuring live bands and comedians to help raise money to go towards the Kickstarter campaign.

The film is shot and processed. Now we need your help to get the movie through post-production, from editorial to sound design to color correction to scoring to all steps in between. \nThe money for the production phase of the black sea was acquired almost exclusively through donations from kind friends and strangers like yourself. I raised over $32,000 (via USA Projects) and after transaction percentages were shaved off found myself with nearly $26,000 to produce the movie. If you know anything about making feature films you'll recognize that 10 times that sum is considered the lowest end of a micro-budget. However, we shot on Super 16 mm which comes with high built-in costs (film stock, processing, transfer, shipping etc ) which might make us insane. We shot in January/February 2013. The production was tight and at times tough. But we did it. \nNow we are on the edge of post-production and cannot get through without your help. For as little as five dollars you can be a part of this film. Your kindness will help us through the maze of post-production in multiple ways: editing the footage, designing the sound, licensing and scoring music, color correcting the image, creating opening and closing titles, paying personnel, entering film festivals and ultimately bringing the black sea into the world. \na personal note on the tone of the film:\nThis film means everything to me. You can read the gory details about why right here but I'll condense it to this: I was in the middle of writing this screenplay in late 2004 when I was diagnosed with a rare kind of brain tumor. I survived. I completed the script and have been working on getting the film made ever since. I state this not merely as a cheap ploy to appeal to your emotion but to explain that oblivion and reprieve are sewn into the fabric of the the black sea's narrative. I can get into specifics of my experience if you are interested - email me for that. Meantime, suffice it to say that the screenplay absorbed all my fear and blackness from that period. the black sea is a dark film, part Hitchcock, part Bergman.\nPut simply, our cast was/is amazing. I cannot overstate it. Working with such a tiny budget and shooting on film meant the room for error was reduced substantially (we shot mostly at a 4:1 ratio.) Also, the chemistry among all six was key to the black sea's success. Their interactions had to feel pedestrian and normal - not acted per se. A high degree of difficulty in other words but they did it. And how.\nLet me introduce them to you (in alphabetical order). Please check their links for more information:\nCora Benesh played Lainie \nErin McGarry played Charlotte \nCorrina Repp played Allison \nBill Sebastian played Paul \nMatt Sipes played Eli \nJoe Von Appen played Michael\nCora Benesh\nErin McGarry\nCorrina Repp\nBill Sebastian\nMatt Sipes\nJoe Von Appen\nMy name is Brian Padian. I wrote and directed the black sea. You can check out my website here. My primary creative collaborator on this film was my friend Scott Ballard. Not only was Scott responsible for the camera and images in the film, he co-produced the movie with me. Scott and I have worked on several short films together in the past few years, which has led to an easy and comfortable working relationship. This in turn filtered down through cast and crew and created a (mostly) stress-free production. \nOur primary creative team and crew are listed below. These guys are the best. (note: This is by no means everyone - we had day players and visiting help throughout the shoot. )\nDaniella Gleeson - camera assistant\nAllison Johnson - camera assistant\nKevin Forrest - gaffer\nMichelle Williams - script supervisor\nJordan Eubesio - production sound; post-sound\nSarah Prevo - hair/makeup\nMeghan Lybrand - line producer\nDavid Marion - 1st AD\nRyan Lloyd - production assistant\nSandy Huddle - production assistant \nJosh Smith - grip/gaffing\nEvonne Moritz - editor\n\nWe were very blessed to have several Portland artists donate/create work for the black sea.  Noah Nakell allowed us use of one of his pieces. Anna Fidler let us use one of her works in a scene. Christina Owen designed and made a key prop. Kate Towers designed and made a key wardrobe item. Joseph Kucinski allowed us use of several of his paintings in addition to creating an item exclusively for the film. These artists are generous and all-around awesome and the our film is elevated by their work. \nthe black sea is a product of the Pacific Northwest. Shot entirely in Oregon (Arch Cape and Portland) and featuring almost entirely OR and WA cast and crew. We also had the support of local vendors donating goods to our production and local facilities donating space for film locations. A partial list of those we are grateful to is here. \nThere are several ways you can help us reach the fundraising goal for the black sea.\nMake a donation!

The primary one is time: I am hoping to get the film edited by mid-autumn to qualify us for several big film festivals. We will have to hustle. Also, since my editor is in Los Angeles and my sound designer is in Texas, my colorist in Seattle, and I am in Portland we are all at the mercy of our individual lives and professional schedules. Another obstacle is actually getting in to said film festivals. We are aiming at the recognizable, higher-prestige ones first which all have a high volume of submissions competing for a tiny number of slots. If we aren't accepted to these festivals - which is statistically likely! - we'll submit to myriad other festivals until our film finds a home. A final obstacle is film distribution. In this day and age film exhibition possibilities are changing daily. My primary hope is for you to see \"the black sea\" in a movie theater. Whether that means being picked up by a distribution company or me renting theaters one at a time and living out of the trunk of my car is impossible to say at this point.

That's me, Uros Berce. I was in no rush. The design was evolving slowly, with many iterations and considerations. Gradually, I truly started to enjoy and love the gameplay, and see the full potential it has. Therefore, I had but one option left: finish it, polish it, RELEASE it! For that's been my dream since I was a child! I gathered a small group of very talented people, professionals in the business to work with me. Up until now, I was able to finance it on my own.\nCurrently, HollowFear is in a late development phase. Technical side of the game(engine, tools...) and gameplay mechanics are practically finished.

He did not seek out the titans of industry that surround him, that pressure and push him toward a life of grand production and unending work. Heir to the fortune of Westward Enterprises, Victor has never had to try for anything; he has never had to strive or conquer or build. But all that is about to change.\nWestward #5 cover image\nPast KS Campaigns\nThis is the 3rd KS campaign for Westward to date, and so much of what you'll read here has been copied and pasted from previous campaigns.\nHere's a brief ten-minute documentary from the KS of \"Westward: Volume 1.\" Although made for a previous campaign, it's still a great way to be introduced to the series conceptually, and contains interviews with the creative people involved.\nNew Rewards\nKS rewards can be tricky things; they require lots of organization and good financial projection. Without caution, the cost of producing and shipping the promised rewards can easily outweigh the contribution itself, nearly canceling it out. The tier system for W #5 has been designed to minimize production cost on Westward's side, while maximizing the more artistic and exclusive values for the benefit of backers. \nIn an effort to provide fresh rewards at minimum cost, a few creative ideas have been added to the W #5 Kickstarter campaign, including:\nPrints - The prints included in the various rewards tiers will be all-new, exclusive to the #5 KS campaign\nOriginal artwork - Mid-level tiers will receive an original ink sketch by the artist of Westward, signed and sealed.\nSteampunk portrait - Your likeness will be rendered in steampunk garb and mailed to you as a print and PDF\nExclusive T-shirt design, featuring art from Westward #5\nReviews\n\u201cPacked with plot and interesting characters...

Maybe you've already pledged, but you're a fan and you want to do more. In either case, there are a number of ways you can help Westward's success outside of contributing to the Kickstarter fund.\nThe best way to support Westward is to boost what we call \"pre-orders.\" This involves getting comic stores to order something that essentially doesn't exist yet (which, as you might imagine, can prove to be very difficult). To boost pre-orders, there has to be demand... Buzz, hype, online postings. To generate demand, one must first raise awareness.\nSo how can you help? It's simple: Tell your friends. Link them to the Westward website. \"LIKE\" the Westward Facebook page, or share updates from that page on your own FB wall. Post the trailer on a comic fan's Facebook wall. Let them know about the Kickstarter project. Comment on blog posts. Follow the Twitter feed.

This was my attempt to shine a light on them.\" \u2014Gerry Kissell\nProceeds from any sales of the book with me given to ACVOW, one of the best charities out there that helps vets and active duty soldiers  suffering from PTSD.\nWhat We Ask\nIn order to make this happen, we are turning to the crowd here at Kickstarter, to help us create the art for this book, so we can create a super hero graphic novel that brings attention to the real heroes who are already among us now; wounded soldiers. You also help us bring attention to one of the most seirous wounds soldiers suffer from; PTSD, or as some call it Combat Stress.  Yes, this is an action filled story, but at its core, this is a thoughtful story about the wounded men and women serving on the front lines, defending the rest of us at home.\nVINDICATED INCORPORATED\nIn order to garner more attention for veteran issues like PTSD, Gerry Kissell came up with the idea of doing a book where the main character is a physically wounded and deeply emotionally scarred combat veteran.  Vindicated Inc. is an original gritty, violent and at times humorous and at other times quite tragic graphic novel written by best selling author Shane Moore (Apocalypse of Enoch) and created and drawn by comic artist Gerry Kissell (IDW's Code Word: Geronimo and Iron Sky).\nSome of the comics and book covers Gerry Kissell has worked on.\nPanels from Vindicated, Inc., chapter one.\nTHE TEAM:\nAs usual, Gerry likes to surround himself with gifted people. First on the list were his writer friends Ernesto Haibi and Robert Scott McCall, both military vets (Ernesto is also a disabled vet) who helped Gerry develop the story. \"I wanted the military perspective in writing this story out. Mac is an amazing writer and editor and Ernesto, a great writer as well, but more importantly, Ernesto really understands the damage done in combat, both physically and psychologically, as he is a disabled combat vet who also suffers from PTSD. This comic had to convey the reality of the process of recovery for soldiers. That was essential to the believability of what happens to our main character.\" \n\nThanks to Ernesto's and Roberts work, they had a fully developed story. But, Gerry needed a finished script, and having wanted to work with his friend, best selling author Shane Moore (Apocalypse of Enoch). Gerry approached Shane. \"Shane gets the story I am trying to tell. He gets it dramatically, but also he gets the story because like the others and myself, Shane is also a military vet. But, more importantly, Shane is also a former police detective. So, he brings another level of reality to the telling of the story.\"\nStepping into he reins as senior editor on the project is IDW's senior writer himself, Tom Waltz (Silent Hill, Ghost Busters).  Tom and Gerry have had a very long and fruitful relationship, as Tom is the guy how \"discovered\" Gerry and got him to leave his career as an artist for ad agencies and get back into doing comics.\nAlso contributing a lot to the writing of the script is actor Kurt Yeager (Sons of Anarchy, Tenderloin, A Dolphin's Tale), who is set to play the character in the film. Gerry recently said of the actor, \"Kurt is not just an actor, he is also a gifted writer. He has put a lot of himself into helping flesh out the main character and the story, and I decided early on I wanted him helping not just with the film, but with the book.\"\nGerry also brings to the art team his artistic pals, Jeff Balke (colorist), David Faught (illustrator), and Bernie Lee (letterer). \"I have met no better letterer in the business than Bernie Lee. He's like me, fast and good at what he does.\" On working withe David, \"When I met David, he was one of the best pin-up artists I'd met. But, I saw so much more in him, and decided to build a professional relationship with him. He has a great eye for comic page layouts, which a valuable commodity in this business. In the process David and I also became best of friends. I just really enjoy working with him.\"\nAnother important part of the Vindicated team are Kevin Watkins, Gerry's art manager, and Paul Reynolds and the rest of the Hazmat Studios team.\nBEST SELLING AUTHOR SHANE MOORE TALKS ABOUT VINDICATED\nTHE VINDICATED STORY:\nVindicated Inc. is a 100 page graphic novel about an elite forces soldier, John Russell, who was wounded in combat, losing both legs below the knee, who then returns home to mend his wounds (both physical and psychological) having to learn how to walk again with his new prosthetic legs, and through a series of events, finds himself donning body armor and an ballistic mask, and an cadre of lethal weapons, and going to war with organized crime in Seattle. He has both criminals and law enforcement after him.  Because of his legs, his identity isn't Vindicated's biggest secret.\n\nREALISM IN VINDICATED:\nOur main concern was not to be unrealistic with this story, so, we knew, because we are going to be showing a lot of combat, that Vindicated was going to be very gory as well as extremely violent at times. No pulled punches anywhere in the story. We felt it would be dishonest, and because this story is dedicated to wounded soldiers, we knew that realism in everything was an absolute.  I think this is the reason everyone involved in the creation of this story are military veterans. This is also why I involved Dale and Julia Dye, the folks behind the military realism of Saving Private Ryan, The Pacific, Platoon and Band of Brothers, because I knew they would help keep us focused on how to keep Vindicated real and honest, and show how a small team of soldiers could do so damage to the infrastructure of organized crime in Seattle.\nTHE FUTURE OF VINDICATED:\nAlready our studio has been working with actor Kurt Yaeger, (photo above) who portrays \"Peg\" in Sons of Anarchy, in adapting Vindicated into a film. Kurt was born to play the character, because like Vindicated, Kurt has a prosthetic leg, and he never allowed his so called \"disability\" to ever slow him down form doing what he loves doing; acting, performing extrema sports, and living life to the fullest. Also working with us is Dale Dye, who plans to handle the technical realism of the planned film (and comic) with his company Warriors Inc, he is also interested in directing Vindicated as a film. Also interested in directing, is Iron Sky director Timo Vuorensola. So, there are a lot of expectations for this book, and it hasn't even been fully drawn yet.\nHOW VINDICATED HAPPENED:\nThe idea for Vindicated Inc. was pure inspiration. A culmination of Gerry's passions both as a former Army combat medic, and his  admiration and love for wounded warriors.  The story of Vindicated Inc. is about an elite forces soldier, John Russell, who was wounded in combat, losing both legs below the knee, returns home to mend his wounds (both physical and psychological) having to learn how to walk again with his new prosthetic legs, and through a series of events, finds himself donning body armor and an ballistic mask, and going to war with organized crime in Seattle. He has both criminals and law enforcement after him.\n\nWhat Gerry found funny was he wondered less how the main character physically would do what he does on prosthetic legs, as we have all seen what the new age of real bionic men and woman are capable of. No, Gerry was more concerned on how anyone could fight crime like Batman or the Punisher, while actually avoiding being killed or arrested. The way he decided to address this problem was to bring in technical experts in military and law enforcement. Enter first, Dale Dye and Julia Dye, the heads of Warriors, Inc., the company that made combat scenes movies like Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers and The Pacific, so realistic.  They took on the role as technical advisers for Vindicated, Inc. Then best selling author Shane Moore, creator of Apocalypse of Enoch, is himself is a former police detective and his expertise was essential in getting the cops and FBI right within our story.\nTHE TEAM:\nCreator and Lead Artist - Gerry Kissell\nLead Writer -  Shane Moore\nWriters - Ernesto Haibi, Robert Scott McCall\nTechnical Consultants - Dale Dye, Julia Dye (Warriors, Inc.)\nLayouts and Inker - David Faught\nLetterer - Bernie Lee\nCONTRIBUTION OVER FLOW:\nYOU COULD WIN AN ORIGINAL PRINT FROM FAMED STAR WARS ARTIST DAVE DORMAN!

Our story is scripted, but the bulk of the work - drawing the pages - lies ahead. Comics are extremely complicated constructions, and Gerry will be doing most of the art himself. Fortunately it won't be his first time. He set a record with penciling the 72 page Code Word: Geronimo for IDW in just three weeks. Though, he was rushed, this time he would like to make sure he has time to draw each panel and make it as realistic as possible.\n\nThis will be his 7th graphic novel (Code Word: Geronimo, Iron Sky, Endtime, Bayeux, Alan Wake, A-Team: War Stories), and more than his 100th published credit as artist, with 22 years experience working in commercial illustration. He's learned a thing or two about organization and hard work, and also in how to manage his creative teams. Indeed he's even learned not to rule out problems and has arranged in advance for assistance in coloring and lettering the pages if it's needed.\n\nThe production schedule as it stands has been planned with lots of room in it to get things done.The book will be broken up into four, twenty-two page chapters, each completed over a 3 month period. That's a comfortable amount of time to make sure unforeseen events don't threaten delivery dates.\n\nThis will allow backers to begin to read the story as soon as the summer of 2013, along with general updates keeping them in the loop as the work progresses. The final book will take a year to put out, but you'll be hearing from us throughout the process.\n\nTo make sure we're ready when the book is done, we've already begun working on dummies and packaging design for the backers editions of the books. The trade paperbacks will be produced via print on demand with built in shipping solutions to ease the process of distribution. And the handmade editions will be printed and bound with the help of local experienced artisans to ensure the best possible results.\n\nWe're doing everything in our power to deliver a quality book to you in a timely manner and keep you informed and entertained throughout the process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "From the Vindicated Team", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "15 days to launch of Vindicated Book One: A Leg To Stand On", "update_content": "With Vindicated Inc: Chapter one: A Leg To Stand On nearly completed, we thought we'd share a little sample of some of Gerry's (work in progress) art from one of the pages.

Seeing the world as he knows it going to hell in a hand basket and wanting to help change that, he joins and becomes The Black Operator!  Equipped with the latest and greatest technology\n- a inexhaustible plasma gun, a magnetic distortion belt that renders him untraceable and a bio chemical exoskeleton (like clear scotch tape that runs down his arms, legs and spine) that when activated, gives him inhuman strength for 35 seconds, The Black Operator goes on missions of High Adventure filled with mystery, danger, excitement and intrigue!\nAll the while, no one knows or even has a hint of his double life!\nThe Comic Book Itself\nThe Black Operator #1 is a 32 page Color Comic Magazine by Sean Russell & Roger Rautio which is also being offered in Black & White with Color Covers.

The Black Operator #1!\nWhy did I write The Black Operator? \nHi Everyone, Roger Rautio here.  I originally thought of the character back in 1991 while I was still in college.  At the time, I was very dissatisfied with television and thought how cool it would be to combine James Bond with the Bionic Man and keep him a total secret.  I just needed a name.  While in class one day, we were discussing black operations and I thought there's the name!  The Black Operator!  Wanting him to be a force of good,  I then made up the 'Scientists for the Benefit of Mankind'.  Still doesn't quite answer why thou, does it?  I think deep down, I wrote The Black Operator to represent the unknown scientists who do good work but never get any credit. That and I wanted a super agent who can hide in plain site but still give the proverbial tap on the shoulder to the bad guys at the drop of a hat.  I think Sean and I have accomplished that and are ready to share it with you!  \nMany Thanks!\nRoger Rautio\nPg 4 shown here.

First off, if you know me at all, or if you know Koreans in general at all, we are pretty hardcore gamers. For me, personally, I played games ever since I was a kid and I never really stopped. So yes, I\u2019m a nerd. I grew up on the usual Pokemon series and the Nintendo console systems that all the kids played and was a casual gamer ever since, and wasn\u2019t a big user of computer games until I started playing a game that came out in 2009 called League of Legends, which didn\u2019t see much play in the beginning but as it grew, it took the video game world by storm.\nThe game became so popular that it built a sort of \u201ccommunity\u201d where over 12 million people on the world come online each day and there\u2019s around 40 million active users that play the game and it\u2019s still growing all over the world. There\u2019s servers in the US, Europe, Australia, Asia, and even in South America. It\u2019s actually phenomenal how large this game and the resulting community has become. \n\nWith the growing community, a subreddit thread involving League emerged from Reddit which is one of the most time-consuming, addicting websites people at my age know. For anyone that doesn\u2019t know what reddit is, it\u2019s a popular website where people can post anything cool/interesting/hilarious whether it\u2019s a video, a picture, or just a written post and people can upvote the posts themselves so more people can see it on the front page or second page. And basically on this mother reddit website, there are smaller subreddits that involve posts about a certain topic, and a league of legends reddit was created. The subreddit currently has about 300k subscribers now and at any time, there\u2019s usually at least several thousand people browsing the page.\n\nBut it was when I was on this subreddit randomly one day reading funny posts about the game and people talking about the professional scene when I noticed a certain post on the front page that said Keith \u201cAieron\u201d Knight, disabled gamer, AMA (which stands for ask me anything). And at first, quite honestly, I was confused. The first thoughts going through my head were about how a disabled gamer would play the game. And then I started thinking to myself what kind of disability he had and how his post got so popular.\n\nAnd it was only when I clicked, that I think I found one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve ever seen in my lifetime. The amount of support and genuine care that people showed for him was amazing. Being an AMA post, where people can post random questions and he would answer any that interest him, the amount of comments about how he was an inspiration to so many people, disabled or not, actually inspired me.\n\nAnd the fact that this was made possible all through a game was even crazier. A community built from the ground up through a video game called League of Legends, was genuinely interested in helping and supporting a fellow disabled gamer, who in fact, is good at the game. I\u2019ve been playing for a while now, and I\u2019d be more than happy to say that he\u2019s better than me. \nThe moment I saw his post and read through the AMA, I decided to do some research. It said in his Reddit post that he had muscular dystrophy, a disease that weakens the muscle and skeletal system of the body. It makes the body grow weaker and weaker until in many cases, results in death. It\u2019s unfortunate, but for someone like Keith to look past it and not let it stop him from leading a life just like mine and yours was incredibly inspiring to me. It was then I started thinking about how I\u2019d never noticed him before because it seemed like the AMA post on reddit wasn\u2019t the first about him. When I looked into it, it turned out that he decided to do the AMA because of the initial support he received when people discovered him through a website called Twitch where people can livestream whatever game they\u2019re playing. There are hundreds of games being streamed on the website ranging from Starcraft to Street Fighter but just to give an idea of the League community, it\u2019s the number one game being watched almost everyday on the website with around 50k viewers on average while the professional and high level players from teams all over the world gain thousands of viewers on their own. On weekends, probably much more. Major tournaments of League of Legends gain around 200k viewers on their streams and that\u2019s discounting the live audiences actually at the events. \nBut Keith alone, just as a casual gamer, was getting several hundreds of viewers whenever he streamed and when I actually SAW some past recorded streams from his channel and saw HOW he played the game, that\u2019s when I knew I wanted to get his story out, even if it was just about how he played the game. Just to give you an idea, despite the obstacles, he\u2019s learned to use a pen with his mouth to type out messages, use his elbow and feet to activate certain keys for the game and control the mouse with his cheek. I know\u2026and he\u2019s better than me.\nIn his time off the game, Keith is a business student in his 4th year of his BBA and with the money that people donate through his live stream, he uses to help a charity organization called Muscular Dystrpohy Canada to help those with the same condition that he has. \nHis story is an amazing one all around, and through reddit and the community built from League of Legends, he\u2019s been able to inspire people around the world and directly help those who are in similar circumstances. It\u2019s people like Keith who are willing to help those around him despite their own obstacles that really make his story worth hearing about and it\u2019s people like me who want to help get his story out there. But as much as I\u2019d like to be able to do this on my own, people like me also need help!\nWhich is where this kickstarter comes into play. Any cent or dollar from anyone donated to this project can help and as I spend my week with Keith and dive deeper into his story, I can let you guys who donate and anyone who views it in the near future see what it\u2019s like in a day of Keith\u2019s life. As Keith lives in Canada, the donations would help pay for the travel fees as well as the equipment costs needed to make a proper documentary film on someone who definitely deserves the most proper of introductions. His story deserves to be heard and with the support from the League community and certainly those outside of the game, we can let it be an inspiration to many more people.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe obvious challenges will be to get the logistics of the project down. Since Keith lives a fair distance away from me and since I need at least a week to be able to compile enough footage for a good documentary, housing and the technical things will need to be organized well. \n\nOnce the footage is compiled, it will take me at least a couple of weeks to edit the film in post so I should have the film released by August.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Wow!", "update_content": "The youtube link is now public and the post on reddit that Keith made with the film is climbing to the front page really fast!

Join a product adventure \u2013 in chat, surveys, using the prototype, and helping choose new services.\nKeep reading...\nTaco makes it easy to decide what to work on \u2013 from the task lists, project management apps, and issue trackers that you already use. \nThat's it.\nTaco's working prototype brings Basecamp todos, GitHub Issues, Google Tasks, Zendesk tickets, dozens of RSS-friendly services and many more on to one screen. If you've ever had to open more than one browser tab just to know what's on your plate, you know why this matters. Keep using the services you do today.\nWe're on Kickstarter to support more services, like Asana, Trello, UserVoice, Flow, and Wunderlist.\nTaco (and a coffee theme). Just drag and drop.\nMost of us don't need another way to create tasks. We need a way to get them done. We hope that Taco is the last task list you'll ever need.\nWatch the video to see Taco in action.\nAfter 23 months of using, iterating on, and \u2013 eventually \u2013 loving the prototype, we're ready to bring peaceful productivity to everyone. As a backer, you'll get access to Taco, early access to the prototype, and most importantly, the chance to influence it with your feedback.\n\"We\" is Troy (@troyd) and Jordan (@fixie). Like most of us, Jordan and I wear many hats. In one day, I could be a product manager, email fiend, software developer, and customer support rep, often for different projects or companies. Each role has its own task list, ticketing system, project management app, or bug tracker, not to mention my personal tasks.\nThe inspiration for Taco came from two painful realizations. First, that I'd spent 20 minutes doing little more than opening task lists, reading, and getting distracted. And second, that I'd spent a lot of that day working on the easiest tasks to start on, not the ones I found most valuable.\nTaco fixes that. Taco gives me one place to see and intentionally decide what I should work on \u2013 across my whole life.\nAs Leo Babauta of Zen Habits says in The Daily Checklist, \"Here's a problem worth solving: am I doing the thing I most need to be doing right now?\" Jordan and I think Taco is the smallest great solution to this problem.\nAs I learned, a seemingly-small change can be, well, huge. Now my day is peaceful. Instead of jumping between whatever is tugging the hardest, my day is simply working through the tasks that I've decided are most important.\nTaco's prototype is already fun to use. A few times a day, I'll use it to see everything, or drag and drop to adjust what's next, or just see where I stand (watch the video to see what I mean).\nI make more progress and almost nothing falls through the cracks. I leave relaxed because I'm confident about where I stand.\nWe're Troy and Jordan. First and foremost, we're Taco users. Troy obsesses over function and Jordan obsesses over form.\nAs users, we demand minimalism, transparency, absolute privacy, and sustainability.\nTaco is delivered as a Web service so that you aren't dealing with API changes and interoperability; we are. Part of Taco's value is that it just works. Also, a Web service means that a mobile view is possible without an impractical amount of work.\nSpeaking of transparency, as users ourselves, we'd need to know what the funds are being spent on. Because Taco talks with external services, it needs reliable, secure hosting (discussed more in \"Risks and challenges\"). Your funds let Taco cover the costs of providing backer rewards. The $3,500 is not profit for us.\nWe've honed the process, built a prototype, and had a taste of the results. Now our goal is simple: help others experience the same freedom. That's where your support comes in.\nThe Taco prototype can talk with 9 services: Basecamp, GitHub Issues, Google Tasks, Highrise, Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, RSS, Tender, and Zendesk. We're here to expand to 20 and make this a solved problem.\nTaco doesn't even track new tasks. Think of Taco as bacon: sprinkle a bit on your existing work process to make it better.\nAs we've prototyped Taco, the few additions came from actual use. An optional daily email with pending tasks. A printable PDF. Oh, and \"bring your own workspace\" or the workspace you'd love to spend time in. Imagine interacting with one of these (or one of your own) a few times each day:\nBecause sustainable operations should be baked in from the start. As users, we're tired of free services which run out of money and get shut down, or worse, get acquired and drastically changed.\nIf Taco can't stand on its own two feet, it shouldn't exist. And since we're asking you to depend on it, that critical mass should be visible to everyone. Crowdfunding is the best way to make sure that Taco's users are its stakeholders.\nTaco's prototype is usable now, and as a backer, you deserve to use it. Understanding your workflow and hearing your feedback is incredibly valuable.\nHere's how you'll help shape Taco as a backer:\nUse the prototype. Start using the prototype when the campaign ends (in addition to any other backer reward).\nInfluence its evolution. Tell us what is and isn't working. Share as much detail as you choose through a semi-formal weekly survey.\nCollaborate with us. Exchange ideas with Jordan and I (and with fellow backers) in a casual text-based chat room.\n\nAlthough Taco will remain minimal, you deserve to be able to help us sweat the details, or at least watch as we do.\nHow much support is appropriate? Here's two ways to think about Taco's value to you.\nIf a single task list helps you be 1% more productive, at $30 per hour, that's $600 per year of potential earnings ($1,500 at $75/hour).\nAnother way to think about it is in relaxation. How much is it worth to sit down on Friday night and read a book while completely relaxed, secure in the knowledge that you didn't forget anything?\nTaco began life as \"Taco Foundry\" because a taco foundry was the most incredible thing I could imagine. We started calling it Taco, and as with Taco itself, the smallest great name won.\nWe call ourselves purveyors of fine productivity for a reason. Taco was handcrafted at New Work City and Plaid in SoHo (New York), Vivace in South Lake Union (Seattle), ProjectiveSpace in LES (New York), HUBBA in Ekkamai (Bangkok), Lab80 in Hongdae (Seoul), Collective Agency in Chinatown (Portland), The HUB in Pioneer Square, and in dozens of coffee shops, bars, and parks around and between them.\nWe think of ourselves as Taco's caretakers. Our role is to a provide a way to make this sustainable. That's where you come in.\nThank you for your support. We look forward to delivering fine productivity.\nWhile Taco stems from our own experiences, we're fortunate to build on the efforts of others. These influenced our thinking and the many avenues which we explored or tested on ourselves.\nDavid Cain, Raptitude\n\"I realize now how much of my time is spent without being fully aware of what I\u2019m trying to accomplish.\"\n\"Why am I deciding to do something else right now?

You might not like Taco.\n\nTo us, this is both our biggest risk and our biggest chance to shine. Taco only matters because - if - it makes an impact in your day-to-day productivity and relaxation.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, we've spent 23 months iterating on the working prototype. We did that so we're thrilled with it and so you can get a very good idea what Taco does and how it works. We hope this is the best of both worlds: having the chance to influence Taco while also knowing what you're helping create.\n\n2. Taco may not work with all of the productivity services you use.\n\nObviously we will try to choose services which make the most significant impact for the most backers, and to do so transparently, but that isn't enough. \n\nTo mitigate this risk, Taco can work with tasks from any productivity service which provides an RSS feed. While it's not perfect, supporting RSS means Taco can connect with any open external service (or a custom service of your own creation).\n\n3. Taco may not be reliable.\n\nTaco depends on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) from your other productivity services, which means Taco's data access depends on them. Also, Taco's own hosting needs to be stable and secure.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, we extensively test the APIs, including using automated monitoring to detect problems and test cases to detect API changes. Also, we're experienced and paranoid: Troy operates mission-critical services and is listed on Google's Security Hall of Fame. Finally, we've chosen to host Taco itself on a thoroughly-vetted service called Heroku. Heroku is used by tens of thousands of other services, which means it is a known quantity (and even that backers can evaluate it).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Edit task descriptions as you work through a task", "update_content": "Taco backers, we're pleased to announce that task descriptions are now editable within Taco.

We will be implementing the following stretch goals since we've reached the funding goal early.\nUNLOCKED STRETCH GOAL #1 - $12,500 MAELEE Solo\nWe have reached $12,500 which unlocked the individual Maelee piece as an Add-on for an additional pledge amount of $10 to any backer level.

This is not limited and does NOT include the 50mm plastic display base.\n___________________________________________________________\nTHE PLAN\nWe are raising funds to cover production and promotion expenses of our new Maelee Special Edition Set and assure she gets to GenCon!\nRather than make the set exclusive to convention-goers we wanted to offer it in our online store during the weekend of the show.\nEven better, we want to also offer it early to our Kickstarter backers and give them an opportunity to get the convention exclusive set before we take it to the show.\n_______________________________________________________________\nTHE SET\nThe Special Edition Maelee Set features our mascot mechanic heroine poised atop a giant wrecked robot heap. She is swinging her trusty wrench in desperate melee against three attacking BdE robots. Maelee and her robot attackers are all cast in quality pewter. One BdE Bot is keyed to attach to the base and is posed as if flying apart. The scenic base is cast in resin and comes supplied with a premium style 50mm plastic base for diplay. The two other attacking BdE robots include 25mm plastic bases. Each set comes with a signed and numbered certificate. The sets will be limited to 300.\nThe BdE robots are all special preview pieces from Bombshell's upcoming line of retro sci-fi minis that will not be available to retail until late 2014. \nEach backer for the Maelee Special Edition Kickstarter Set will also receive the \"Buddy\" BdE Bot, a friendly companion that will not be included with the GenCon convention sets. This piece is limited to ONE PER BACKER.\n__________________________________________________________\nTHE PROCESS\nUnlike our previous project where we were raising funds to make the pieces, the sculpts are finished and are ready to go into production now! Your funding will go towards production costs for manufacturing the pieces, packaging, and getting the sets to GenCon. We will be posting regular updates frequently to show exactly how the schedule is progressing. We have verified the production schedule with our casting supplier and plan to begin shipping rewards packages the week following the project completion. Surveys will be sent shortly after funding completes and they will be easy to complete and return.\n_______________________________________________________________\nTHE REWARDS\n$15 BOTS - For those who want just the robots. Includes a set of TWO attacking BdE robots. Each robot is 30mm tall and comes with a plastic 25mm base.\n_______________________________________________________________\n+$10 Maelee - Solo Add-on -  We have reached $12,500 which unlocked the individual Maelee piece as an Add-on for an additional pledge amount of $10 to any backer level.

Components will be polybagged and padded to ensure they are protected .\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nShipping to US backers is included with the pledge totals.\nBackers who want their rewards shipped outside the US must include the requested amount ADD THIS to their total pledge. To edit your pledge total, click \"Manage Pledge\" at the top of the project page and enter the correct amount you wish to submit.

To avoid this issue we have verified scheduling with our casting supplier in order to get a head start on production. We are also planning to begin mold making and casting as soon as possible with frequent updates throughout the run of the Kickstarter project.\n\nWe have also verified shipping reward gifts to our international backers so that there will be as few hassles with customs for them as possible.\n\nThe offered pieces have already been sculpted, printed, and mastered. As we begin receiving castings they will be packaged for shipment so that the rewards can be sent as soon as the project surveys are returned.\n\nAnother challenge is sorting the surveys after the project completes. We have built this project with streamlined rewards levels in order to simplify surveys so they are easy to complete and return quickly. In this way, we plan to assure that when the backer surveys are polled, rewards will be shipped on time.

Inspired by the predecessors of this hallowed genre like Valkyria Chronicles, Final Fantasy Tactics, and the X-COM franchise, WARMACHINE: Tactics seeks to break new ground for turn-based tactics games by delivering a never-before-seen level of dynamic battlefield combat.\nAs you\u2019ll see in the video, the development team has worked around the clock for several months to prove we have the experience and the ability to turn WARMACHINE into an incredible video game worthy of your pledge. Kickstarter has provided the opportunity to realize this vision, and with you on our side, we can make it a reality.\nTo date, we have unlocked 16 stretch goals, adding incredible content and features to the game, making your $20 pledge an amazing value!\nRivalries as old as man steep the Iron Kingdoms in a tradition of incessant war, forging in its violent fires heroes of unimaginable power and the weapons they alone can wield. This is a land dominated by iron giants and their heroic human controllers, a fantastic realm marching to the progressive cadence of an industrial revolution, where magic and technology have found common ground in the form of a new science, called \u201cmechanika.\u201d\nDominating the field of battle are the WARCASTERS, rare individuals who have mastered both sorcerous magic and martial combat and who possess the singular ability to command the mightiest warriors of the Iron Kingdoms\u2014ten-ton, flame-belching, lead-spewing machines of destruction called WARJACKS.\nWarjacks are the warcasters\u2019 greatest weapons\u2014titanic, steam-powered automatons with arcane brains, magically linked to their warcaster controllers and capable of executing their every devastating order. Together, a warcaster and his warjacks possess the power of a small army. When leading a military force, they are unstoppable.\nThe wars that engulf the Iron Kingdoms are waged by four powerful nations: imperialistic and conquest-driven Khador; heroic Cygnar, with its cutting-edge technology; the fanatical Protectorate of Menoth; and the undead \u201cNightmare Empire\u201d of Cryx. Bolstering the forces of these factions are countless mercenaries, drawn from all corners of the continent to profit from the endless conflicts. Other nations beyond the Iron Kingdoms have also entered the fray\u2014ancient and inhuman races, some who ally with the human factions and others who would see humanity destroyed.\nFor a deeper look into the world and factions of WARMACHINE, visit WARMACHINETACTICS.COM.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics is a squad-level, turn-based tactics game featuring both a single-player campaign and online synchronous and asynchronous head-to-head multiplayer options.\nWhether playing the campaign or multiplayer, the command and management of your squad is key. Not only will you make defining choices about the warcaster, warjacks, and warriors that comprise your squad, but you will also utilize strong tactical direction of their strengths and abilities in battle as well as astute guidance for how they evolve over time.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics is designed around the philosophy of synergy between the members of a squad. Every unit is part of the whole and can interact with other units for greater effect. Similar to the concept of creating ability combos in a trading card game, units in WARMACHINE: Tactics can combine effects and abilities that support each other\u2019s efforts and increase one another\u2019s effectiveness. Careful and creative selection of a squad\u2019s warcaster, warjacks, and warriors is essential to an effective strategy. Plus, it means you can design exactly the force you want to put onto the battlefield.\nThen once your squad takes to the field of battle, your tactical command of their actions will govern their success. Will your squad advance cautiously, utilizing cover and outmaneuvering the enemy, or will they charge furiously into melee combat where brute force and resilience will win the day? In battle, how you command your warcaster, warjacks, and warriors and the tactical decisions you make to adapt to your enemy will determine your squad\u2019s fate.\nIn WARMACHINE: Tactics, you\u2019ll be able to save multiple squads in different configurations so that you can always pick the best load out for the mission or opponent at hand. And if you want to see how your squad stacks up, you\u2019ll be able to pit them against an AI opponent in order to try out your strategies and evaluate their performance before putting them to the true test against opponents from around the world.\nThe Iron Kingdoms are populated by rare individuals who possess incredible arcane talents in addition to unmatched combat skills. Even more important, they can mentally command and channel their power through the most devastating weapons of war\u2014warjacks. In WARMACHINE: Tactics, your squad is led by such a warcaster, one of many unique characters drawn from a colorful pantheon that makes up the epic cast of this setting. Each warcaster possesses an arsenal of weapons tailored to his personal fighting style as well as a unique combination of spells and skills. These include a defining arcane feat that, when used at the right time, can turn the tide of battle.\nWarcasters possess a replenishing reservoir of magical energy, called focus, which endows them with their superhuman abilities. Focus is used to cast spells, charge the protective fields of their specially created battle armor, and increase the effectiveness of their combat abilities.\nEvery warcaster interacts with his or her warjacks and warriors differently. One warcaster may promote aggressive strategies and bolster her squad\u2019s performance in melee combat, while another warcaster may provide greater defense and longevity to his squad, encouraging a more methodical approach to victory. The interchangeability of warcasters in WARMACHINE: Tactics provides nearly infinite replayability and ensures that no two game experiences are ever the same.\nThe spearhead of the WARMACHINE fighting force is the warjack. Outfitted with an array of wicked weaponry, these imposing constructs of steel and iron are brought to life through a fusion of steam power and magic and controlled with deadly precision by the warcaster.\nA warcaster is in constant telepathic contact with her warjacks and can channel her focus through a warjack to boost the machine\u2019s combat abilities and enable it to execute devastating power attacks.\nThe relationship between warcasters and their warjacks is as close as the kinship between any brothers in arms. Over time, a warjack gains experience and may bond with its warcaster, taking on unique personality characteristics and developing new aptitudes.\nFleshing out the squad in WARMACHINE: Tactics are the warriors. Encompassing a wide range of disciplines and roles, warriors are selected for the fighting capability and supporting tactics they add to your squad based on how you want the force to operate on the battlefield.\nSquads in WARMACHINE: Tactics are small, elite units, and the warriors that comprise them are all heroes in their own right. The warriors bring with them a gallery of incredible weapons and abilities that can make a squad perform efficiently and effectively in any situation, from rapid assaults to stealthy hit-and-run maneuvers and everything in between.\nEach battle awards warriors, warjacks, and your warcaster with experience that unlocks new options for your squad, like tactical feats for the warriors or bonds between the warcaster and his warjacks that affect the performance of the warjacks in specific situations. This ever-growing list of options can be accessed during squad building to customize your force to your precise strategy.\nEach campaign will focus on a single novice warcaster character and allow you to play through the formative experience that evolves that character into a full-fledged warcaster, also playable in multiplayer.\nThe campaigns will deliver an extensive, story-driven experience. Although conducting your squad during campaign battles works exactly like combat in multiplayer, you\u2019ll also have the opportunity to choose how the central character develops her abilities through the course of her evolution.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics will ship with the \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d campaign, featuring Cygnar\u2019s Lt. Allison Jakes, a young journeyman warcaster trained as a duelist who is unexpectedly thrust into a position of great responsibility and leadership before she is ready. Under your command, Lt. Jakes will rise to the occasion in the face of horror and adversity in this harrowing story that will define her character forever in the ongoing saga of WARMACHINE.\nFuture campaigns will explore all the factions of WARMACHINE and feature a cast of characters uniquely designed for both the video game and the tabletop.\nOne of the most exciting aspects of WARMACHINE: Tactics is being able to play against your friends no matter where you are or what time it is. Online multiplayer will support both synchronous and asynchronous play, so you can compete head-to-head against a live opponent on the other side of the world, or you can play the asynchronous \u201cplay-by-mail\u201d mode, which allows both players to take turns at their leisure. If you don\u2019t have a friend available and still want to get your battle on, you\u2019ll be able to find an opponent with automatic matchmaking. And WARMACHINE: Tactics will offer casual, ranked, and tournament play to suit the style of every player.\nMultiplayer will be supported with regular releases of new maps, units, and even whole new factions. We want to ensure that your game experience is consistently fresh and offers new challenges every time you play.\nOur funding goal allows us to produce the single-player campaign and the multiplayer mode featuring playable forces with multiple warcasters, warjacks, and warriors for the Cygnar and Khador factions as well as some Cryx units that appear in the single-player campaign\u2014about three dozen units in all. We hope to get a whole lot more in there by achieving our stretch goals: the WARMACHINE tabletop game currently includes over 500 distinct warriors, warjacks, and warcasters, and our ambition is to bring as many of them into WARMACHINE: Tactics as possible. Our goal is to deliver regular expansions to the game in the form of campaign and themed bundles that will add new characters to your faction rosters and new stories to experience. Multiplayer maps will also be released regularly as free downloads, available to play by everyone.\nWe\u2019re not just going to show you some pretty pictures and expect that you\u2019ll back our project. We\u2019re going to entice you with what we hope are tantalizing offers you can\u2019t refuse!

This collaboration has allowed us time to bond, to learn to work effectively and efficiently, and to develop the trust required for two entities to undertake the challenge of bringing a dream to life. Individually, we bring vital expertise and resources to the WARMACHINE: Tactics project, and together we can achieve more than either of us ever could alone.\nPrivateer Press Interactive and WhiteMoon Dreams have made a considerable investment in time and money to pay for the initial development of WARMACHINE: Tactics. We accepted this risk so that we could present a project worthy of your confidence. Our belief is that by promoting this project on Kickstarter, we\u2019ll raise the profile of the game and expand awareness of WARMACHINE to an even wider audience that will help us achieve the funding necessary to produce the best version of WARMACHINE: Tactics possible.\nIn early 2013, Privateer Press Interactive and WhiteMoon Dreams officially joined forces to co-produce WARMACHINE: Tactics without the traditional support of a publisher.\nPrivateer Press Interactive was founded by Matt Wilson, owner and Chief Creative Officer of Privateer Press, Inc., the leading independent producer of tabletop miniatures games, best known for WARMACHINE, the game of steam-powered combat set in the fantastic world of the Iron Kingdoms. The mission of Privateer Press Interactive is to bring the tabletop gaming worlds of Privateer Press into the digital medium.\nWilson, who created WARMACHINE, has worked in the game industry for over 18 years as an artist, art director, writer, and award winning game designer. Prior to the twelve years of titles he has generated at Privateer Press, Wilson art directed and was the lead concept artist for Magic: the Gathering at Wizards of the Coast, as well as contributing artistically to Dungeons & Dragons, FASA\u2019s Battletech and Shadowrun lines, and AEG\u2019s Legend of the Five Rings, where he also created the world and developed the game.\nFor six years, Los Angeles-based WhiteMoon Dreams has worked with companies all over the world to bring their games to market and has been heavily involved in game technology R&D with partners including Disney, Intel, and Tencent. WhiteMoon Dreams is helmed by founder and CEO, Jay Koottarappallil, who has spent 18 years in the video game industry working on a range of titles, including the Myth, Ratchet & Clank and Medal of Honor series\u2019.\nKoottarappallil has assembled a team of design heavyweights including Creative Director Scott Campbell, one of the key minds behind the original Fallout, and Game Director Kevin Mack, who ushered Fear Effect and Medal of Honor. Projects at WhiteMoon Dreams are managed by Executive Producer Rusty Buchert, a revered icon for indies everywhere for his work at Sony on such titles as Flow, Flower and Journey as well as being responsible for some of Interplay\u2019s biggest games, including Descent, several Star Trek games, and many others.\nBy combining and sharing resources between our two companies, we are able to move rapidly and efficiently through the development process of video game production. WARMACHINE: Tactics is a true collaboration, and because of the constant communication and the fact that WARMACHINE'S creator, Matt Wilson is part of the game\u2019s design team, we are able to ensure the most faithful interpretation of the WARMACHINE setting possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA letter from Privateer Press Interactive founder, Matt Wilson:\n\nVideo games are complex undertakings. Everything presented on the screen has been painstakingly created by many disciplined professionals\u2014artists, animators, programmers, designers, and audio and effects engineers. Games are a meticulously orchestrated symphony that, when well presented, create unforgettable interactive experiences for those who play them. If the concert isn\u2019t well executed or conducted, the result is sluggish performance, a frustrating interface, low-quality art, or missed deadlines.\n\nThese variables make predicting the outcome uncertain, but every potential problem is surmountable with the proper application of time. Ideally preparation and experience will help avoid any pitfalls, and carefully planned contingencies will make it less disruptive when one is unavoidable. The most significant challenge in software development is simply delivering what\u2019s been promised on time.\n\nWhile it may appear Privateer Press has made some bold moves in the past, the truth is, we are risk averse. We make our decisions cautiously, with great consideration and calculation. Privateer Press Interactive, being composed of the same executive team, is no different. We know our greatest risk in this is the reputation of the Privateer Press name we have built over the past twelve years, and we have not undertaken this project lightly.\n\nThe decision to launch this project on Kickstarter came after nearly a year and a half of observation and analysis of other crowdfunded projects, and our decision to make this journey with WhiteMoon Dreams follows nearly five years of friendship and trust developed from our professional association. This is not a quickly conceived scheme, nor are we entrusting our beloved WARMACHINE to an unknown quantity. We have weighed the alternatives and considered the variables, and we\u2019re confident in our choice of development partners. But that\u2019s not enough. Just like you, we needed to see it in action.\n\nTo be sure of our decision, along with WhiteMoon Dreams we have funded several months of development on WARMACHINE: Tactics so we\u2019d be able to show you something credible and worthy of your pledge. We didn\u2019t want to just show concept art and offer lengthy descriptions of the game we envision; we set out to prove we have a team with the talent to bring this world to life. New progress is made on the game daily, and we\u2019ll be sharing that with you regularly throughout the campaign and right up until the product launch. We\u2019ve chosen a realistic funding goal that will support the required development, and we\u2019ve committed to a comfortable timeline with built-in contingencies should we encounter unavoidable delays. And we have planned our current funding beyond the end of this Kickstarter so that our team can remain focused on its continued development without skipping a beat.\n\nWhen we undertook this project, we also made a pledge: we will not launch another Kickstarter project until WARMACHINE: Tactics has released and has achieved all we have promised to deliver in the basic game as well as all the stretch goals we reach. We view this Kickstarter campaign as our one shot\u2014our single opportunity to create this game on our terms, and with your support.\n \nWe will honor your support above all else.\n\nNo one knows the future. When I met Jay Koottarappallil of WhiteMoon Dreams five years ago, neither of us imagined we\u2019d someday be making our WARMACHINE game this way. But now, more than ever, I am confident it will get done\u2014and I can\u2019t wait to play it with you.\n\nMatt Wilson\nOwner & CCO\nPrivateer Press, Inc.\nPrivateer Press Interactive, Inc.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "LATEST DEVELOPMENTS", "update_content": "Greetings WARMACHINE: Tactics Backers!\nWhiteMoon Dreams is forging ahead with the development of WARMACHINE: Tactics and has some great news about the latest patch, available today, and what's coming up.

It is a gift that will stay with him for the rest of his life.\nHaving grown up with inspiring movies like The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth,it has been been a dream of mine to create such imagery with hand/cable controlled puppets. This film will also utilize a bit of modern technology to better immerse viewers into the world.\nI need your help to make this movie come to life. If you are a fan of the Henson-Froud collaborations or perhaps just want to make a statement that puppet art is alive and desired, please consider a generous donation at one of the many pledge levels to help me reach my goal.\nBe a part of the magic.  Partner with me on this journey to make the dream into reality!\nMy name is Toby Froud and I am a sculptor, fabricator, and puppeteer.   My love of puppets began at a very young age after my first film role as Toby the baby from Labyrinth. Growing up with Brian and Wendy Froud for parents, a draw towards puppets and fantasy was natural.  I'm excited to continue the Henson-Froud collaboration working with Heather Henson of IBEX Puppetry.  Heather Henson is the executive producer for Lessons Learned. \nLessons Learned will be part of the Handmade Puppet Dreams series by IBEX Puppetry.  \nVisit the Handmade Puppet Dreams Facebook page for updates: https://www.facebook.com/HandmadePuppetDreams\nOver the years, I've had wonderful experiences working in the film making industry..  From getting my feet wet at Weta on the Chronicles of Narnia and King Kong to working for Laika on Paranorman and their new feature The Boxtrolls, I knew film making was for me. Along the way I've experimented with some short films, here are a couple for you to see:\nFumber and Ignatz - Two goblins philosophizing about... nothing! One of a series of quirky \"philosophies of Goblins\"shorts created in a tiny shed on Dartmoor in Devon, England\nThe Little Game - A man who finds a strange mechanical toy gets more than he bargained for.  An experiment in live action narrative.\nMy intention for Lessons Learned is to bring Froudian characters to life on screen with physical puppets, practical effects and very real props and sets.\nCurrently, I am building an amazing team of artists and performers that share the same passion for puppetry.  \nYour support will help us bring this vision to the screen by covering equipment costs, space rental, paying incredible artists to do what they do best, and affording the best post production and sound design to further immerse you in this fantastical world.\nStretch Goal #1 Reached!! The Granny will come to be!\nWorking Brian Froud Design for the Granny. (This is not the print reward, but give you an idea of the character)\nRewards\nSculpt for 8GB Hard Drive by Toby Froud\nCorrection on Reward: All DVD and Blu-Ray discs will be Region Free.\nGrandfather, Boy, and Digby- One of a kind character Maquettes sculpted by Toby Froud, approximately 8 inches tall.\nExclusive Kickstarter Gift - \"Goblin Thinker\" sculpted by Toby Froud and cast in plaster.  Approx. 11inches tall, 6inches wide, and 7 inches deep. \nLimited Edition,full size,Stand-in Digby Puppet -   Picture is of the actual character from the film. Stand in version will be similar construction with hard plastic cast head and hand mouth control only.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere will always be risks and challenges when making a live action puppet film. \n\nThe puppets themselves can take on a life of their own. Using the materials I need to bring the characters to life makes the puppets quite delicate. Foam latex can rip, rods can bend, cables can snap, tension can weaken, and unpredictable forces of nature can occur. Using the best quality materials I can afford, hiring professionals for the build, and experienced puppeteers can help reduce these risks. We may even do a little dance for Mother Nature.\n\nSchedule may also be a challenge while creating Lessons Learned. Working with schedules of the puppeteers, the technical crew needed, and visual effects, filming will need to be on a flexible timeline. We plan to be filming this fall and reach completion in February.\n\nAnother challenge will be the recording of sound for the film. The puppets' controls, puppeteering teams, and various effects will make live sound recording extremely difficult. We will need to pre-record all dialogue and then puppeteer to playback during production.\"\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Production Booklet", "update_content": "Hello My Wondeful Kickstarter Backers,\nOver the weekend I've emailed each of you, please make sure that you received that email as it contains details about your rewards.   \nFor those of you who have physical rewards coming your way, please message me through Kickstarter with any change of address details.\nThanks Kindly for your attention to this message.

Whether you\u2019re a fan of Pathfinder, 4th Edition D&D, or the excellent new 13th Age system, you\u2019ll be able to bring Thule to your gaming table. When our Kickstarter campaign closes, you\u2019ll receive a backer survey from Kickstarter. At that time, you\u2019ll be able to select the rules set you prefer for your Primeval Thule book.\nMany Kickstarter campaigns become quite complicated, and offer rewards and goodies that really don\u2019t have much to do with the actual creative project. We want to keep our campaign simple and straightforward\u2014time and effort we spend on making T-shirts is time and effort we\u2019re taking away from making the best RPG setting we can make. However, there are a few add-ons we think we should make available.\nTo make an add-on to your pledge, just add the value listed to your existing pledge. You\u2019ll be able to tell us how you want to use your total pledge during post-Kickstarter survey and communication.\nNEW!! +$50 Signed Todd Lockwood Cover Art Print\nAdd $50 to your pledge of $40 or more, and we'll also mail you a signed, 16\"x24\" (~40x60cm), full-color print of the Primeval Thule cover art by Todd Lockwood. This print will ship separately, and shipping is included to any address in the US, Canada, or Mexico. Please add $15 for shipping outside North America.\n+$15/+$35 Active Duty Military Upgrade\nAdd  $15 to your Primeval Thule Setting Book or $35 to your Deluxe Primeval Thule Setting Book reward level, and we\u2019ll upgrade your setting book to the next trim level. This is a savings of $10 or $20 for our active duty armed forces personnel to say thank you for your service. We'll want to verify your status, either through a base, APO or FPO mailing address, appropriate .mil email address, or via the dmdc.osd.mil site.\n+$10 Primeval Thule Soundtrack\nAdd $10 to your pledge and get the following 4 tracks from the Ambient Environments soundtrack by Blue Moon Studios: moaning caverns, the tunnels deep, the dark forest, and frozen tundra.\n+$15 PDF, Second Copy of Digital Thule (Obsolete)\nOriginally intended to allow you to pick up a PDF for a second system, this add-on is now obsolete, as we are now providing all three versions of the PDF to backers whose reward originally included a PDF for only one game system.\n+$40 Upgrade Deluxe to Premium\nFor backers at the Merchant Prince or Dungeon Builder pledge levels only, add $40 to your pledge to upgrade to a premium leatherbound book.\n+$50 Basic Book, Second Copy\nIf you want a second copy of the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting, we\u2019ll be happy to send it to you. Just add $50 to your pledge of $60 or more. Get a spare copy to share around the table, or buy Thule in a second rule set (you can tell us which rules sets you want in the post-Kickstarter survey). Limit 2 of this add-on per backer.\n+$75 Deluxe Book, Second Copy\nIf you want a second copy of the Deluxe Primeval Thule Campaign Setting book (including the DM screen and additional maps that come with it, of course), add $75 to your pledge of $80 or more. You can tell us which rules set or sets you want in the post-Kickstarter survey. Limit 2 of this add-on per backer.\n+$125 Premium Book, Second Copy\nIf you want an additional copy of the premium leatherbound Primeval Thule Campaign Setting book and its accessories, just add $125 to your pledge of $125 or more. You\u2019ll be able to choose the rules set or sets you want in the backer survey later. Limit 2 of this add-on per backer.\nIf we receive contributions beyond our target number, we\u2019ll be able to offer several exciting stretch goal rewards for our contributors. Most of these apply to ALL reward levels\u2014by helping us to reach our stretch goals, you\u2019re making the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting bigger and better for yourself, and everybody else!\nThat\u2019s pretty key, so we\u2019ll say it again: Your Primeval Thule book gets bigger and better as more people back us. Tell your friends!\nAt $70,000,  the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting book will include an adventure by the world-renowned creator of the Forgotten Realms, Ed Greenwood! In addition, the Accursed Trio - Ross Watson, John Dunn, and Jason Marker - the designers behind the upcoming Accursed: A Savage Worlds RPG Setting, are generously providing a bonus PDF adventure to our Digital Thule bundle if we reach this goal.\nAt $80,000, we will increase the size of the book to 288 pages. With the additional page count we\u2019ll include more character narratives, more monsters, and an adventure by noted Pathfinder and 4th Edition designer Owen Stephens.\nAt $90,000, we\u2019ll continue to expand the book by another 16 pages. In addition, we\u2019ll add an additional poster map to the Deluxe and Premium editions\u2014a tactical map gridded in 1-inch squares depicting a key adventure locale from the setting book.\nAt $100,000, we\u2019ll bring the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting book to a full 320 pages, including additional character origins, terrifying new monsters, and an adventure by Pathfinder RPG lead designer Jason Bulmahn.\nAnd if more support is forthcoming, we\u2019ll keep adding content and awesome game accessories to your Primeval Thule experience!\nWe\u2019re a brand-new game publishing company formed by three longtime RPG industry professionals. We\u2019re all Wizards of the Coast veterans, and we worked and played together for years on 3rd and 4th Edition D&D. We have longstanding relationships with some of the top talent in the RPG biz, and we\u2019re assembling a dream team to make Primeval Thule a reality.  Here are some of the key players:\nRich Baker is a best-selling author and award-winning game designer. He was one of the core designers of 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons, and wrote or contributed to scores of D&D adventures and sourcebooks in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Edition. You may know him from the Birthright Campaign Setting, the Alternity Science Fiction Roleplaying Game, Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords, and the 4th Edition Dark Sun Campaign Setting.\nDavid Noonan counts more than 50 3rd edition, 4th edition, and Pathfinder products among his credits. He was also the lead writer for the TERA MMORPG and consults with video game companies on script and narrative design issues.\nStephen Schubert worked on more than 50 3rd edition and 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons products as a designer/developer, and was a core developer on the D&D Miniatures Game team. He has since branched out into digital games.\nRenowned fantasy artist Todd Lockwood, our cover artist, is known for bringing R.A. Salvatore\u2019s Drizzt Do\u2019Urden to life on numerous novel covers, and was the illustrator who reinvented the dragons of D&D for 3rd Edition.\nChristopher West is our lead cartographer. His credits include poster maps for the Star Wars Miniatures game, the Maps of Mystery feature in Dungeon magazine, and the Numenera Roleplaying Game.\nOur stretch goal designers include some of the best-known writers in the RPG business. The legendary Ed Greenwood is the creator of the Forgotten Realms setting and hundreds of memorable characters, most notably Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale. Owen Stephens is a fellow Wizards of the Coast veteran and a Pathfinder RPG contributor who worked on the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. Jason Bulmahn is the lead designer for the Pathfinder RPG. You can\u2019t find better writers and designers!\nOur production expert is Wizards of the Coast veteran Larry Weiner, who\u2019s forgotten more about the global printing business than most people will ever know. He\u2019s the reason we can deliver a top-notch product like Primeval Thule at an affordable price. Finally, talented newcomers Justin Mayhew and Klaus Pillon are the concept artists who created the images you see on this Kickstarter page, and our logos are the work of graphic artist Mackenzie Schubert of Strip Search fame.

It is the story of a young man, worn by his family's values, who moves to the city in search of an escape only to find more of the same. But then something happens to him that forever changes his perception of the world around him and the so-called reality that our society instills in us. As he becomes more and more consumed by this alternate reality, he gets even more distanced from everything and everyone he used to know. This ends up forcing him to make a choice as well as force others to push the limits within their own minds and find out just how much they're willing to believe.\nMY STORY: 4 years ago I had the idea for this story and wrote the first draft of the script for my screenwriting class at Emerson College. Coming from a rural home surrounded by forest and moving to a city where all of the trees I was used to were suddenly swapped out for skyscrapers was an intense change, but at the same time a fascinating contrast. And as I spent more and more time in the city I also started to see the stark differences between the two extreme ends of the humanity spectrum and the endless possibilities a space filled with so many people and so many minds could have. These contrasts within environments, societies, and especially within a person's mind are concepts that fueled the creation of this story and inspired two of the major themes: perspective and possibility. Knowing that this was a project I wanted to personally take on and produce and direct myself, it came down to a matter of how and most importantly when. NOW, many revisions and test shoots later with the right camera and equipment available and an awesome crew at my side, the time has come! But in order to bring this dream of mine to the screen I'm going to need your help.\nHOW YOU CAN HELP: I wrote this story with the intent to keep production as simple as possible. I wanted to make a film that had strong characters and a strong message without the need for a gigantic budget and intense production design and special effects. And I'm incredibly fortunate to have an amazingly talented team of crew and actors who have faith in the project and are going to be devoting all of their time and energy for free. HOWEVER, in order to keep up with the rapid technological advances of the film world and to give the story a professional and truly cinematic look we're going to need much more than what we personally own. To make this film look the part, my Cinematographer Steve DiCasa and I will need to rent a VERY expensive camera and other professional film equipment that we'll only be able to do with the right budget. \nSo please check out what we have to offer over on the right hand side of this page and if you're able to donate anything at all we would be eternally grateful! If we reach this goal it'll be because of YOU, and I'll be able to show you the film I imagined when I started writing it 4 years ago.\nWe truly appreciate you taking the time to read and hear about our project.

Forget what you know about the vampire genre. Fang hunts the hunters. \"FANG\" is full of ghouls, gunplay and gore. Fang is an action horror comic of redemption, revenge and self discovery. It's John Woo's the Killer meets Blade with a bit of Golden Child and Big Trouble in Little China thrown in for good measure. In Vampire lore, there's a legend of an assassin whose sole purpose is to murder vampire hunters. He\u2019s sometimes called the Weeping Reaper or the Great Reluctant Evil. Our story centers on \"Lo Fang\", the chief assassin of the Kiang-Shi (Chinese Vampire) Empire. Dressed in white designer suits and trench coat, Fang is as stylish as he is deadly. Armed with a pair of AR-90 hand cannons and a Chinese broad sword, he travels the world stalking vampire hunters under the reign of the Kiang-Shi Empress.\nIn his natural life, Lo Fang was a monk who fought against the Kiang Shi* Infestation of China. Using his mastership of Kung Fu, he and his monks were able to repel the undead onslaught. This greatly angered the Kiang-Shi empress whose sole desire was to rule the world of man. She had Fang captured, and personally turned him into one of her kind. Upon awakening, Fang found that his body had been covered with a tattoo resembling the Vampire Empress. With the mystical tattoo etched in his skin Fang was now under the Empress' complete control. Fang became her chief assassin, using the prowess he once used to destroy the Kiang-Shi to now dispose of Vampire Hunters around the world. Though he was Kiang-Shi, and the consumption of blood was essential to his survival, Fang begged to never force him to feed upon an unarmed or innocent victim. The empress granted his wish, and thus The Legend of the Weeping Reaper was born.\nAfter a millennia of waiting, as prophesied, a weapon capable of tipping the balance has appeared. In an ashram in California, monks guard the one thing capable of halting the Kiang-Shi Empress\u2019s conquest of Earth. She assigns Fang the task of finding the weapon and destroying it. Fang regrettably undergoes his mission.\nFang embarks on his mission to find the weapon, though the \"weapon\" may not be what he, or anyone else, imagined.\nKicktraq.

As creators, and fans of the same types of comics and films, we quickly became friends.  I eventually moved to Atlanta from New York where David was based.  We became roommates, and almost immediately began kicking ideas around.  Through this process, David told me a story about a story he started but never went anywhere with.  It needed an artist to come to life.  I looked at it, and immediately I knew this was the project for me.  Right away, I started on designs, and we kicked around some more ideas and tightened the story.  I designed a logo, started working on pages, and then I had to find work to pay bills, 'cause that's important. \nWho am I?:\nGustavo Vazquez is an artist, producer, actor and traveler raised in Brooklyn who loves the art of storytelling. A self-taught illustrator, he started his career as a comic book artist for Marvel, DC and other comic book companies, as well as drawing storyboards for animation, commercials and music videos. He continues to work as an illustrator and amateur photographer, while also creating and developing projects for Film and Television. Django is also a fan of WWE professional wrestling.\nand David?:\nDavid Atchison is a freelance writer & producer whose work has appeared in a variety of mediums. He co-created the Occult Crimes Taskforce with actress Rosario Dawson and illustrator Tony Shasteen. The OCT is currently in development for television with Valhalla Entertainment and the A&E Network. He penned the Method Man Graphic Novel for the Hip Hop mainstay and Grand Central Publishing. Atchison also co-wrote True Believer, a back door pilot for NBC/ Universal's SyFy Channel. Other multimedia projects include Singularity for Activision Games and the Warriors Graphic Novel Adaptation for Paramount Pictures/ Dabel Brothers Pro. In 2010, Atchison accepted a position with the 20th Century Fox Film Entertainment Story Department where he helps develop films.\nThere's also our colorist, Ross Campbell:\nRoss A. Campbell is a debuting comic book colorist born in Scotland and educated in France. Currently working on Dynamite's ongoing comic book adaptation of Paizo's award-winning RPG Pathfinder, he also helps out with Jim Zub's Skullkickers and jumps on board any project Gus throws his way. Other clients of notable repute are Image Comics and Udon. Also a passable all-round artist, he dabbles in full illustration, traditional and digital for a hobby and is also a budding musician. Socially awkward unless drunk.\nNow, some more about Fang...\nLogo in B&W\nFang sketches\nSome more Fang sketches. I like to work out the character before I start a story. How he moves, acts, etc...\nSketches for sword techniques\nOriginal Page 2 breakdowns\nOriginal Page 3 breakdowns\nOriginal Page 4 breakdowns\n\n\nFang got put to the side for a while.  Life happened, I got some other work that could pay the bills, and eventually Fang turned into something akin to a cold case file.  Something that had to sit for a while until we (really, me) had the time to come back to it.   I moved to CA, and after a few unsuccessful tries to wake Fang up from his slumber, back it went into the file.  Life went on while Fang slept.\nThat is, until a few months ago.  I was going through some paperwork, and came across a couple of old drawings for a few cover ideas I had for Fang.  That perked me up a little.  I had been stagnant in my drawing, and was a little tired of working for other people.  I decided to go through all my papers and artwork, and dig up every little thing I had done for Fang, and breathe some fresh life into it.  I started by reworking a short story I had asked David to write a couple years back to introduce the character.  I originally wanted to showcase this story at conventions, and get some interest back into it.\nCover ideas\n\n\nI figured I had something, as some old friends I ran into started asking about Fang.  \"Hey, man.  Whatever happened to that vampire project you were working on?\".  This reignited the flame, and confirmed that there was still interest in a cool, different vampire story.  It was time to reawaken the Weeping Reaper! \nSo, without telling anyone, including David, I started working on some pages and designs again.  I need to really get back into doing this, for real this time, with the idea that I was going to get it done, no matter what.  This was my chance to really do something I was passionate about, and show the world, (or at least a few hundred comic book fans) what I was about.  What I had trained this twenty-plus years for.  I want to release Fang out into the world and wreak some havoc!  And here we are.\n\nSo, there you have it.  The story behind the story.  Now, let's get to the good stuff...\nFang character design\nThe Brute character design\nKiang Shi Empress character design color.\nPage 1 Prologue Color\nPrologue Page 2 B&W\nPrologue Page 3 B&W\nPrologue Page 4 B&W\nA page from the Marvel Universe Update books.\nA couple of pages from my What If? Spider-Man Back in Black issue\nCovers from my first book Sunfire and big hero 6, coming out next year as an animated Marvel film!\nThe Goal:\nThe nitty gritty.  The script is finished, designs are done, and the graphic novel is about a third of the way sketched out, but there's still along way to go to get this book done and into your hands.  As this campaign is going, I am trying to finish sketching out the rest of the pages so that when the campaign is just about done, I can get to drawing the pages right away. \nI've set upon this journey several times now, but have always been stopped in my tracks due to a lack of funding.  I end up stopping production to do other jobs and by the time I'm done, the momentum is gone.  I'm trying to end that trend.  It's also gone through several phases of design and ideas on how to make this book a different experience than most comics out there.  I've finally figured it out.  What I need now is the support of fans and friends (and anyone else who is interested in breathing life into a fun project) to make sure I can create the art for the book and get it out and printed.  If I can achieve my Kickstarter goal, I will be able to share this epic story with whoever is interested and invested. This is a project that's been years in the making, and I am so proud to finally have the opportunity to share it with you.\n\nThat's where Kickstarter, and you, come in!  I know I'm asking a lot by asking you to spend your hard earned money on something that isn't yet tangible.  What you're buying into is a dream and a promise.  A dream that I've had for many years now.  To work on my very own project, on a character I own and helped develop.  This is your chance to invest in something that will give back to the creators.  The dream of the every man.  I also said you were buying into a promise.  The promise is to get the best work I've ever produced in my long career.  I strive to get better and better each time I work, but this time I've got a little extra passion in this project.  I've worked on making it the best I can make it, and I feel at this point that I've either got to do it, or I've got to do something else.  And I really want to do this.\n\nKickstarter has created a way for me to work on my dream project, and get the interest of people who really want to see it.  Real investors.  Because you're invested in the project from the ground up, and you really do want to see your investment come to fruition.  It allows creators, like me, to be able to work on the project at hand, and not be distracted by outside influences.  If this project is successfully funded, the money has to come upfront.  It keeps me, the creativity, and the book going.  However, and I hate to bring this up, if I don't make my goal, you get your money back, I get nothing, and it's back to the drawing board.\nINCENTIVES:\nPlease note.  Some of the incentives are dated April and May of 2014.  Issues will be released on approximated dates as follows. \nIssue #1 as of October 2013\nIssue #2 as of January 2014\nIssue #3 as of April 2014.  \nThe graphic novel will be released in May of 2014.                           (Those who purchase the graphic novel will receive PDF copies of the individual issues as they are released in print.  There are extras being printed in the collected version that will not appear in the single issues.)\nPrints, t-shirts, coffee mugs, etc, will be available in August 2013 when the campaign is over and all orders are completed.\nThose orders that contain multiple items released on different dates, please be patient.  If you would like to receive items when they are released, you may be asked to pay extra shipping, unless you can wait until all items are shipped together.\nGraphic Novel (Note: Not a view of final product)\nSome of the incentives. (Note: Not an image of the final product!)\nSHIPPING:\nShipping charges for larger items such as prints, coffee mugs, t-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, please consult the following when paying for shipping.\nUS (DOMESTIC):\n$10 FOR ALL ORDERS ABOVE THE $25 TIER\n$20 FOR ALL ORDERS ABOVE THE $50 TIER\nINTERNATIONAL FEDEX ORDERS:\nNORTH AMERICA/CANADA/MEXICO: $30\nUK/AUSTRALIA: $40\nSOUTH AMERICA/AFRICA/ASIA $60\nShipping rates by color code", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've tried to set my goal at a realistic amount to make this project happen. Now I just need to hit that goal. \n\nWondering where that money will go? Well, as I said, part of it will help me have enough capitol to draw the book, and pay the colorist and letterer to bring my lines to life. Plus, I'm going to need to get those incentives made for you. Printing costs, as well, for the limited run of books I'm going to make for this campaign. \n\nUpon first sight, $40,000 seems like a lot of money. However, Kickstarter campaigns are not straight donations and in reality a campaign costs a lot of time and money to fulfill rewards ordered and manage correspondance. So only part of the money asked for actually goes towards creative production of the book. \n\nProduction costs- I am pretty much the entire creative team for the book, and if you break down what funding I'd get for the 96+ pages of full production work I'd create, the rates break down to less than I would get paid elsewhere. Not including funding for the time to adapt, letter, design, create promotional images, covers, pin ups, take care of the Kickstarter, or work on the sketchbook. In short; I am not becoming rich, by any means, with this campaign. My only intent is to be able to work on FANG, and be able to survive through the process!\n\nKickstarter/Amazon Fees - Roughly 8%-10% of final funding\n\nTaxes - self employed rates apply\n\nProduction of books - These rates vary depending on amount ordered, but takes up a nice chunk of funds\n\nShipping & shipping supply - Another large chunk, depending on amount shipped\n\nBuffer Amount - This should be included in ANY Kickstarter. This includes money aside for dropped pledges, lost books, refund requests, and any errors and miscalculations.\n\n\nAlso, so that you know where I am in the project, I will be posting regular updates here on Kickstarter, and on a Facebook page I've started up specifically for this project. I'll definitely do some write-up updates, post pictures and art, and I will try to do some more videos as I go along. As I do this, I will also be handling the production process, so that when the book is complete, I can get it to you as soon as possible. You will get to be a part of this process and see the magic happen! Should I surpass my goal, depending on the amount, I will add some more incentives, exclusive to this campaign and its investors. \n\nI am focused on Issue 1 of Fang right now because I don't want to keep backers waiting for over a year for the whole series to be completed before they receive their reward. I will keep everyone updated as each issue is finished and the next one started.\n\n\nHow Kickstarter Works...\n\nKickstarter is unlike regular online ordering experiences in that you are not just buying an item for precise arrival, you are joining me in my personal adventure to complete this project. You'll be with me for both the victories as well as the bumps and difficulties, all culminating in receiving the final product, which I will have given so much to achieve. Kickstarter is more about supporting ideas, people, and projects than it is to receive an item right away. And so you're aware of everything before you join me (and FANG) on this adventure!\n\nStep 1. Create a Kickstarter account, and determine payment method\n\nStep 2. Decide which Reward you'd like, taking special note of any shipping estimates.\n\nStep 3. Wait and see what happens! If the campaign is successful by TBA, then your card will be charged and your reward is secured. If the campaign is unsuccessful, then your card will NOT be charged.\n\nStep 4. (optional ;) ) If you would really like to see this project succeed, then the most helpful thing you could do is help spread the word! Tweets, facebook posts, blog posts, whatever you want to do to help\u2026 I would eternally appreciate it!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Gustavo (Django) Vazquez\nFirst created \u00b7 35 backed\nGUSTAVO (Django) VAZQUEZ Gustavo Vazquez is an artist, producer, actor and traveler raised in Brooklyn who loves the art of...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Thank you for your support.", "update_content": "I just wanted to take a moment and thank all the people who supported, shared, and pledged on my campaign.\nIt was a very hard task to undertake alone, and I have to figure out if I'm going to try and go this route again for Fang.\nI'm still doing my book, but obviously, it's going to take a longer time to do at this point."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Last update?", "update_content": "Well, folks, this might be it for this campaign.

Look on the download page of the website for the Diamond constraint (*.lpf) file. This is one of the files required for compiling the FPGA code. It maps the logical name of each input/output function to its physical pin number. Also included are comments which identify the connector position for each pin.\nUPDATE 7. The first Verilog file is now available on the trifdev.com web site. It is used to compile the I/O expander code loaded into the Trifdev FPGA board.\nSo what's it for?\nArduino boards are great, but sometimes you need more I/O pins, or maybe there is some time critical function which simply isn't achievable in software. This is where you need a FPGA (read on if you don't know what this is), but they have a reputation of being difficult to use, expensive and generally troublesome.\nSo how does this board solve the problem?\nThis is where this project can help. The board is supplied ready loaded with a simple I/O expander, which works straight out of the box to give you 58 more I/O pins. No FPGA programming required! Below is an example of the Arduino code needed to set the value of some FPGA I/O pins. Simple!\nBut it does more!\nWhen you have tried the pre-loaded FPGA code, you could use it as a basis to develop your own functions, using FREE design software direct from the FPGA manufacturer. Maybe re-allocate the I/O pins, or add some extra logic to pre-process the incoming data, or include logic for controlling a specific device.\nArduino I2C code\nGive me some example applications!\nComplex I/O decoders\nReplace a whole collection of simple gates\nMake a motor controller\nAdd specialised or extra UARTs\nDesign your own CPU\nImplement fast algoithms, e.g. FFT\nAnd reprogram it time and time again\nWhat is an \"FPGA\" anyway?\nIt stands for Field Programmable Gate Array. It is an integrated circuit which has a large number of very simple hardware functional blocks. When programmed, these blocks are interconnected, inside the device, to make up an electronic circuit.To create these interconnections, you use a programming language specially designed for this type of device. There are two such languages in common use, VHDL and Verilog. They both do much the same thing, and both are supported by TRIFDEV. The most important difference between these languages and a software language such as \"C\", or Arduino sketches, is that you are programming the hardware directly, by connecting gates, flip-flops, memory and so on. So when you read the code, it doesn't follow one step after another, but everything happens simultaneously. This is what makes FPGA designs so powerful.\nBut I don't understand how to write FPGA code!\nWe will show you how to download and run the software, and give some ready-made examples. All our code will be made available for you to use, and we will provide tutorials to explain how to modify it. It's always easier to start with something which works and adapt it, rather than starting from scratch. We don't pretend to be experts in VHDL or Verilog and our tutorials will be simple, but if you need more advanced information we will point you towards the many examples available on the web for you to gain a deeper understanding.\nFor some simple examples of VHDL code, see http://downloadsourcecodes.com/vhdl\nGive me details!\nThe FPGA we use is a MACHXO2-1200, which has 1280 Look-Up-Tables (LUTs) so is capable of running quite complex functions. There are several built-in functions, including a programmable oscillator with PLL (0.024 \u2013 400 MHz), I2C and SPI ports and a timer/counter. There is user RAM (64k bits) and user Flash (64k bits) to store variables and fixed parameters. All these are in addition to the LUTs. If you are a real hardware techie, there is logic analyser code which lets you see exactly what is going on inside the FPGA.\nThe board includes two push buttons and five LEDs, preconnected to the FPGA, which are useful for simple tests and for checking that the FPGA code is working. There are three extra 0.1\" pitch sockets on the board, connected to free pins on the FPGA. The first has 21 I/O pins and 4 ground pins. The second connector has13 I/O pins alternating with ground pins for high speed signals. The third connector has 24 I/O pins. The standard Arduino connector holes are present, but the only connections are for power and the I2C bus, so this board does not interfere with any other shields.\nThe FPGA runs at 3.3v, so there is a voltage regulator on board. The power source can be either from the host Arduino, or from a USB connection, or from any other 5v supply. If the board is used stand-alone, it can supply 5v or 3.3v to other devices you may wish to connect, subject to maximum current limits of course.\nThe FPGA is programmed via a simple USB cable, using the free software downloadable from Lattice, the FPGA manufacturer.\nThere are more technical details on our web site www.trifdev.com .\nThe pre-production bare pcb\nCan I connect it to my Raspberry PI?\nYes, in principle you can connect it to almost any CPU. TRIFDEV has a standard I2C slave port, so you can easily connect it to any system which supports the I2C protocol. Even if the CPU doesn't directly support I2C, you can use a software \"bit banging\" method. It's beyond the scope of our tutorials, but a quick web search will provide examples.\nOf course, the FPGA is re-programmable, so you could change it to incorporate one or more UART modules to implement serial ports if I2C is not convenient.\nWhat else can it do?\nThis design has multiple possibilities:\nUse it as delivered to add extra input and output capability to an Arduino, or any other device with a I2C port. Just connect and go.\nRe-program it to include your own special functions. The programming software is a free download from Lattice, and all you need to add is a standard USB cable. No programming hardware required!\nUse it stand-alone, no processor needed. You can also add Arduino shields to enhance its function.\nUse it as a development platform as a quick start to your own design.\nOr as an educational tool.\nJust remember that the FPGA is a 3.3v device; connecting its I/O pins to 5v without suitable protection may damage it.\nAll this is too simple, I'm a power FPGA user!\nHow about programming the FPGA to perform the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm, or implement your own CPU design, or a specialised UART? It might look simple, but you can use this board to develop highly complex functions.\nDo you have prototypes yet?\nA first prototype is already working, with simple VHDL code examples, both as a stand-alone board and controlled from an Arduino via the I2C port.\nThe pre-production batch is being tested right now.\nThe aim of this project is to finalise the production version of the board, and introduce it to potential users.\nThe first prototype connected to an Arduino\nWill you release the hardware design?\nYes, if this Kickstarter project is fully funded, we will release the circuit diagrams and pcb layout. We have used DesignSpark for this project, as this is a free schematic capture and pcb layout package, supported by RS. (See http://www.designspark.com/ for further information.) So anyone can take our design and tailor it to suit their needs.\nThe pre-production board DesignSpark layout\nOur production plan.\nTRIFDEV will be made in the UK. That is to say that the final assembly onto the pcb will be done in the UK. As with any electronic device, the individual components will be sourced from various parts of the world.\nFirst protoype build and test:                  Completed May 2013.\nSecond prototypes and pre-production batch:  In progress\nKickstarter launch:                                             mid June 2013\nKickstarter end:                                                 mid July 2013\nOrder production batch:                                    end July 2013\nDespatch early-bird rewards:                            early August 2013\nReceive and test production batch:                   end August 2013\nDeliver all other rewards:                                   September 2013\nHow do I get one?\nPlease become a backer!

Like many similar small presses, we don't really make a profit but publish books out of sheer enthusiasm, funding ourselves through other means.\n\nBack in December 2009, we released our first publication: Coin Opera, a pocket-sized anthology of poems based on computer games - shape-poems imitating the look of Tetris and Space Invaders, sonnets on Streetfighter characters, a break-up poem in the voice of GLaDOS, odes to Wolfenstein and Paradroid, and more besides. The conceit of the book was that Dr Fulminare, Sidekick's alchemically-inclined editor, had trapped the poets in a 'brutal simulator' as part of an experiment. This is what it looked like:\nFrom early 2011, we've been slowly gathering more and more poems by a wider array of writers, and are now poised to publish Coin Opera 2: Fulminare's Revenge, a much bigger sequel featuring the work of over 30 contributors, as well as 2-player poems mimicking the rules of certain gaming genres, super-sized boss poems, an introduction that explores the strange similarities between the two mediums, and a foreword by games journalist and comic writer Kieron Gillen.\nThe subject matter covers popular gaming franchises, as well as classics of the various eras, and even the odd browser game.  \nContributing poets include:\nJoe Dunthorne, award-winning author of Submarine.\nChrissy Williams, former NGamer journalist and author of Flying Into The Bear (Happenstance, 2013).\nRoss Sutherland, a Times Literary Star of the Year, whose numerous shows and tours include The Three Stigmata of Pacman, and whose free e-pamphlet of Streetfighter sonnets was published by Penned in the Margins in 2011.\nLuke Kennard, Forward Prize nominated author of four full poetry collections and a novella, Holophin, the latter of which just won a Saboteur Award.\nPosie Rider, feminist writer and academic and author of City Break Weekend Songs (Critical Documents, 2011).\nDan Simpson, resident poet at the GEEK 2013 gaming expo who is touring his Pacman-inspred show, We Are All Orange Ghosts, this summer.\nNathan Penlington, Welsh poet, magician and raconteur, currently touring Choose Your Own Documentary, a show based on multiple choice gamebooks.\nAbigail Parry, an Eric Gregory Award winning poet who was also shortlisted for the Manchester Poetry Prize in 2012.\nThat editor is a spy! Jon & Kirsty at Geek 2013 (Photo by Andrew Dean @awdean1)\nThe cost of printing a first run with a proper litho printer on sexy Swedish Munken paper comes in at around \u00a33,000, and we're looking to crowdfund about half of that amount, paying the rest ourselves.\nThe reward tiers operate as follows: you can fund us any amount you like. If you hit the \u00a36 mark, we'll email you a pdf edition of the book. Please note that this won't be in .mobi or .epub format. You'll still be able to read it on most e-reader devices but it will appear as a series of images!\n\nIf you hit the \u00a312 mark, you're essentially preordering the normal edition of the book, the one that we'll be trying to get stocked in bookshops.\nAt \u00a318, you'll be rewarded with a deluxe edition, which includes not one but two bonus booklets. Super Treasure Arcade is an updated and redesigned version of Treasure Arcade, an e-pamphlet editor Jon Stone wrote for 2011's National Poetry Day. It features a short poem for one game from every year since 1971, when Galaxy Game, the first coin-operated video game, was installed at Stanford University in the US. All are written in a poetic form of the author's invention, so absurdly complex that he'd forgotten half the rules when we went back to add two new poems for the Coin Opera 2 edition.\nThe second pamphlet packaged with the deluxe edition is Core Samples, a book of procedurally generated poems based around the idea of coring out a slice of earth from inside particular games. Does Grim Fandango's soil harbour demon beaver bones? Are there entire strata of liquorice and cake in Zool: Ninja of the Nth Dimension? Every single copy of this pamphlet will be unique, since the poems are generated by a javascript code run through a browser, then copied into the InDesign file before the pages are printed. We'll be printing and stab-binding these ourselves.\n\nAt \u00a325, the reward includes an A2 poster of all the contributing poets rendered as sprites in the style of Samurai Shodown on the NeoGeo Pocket Colour. This artwork also features in the book, and looks a little something like this:\nYes, the 'weapons' include a sand timer, a dinosaur skull and Shao Kahn's hammer.\nFinally, for \u00a340 you'll get everything we've mentioned so far, as well as a custom poem written by one of the editors, based around a computer game of your choosing. We'll publish these on our website as well as sending you a print copy.\nHere's a sample poem by Matt Haigh to whet your appetites:\nThe Thirteenth Colossus\nDon\u2019t hate me for this \u2013 for my bloodied fists\ncaught up in your pelt\u2019s oasis,\nthighs buried in stalactites of stubble,\nscuffed by horns of bone like missiles.\nMy elbows and toes grapple\nwith your colossal, questing bulk, dappled\nby strange growths. I grope for pulleys and ropes,\nwicker and wood lodged in your spine;\ngrope in the colosseum of your head\nsporting pillared teeth and smashed masonry.\nThe thrum and chug of you, liquid muscle\nbetween my legs, twisted thickets of gristle,\nthe whir of engines, the heart\u2019s hydraulic pistons,\nthe accordion bellows of your cavernous lungs,\neach blasted breath a mournful waltz \u2013 I feel it all.\nFossil of drowned worlds, fossil of the sky,\nyou twist ribbon-like between floating hills,\nplayful in your zigzagging as a box kite.\nFrom this height I can taste everything:\nthe sea\u2019s cerulean blue hot as menthol,\nthe musk of your tough leatherette, old as earth.\nI crawl over the crenulated battlements\nof your body, flat on my belly, through\nhessian tufts of tubers, frozen nodules;\nacross your mottled, granite-flecked hide\npocked with whiskers like sticks of gelignite.\nYour back is a city whittled to ruin\nand I the tourist who will infect and spoil you.\nDon\u2019t hate me for the blade I slip into your sinew\nthen crack and twist as if disembowelling crayfish.\nEvery faucet of steaming black blood\nsplatters my cheeks, my tunic, my horned helmet \u2013\nand I know now how David felt, the spire of you\nbuckled, a brace of rabbits broken-necked,\nas you descend from your former majesty,\nthe cloud fortress of each eye dispersing.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've gathered together all of the poems we need and have a quote from the printer we want to use.

Rest assured we've spent enough time and love on this now to see it through.\n\nIn the pleasant and unlikely event that we're funded for more than we've asked for, we'll first look into the possibility of a larger print run. As we're using traditional litho printing, the more we print, the better value we get, and the better value we get, the more copies we can afford to send out to journalists for publicity purposes, which in turn helps with sales.

I think they speak volumes above anything I can say, though I will say a lot nonetheless ;)\nNow then;\nHeroic is the first story arc from Zenith comics, a brand new comic line and a brand new universe. It's just the first part in a grand design to bring the HEROICS back to \"superheroics\". I grew up on comics, I love comics, and I want to make the kind of comics I want to read and bring a whole new world along with it. Zenith exists to make the best comics possible, because I want to read the best comics possible. And you do too.  \nHeroes who are actually heroes. Heroes who inspire. Bigger than life, and with actual ideals. I am a big fan of the Bronze Age of comics - 1975-1985 in particular. I want to draw from that inspiration, but with a modern eye. I want heroes who inspire, but not ones who are cardboard cut outs of truth and justice. Icons, who stand for something, just like real people often stand for something. I reject that \"realistic\" means things are grim, humorless, and self-serving. There are people being heroic every day, people fighting for ideals every day. There is room for realistic people in fantastic situations. We used to write those stories. Zenith is going to write them again.\nHEROIC kicks off the Zenith Comics line and the Zenith Comics universe. It's the story of a young woman known only as Number 32, who's a vital piece in a much larger game, and that's all I can tell you without ruining it. It's going to be told in two 6-issue arcs, and by the end of it, you'll be introduced to a whole new world of heroes and villains.\nIssue 1. The script is written, the creative team is on board. We need funds to get the art done and the printers rolling. IF we hit our goal, Issue 1 goes up. Everything past our goal is focused on getting issues 2-6 started. Fund us and you're bringing a comic to the printed page and launching a new universe. I've got a story to tell, and this is just the beginning. Once the ball is rolling, I've got a whole universe to explore. HEROIC isn't the only story I've got to tell, and I'm not even the only writer Zenith will ever feature. Everything past our goal is going to make sure Zenith Comics grows and expands.\nArt, Colors & Lettering (including cover)= $4640\nPrint (500 copies) = $1648\nShipping (500 copies) = $3000\n\nSubtotal = $9288\n\nAmazon/KS Fees 10% = $10,217\nI've got a crew of dedicated and brilliant people helping make this happen.

Recently killed in battle with his Nazi archenemy der Ubermann, the nation has mourned his passing.\nInvictus - A young man from Montana who is infused with a raw energy that makes him every bit as powerful as the Guardsman was.  A troubled teen with secrets of his own, his desire to present a positive image and \"look good\" makes many underestimate how committed this young hero is.\nPilgrim - Possessing a power classified as \"Biokenesis\", Pilgrim is a young, intelligent man on a quest to self discovery.  His driving focus is to discover his place in the universe and who he is in relation to that.  His spirituality is in constant conflict with his desire to apply logic to his everyday actions.\nDevil Dog - A one time spy, the man known as the Fighting Devil Dog is a mix of superhero and superspy.  His past has given him not only the skills and contacts he needs to get the job done, but inside knowledge of how the Watch conducts business, as he was once their top operative. \nNumber 32 - A blank slate to say the least, Number 32 was never meant to be awake.  More so she has not been properly prepared for her new life and is running on genetic instinct without a single point of reference.  She is also hearing a voice in her head that guides her actions as our story unfolds.\nDoc Titan - Former Golden and Silver Age superhero, Doc Titan is also the man who single-handily developed the American Super-Soldier Program during WW2.  Since then he has developed Titan Industries, the leading military contractor for the USA as well as running America's ongoing superhuman programs.\nLassiter King - Head of the Watch, the black ops division of Titan Industries, he has no powers but is universally feared by the agents under his control.  He is one of the few who will directly stand-up to Doc Titan, but even there he knows his boundaries and rarely exceeds them.\nBlack Lion - A former big game hunter from France, Black Lion is one of the oldest members of the Watch.  His powers, essentially a were-lion, allow him to transform himself from human to a black furred lion as well as a powerful hybrid Lion-Man form.  He is a heartless hunter who enjoys his work.\nPsiren - An albino woman with tremendous mental powers, Psrien has also studied as a psychiatrist which gives her insight into the behaviours of those she hunts, or so she feels.  She despises her teammates on the Watch and may have secrets yet to be revealed.\nJohnnie Blades - A psychotic speedster with a penchant for knives, Johnnie Blades was a hit man for the mob before getting recruited into the Watch.  He enjoys his work a little too much and often targets that are classified as dead or alive always end up the former.\nSo it is a given that every project should have stretch goals and we are no different.  This section will expand as we add more and more (as they are developed),\nPlease note that each extra issue will add 2 - 3 months to the expected delivery date as we have to produce them (for example Issue 2 would be about December 2013 or January 2014, etc...)\n\nAlso, this is all calculated based on 500 printed copies.  If we go over the 500 copies, we would have to recalculate the stretch goals based on demand.  Obviously we want this to be as transparent as possible, so these current stretch goals are based on 500 printed copies of the comic.\nStretch Goals\n\u2022 $11,000 - Jen Page as Lady America Photoshoot & Cover\nThis is a big one folks!

Excelsior is a Steampunk Pen and Paper RPG set in the Victorian era in the midst of the rapid population growth brought on by the advances in technology and medicine during that age. The leaders of the world realize that exploring the remaining uncharted areas of the world are their only hope to deal with this population explosion. The governments of the world have pooled their resources to create the three largest exploration and colonization ships in history in order to find a new part of the world that man can colonize and harvest resources. Things don't go exactly as planned when the explorers find themselves in a completely unexplored part of the world and having to deal with the internal and external dangers that are found within it.\n A number of Steampunk RPGs have been funded through Kickstarter over the last year and you're probably thinking, what makes this one different and worthy of my support? Excelsior strives to adhere more closely to the settings and stories found in the literary works that inspired the Steampunk aesthetic, namely by writers such has Jules Verne and HG Wells with a few esoteric sprinkles of HP Lovecraft and other authors of that genre and era. We offer a variety of backer levels so our backers not only make the story of Excelsior a reality, they become part of it.\nThe writing, editing, and preliminary play testing is complete, but we need your help to finance the great art we are looking to incorporate into the 150+ page core book to ensure that our vision of Excelsior is accurately represented within its pages. We've also been lucky enough to enlist the talents of renowned pen and paper RPG artist Imaginos Workshop's Mark Dudley, whose most notable work has been seen throughout various source books for the Palladium Books game Rifts, as well as Robotech the RPG. We also have the one, the only John Zeleznik working on the cover as well as some interior illustrations. John\u2019s clients include Marvel Entertainment, Hasbro, Mattel, Playboy, Palladium Books, Wizards of the Coast, WizKids, and FASA Corp, amongst many other well-known names. We might get more heavy hitters if we reach our stretch goals!!!\nExcelsior takes place during post Industrial Revolution times, where advances in technology and medicine have enabled mankind to enjoy a level of prosperity that was formerly only dreamed of. However, the downside of such prosperity has been the rapid population growth over the last fifty years and the increase in border skirmishes and wars to this growth that many throughout the world have attributed it to. The leaders of the world recognize that between the escalating conflict for resources and devastating tools of war that modern countries have available to them, mankind's first global conflict may be inevitable.\nThe leaders of the world put their resources together to create the largest convoy ever assembled in the history of man to explore the remaining uncharted areas of the world for purposes of colonization and resource prospecting. Many of the world's top scientists and engineers join the voyage in hopes that these parts of the world may hold new scientific findings and insight related to the origins of man. Things don't go as planned and the surviving colonists find themselves in a place that is definitely not part of the world they knew. We don't want to give too much away, but we like to think that the picture that we're (and that includes you, dear reader!) painting with the story of Excelsior has something for all fans of the Steampunk genre as well RPG gamers that are looking to branch out their play with a new setting and rule system.\nWe have detailed rules for using and creating inventions and provide rules for characters that want to enhance themselves using BioMechanics.\nOur percentile combat and skill test rule system is something that new and experienced players alike will understand and pick up quickly to allow for vivid storytelling and fast combat without having to memorize lots of proprietary game terms and keeping track of lots of specialized dice.\nThe core character classes that we are introducing in this book allow players get an opportunity to role play within their favorite type of Steampunk in the world of Excelsior:\nThe Scrapper: You are the brute squad! You're in the front lines of battle taking on dangerous enemies with the biggest weapon you can swing with both hands.\nThe Punk: Who needs to work when there are so many pigeons to pluck! You come from out of nowhere to make precise, surgical strikes, only to fade back into the shadows.\nThe Marksman: You're a big game hunter that prefers to use his trusty shooting irons to take foes down while the \"riff-raff\" gets their hands dirty with the toe to toe fighting.\nPhysician: You're responsible for keeping your comrades stitched together and making sure that that your opponents are having a very bad day.\nAegis: You are the pilot of the group and can navigate the world using a variety of vehicles, including mechanized suits of armor capable of absorbing and dealing out massive amounts of damage.\nInventor: You create devices (that mostly work) to enhance your own abilities or those of your comrades. You can partner with a Physician in your party to install Biomechanical enhancements on other people.\nB. Wraven Wright: Founder, Head Writer, Head Designer, and Chief Art Director for 2Die10 Games. Mr. Wright has ghostwritten for a variety of OGL D20 projects under various pseudonyms over the years and decided to strike out on his own two years ago by founding 2Die10 Games and creating Excelsior.\nChristine Hoyler: Graphic Designer and Head Layout Artist. Christine has had a long career as a professional graphic designer and consultant whose client list includes: The Discovery Channel, American Apparel, Disney, MGM, and Newline Cinema. She is a gamer in the true sense of the word and plays a variety of card, board, and online games.\nNiklaus Evron: Assistant Layout Artist.

Check the updates.\nHi, my name is Simon, and I\u2019m the writer/director of Third Contact. I\u2019m on kickstarter to raise \u00a315,000 to support theatrical distribution for the film.\nFind out what the money is for in more detail.\nThe film was shot without financial backing and went on to appear at a prestigious festival in Germany. You can read the story behind the making of the film here.\nThird Contact originates from what has been described by one film critic as \u2018a goldmine of ideas\u2019, including madness, depression, grief, as well as scientific concepts such as a disturbing \u2018thought-experiment\u2019 called Quantum Suicide.\nWith influences beginning at Sophocles Oedipus the King, this story follows on from Hitchcock\u2019s Vertigo and Marker\u2019s La Jet\u00e9e - stories about time and fate, about memory and obsession.\nSYNOPSIS\nMemories of lost love torment David Wright as, for reasons of his own mental health, he struggles to run his private psychotherapy practice in North London. While also dealing with the recent death of a patient, an apparent suicide, David spirals down into the darkest of places. \nDavid\u2019s motivation for life is all but gone. Then, one night, the dead patient\u2019s sister contacts him with a mystery: her brother left behind a list of four specific memories from his life, marked with the date when they occurred. \nWhen David finds another patient has also written a similar list, he is drawn into an obsessive and disturbing investigation.\n\u201cIt is difficult for me to convey the sheer artistic brilliance and visual beauty that the work possesses.\u201d Kate-Jane Hall, THE LONDON FILM REVIEW\n\"If it\u2019s true that the flick was made with a camcorder . . . Horrocks has done something truly epic.\" Will Roby, TOPTENTOPIA.com\n\u201cQuite the masterpiece and sensational debut\u201d Thomas Rothschild, FAUST\n\u201cA goldmine of ideas.\u201d Ralph Sziegoleit, FRANKENPOST\n\u201cA moving experience that not only qualifies as cinema but could also be considered a masterful piece of art with its poetic use of mystery and dialogue.\u201d Christopher George, MOVIE SLEUTH\n\"The writing is beautiful. The storytelling. The performances. The art direction. At this level in the microbudget realm, I can't think of anything else that comes close.\" Heidi Haaland, SCREENWRITER.\n\"A massive achievement and if I can ever produce anything that is even half as good I'll be pretty bloody pleased with myself. BRAVO!!!\" Steve French, FILMMAKER.\n\"...the words of food critic Anton Ego, \u201cThere are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defence of the new. The world is often unkind to new talents, new creations. The new needs friends.\u201d Third Contact is new. Simon Horrocks is new. This is me standing up, putting myself out there and defending them both.\" Thomas Patrick, THAT FILM GUY.\n\"Through Third Contact, Simon Horrocks has created the kind of film which I can only dream of making in the future and has set the standard for low-budget mess-with-your-mind productions.\" Pardonmyfrenchie, BLOGGER & FILM EDITOR.\n\"poetic and... mysterious\" Critic Nic, FILM BLOGGER.\n\"Fans of directors like David Lynch, Darren Aronofsky, Richard Kelly, Vincenzo Natali and Duncan Jones ought to enjoy Third Contact\u2019s open-ended, philosophical and conspiratorial nature.\" Ian Cavalier, SPIRAL NOTEPAD.\nIn 2010, we set out to shoot Third Contact with whatever we had to hand.\nAfter a lot of hard work, improvisation and imagination, we made a film which has gone on to show at a prestigious festival in Germany and receive critical acclaim.\nWe couldn't have done it without a great cast, so I was lucky enough to have actors and friends appearing in the film and donating their time for free.\nWithout the amazing acting talents and great dedication of Tim Scott-Walker, Jannica Olin, Oliver Browne, Cristiana Dell\u2019Anna, Virginia Popova, Kristina Erdely, Simeon Willis, John Kay-Steel, Andrew Lawden, Zara Symes and many others; without Sarah Jane Fogg\u2019s wonderful music; without the hard work of Justin Rogers, Scott Liston, Gabriela Talevera and many others, this film would not have been made.\nOur dream is to see Third Contact make it to the BIG SCREEN so please join our campaign to raise funds for a THEATRICAL RELEASE of the film.\nAs part of our campaign, one of our most exciting rewards will be to show the film to you on one of the most prestigious movie theatres in the world - the BFI IMAX in central London, the biggest cinema screen in Britain (see below for further details).\nWe'll release Third Contact independently in select theaters around London. From there, we\u2019ll be pushing to show the film in independent cinemas across the UK.\nWe\u2019ve shown Third Contact to independent cinemas in London - they like the film and want to show it. Before they can show it, however, we need funds ready to pay for film promotion.\nThe theatrical release and resulting media coverage of the film will become a huge asset as we then move on to distributing via DVD, Blu-Ray and video streaming services to an international audience.\nI\u2019ve done all the promotional design work myself, which means even more of your money will go where it\u2019s needed. Apart from securing a professional film PR company\u2019s services, costs will include hiring a cinema booker, paying for posters and flyers to be printed and other \u201cdeliverables\u201d such as Digital Cinema Packages and Blu-ray masters.\nI believe in cinema, which means watching films on a big screen. That\u2018s what inspired me to want to make my own films. I would love to bring Third Contact to cinemas around the world and your backing will help me to keep pushing towards that goal.\nI want the exclusive event screening of Third Contact to be a special experience for those making the \u00a350 donation. That's why I've provisionally booked the BFI IMAX cinema screen in central London.\nThis is one of the most prestigious cinemas in the world, where many of the biggest stars in the business attend premieres of their films. But why should big budget productions have all the fun?\nShould you choose to pledge \u00a350, I will be eternally grateful. Should 250 or more of you decide to pledge \u00a350, the event screening will take place at the BFI IMAX. If not we will find another (slightly smaller) prestigious venue in London.\nIf you pledge \u00a350, as an added thank you, I will add your name to the opening credits for this special event screening. If enough people make this pledge, your name will be up on the biggest cinema screen in Britain. Feel free to take a picture!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no guarantees in the film industry. Even films with huge PR budgets can struggle to find an audience. \u00a315,000 is a pretty small compared to the average PR budget.\n\nHowever, we have taken advice from others who have been successful in this field. Our strategy will be to open the film in a limited number of cinemas in London. The money raised on kickstarter will pay for local promotion - basically letting as many people know about the film as we can with posters, press and media exposure. If this goes well, it will open up the opportunity to show the film in other parts of the country, as well as other parts of the world.\n\nAfter theatrical distribution, I intend to release the film on DVD and VOD platforms, nationally and internationally.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Third Contact: 20 City USA and Canada Tour LIVE", "update_content": "The tickets for the USA and Canada tour are now LIVE!\nBut we are not only touring Third Contact, we are also shooting a new film!\nTo find out more, follow the link:\nhttp://igg.me/at/3CUSAandCanada\nIf you are near one of these venues and fancy seeing the film on the big screen, hope to see you there!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Third Contact: The Final Chapter", "update_content": "Just over 5 years ago, I began work on a screenplay about a therapist who becomes obsessed with the investigation into the mysterious deaths of two patients.

The game takes place within the crumbling ruin of a partially destroyed Soviet city. You will have to learn to stay alive while facing vicious alien hybrids, ruthless bandits, and other survivors of the disaster, all of whom will stop at nothing in order to survive. While exploring new areas, scavenging for vital supplies, and fighting for your life, you will have to make hard choices between greater goals and your own personal objectives. These choices will lead to different outcomes and may have wide-ranging consequences. \nOur inspiration comes from many sources: games like Fallout 1 and 2, S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl, Metro 2033, Half-Life 2, Resident Evil; films The Thing, Alien(s),Prometheus, The Road, The Myst; our favorite writers Isaac Asimov, Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Stanislaw Lem and many others.\nWe are creating a game in which you will have the freedom to act without cleaving to artificial boundaries of morality, where your actions and inactions affect the game world, where the enemy is not only strong and dangerous, but often subtle and insidious. The grim landscape of the city reflects the cold and unforgiving atmosphere of the game, where survival is a daily struggle.\n(The video does not show the final gameplay or quality. All the enemies shown in it do not have any AI whatsoever. This is just a working prototype)\nThe main characters \n\"Salamander\" group\nThe Salamander Group, a small scientific group studying the parasite and searching for a possible cure. Their numbers have been whittled down until only four remain. Members are, from left to right:\nProfessor Pavlov, head of Salamander\nDoctor Glogger, his right hand man and assistant\nCalvin Winkler, a laboratory assistant, found wandering the city alone by Dymov\nAndrei Dymov, a Soviet paratrooper who protects the other members of the group as well as finding essential supplies to continue their research.  \nsome of the key NPCs\nfrom left to right:\nZakhar, a wandering survivor, always on the move within and without the city. He carefully remains neutral, favouring no faction over the others. His ability to stay alive for such long stretches in and around the city is shrouded in mystery.\n\u201cSurgeon\u201d, the Nemostor leader. Nobody knows how he got his nickname, although rumours abound that when the parasite struck he was a working as a surgeon, and his horrific injuries and mutilated face were a result of an attack by one of the infected. Other, darker rumours, suggest that it is a reference to his fondness for indulging in violent, inhuman experiments on captured survivors.\nColonel Lewis was sent to DUGA-40 as part of an international humanitarian mission to support the Soviet army in regulating the infection. He, like many others, was left to die after the airstrikes left vast swathes of the city in ruins. He is now the informal leader of the Railway Camp, and with his exoskeleton \u201cLedokol\u201d protects the camp from hybrids and raids by Nemostor.\nPavel, a young and gifted chemist. His drug habit got him fired from his position as a laboratory assistant at the Hospital, and that fortunate event meant that he was ensconced in his basement cooking up new drugs when the bombings occurred. Now he never leaves his basement, and sells his drugs to any buyers via runners.\nIn an alternate universe, where Soviet expedition discovered \u201csomething\u201d in Tunguska, after unexplained phenomena in 1922. The mankind made huge technological breakthroughs in many areas of life and science.\nSky gave humans an unexpected gift, which spurred their technological progress: transistors, first computers, robotics, nuclear fusion, self-renewable synthetic fuel, lasers and wireless communication.\nHowever, every medal has two sides. Humankind were playing with \"fire\" and violently burnt itself.\nAn unknown organism was accidentally discovered in the one of the extraterrestrial artefacts. The tiny parasite, a contact with it, leads to unpredictable mutations. Despite strict quarantine, the parasite broke out from the laboratories' walls and infected more than 70% of citizens in a secret Siberian city . The parasite adapts and transforms human's body to its own needs, turning its victims into vicious hybrids. \nFear of global pandemic forced the Soviet government to bomb the city, leaving all the uninfected to die. They hoped that isolated parasite would die from starvation or hibernate again. But was it isolated? \nFive years have gone since the airstrike, which partly destroyed the city, a small number of uninfected are still alive and fighting for their lives.\nOpen World \u2013 gives an opportunity to roam freely around the locations in any order, without forcing one to accomplish the main story line. In addition to that, the absences of level system, which would create artificial barriers, truly open the world for exploration from the very beginning.\n\nDynamic weather \u2013 different weather conditions and cold environment will make you searching for shelter, warm clothes and balance the time between indoor and outdoor exploration.\nDay and Night cycle \u2013 during the days, you will be facing threat from human beings like Nemostor\u2019s patrols or other unfriendly survivors and at nights, you will be hiding from deadly creatures. In many cases, you might prefer to avoid direct conflict, but of course it will hugely depend on you character and your play style.\nCombat systems \u2013 Real Time and Tactical (prices aiming) \u2013 you can easily switch between real time and tactical mode at any time you want. The tactical mode allows to pause the game and aim precisely at any part of the body, sometimes dealing more damage and produce less noise.\n\nMicro Events System \u2013 it is a pool of events with a number of different outcomes, which can be triggered by player\u2019s interaction with the environment. For example you have fixed a generator and turned it on, what happen next -well, you can search a building without a flashlight and some previously closed doors are now open, but the light might attract hybrids, or pipes in the basement blew up blocking the entrance, making the basement unreachable\nRandom Interiors \u2013 every new game, the interiors of some buildings as long as loot, enemies inside them and Micro Events will be randomly generated.\n\nTransport \u2013 driveable retro cars\nCompanions \u2013 robots which carry your stuff and provide additional lighting, but don\u2019t forget to fill it up with a new portion of diesel.\n\n\nSetting \u2013 post-apocalyptic environment of a soviet, secret city, set in an alternate universe, where the discovery of a spaceship wreckage in Tunguska had a tremendous impact on technological revolution.\n\nWe are a small team of passionate gamers who have been developing Frozen State for about a year in our free time and on our own savings. Initially the core team consisted of three men, but now we have a few more people who share our ideas and willingly contribute their spare time and skill to Frozen State. However, to bring the game to the next level we will have to quit our jobs in order to focus on developing Frozen State full-time. \nWith your help we can considerably speed up the development process while maintaining consistently high standards, and release a finished game in about sixteen months. Why 16 months? Considering the scope of Frozen State and the size of the team, as well as learning from the experiences of other Kickstarted projects, we would like to be somewhat conservative regarding the time needed to complete the game. This amount of time is required to provide the best possible quality we can deliver. The core idea and game mechanics are already formed and will not change dramatically over time, which gives us an opportunity to make a playable beta in around six - eight months. \nSixty thousand pounds is the minimum required to allow the team to work full time throughout the sixteen months. It will barely cover our expenses and living costs, and we already have bought Unity3D Pro licences, so all your money goes towards the development of our great game.  \nAlexander Prokhorov - Game designer and project lead \nAnatoly Tsvetkov - 3D Artist (environment)\nAnton Pozdnyakov- Programmer \nContributors\nLuke Fielding - 3D Artist (environment) \nIvan Vavilov - 3D Artist (characters) \nDmitry Alexeev- Concept artist\nPhillip Robertsen - Animator       \nSurvival packs\nHD wallpapers and Posters\nMusic\nIf you like our game, please help us spread the word. \n\n\n\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development is a hard and complex process. During this process can raise some unexpected issues, which can slow down the development.

Our team members have worked in different indie game projects and have all necessary expertise.We also invested our own savings in buying some software and started working on playable alphas.\n\n\nHopefully the work that we already done and our commitment to Frozen State have proven that we can deliver what we promise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Snow Arc\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nWe are a small team of passionate gamers.

Our first release is a core multiplayer experience on PC & PS4 that includes no less than six maps, four new gameplay modes, and our comprehensive community-building/clan management tools.\nLike many fans of the early SOCOMs, you may be among the legions asking for an HD version of SOCOM II. This isn\u2019t that. We\u2019re not here to simply deliver the past in a prettier package. We\u2019re building the spiritual successor to the early SOCOM games from the ground up. H-Hour: World\u2019s Elite is immediate, realistic, multiplayer-oriented and team-based. It is an experience directly inspired by the SOCOM series because those games were the starting point. H-Hour is several miles down the road that we traveled with SOCOM, the kind of shooter that SOCOM would have become if I had continued to helm the series beyond the second release.\nAnd while SOCOM focused on the U.S. Navy SEALs for its content, the H-Hour project will lean on the creative experience of its director and its President, Tom, a retired Army veteran to help shape the vision and incorporate aspects of multiple special forces groups from around the globe, formally known in H-Hour as the World's Elite.\nBecause shooters don\u2019t have to be about long cutscenes or pointless \u201cwow\u201d moments. They don\u2019t need to involve sprinting around constrictive maps and magnetic bullets. They shouldn\u2019t involve overly scripted AI behaviors that are exactly the same every time you play. Or driving a truck through Manhattan on a rail while the city explodes due to unknown causes. They shouldn\u2019t be ranked by who has the biggest explosions and their greatest appeal shouldn\u2019t be \u201ceverybody else is playing it.\u201d No, really they should be about connecting on a human level with other players, honoring the contributions of our military colleagues through respect for authenticity, and bringing like-minded people together online to strategize, execute and win. \nYou know what\u2019s more important than explosions? (Though we do like explosions\u2026) Team play. Esprit de corps. A good attitude. Being part of a healthy, passionate community in which you enjoy spending your precious free time. One of the single most important innovations of H-Hour is our use of modern analytics technology to monitor griefers, cheaters, and generally obnoxious players and utilize that data to deliver an experience free of those elements\u2014a battlefield of other dedicated competitive players who understand honor, respect and the values upon which our great military was founded. \nSpecial Operations Forces Studios (SOFs) is a video game development studio led by elite Special Operations veterans and premier gaming experts. The game development is led by me, David Sears. The company is led by Tom, a 20 year retired Army veteran with 17 years of Special Operations expertise, leadership, and live-combat experience. He has performed countless real world missions in support of the Global War On Terror as a team member/operator, is the recipient of numerous decorations and awards, and is regarded as a global expert in all aspects of Special Operations. Between us, we have forty combined years of experience in creating authentic, team-based shooter experiences, mine virtual, his more literal.\n[Note: You can read more about us and some of the other founding company members at our website.] \nWe aren't big fans of bureaucracy and politics. These things tend to get in the way of the mission and for us, the prime directive is to make great shooter games. Our studio is no nonsense, low overhead, and we ensure that almost every dollar we make goes back into the games we\u2019re working on. We can make creative decisions quickly by trusting our instincts and experience and by listening closely to our online community without having to book a meeting with senior executives next quarter. Honestly, it\u2019s pretty awesome to be able to focus on making games in an old school way, thinking about what\u2019s fun first and what would look good on a box second. Of course we do like to make stuff that looks good on a box, too.\nAll of this isn't to say we don\u2019t keep a close eye on our schedule and budget. We honor our supporters with a strong commitment to not only ship on time but to exceed their expectations. You can\u2019t do that without smart planning and occasional overtime when inspiration strikes. \nPeople with a whole lot of money to invest\u2014money fund managers, for example\u2014have shown strong interest in us and we suspect that they really like the idea of H-Hour making tons of cash for their investors. They even seem willing to mostly stay out of our hair once production of the game begins. But there\u2019s always a catch: before we take discussions to the next level we\u2019re going to need to produce a compelling proof of concept in the form of a game demo.\nEven though the team has shipped AAA games that have made their respective publishers hundreds of millions of dollars in the past, we still have to show a rock-solid playable to unlock access to Venture Capitalist (VC) money. Their investment allows us to build a complete game and in the end, make them a lot more money. Of course having a lot of backers from Kickstarter helps our cause too because it shows that the idea of H-Hour already has real-world support.\nReally, it\u2019s only the fortunate byproduct of giving you the shooter experience you want that makes this process tolerable. You\u2019ll get the game and some pretty cool swag out of it and we get to work on a game that we\u2019re passionate about; a game that the gaming population seems to desperately want, but that no major developers seems capable of or interested in making.\nSpeaking of that, when it comes to the demo, surprisingly, building the gameplay and level isn\u2019t the biggest challenge. It\u2019s making the level and character (and explosions) pretty. I\u2019m totally serious. We\u2019re already pouring a lot of time and energy into getting the game running\u2014it\u2019s just gray prototype ugly looking. I can say that because this is Kickstarter and that\u2019s why we need the initial shot of Kickstarter magic: to bring more artists on board. Those guys want to get paid, after all. Pretty pixels aren\u2019t free.\nH-Hour: World's Elite\u2122 is a tactical, team-based military shooter in which cooperation among players is required for success. A run and gun lone wolf approach quickly results in your death; only by cooperating with your team can you hope to achieve victory. But so many players who would love military shooters are discouraged by what they perceive as brutal competition from day one. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re including mechanisms that not only allow you to play with players at your skill level but teach and encourage you how to play tactically. \nThe design philosophy is simple: bullets are deadly, and any character not wearing body armor or staying out of the line of fire will not last long. There are no absolutes in lethality, but in H-Hour, you won't take a shot to the head and keep fighting while you miraculously regenerate health. If you are looking for a change of pace from reckless play and want a little more realism in your combat, you\u2019ll love the feeling of H-Hour and the game will monitor your performance, point out what you did right and wrong, and offer strategies for your improvement. \nReality is a theme of H-Hour. The game is inspired by real world events\u2014the personal stories of Special Operations Forces\u2014repurposed and staged in new and equally deadly locations for the purposes of preserving national security. Environments emphasize all the filth, chaos, and visual disruption common to many of the locales where savages plot and launch their insurgencies or terrorism campaigns. \nAll animations are sourced directly from Special Operations veterans who bring their expertise and decades of combat experience into the motion capture studio and their war stories into our offices. It\u2019s hard not to be inspired when you work with these heroes.\nWe believe that players should be able to fine tune their shooter experience as much as possible. This is expressed in the design from the ground up.  \nH-Hour is a hybrid third person and first person shooter. The third person perspective allows you to view your character and provides increased situational awareness\u2014an intelligence edge in combat situations. The first person view presents you with only a reticle and adjusts the field of view so that you have the feeling of being \u201cin the shit\u201d and a naturally enhanced \u201czoomed in\u201d perspective that provides a twitch play edge. \nThe ballistics model is as complete and authentic as any weapons simulation available in a game needs to be, taking into account all the pertinent variables such as stance, weight, character speed, and the particular characteristics of each weapon. Any more realism would just get in the way of fun.  \nYou can choose to carry more or less gear, heavier or lighter weapons, and more or less body armor among other options. Each of these choices bring benefits and tradeoffs in the form of increased firepower or protection but reduced speed, accelerated fatigue, or obstructed peripheral vision.\nWithin the game and lobbies, players have access to headset chat with multiple channels so that they can speak directly to their teams. Team leaders can also use the TEAMCOM\u2122 visual interface to send predefined and user-defined text commands to their entire team or individuals\u2014including the AI-controlled civilians that appear on many maps. If you\u2019re not comfortable talking out loud in an online game that\u2019s okay\u2014you can just choose from a menu of simplified visual commands and your character will do the talking for you.\nMultiplayer games live and die by virtue of their communities. In H-Hour, these communities are supported natively in the game itself through innovative community and clan management tools.\nPlayers with leadership drive can create their own permanent clans with just a few clicks using preset options. However, these leaders have much more customization options at their disposal. These include sending invitations to join the clan, creation of unique clan badges and logos, a dedicated clan page, clan member performance data at a glance, the ability to issue and accept clan challenges, the creation of clan or training games with detailed after action reports, and the ability to tailor a clan constitution to match their philosophy. \nJust as players are required to accept an agreement to play fairly and ethically when entering the world of H-Hour, clan members are required to embrace the ethos of their clan. The same technology that measures your performance to help you as an individual helps clan leaders build and better run their clans. Authorized clan leaders have access to the behavior of their members in any match and the ability to give guidance, warn, or censure any clan member. This means that a clan leader doesn\u2019t have to watch everything every team member does in a match\u2014the game will create an \u201cafter action\u201d report for them.\nH-Hour also gives players the tools they need to build a robust community populated by gamers that want to play, not gamers that want to spout grief and irritate. This attitude is reflected in a subset of voting tools available in any multiplayer game that allows players to report cheating or bad behavior. \nOffering dedicated servers allows SOF Studios to not only offer you the most reliable gameplay but to maintain a vast database of player metrics that can be used to improve the existing gameplay experience. Just like the \u201cbig boys\u201d of the industry, we\u2019ll be watching closely to identify issues as they arise. Unlike the big boys though, we can release fixes right away without long lead times.\nLadders have always provided players with an easy way to compare their progress and abilities against other players. In H-Hour ladders perform the same function but in addition to the common focci of most matches won, most headshots and achievements of that sort, the games ladders include more abstract and until now, difficult to track performance. For example, H-Hour offers ladders for \u201cbest team player,\u201d \u201cgood Samaritans\u201d who protect innocent civilians or save teammates, and \u201cbest tactical player\u201d for those who apply real world tactics, among others. \nWhether you are working together as a lethal SOF team or taking the role of the savages, you\u2019re encouraged and rewarded to play as a team. This means following orders from team leaders, sticking to a battle plan, achieving objectives that require coordination with one or more teammates, and watching the backs of your comrades. There is no \u201cI\u201d in H-Hour where the line between death and victory is crossed by selfish play. Rewards come not only in the form of a match win, but in increased experience points and combat perks available only to teams that coordinate and execute together.\nMembers of America\u2019s retired warfighter community aren't our consultants\u2014they\u2019re our colleagues. We don\u2019t email them with a question about firearms, they take us to the range and train us. We don\u2019t ask if they have photos from a dangerous part of the world, they take us there. We don\u2019t ask them what extreme rappelling is like, they throw us over a cliff so we know firsthand (which is far more awesome than it might sound). And one of our key teammates is a professional weapons engineer who knows as much about firearms and ballistics as just about anyone on the planet. The game development team blends all these insights and experiences into a shooter that is as realistic as the overarching principles of fun allow.\nWith Tom\u2019s long standing friendships throughout the defense industry\u2014friendships with people that support the warfighter with the best in design and innovation\u2014we have a direct line on what\u2019s \u201cnow\u201d and what\u2019s next in terms of military gear and combat wear. Tom\u2019s advisory network represents companies that focus on weapons and optics manufacturing, clothing, and soldier survival equipment. They are the best in the world at what they do and continue to help support the studio even after Tom\u2019s retirement from active duty.\nWe\u2019re going to push the PC to the limits of its rendering possibility (don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have a bleeding edge machine\u2014H-Hour is scalable) and we have the artists and animators committed to doing this. H-Hour will be visually stunning.\nBut we think audio is incredibly important too, so we\u2019re collaborating with an extraordinary composer, soundtrack producer and all around delightful person--Penka Kouneva. You may have heard her work in Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands game or her contributions to Gears of War 3 and Transfomers (themes by Steve Jablonsky). She was also lead orchestrator on Elysium; Transformers 1, 2, 3; Pirates 3; and Angels and Demons. You have definitely heard her work if you've watched our Kickstarter pitch\u2014Penka provided the music. She\u2019s World-class and we are beyond excited to work with her. If you want to hear more of her work, check out these links:\nwww.penkakouneva.com\nhttp://soundcloud.com/penka_kouneva/sets/a-warriors-odyssey-previews/\nOur goal is to unify AAA game design, art direction, and music to deliver you an outstanding game. It\u2019s a tall order but we\u2019ve been doing this for years and with our no nonsense philosophy, we can dispense with the politics and get down to making the game you want to play.\nWe appreciate Greg\u2019s kind words. You might think he\u2019s implying that I was the creative director on every SOCOM ever made. Just to be clear I was CD and a designer on the first two, CD for the first PSP game, and CD at the studio while we were making SOCOM III and MAG but left before shipping those.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo game development production is risk-free. That\u2019s why we\u2019re keeping our initial scope manageable.

Frequent content updates are a lot to manage and are probably the biggest risk we face\u2014we don\u2019t want you to download something that will break the play balance.\n \nAnother troublesome risk is the ongoing war with griefers and glitchers. No matter how good your game is, some people love to ruin it for everyone else.

I miss the days of hanging out in the rec room and talking to my wingmen before flying a mission.  I don't really care much for the economy sim aspect, such as commodity trading and ship purchasing, that has found its way into many modern space sims.  Neither am I satisfied with arcade-style games at the other extreme.  I was looking for a story-driven game that concentrated on being a pilot and part of something larger than myself.  I realized that if I was going to play a modern version of the classic space sim, I would have to create it myself. \n\nI set out developing Eterium about five years ago in my free time,  building it on a custom engine, while holding down a fulltime gameplay programming position. This made for a very slow moving process.  The gameplay was coming along nicely, but the graphics left much to be desired. That's when Dave joined the team and took the graphics to a new level.  Eterium is the story-driven classic space sim that I had been waiting for.\n\nWe've come along way since Dave joined the team!\nWe already have thirty-five missions up to a beta quality, but as you can see from our Demo there is still a lot of room for improvement. That is why we are turning to the kickstarter community to assist us in funding the completion of this game. With the funding we will be able to double the length of the game, polish the existing experience, improve the visuals, create new music and hire an artist to create better characters!\nUEA Changdao Heavy Fighter - One of the four playable ships.\nEterium is an approachable and yet complex space sim game.  It is very important to us to design a game that can be easily picked up by new players.  There are many space sims out there that have such a steep learning curve, that it is really difficult for new players to start out.  Eterium's goal is to have a pick up and play feel while preserving the hardcore spirit of the genre.  The difficulty in Eterium is not in learning to fly your ship, but in learning to manage the encounters.  On harder difficulties the AI becomes more cunning and more difficult, but the AI will never cheat.  Weapons always do the same amount of damage and the AI's ships always have the same limitations no matter what difficulty the game is set to.\nThe United Earth Alliance Strike Carrier Canopus\nEach missions starts with your ship on the flightdeck.\nA few key features:  \nFully customizable joystick, Xbox controller, and mouse support.\nDynamic difficulty that allows the game to continually fine tune the AI skill level in addition to the standard game difficulty settings.\nFour playable fighters with unique cockpit designs.\nFirst person view from within the cockpit.\nProcedural Missions: Many of the missions are created using an intelligent mission generation algorithm making each play through unique.\nAdvanced Damage System: In addition to shields and armor, there is an advanced damage system that governs the ship's functions. From weapons to engines the damaged system affects how the ship handles in combat.\nNvidia 3D Vision Support: The game looks awesome with a 3D monitor. If you have a 3D monitor you can't pass this game up!\n\n\nEstimated System Requirements\nThe requirements are all subject to change. We\u2019re trying to accommodate as many machines as possible.\nOS: Windows (XP/Vista/7/8) \nProcessor: 2ghz Core 2 Duo \nMemory:512 MB\nGraphics: Shader Model 3.0 or better (Integrated graphics not supported, Nvidia card and 3D Vision setup required for Nvidia 3D Vision) \nMinimum (officially supported) Resolution: 1280 x 720\n\nAsteroid fields are a good challenge - combat in asteroid fields is exhilarating!\nDemo\nCheck out our demo. This is the first few missions from an early beta build to give you a taste of what you can expect from Eterium. http://rogueearth.com/Demo\nWe are working to improve the look of the characters and make them better match up with the rest of the game. We have not decided if we are going to stick with the anime style or go for a more realistic look.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nIf you haven't played our demo yet, I encourage you to give it a try. You'll see how far along we have come so far. We have been working on Eterium as a side project; but after hearing from all of you, we have realized that with some funding we could make Eterium something truly great.  We have put a lot of time and effort into making Eterium what it is today, but there is only so far that we can take it on our own.  The funding we receive from kickstarter will go toward hiring an artist to improve interactive story elements (characters and backgrounds), musicians to create custom music tracks, better sound fx and completing the development of the game.\nCapital ships add challenge and variety to the game.\nThe Team\nEterium started a few years back as a side project from the Lead Programmer Andrew Luby. Andrew has since dedicated himself full-time to seeing this project through to completion.\nDave Schoneveld, the Lead Artist, joined the team about a year and a half ago; also contributing to Eterium as a side project. Dave saw the state of Eterium, and how much potential it showed, but knew the graphics would never make the cut. He worked to replace all the graphics in the game and bring the visuals to a level they are today.\nEric Duhon has been provided additional programming help throughout the last half a year. He has brought Eterium into stereo 3D with Nvidia 3D vision, greatly improved the graphics capability of the engine, and provided advanced joystick support.\nMatt Roseman flimed and edited the Kickstarter video. Thanks Matt!\nScott Sorenson and Chris Murguia have recently signed on to create the custom music for Eterium. (The music they are creating has not yet made it into the demo).\nRefinements of the corvette light capital ship.\nGoals ($25,000) - Estimated Release October 2013\nComplete the game.  The funding from kickstarter will give us the time we need to dedicate ourselves to finishing the missions, improving the graphics and particle effects, polishing the game, and play testing to deliver the best experience possible upon release.\nDouble the game's length from around 35 missions to 70 or more. That will take you about 12 to 16 hours to play through! Our original plan was to release the game in two parts, simply because it was so much work to create the first 35 missions.  But with the help of kickstarter we will have more time to develop the missions and tell the entire story with a single release.\nAdd a fourth playable ship with new cockpit: the Saber, an experimental new medium fighter that has more firepower than the Sagaris Medium Fighter but has handling characteristic closer to the Talwar Light Fighter.\nRework the character art.

But if we earn beyond our goal, we'll have additional funding to support:\n$50,000 (add 2 months to estimated release)\nFully voiced dialog both during cinematics and in-flight gameplay.\nEarn in-game medals for outstanding performance.\nImproved joystick support and performance, including support for foot pedals.\n3rd person view.\nIn-flight power and shield allocation\nCustomizable missile load-outs (later missions)\n\n$75,000 (add 2 more months to estimated release)\nBranching storyline.  With a branching storyline, your success in the missions effects the story and the outcome of the game!\nFull Oculus Rift Support with head tracking and 360 degree cockpits.\nAdvanced camera controls including target-lock and looking around the cockpit.\n\nThe Beta Program\nThose of you who sign up for the beta program will be helping us out tremendously by playing the game while we develop it. You'll be able to work directly with us to help us balance the game and tweak the missions and story so that we can provide the best experience possible. Those who sign up for the beta program will get their beta copy as soon as the kickstarter campaign ends. The beta version of the game you get, will not be complete. You will get about 30 playable missions at first, but as we work on the game you will receive regular updates to the beta version. That way you will be able to see the game evolve and be part of the decision process every time we add a new mission or change how a certain ship handles.\nStay up to date at our Developer Blog.\nAdd-ons\nTo get add-ons please pledge the amount listed below in addition to your current selected reward tier.

THE ITALIAN COP AND GANGSTER FILMS THAT RULED THE '70s got selected by film festivals all around the world, garnered Top Festival Picks by newspapers like the SAN FRANCISCO BAY GUARDIAN, won other festival honors, received positive reviews in publications like VARIETY, and received multiple distribution offers.\nEUROCRIME's documentarian, Mike Malloy, diligently edited his doc to pack in so much information, energy, style and creativity that the two-hour running time was accepted by audiences. The net effect? He was able to tell the story of the subject DEFINITIVELY.\nMalloy has been researching his next doc project, PLASTIC MOVIES REWOUND: THE STORY OF THE '80s HOME VIDEO BOOM, since 2003. And when the project's sizzle reel debuted a couple months ago, the advanced buzz and reviews seemed to understand that while other, similar projects may use the word \"definitive,\" this one means it.\nSerialized across six half-hour episodes, PLASTIC MOVIES REWOUND will cover (1) Cultural Shake-Up, (2)  Industry Shake-Up, (3) Golden Age of Mom-and-Pop Video Stores, (4) Alternative Formats and Delivery Methods, (5) Filmmakers Versus Distributors and (6) the Future of Physical Media.\nThe project has about 20 interviews in the can already, from important industry players like the founder of Netflix and the former VP of RCA (that was involved with the company's failed CED format) to colorful low-budget and shot-on-video genre directors. Have a few more interviewees attached that we'd like to pick up.\nSo we're seeking to raise money in order to continue a little more production then jump headlong into post, where there's an 8TB raid drive that needs to be bought, etc.\nThis doc series will feature original synth music by composer Matthew Miklos (from the notorious garage rock band The Lyres) and a mix of original and licensed synth music from amazing Swedish composer Thomas Nyholm. Second Unit director Michael Perkins (THE BOOKER) is working on the dramatic re-enactments. Associate Producer Jonathan Hickman is both a camera op/DP and an entertainment attorney. Associate Producer Michael A. Martinez is a camera op/DP with some major Hollywood credits. Associate Producer Travis Mace is one of the hardest-working guys in the VHS collecting subculture. Associate Producer Morgan White (THE REP) has been helpful as hell in a number of ways.\nBut enough about the project; I want to tell you what you'll be getting if you donate at the exciting MILLENNIUM PLATINUM SIGNATURE EDITION level, which is meant to be a great value to the collectors. $75 will get you one item from each category:\nSIGNED MOVIES:\nKilling Spree (Magnum VHS, signed by SOV director Tim Ritter)\nWorst of Enemies (RaeDon VHS, signed by director Garrett Abdo)\nDemon Queen (Massacre DVD, signed by director Donald Farmer)\nDeath Collector (RaeDon VHS, signed by director Tom Garrett)\nBloodsuckers from Outer Space (DVD, signed by director Glen Coburn -- multiple available!)\nDeath Collector (MNTEX VHS, signed by director Tom Garrett)\nSavage Vengeance (Eden DVD, signed by director Donald Farmer)\nRepligator (Whacked limited pre-release DVD-R, signed by director Bret McCormick)\nReconciled (SubRosa DVD, signed by SOV director Tim Ritter)\nKilling Spree (SubRosa DVD, signed by SOV director Tim Ritter)\nmore coming...\nSIGNED NON-MOVIE ITEMS:\nDeath Collector unused artwork (signed by director Tom Garrett)\nPortable Grindhouse book (signed by author Jacques Boyreau -- multiple available!)\nVideophile magazine issues (signed by publisher Jim Lowe -- multiple available!)\nSplatter Times magazine (signed by publisher Donald Farmer)\nmore coming...\n\n\nMYSTERY ITEMS:\nIncludes relevant-to-this documentary DVDs, vintage press materials, etc etc etc -- donated by filmmakers, by Vagrancy Films, Cult Movie Mania, Massacre Video, Lunchmeat Magazine, Slasher // Video and others!\nMP3 SOUNDTRACK DOWNLOADS:\nSeveral MP3s from Matthew Miklos and a couple from Thomas Nyholm.\nA COPY OF THE FINISHED DOC:\nVHS edition of the documentary, when complete -- likely a two-tape set, likely in double clamshell packaging.\nSPECIAL THANKS:\nSpecial thanks credit in an episode of the documentary (and on imdb, subject to that site's terms and blah yada blah...)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilm projects always contain so many variables and moving parts that it's impossible to predict exactly how one will unfold.

Caustic Soda is an action-driven graphic novel set in San Diego, CA in a speculative future where a war for control of the border has erupted between the unified narcotics syndicates of Mexico and the Paramilitary Security Corporation, Agility. \nThe narrative follows the work of the Arnelle Liquidation Associates, a group of freelance assassins whose base of operations is a punk rock club called The InterZone, where they dispose of their victims. \nThe dangerous work performed by the kill-for-hire team affects both sides of the conflict, blurring the lines of loyalty, friendship and love. \nProtagonist Anton Nevona is an analyst for Agility Inc. and a liaison to the Arnelle Liquidation Associates, brokering targeted kills for the highest bidder. He also has a unique skill, using his Ouroboros ocular implant he can hack into a persons brain, reveal information and gain access to memories. Despite a simmering addiction to an entheogenic stimulant called bLoom (which filters his perceptions and effects his actions), Nevona finds himself implicated in a terrorist attack and accidentally amputates his thumb in the middle of a Department of Homeland Security raid, all before breakfast.\nDaniel Crosier illustrates the comic by hand, using ink and graphite on birch wood panels. \nClient Services Department at the Arnelle Liquidation Associates\nCover artist Sonny Kay has incorporated imagery and themes inspired by the narrative, rendering a powerful and striking cover. \nCover by Sonny Kay\nMoney \nOur book is 100% creator owned and funded.

I got my first taste of the game at Pax East 2013, and I can truthfully say that the game is as deep as it is beautiful.\"\n - Alex Coccia, GreenlitGaming\nWhat is GoD Factory: Wingmen?\nGoD Factory: Wingmen is a multiplayer space combat game in which the player works with a team of up to three other players to destroy the opponent\u2019s Carrier while defending their own.\nBefore joining online matches, the player assembles two gunships by individually selecting the twelve parts that compose each ship. These parts are bought from the game's shop using Credits earned by playing games online. Once in-game, the players must destroy different key areas of the enemy Carrier to incapacitate it and ultimately destroy it. Destroying a Carrier part gives penalties to the enemy team, and each broken part inflicts a different penalty. The key to victory will be to work as a team and many weapons and abilities will have secondary uses that can only be triggered by joining up with other players. A game should last about 15 minutes on average and can't stretch beyond 25 minutes. The game will be playable both in third person, to see your ship you've built, or from inside the cockpit, for greater immersion.\nVote for us on Greenlight!\nThis is primarily a PC game, but we're very open to the possibility of bringing the game to consoles if the opportunity arises. We will also have a Mac version, but it might not be available at launch. Linux is also a possibility, but no promise as of yet. Anyhow, you'll be happy to know that this game is not hardware intensive, so if you have a decent PC, even if it's a few years old, it should be able to run the game. We are working hard to make GoD Factory:Wingmen accessible to lots of people can play this game, without sacrificing the beauty of the visuals. We're already able to run the game quite decently on 5 years old laptops, so we're pretty confident that we'll be supporting a wide range of PCs.\nKey features:\nMany different gunship classes and parts to choose from;\nBuild 2 gunships and lend the one you're not using to your teammates or keep it for later; \nDifferent weapons and abilities are amplified by cooperating with your allies; \nDestroy the enemy Carrier part by part, taking away its abilities progressively; \nComplex weapon attributes provide a wide array of strategies to experiment.\n\n\nA good game isn't just a set of features however, it's an experience, and it has to be approached like one. We're orienting ourselves on four key aspects of the experience that we'd like to deliver:\n(Taken straight from the Game Design Document!)\n\nCreate: \nThe player wants to feel that he's doing his own thing. He's crafting a ship that fits his preferences, he works on making a play style and strategy of his own. He wants to build his squad by joining like-minded players. Everything must come with a sense of ownership.\n\nFly: \nWe need to convey a sense of mobility to the player. He must be picturing himself moving into a 3D space with both skill and freedom, the ability to go wherever he feels like. The movement of the ship and the camera must give to players the reflex to tilt their heads to follow their ship's motion. They want to feel \u201cthere\u201d.\n\nCooperate: \nAny player wants to feel like he's playing an important part in his team. In order to do so, we must reward every actions done as a group and make sure that victory is achieved when everyone acts toward a common goal. In order to convince the player to be a team player, he must feel the presence of his allies in the fight.\n\nImprove: \nAn aspect that will hook our players is the strong sense of progression when playing the game. Not only will his ships become better as he plays, but learning the complex systems and the meta-game will always give him something more to learn. One reason to keep playing is that you always get better.\nThe Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset that was immensely successful here on Kickstarter. VR replaces your vision by the environment of the game by placing monitors in front of each eye. Motion tracking and stereoscopic 3D make this even more convincing. \nOculus Rift is not ideal for every game because it completely replaces your vision.  For a game with a character that moves and jumps, it can feel a bit awkward as the player is sitting in a chair.  However the experience from GoD: Wingmen is within a cockpit, creating the perfect environment for simulation.\nIt is our intent to support the Oculus Rift for GoD Factory and we hope that we'll be ready on time for launch.\nNine Dots is a team of 7 developers working full time. We've got two programmers, three artists, one game designer/studio manager and a recently added game designer. Most of us have been working on this game for a year now with no salary. Before that, we had worked on a different game, Brand for over a year, also with no salary. So needless to say, we're a bunch of extremely committed developers doing all we can to make a great games!\nNine Dots was created to fight back against management practices from the game industry which we think are holding us back. We want to change how we make games, and what games we make. We are vehemently against crunch time, we believe in building our own intellectual properties rather than working on the projects of others and we make sure that everyone has a meaningful creative input on the game. If you want to read more about this mission, we were featured in a related article on the Penny Arcade Report not long ago: http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/why-your-games-are-made-by-childless-31-year-old-white-men-and-how-one-stud\nWe are giving everything we have to make this project a reality. However, sometimes that's not enough. We have a very solid alpha, which was thoroughly enjoyed by hundreds over hundreds of people during PAX East, including TotalBiscuit! Dave Voyles, former Editor-in-Chief of Armless Octopus and coordinator of the XBLIG Indie Uprising, also had kind words regarding the game:\n\"The space shooter genre has been sorely missing in action since the critically acclaimed X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter in the early 90's. After my time with GoD Factory at PAX  East, I think GoD Factory is as close as we've come to that experience since so many years ago.\"\nHowever, we might be unable to bring the game to completion. We've been working for 2 years at Nine Dots now, without salary. Our personal savings and resources are spreading thin, and even though we haven't paid ourselves salaries, we still have business related bills to pay. We have to pay for insurances, rent, licenses and many other things to sustain the business. We are surviving on a $25,000 bank loan, but that won't suffice.\nRealistically, in order to put absolutely everything we'd like to havein GoD Factory: Wingmen, it would take around 300,000 dollars to pay for salaries, software licenses, servers, sound effects, music, marketing (we really need to populate our matches to make this game interesting!), rent, insurances, bank fees, accounting fees, etc. Obviously, the biggest chunk of that money would go to salaries so that we may sustain ourselves while we make the game.\nHowever, we don't need all of that money *right now* to be able to progress. With 70,000 dollars, we'd have enough resources to at least bring the game to a sufficiently polished state to start the alpha funding process. Alpha funding is the principle of selling the incomplete game for less than it will cost once finished and using the feedback of early supporters to better polish the game and iron out the details. It's how Minecraft, Project Zomboid and Path of Exile funded their development, to name a few. It's a great way to leverage a community and funds, which are the two resources we need most to pull off this kind of game.\nWe are also currently under consideration for a loan from the Canada Media Fund to finish the game, but in order for them to back us, they require that we have a minimum of funds ourselves to invest in the project. So if we don't meet our Kickstarter goal, we pretty much have no chance of receiving their help either.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we can add to the game depending on how much we raise:\n$70,000: We can bring the game to a polished enough state to start selling it following the alpha funding model. Features that might not be included when the alpha funding starts include some of the gunship parts, the progression system (all parts would be unlocked from the start), it will probably be still a little bugged and some balance issues, etc.\n$100,000: If we reach that much, then we can guarantee that we'll make a different cockpit model for every species, which will be especially cool for Oculus. Of course, we'll also get closer to a more polished game for any amount above $70,000.\n$150,000: The ability to choose between at least two different carriers, with very different layouts and major gameplay differences.\n$200,000: We'd REALLY like to raise this much since we've been in talk with a famous composer to make music for our game, and we would be incredibly happy to have him do the soundtrack for our game.\n$250,000: More complex levels, including space stations that must be captured to gain benefits for your team, such as power-ups.\n$300,000: We'll have a clan-based ladder ranking system. We'll also be able to guarantee that we'll support the game for at least a year from launch. We'll put extra money into our servers and release the game early in August so people can start interacting with it, even if it's not final! That will also give the players a bigger say on how the game will turn out.\nStraight from the first reward tier, you pre-order the game, for probably less than what it will cost at launch. So many things could happen during development though, so don't take the release date for granted. \n\nMany tiers give you access to exclusive content that will only be available to our backers, such as the Super-Gold material for your ships and some vanity items that alter the look of your ships in unique ways. The best rewards however allow the backers to directly influence the game's look for everyone to see. You get to change the game in a way that everyone will experience. We're also very open to suggestions! So if you'd like to contribute but you don't see the kind of reward you're looking for, just send us your suggestion and we'll see if we can make it happen. No promise here, but it's always worth a shot!\nAll our backers will also be thanked in the game's credits.\nSo here's a more detailed explanation for every reward tier.\n$10 or more\nThis is exactly the same offer as $15, but for less. The thing is, it's a limited offer!\n$15 or more\nPre-order the game. You get the game as soon as it's ready.\n$35 or more\nPre-order 4 license for the game, meaning that you can assemble a full team with your friends. You also get two exclusive cosmetic additions that are only available to backers who paid enough to reach this tier: one is a Wing Lamp that adds some kind of flare effect in front of your ship, while the other is a highly reflective, Unique \"Super-Copper\" material that you can apply to any of your ships.\n$50 or more\nAdd to the package a single access to the Beta, meaning that you get to try the game before everyone else, give us feedback on how to make the game better and start mastering the game before everyone else! You also get the exclusive \"Super-Silver\" material to apply to your ship and a vanity item that will add a blazing fire to your trails. Finally, you get one of four unique ships designed only for our backers. These ships are made from the three major ship parts, which are the wings, the hull and the cockpit. There is one unique ship per species.\n\nUPDATE:\nWe will reveal the look of the exclusive ships as we make them in the FAQ!\n$100 or more\nNot only do you get all the previous rewards, you also get all future expansions and DLC to the game. We intend to support the game for a while and frequently update with new content, and it will all be available to you without spending one dime more. You also get all 4 unique ships, and the unique super-gold material to apply to your ship. You also gain access to a special plug-in that allows you to make your own holographic emblem, in a similar fashion to guild emblems in many MMOs. \n$250 or more\nThere are big billboards on space stations and satellites that will appear in some level environments. These billboards will shuffle through a bank of images. You get to provide us with an image of your choice (we need to approve of the image first) and your image will be displayed on those billboards. You would like to promote your own game? You want to make a joke to make our players laugh? You like kittens? Show it on our billboards!\nYou also get a vanity item that alters your ship by adding big Diamond gems to your ship.\n500$ or more\nYou get to design your own stellar Constellation, which all players will see in the sky surrounding the battlefield. You will have a maximum of 12 stars for your constellation. Note that not every constellation will necessarily appear at the same time in every match.\nYou will also get a Vanity Item that produces an Ornate Luminous Halo on your ship.\n$1000 or more\nFor this amount, you can either design a custom Planet that will be up for everyone to see in the game *or* a custom Vanity Item, similar to the other vanity rewards such as fire trails, diamond chunks, star flares in front of your wings, etc. Tell us what you'd like to see, if it's reasonable we'll do it. We won't do anything offensive or which concerns intellectual properties we do not own the rights to. The planet will not appear in every match and will be one of the randomly shuffled level element.\n$2500 or more\nDesign a GoD Monument (instead of a Planet or a Vanity Item), which are absolutely ASTRONOMICAL statues or monuments. These colossi have a big visual impact on levels, even more so than planets or space stations, and will usually be the main piece in a level environment. Just like the planet, the GoD Monument will not appear in every match. It will be one of the random elements that composes a level's environment. Believe us, all players take notice when a GoD is there. In some cases, we might even be able to animate the GoD monument, depending on the complexity of the concept.\n$5000 or more \nDesign a new Carrier Cannon (instead of a planet, vanity item or GoD) This cannon will have its own unique shape and projectile special FX. You also choose whether this cannon will only appear on your side when you're part of a match, or if every player in the game has access to it.\n$10000 or more \nFor this much, we actually make a game that will be available in our game. In the Crew Quarter menu, where a player can see his stats, trophies and codex entries, there will be an arcade cabinet which can be selected to play a game. This game will be your idea, which must not take more than 2 weeks to make. We'll discuss this at length to make sure it ends up being something you're satisfied with, but you need to have realistic expectations. This arcade cabinet will be available for any player to try.\nWe need your help, and the simple fact that you're here reading this, that you've spent time considering our project or watched the video means a lot to us. If you like what we are doing but can't afford to contribute at the moment, know that you can help us a lot by simply talking about us and sharing our Kickstarter. We're very grateful for this kind of help as well and we know all too well that sometimes you're just strapped for cash and can't help this way.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven if we meet our goal of $70,000, there is always a risk that development would not go as planned. We could start our Alpha funding model for sure, but if we don't receive enough support afterward, we might have to stop development before reaching the fully fleshed out game we want to make. That's a worst case scenario however, especially considering how far in development we already are.\n\nWith this being said, we've been extremely committed so far. Considering that we've been doing this for a year with no salary working on GoD Factory, I think it's pretty safe to think we can bring this project to completion if we get the cash and the support from our backers. We've completed a game project before and we know what it entails. We made mistakes with our first title and we do not intend to repeat them, so we are ready, more than ever, to take on this challenge.\n\nThere is also the risk that the game might turn out to be something different than what you expected. Games are subjective, so the experience will vary from player to player. No matter what, we intend to deliver the best product our resources will allow us to make.\n\nBut really... we have no intention of dropping the ball.

Fear not! You can still pre-order a lamp at 8bitlit.com\n\nRelive Your 8-Bit Glory Days!\nDon't you miss the good old days? The days of long summers, few responsibilities, and plenty of time to play.  \nA timeless symbol of our 8-bit glory days, the Question Block Lamp brings back everything we love most about old school gaming.  \nSimple mechanics: Tap the bottom to turn on and off. Whether you use your fist, palm, or head is up to you.\nAddictive sound effects: You'll be rewarded with gold coins and the occasional 1-up each time you interact with the lamp.  \nNostalgia-inducing design: Energy efficient LEDs and retro graphics add that warm, familiar glow to your space, day or night.\nPerfect for any room\nWhether you hang it in your bedroom, boardroom or bathroom, you can\u2019t go wrong. We use the highest quality parts and construction so it\u2019ll look and sound amazing year in and year out.\nRidiculously Simple Setup\nSetting up your Question Block Lamp is easier than connecting an RCA jack.\nSimply hang with the enclosed mounting kit and plug in the super long 20' power cord.\nIf you'd prefer to set your Question Block Lamp on your desk, table or night stand, be sure to grab the matching solid aluminum stand (optional). Perfect for offices and cranky landlords!\nOur Story\nWhen makers are around, every open-bar Christmas party is bound to turn into a brainstorm. \nWe got to talking about ideas, and DaDING! We came up with the concept for a fun, interactive gadget that brought back a time when 8 bits were all you needed.\nThe next two weeks went by in a blur of superglued fingertips and solder smoke, but at the end with had our first Question Block Lamp!\nWe eagerly shared our creation with our family, friends, and coworkers, and the response was overwhelming! Everyone loved the lamp and wanted one for themselves.  \nA few days later, we listed our first lamp on Etsy. To our surprise and delight, Drew Olanoff (formerly of The Next Web) found our listing and wrote an amazing review! In the months that followed, we received great press in publications like G4TV, Gizmodo, Joystiq, Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal and more. \nAll the attention led to a lot of sales - over 1,000! We recruited a team of skilled makers to help us fulfill all the orders. \nWhy Kickstarter? (Question Block Lamp 2.0)\nIn July 2012, we stopped production of the Question Block Lamp to design a new version. We wanted it to be more robust, reliable, and manufacturable at scale. Here\u2019s how the next generation lamp will be even better than before:\nElectronics Upgrade: (Warning: Geek Speak!) To make the lamp more reliable and sensitive to touch, we've integrated the capacitive touch sensor into the circuit board. Now it's super sensitive, activating instantaneously with a single fingertip.\nStronger construction: We\u2019ve selected tougher materials and production techniques to be even more resilient to wear, tear, and supercharged uppercuts. Originally we used acrylic, which is great for lasercutting, but very brittle, meaning the lamps were somewhat fragile. The new version will be made of polyvynil chloride (PVC) which is more resilient and can be die cut. \nLonger power cord: To ensure your lamp can hang in any room, we\u2019ve extended the power cord from 11 feet to 20 feet.\nEasy to install mounting kit: Every lamp now includes a mounting kit so you can get set up in no-time. This will ensure the cord hugs your wall and ceiling. \nMatching aluminum stand: For the Kickstarter, we've developed a durable aluminum stand that complements the lamp, and lets you place it on any flat surface. (Surface finish will be powder-coated or annodized - TBD) \nIn order to deliver this new version of the lamp, we need your support to make a minimum order to the factory.\nLight up your life at a Special Kickstarter Price\nIf the Kickstarter is successful, we'll have enough funds to scale up production and lower the price to $49 (originally $75 plus shipping).\nToday we have everything lined up to begin production in a modern, safe and clean facility overseas -- all we need is your support. With your pledge, we'll start production and deliver high-quality lamps at a great price. \nAt the $125 pledge level we\u2019re offering a small run of Limited Edition lamps, handcrafted in San Francisco. These lamps will be Version 2.0 and include all the new upgrades. Each lamp will include a unique laser etched identification number and ship shortly after the Kickstarter closes.\nRewards:\nProduction Schedule\n  Pre Kickstarter\nJanuary 2012: Created first prototype\nFebruary-July 2012: Handmade and sold lamps on Etsy\nAugust 2012-May 2013: Worked with manufacturers to redesign lamp, and enable large scale production.\nJune-July 2013: Kickstarter campaign\n  Post Kickstarter\nAugust 2013: Visit manufacturers, produce handmade Limited Edition lamps in San Francisco\nSeptember 2013:  Oversee first units off the line\nOctober 2013: Lamps and stands ship to fulfillment center\nNovember 2013: Lamps and stands are delivered to Kickstarter backers\nSpecial Thanks:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn addition to building and shipping over 1,000 lamps over the past year, we've also been establishing relationships with experienced manufacturers and sourcing experts to help mitigate as many risks as possible.

This biker, duJour, longed to recover the soul of his lost wife and gain vengeance against the voodoo witch who hexed him and murdered his gang.\nGet the WHOLE Story: TO ADD A STANDARD COPY OF ROADKILL DU JOUR #1 TO ANY REWARD TIER, SIMPLY ADD $5 AND MESSAGE US AT THE \"CONTACT ME\" LINK TO THE RIGHT!\nTHE STORY IN ISSUE #2\nIn this second chapter, duJour recruits avenging weapons in the forms of NEW misfit members of his Roadkill Motorcycle Club, all the while watched and warded by the witch, Mama Houdoo, and her legion of horrific minions!\nThe Kickstarter-Exclusive, 1970's Exploitation, Movie Poster-Style Cover to Roadkill du Jour #2 - Available Beginning at the $12 Tier!\nRoadkill du Jour is a tale of motorcycle gangs in a mystic bayou world, clashing in an explosion of vengeance and voodoo. At the heart of it all is the enigmatic loner, DuJour, by all counts a victim...of fate, of changes, and - most of all - of the black magic-wielding Mama Houdoo, dark mistress of the rival Gatorbait Motorcycle Club! Our story is that of duJour's quest to rid himself of his curse(s) and gain some satisfaction at the expense of Mama and her ilk.\nBut, the story behind the story goes back a couple of years. Writer Kevin LaPorte concocted its foundation during road trips to comic conventions supporting horror comic Clown Town amidst discussions with the illustrious artist of that project, Amanda Rachels. LOTS of dead critters on the road in the Southeast U.S. where we were driving, and those times were at the height of Sons of Anarchy couture. Thus, an off-hand comment like, \"What if there was a hero who got animal powers from eating roadkill,\" became the high concept of a badass biker who HAD to eat the roadkill due to a voodoo curse placed on him by a rival gang priestess!

Funds collected will go first to fees, taxes, printing and production of books and rewards, and fulfillment (shipping, supplies, etc.).  Any funds remaining beyond those expenses will go toward compensating the creators, marketing and distributing the project (via print, digital and personal appearances at conventions and retailers), and expanding the size of the print run (dependent upon demand).\nThe Standard Cover to Roadkill du Jour #1 - Available by adding just $5 to ANY Reward Tier!\nLOYALTY REWARD:\nEVERY Backer of THIS campaign (non-PDF tiers) who previously backed Flesh of White #'s 1 or 2 or Roadkill du Jour #1 will also receive a UNIQUE SKETCH Trading Card for DUJOUR, with actual pencil art by a Roadkill du Jour artist, Shawn Harbin or Laura Guzzo, or Flesh of White artist, Amanda Rachels!\nduJour Sketch Card - Loyalty Reward! Available to ALL previous backers of Flesh of White or Roadkill du Jour Kickstarter Campaigns!\nTHE WRITER:\nThe Writer of Roadkill du Jour - Kevin LaPorte\nKevin LaPorte is the Mobile, Alabama-based writer and co-creator of genre comics with a horror bent - Roadkill du Jour, Clown Town, The Blind Eye!  The worlds Kevin creates range from dark carnivals overrun by killer clowns violently avenging abused children (Clown Town) to dying frontier towns in the Old West beset by Steampunk versions of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (the in-development Last Ride for Horsemen) to the bayou territory of a lone motorcycle gangster seeking vengeance for his cursed appetite for street meat and the slaughter of his brothers-in-arms (Roadkill du Jour)!  Kevin also contributed poetry and lyrics to Ancients & Warriors: The Sketch Art of Gavin Michelli, featuring the figure work of collaborator, Gavin Michelli.\nTHE ARTIST:\nThe Artist of Roadkill du Jour - Shawn Harbin\nShawn Harbin is an enigmatic writer and artist mostly known for his work on The Dungeon Comic. The man himself is saturated with sardonic wit and pragmatic rants railing against man\u2019s failure to live up to the laws of natural selection. Highly influenced by artists Todd McFarlane, John Romita Sr., Humberto Ramos, Frank Cho, Jay Leisten, and Jeff Koonz, Shawn\u2019s talents as a penciler and storyteller are stimulated by some of the best in and out of the comic art world. His art is a mixture of hot babes, intelligent monsters, and campy humor wrapped in twisted darkness and highly innovative layouts.\nTHE COLORIST:\nThe Colorist of Roadkill du Jour - Laura Guzzo\nLaura Guzzo is a freelance illustrator whose award-winning artwork has been featured in galleries across the East Coast. Laura enjoys working in many different media, including colored pencils, watercolor, and collage.

Every major city except Washington, DC, at least. So we asked around. Was there a reason nobody had put on a big comic-con in the Washington Convention Center? Nobody knew why, it just hadn't been done. We got tired of waiting for somebody else to deem DC worthy of a con, and we did it ourselves. If you were one of the 7,000+ people who came out to Awesome Con in April, I hope you felt like you were part of something truly special, because you were. \nThis is what it's all about!!\nIt is obvious that the District should be the home of a premier national comic-con. A comic-con worthy of the District of Columbia and the entire DC Metro Area. We could wait around for some multi-million dollar corporation to do it, or, as fans who also know a thing or two about running a convention, we can do it ourselves, with your help. We promise to run it from a fans-first perspective, with the help and support of the fan community.\nOur plan is to bring you the biggest show this area has ever seen, on April 19-20, 2014. Over 100,000 square feet of exhibitors, artists, comic pros, and celebrities. More than twenty rooms of programming, and since we're not some huge corporate behemoth, we can keep ticket prices reasonable.\nBut we're going to need your help to do it. \nAt this moment, Awesome Con is in about the same place financially as it was last year when we started planning the first Awesome Con. Basically, we can afford to put on the exact same show we did last time. That's not really going to work for 2014. We sent out surveys after the con, and over 95% of them said the same thing: MAKE IT BIGGER. We can make it bigger. We will make it bigger. But making it bigger presents a few challenges.\nSpecifically, we need more money to rent a larger convention hall, which is probably the most pressing and most obvious issue. We will also need to hire a few employees to help manage the whole thing. This is something that will require a full year's worth of work from a team of people, or it just can't happen. So that's why we're coming to Kickstarter. Our other options are to borrow money from a bank or to find a rich investor, but neither of those options serves the fans well, and serving geekdom is priority #1. If we can run this as a project on Kickstarter, you will be guaranteed to have the most absolutely fan-friendly show that's ever happened. \nThis is how packed the panels were in April! We need more space!\nThis Kickstarter campaign is about creating an awesome experience for one weekend next year, and so the #1 thing we want to emphasize is that by backing us, you will be coming to the con. Every reward we offer involves admission to Awesome Con DC 2014. And you won't just be contributing money to the con, we'll take your input along the way while we're planning the con. Also, all Backers will get a swag bag with an exclusive con badge, an exclusive comic book, a show program with your name listed in the Backers' section, and an invitation to the Backers Only Panel at Awesome Con DC. This panel will probably be the greatest single fan event of all time. We've got some cool ideas for it, but they're top secret for now. \nIf we raise more than our goal, the extra money will go toward making the con bigger and better. We'll get more famous (and more expensive) guests. We'll do more special stuff after hours. The more you contribute to this campaign, the more you are helping to make Awesome Con even more awesome. \nEDIT 7/1/13: We've added two cool new benefits for all backers. \n1) Friday Preview Night. We will open the doors to the con in the late afternoon or evening for a preview of the con. All Kickstarter backers at Concerned Citizen or higher will get into Preview Night for no extra charge. We will probably put a limited number of tickets on sale for Preview NIght, but if you're a backer you get in for free. If we have enough backers (at this point it doesn't look like we will have enough), we will make it so that ONLY backers are allowed in on Preview Night. Either way, this will be a fantastic Friday to come to the con. It's a holiday weekend, traffic and parking in DC will be as good as you could possibly hope for on a weekday.\n2) After the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will send out the link to our room block at the Renaissance to backers at least one week before we publish the link on our website. Our rate is $139 + tax, that's the best rate I've ever seen at that hotel. Maybe they're trying to build a relationship with us because there's a new hotel opening up next year next to the Convention Center. I don't know, but $139 per night at a downtown DC four-star hotel is amazing, and it's within walking distance to the con (it's just across the square). I know it's not a huge perk, but if you're planning to travel to the con it can save you a few hundred dollars.\nThese two added benefits will ONLY happen if the Kickstarter campaign is funded. The con will still happen if we aren't funded, but we may have to scale back a few things that we want to do if we have to look somewhere else for funding. It will be Awesome regardless.\nGUESTS\nGeorge P\u00e9rez will be at Awesome Con!\nThe biggest question we've been asked so far is about guests. And the best answer for that question is that George P\u00e9rez will be at Awesome Con 2014. We are also talking to a lot more fantastic comics and media guests. Unfortunately, we can't announce any media guests to go along with this campaign. Due to filming schedules, most movie and TV actors won't be able to book earlier than 4-6 months before the con. We are in contact with a number of agents about a number of guests, and as their schedules permit, we will be confirming them. We are also in touch with a number of high-profile comic guests, and we can announce a few right now, and as we confirm them, we will continue to announce more. We expect a relatively large number of media guests (between 20-30), and even more comic guests. \nCONFIRMED GUESTS:\nGeorge P\u00e9rez\nBen Templesmith\nJustin Jordan\nSteve Conley\nGreg LaRocque\nNick Galifianakis\nMark Mariano\nIdentity Comics Studio\n-Jerry Gaylord\n-Penelope Gaylord\n-Bryan Turner\nThe Octopus Tree House\n-Paul Petyo\n-Jess Weiss\nCurls Studio\n-Carolyn Belefski\n-Joe Carabeo\nSuper Art Fight\n-Michael Bracco\n-Jamie Noguchi\n-Rosscott\nREWARDS\nNote: You can totally change your reward level at any time, if we've added a new one that you're interested in. Or if you're interested in more than one reward tier, let us know and we can figure out an additional amount to add to get both. \nConcerned Citizen and Superhero Assist\nThese tiers come with the exclusive Backer Swag Bag (badge, comic book, name in the program, invitation to Backers Only Panel), plus your badge gets you admission into the con. The Concerned Citizen Badge gets you in for one day. The Superhero Assist Badge gets you in for both days. You're not only helping us out, but you're also getting a sweet deal, considering that regular admission to Awesome Con for one day will be $30 and 2 days will be $50. \nEDIT: We've also added a few more variations of the Superhero Assist reward. We've got the Superhero Assist + T-Shirt for only $10 more, and also a 2-Pack and 4-Pack of the Superhero Assist + T-Shirt. Admirer of Art Superpowers is a new reward tier that's the same as Superhero Assist + T-Shirt, but you get original artwork (not a print, an original!!). You can also add the original art to any other reward tier by adding $50 to your pledge and sending us a note about it. \nConcerned Citizen and Superhero Assist Early Birds\nThese are the same as above but if you jump on early you get free exclusive comics. Concerned Citizens get the Awesome Con Variant Regular Show #1 from BOOM! Studios, and Superhero Assistants get the Awesome Con VIP Exclusive Adventure Time #15. They ship out within 6 weeks of the end of the campaign.\nArt Superpowers\nIf you've been splashed by radiation that left you with the Power Of Art, then you might want a table in our Artists' Alley. Backers at this tier get a 6' table at Awesome Con to sell their artwork, first dibs on table placement, and a swag bag with a Kickstarter Backer Artist badge, invitation to the Backers Only Panel, and an exclusive limited edition variant show program with a blank cover so you can design your own cover. Inside that program, you'll also see your name with a note next to it so that attendees know YOU BACKED US! You also get a second badge for an assistant. \nHere's some of 2013's VIP swag bag. With your help, 2014's will be even better!!\nSidekick, Vigilante, Superhero, and Omnipotent Super-Being\nThese tiers are kind of like VIP passes. Except they're better. And they offer rewards never before seen at a comic-con. At the Sidekick tier, you get an extra-sweet gift bag with the entire contents of the Superhero Assist reward, plus a coupon for free photo-op & autograph from a media guest (your choice), an exclusive comic or toy, and an exclusive t-shirt. You'll also get Sidekick benefits like early entry into the con and priority panel seating. At the Vigilante tier, you get all the same rewards and benefits of a Sidekick, but you'll also be invited to a catered party after the con on Saturday, where you get free food and you schmooze with staff and maybe some guests. At the Superhero tier, things start to get serious. If you are a Superhero, you have the ability to cut the line at every panel, and you can cut the line for autographs for every media guest (once per guest). We'll also mail you out a copy of every exclusive comic we've ever done for a con up to now (Adventure Time #1, Marceline #1, Revival #1, Doctor Who #1, Fionna & Cake #1, Adventure Time #15, Regular Show #1, Candy Capers #1, and TMNT: Animated Adventures #1), and a special 2013 Awesome Con program signed by 10 guests. At the Omnipitent Super-Being tier, your life changes. We basically treat you like a celebrity. You get a hotel room, you get all your meals covered, you get first dibs on everything. You can get into the green room and drink soda and eat sandwiches with some guests and staff. If there is a panel going on, and the room is full, we will make somebody leave so that you can go in. This is the level of access you get at this tier, and that's why there's only one available. Only select this reward if you are prepared to act like an absolute diva all weekend (just kidding, but seriously, you deserve it. TREAT YO SELF). \nThe Crossover Event of the Century\nSome people dream of a fairy tale wedding. Some people dream of a geek wedding at a comic-con. This reward is for the latter. Here are the basics: You and your fianc\u00e9 will get VIP treatment at Awesome Con 2014, including all the Sidekick rewards, plus two-nights' hotel stay (separate rooms Friday night, honeymoon suite Saturday). You also get a wedding ceremony and a reception for 50 guests at the show. That includes officiant, DJ, and catering. If you want to bring your own officiant, be my guest. We can go over the little details later, this is YOUR special day so we will make sure you have input on everything like the color of tablecloths and all that. Your guests will be allowed into the ceremony/reception without Awesome Con admission. Look, your new mother in-law just isn't into comic-cons, we get it. She can still come to the wedding.\nSecret Identity, Scientific Genius, Benevolent Industrial Titan, and Super-Spy Boss\nThese reward tiers are for exhibitors. If you'd like an exhibitor booth or booths at Awesome Con DC, you can choose from these four options. Exhibitors who back our Kickstarter get absolute first dibs on the placement of their booths. This is your chance to be one of the very first booths that attendees see as they walk into Awesome Con. These reward tiers also come with a swag bag which includes a Kickstarter Backer Exhibitor badge, invitation to the Backers Only Panel, and an exclusive limited edition variant show program with a blank cover. Inside that program, you'll also see your name with a note next to it so that attendees know YOU BACKED US! You also get two additional badges per booth. Backers get dibs on booth placement over people who purchase booths after this campaign ends (plus regular rates for booths go up $150 per booth when the campaign ends). Secret Identity is one 10'x10' interior booth. Scientific Genius is one 10'x10' corner booth. Benevolent Industrial Titan is 20'x10', one interior and one corner booth. Super-Spy Boss is a 20'x10' endcap, two corner spaces.\nIf you'd like more space than one or two booths, please contact us to determine the correct pledge amount for what you want. \nThis was the 2013 Exclusive T-Shirt. How cool will 2014's look??\nNew Reward Tiers\nWe added a few new reward tiers, here's some more info. \nHelpful Space Alien\nFor people who can't make it to the con; you get a downloadable Backers Badge that looks just like our admission badges, with EXCLUSIVE ARTWORK just for this tier! You'll also get an invite to a live stream of the Backers Only Panel (or if you end up purchasing a ticket later, you can come in person!). \nFormer Animal Now Mutated Into Human Size With Human IntelligenceThis reward is the same as the Helpful Space Alien reward, but you also get a copy of our exclusive TMNT: New Animated Adventures SDCC Exclusive comic book. If you want any copies of the other exclusives we've got (Fionna & Cake #1, Adventure Time #15, Regular Show #1, Candy Capers #1), just add another $15 to your reward level and send us a note. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis far out, there are still a lot of unknowns and there are still a lot of important questions we can't answer. We haven't booked very many guests yet, and the show falls on a major holiday, Easter. Also, nothing of this size has ever been done in DC. But that's not a risk, that's an opportunity. We are completely qualified to make this show happen, and to make it Awesome. The challenges we faced prior to the 2013 Awesome Con were actually more daunting, and we overcame them pretty handily. \n\nIn case you're worried, we are already in touch with the representatives of dozens of guests, and we'll stay in touch, so we should have guest confirmations as soon as the potential guests know what their film schedules are like in April 2014. The guest list WILL be fantastic, don't worry about that. If you look at other major cons around the country, 4-6 months beforehand is when they really start announcing guests, and we'll also probably keep adding guests up until a few weeks before the con.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Help back my new con - Star Con in Orlando, Florida", "update_content": "After Awesome Con 2014, I was pretty sure that was the last Kickstarter campaign I'd ever run.

We've also got a few backer levels for people who aren't able to make it to the con but would like some of the swag.

In five words: Advanced Strategy Cards for Chess. In more than five words...\nRogue Chess uses cards to modify the move and capture of chess pieces. Each card is specific to a certain chess piece and when played will modify that piece's move, capture, or add a special effect. Every round a player may use a card or move as normal. Once the card is played, the player discards it and draws a new one.\nThese cards are placed face up and everyone knows exactly what each other can do. In this way, you're still basically playing chess. Strategy is still king. However, you now have to play on your toes and by the seat of your pants. Rogue Chess will challenge your ability to adjust strategy much like actual battle. Because no plan survives contact with the enemy.\nRe-energize your current chess game. Maybe you like chess, maybe you used to like it. Question is, how much do you like it now? How long has it been since you've played chess? If it's been a while or you should get Rogue Chess and revitalize your game. Make chess fun again!\nLove chess already? Awesome! Get Rogue Chess and expand your game to a new level. With all of the revolving options that come about you will be forced to think on your feet and will help you think outside the box.\nEven if you are a chess purist you can still enjoy Rogue Chess. The game still works with the basic chess concepts. The only thing that breaks the basic concepts of chess is the chance of what cards you will get. That can be mitigated with a variant rule that I have created just for you!\nLast but certainly not least, what about those of you that have never played chess. Why not? Well, if it's because chess is boring then Rogue Chess might just change all of that for you. Adding these cards to your chess game gives it a whole new life. Kids love it because it adds a fun and exciting new element.\nI have designed over 100 different cards. Some of these are still being play tested but most are ready for the big time. A good chunk of the art is finished and as you can see the overall design and look of the decks are finished but I need time and money to tie this  up. While I do some of my art, I have to hire some of it out. I also cannot be trusted to edit my own work and professional editors are not cheap.\nI also need to purchase a bunch of the prototype decks to give out to my crack team of chess players in order for them to try and break the game. Any cards that don't cut it will be modified or tossed from the deck.\nThis is our first foray on Kickstarter and will be the herald to our Game Changer series of games.\nCheck out these links to some more videos showcasing how some of the individual cards work.\n+The Barbarian+\n\"I finally got a chance to test-play this game -- and it's awesome!!! I liked the idea, but how would it play out? (ha!) Turns out these cards make the game rock! It's still chess, and still very much a game of strategy. But the cards add twists and turns that force both players to adjust their tactics, just like real life. Not only do you need to account for the pieces on the board but now the cards the you have and your opponent has. It's an endorphin rush and you get another hit each time a card is played and a new one drawn.\"  ~ Harold Wylie, Prototype Engineer US Army.\nJust like the game of chess has six pieces, their are six reward levels. Each of these reward levels include all shipping costs with-in the continental United States. All overseas shipping will require additional.

Their moves will always consist of a Move, a Capture, and often times a special ability. When you pull a Champion, your opponent will wince. You get 6 additional cards to the Base Deck and 6 more to the Expansion Deck. That's a Champion per piece per deck.\nUNLOCKED! - Because I can!\nThe Arcane are power cards that are somewhat different than any of the other previous cards. The special abilities of these cards will generally directly effect your opponent in some way rather than the piece they are tied to. You get 6 additional cards to the Base Deck and 6 more to the Expansion Deck. That's an Arcane per piece per deck.\nUNLOCKED! - Because I can!\nThe Fates are event cards that effect the field of combat. The special abilities of these cards will generally have sweeping effects to your opponent's next round. You get 6 additional cards to the Base Deck and 6 more to the Expansion Deck. That's a Fate per piece per deck.\nThe \"T\" is a T-Shirt designed much like \"The King\" and \"The Queen\". This reward is only for the Bishop Level and up. You will have your choice of size and piece: Pawn, Knight, Bishop, or Rook. Sorry, the Queen and King are already spoken for.\nMore Stretch Goals will be listed as previous ones are met.\nTo track the Rogue Chess rollercoaster!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTheir could be delays with art work and editing but this is the least of my concerns. The game is solid, the lion's share of card design is finished, and the design concept of art is finished. Wrapping all of this up is fully under my control and I have several other avenues to use should any one of these run into delays.\n\nMy biggest concern is getting quality products on time. I have done some research on this and found that many people use Chinese printing companies because they are cheaper. However, not all companies created equal. I found some horror stories on-line about damaged product arriving and no way to get compensated without an international legal battle.\n\nAfter careful consideration and some digging, I have found a well established American company that delivers quality product on time. They are little more expensive but not prohibitively so. Weighing the options, I feel this is the right way to go. Being an American company is also important to me. Not only because I am a patriot but it also makes them relatively local. I can jump on a plane and knock on their front door if I have to.\n\nThis only concerns me because I have never done anything like this before. If I make goal, it will be no problem to get all my shipping out the door in an orderly manner. However, if I'm wildly successful, I will hire a fulfilment service to help get all of the products delivered properly, on time, and within budget. So, while I think I have this covered, it could present delays because of my newbie status. Rest assured, I will work my butt off to not allow this portion to get the best of me and I have several friends in the industry that can help me through this process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Final PDF", "update_content": "Everyone should have gotten their stuff by now other than the PDFs.

We appreciate every donation to this film.  With under a week left every extra dollar we raise will make this film that much better.  Keep the donations coming!!\nWe've been getting some amazing press. Our film was featured on SpikeTV.com, Nerdist.com, i09.com, Primary Ignition, Beyond the Marquee, Film School Rejects, Planet5D, Slashfilm.com, Movieviral.com, Cinemabyte.com, filmpulse.net, Geektyrant.com, Hasslein Books & Giant Freaking Robot.\nYou can make it happen. Your support makes it possible for our veteran production team to bring this unique documentary to life over the next two years. You have the chance to make this film project a reality and get it ready in time for its premier at the 30th anniversary celebration of the Back to the Future franchise.\nThat's right. This documentary is such a big deal to the Back to the Future community that over two years in advance of the \u201cWe're Going Back\u201d celebration, its already booked to premier. You can be a part of that. Heavy, huh?\nWe, and many others across the world, think that Back to the Future has been one of the most culturally influential films in movie history. By backing this project you're sending a message: Back to the Future is an important piece of Hollywood history and Americana, and should be given the attention it deserves. You're telling us\u2014and hopefully all your friends\u2014that this movie franchise is deserving of a closer look at all it has meant to millions of movie fans worldwide, and what that translates to in terms of greater cultural impact.\nIf \u201c1.21 gigawatts,\u201d \u201c88 miles per hour,\u201d \u201cflux capacitor,\u201d and other such phrases from the movies have come out of your mouth, or landed on your ears, you've felt the impact of this series; films which surely number among the quintessential pieces of cinematography from the latter half of the 1980's. The importance of this documentary film can't go understated as we ask YOU to help us finish the project the way we've envisioned it.\nBut don't worry. It may be your density...err, destiny...to back this project and make Back in Time a reality, but if you close the Kickstarter project without backing nothing bad will happen. We promise. Still, if you're awakened by Darth Vader from the planet Vulcan threatening to melt your brain if you don't pledge, we hear that logging in to back us will probably get rid of him.\nDitching the scary alien nocturnal visitation isn't the only benefit you can get from backing the film though. We have a load of great perks for our backers. Like these swell Gildan soft-style tees in your choice of Sport Grey or Kickstarter Green. Exclusive to backers of this campaign, the iconic imagery leaves no doubt about how you feel about Back to the Future.\nA real movie deserves a real movie poster, and we've got a draft ready to show you. The credits will be updated before the final version ships (remember:  only two Executive Producer credit is up for grabs, so get it before its gone) and trust us: it'll look even better in person than it does on your screen.    \nHeavy, we know. You're totally convinced, and you're going to pledge before you leave the site. So thank you for your support. If our calculations are correct, when this baby hits $33,100...you're gonna see some serious shit. And unlike the Time Machine, when we pass the requisite number, good things just keep coming, so don't stop letting people know about the opportunity to support this piece of documentary history in the making. \nSo, after you back the project you should follow Back in Time on Twitter, and use the #BackinTimeFilm hashtag to tweet about the project. Make sure to like the Back in Time page on Facebook and\u2014of course\u2014share our status updates as we keep you appraised during the Kickstarter campaign and beyond. Plus, you should absolutely check out the Back in Time film site for news as we move into production of the documentary.\nWatch the trailer on Youtube.\nStill curious? Read on to discover more about Back in Time, and our team.\nThe first time I ever encountered a DeLorean in person I was shocked and amazed at the attention it drew. As a filmmaker, and a lover of the trilogy, that fateful event compelled me to examine what precisely the cultural impact of Back to the Future has truly been across the decades since it was released. I knew right then what the focus of any true documentary about the series would need to be: the Time Machine itself. That beautiful DeLorean.\nWith the 30th anniversary of the original film's release creeping steadily nearer, I knew that it was the right moment for this project. 30 is a big, magical number in the trilogy. 2015 is the year Marty, Jennifer, and Doc Brown travel to in Part II. If ever there were a moment to hit the gas and make the jump, it was now.\n So I got the best people I could find who were also passionate about making this a reality. I found people inside the fanatic BTTF community and found that the more excited they got, the more I knew how right this project was. The more myself and the rest of the crew became, the more wound up the community folks ended up. \nWe're generating just about 1 gigawatt of electricity right now between the crew and the BTTF community folks we've managed to wrangle into working with us on this project. All we need is some passionate fans of the trilogy to help us get that last 0.21 gigawatts of power.\nI'm pretty sure you're up to it.\nIn return for that support, we've got an amazing documentary planned out (and extra ideas aplenty for when we blow past our goal at 88 miles per hour) which includes interviews with some really prominent people in Back to the Future circles. From pillars of the fan community to cast and crew of the films. We've even got eyes on an original Time Machine. (Yes, the only privately-owned which happened to have been DeLorean featured in our trailer. It's the star of the film!)\nWhile the film would have been fun, and relatively easy to produce on our own (with the amazing crew we've got, this isn't a film we're making for challenge, but love) yet it is a project we know can really become so much more if we hand it over to the fans of the series.\nThe extent of the excitement we've seen generated even in pre-production has been as phenomenal as the original films. With as passionate and loyal a fan base as Back to the Future enjoys, we felt it would be doing the community we're filming a disservice if we didn't throw our arms open and invite anyone who wanted to be a part of this piece of filmmaking history a chance.\nPlus, we know that the more we exceed the goal of the Kickstarter by, the bigger a production this film becomes. We could have made a shoestring film which was amazing in its own right, but the truth is that we wanted to give the BTTF community and fans around the world the kind of documentary the series truly deserves. Something big. Something exciting.\n So, with that in mind, we've got our eyes on some amazing heights if we can get the backing we know this project is likely to manage. More crew, more travel, more interviewees, more interviews, more bonus features, oh, and more more.\nAll that remains is for you to pledge, and tell everyone about this amazing opportunity to help produce this unique documentary.\nLike I said, we have a long, long list of \u201coh, and if we get the money\u201d folks lined up for if the funding goes really well. But there are some absolutes we can share with you right now. So, of the 10-15 folks we plan to interview in any eventuality, here's a handful of names we're willing to share:\nBob Gale \u2013 Co-writer and creator of Back to the Future.  One of the largest advocates of the film to this day.\nJoe Walser \u2013 Joe is a Time Machine owner, the leader of the Time Machine Restoration project, and an organizer of the We're Going Back fan celebration.\nKen Kapalowski \u2013 Ken is also a Time Machine owner and organizer of We're Going Back.\nTerry & Oliver Holler \u2013 An amazing couple whose Time Machine travels have taken them throughout 4 countries (and 49 of the 50 United States so far!) and raised over $100,000.00 for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research so far. \nBill & Patrick Shea \u2013 THE Time Machine Owners. These car enthusiasts have the only privately-owned DeLorean Time Machine which was used in the Back to the Future movies. (These two can be seen in our video trailer above.)\nStephen Clark \u2013 The owner/founder of BTTF.com, Stephen has been involved in promotion of the trilogy for over two decades.\nOnce we have more confirmations, we'll be announcing more names. We have some really great ones in the works that we're very excited about.\nThe inestimable duo of Joe Walser and Ken Kapalowski have given us their blessings\u2014and excited ones at that\u2014to premier Back in Time at the 30th anniversary We're Going Back festivities in Los Angeles in October 2015. This is an event that you need to see to believe, and with the power of the number 30 in BTTF, it's unlikely that an event like this will ever be topped.\nWe feel truly blessed to have this kind of a venue for the premier of our documentary, and the pressure of making something truly fantastic has the entire production team a little giddy.\nOf course if you're unable to get to Los Angeles (and if you can, you should, just look at this) we'll be sending copies to our backers (at least $10 for a digital copy) the day after the premier. So you can watch it in the comfort of your own home, or take your copy to a friend's house to enjoy with some popcorn and a Back to the Future movie, or three.\nJason Aron / Director \u2013 Jason has been active in filmmaking for the past decade, and his work has been seen by hundreds of thousands of viewers. He has a background in the professional sports sector, having interviewed everyone from team owners down through players across diverse organizations. With an interest in the film series which dates back to recording the first Back to the Future film\u2014line by line\u2014on a tape recorder, Jason's commitment to the material of this documentary is second to none.\nLouis Krubich / Executive Producer \u2013 Louis spent half a decade working in production for various companies\u2014primarily MTV Networks\u2014before becoming one of the principals at Hoboken-based production startup Malka Media Group. The company provides production services for a broad range of industries, including sports, music, education, charity, and more. While at Viacom he worked with a small team dedicated to creating custom promotional content for upcoming blockbuster films, an experience he plans to put to good use on this project.\nAdam F. Goldberg / Co-Producer - Adam is a film and television and producer writer in Los Angeles. His screenplays include Fanboys, The Jetsons, Aliens in the Attic, The Muppet Wizard of Oz, How To Train Your Dragon, and the upcoming Flat Stanley and The Berenstain Bears. He also created the TV series Breaking In for Fox and and written on shows such as Community, Aliens In America and Voltron Force. His new series \"The Goldbergs\" is premiering on ABC this fall after \"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.LD\".\nGreg Lassik / Lead Cinematographer \u2013 Greg's New Jersey-based Endless Wave Studios has been in the business of telling stories for more than ten years. His unique specialty is in telling the story of couples embarking on the next phase of their lives by creating moving wedding stories. The veteran eye he brings to the project will no doubt prove invaluable during our various Back in Time's travels. (...time travels. *rimshot*)\nBen Carey / Director of Photography \u2013 Ben is a graduate of the NYU Tisch School of the Arts. He's made his mark on the production scene in New York city, having worked on hundreds of projects. Everything from music videos to commercials, and shorts to full length features has been his bread and butter since he started his professional career. A man of many talents, he's as comfortable with hanging the lightning as he is with designing the scenery or getting behind the camera.\nOther Crew\nAllen Calmes / Composer: Original Score\nJhah M. Balmaceda / Artist: Original Artwork\nJordan Rosengarten / Special Adviser\nMathew Reuther / Press Writer\nKickstarted Crew Members / Making Amazing Film\nWe've worked with amazing talents throughout our careers. Some of those folks would be a great fit for the Back in Time film, but we need your help to reach and exceed our funding goals in order to get them in on the process. It's through the amazing support and passion of Back to the Future fans that we'll be able to make the kind of film this documentary deserves.\n Now, we're gonna make like a tree and get outta here, because we've got to get Back in Time.\nBut before you split, don't forget to pledge!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilmmaking is a notoriously slippery slope. Issues in shooting can, and do, crop up. But part of being a professional, and being a part of a veteran team, is knowing that you\u2014and everyone else involved with the production\u2014are capable of rolling with the punches.\n\nFunding is always a question for a film, and we absolutely need the money we're asking for in order to make the kind of film the Back to the Future trilogy deserves. \n\nLikewise, many production challenges can be encountered along the way before a production even gets to shooting. Yet here, with the Back in Time project, we've done a great deal of work already. We have a venue for the premier. We have commitments from many interviewees, and are in active negotiations with a number of others.\n\nAll in all we've done everything we can to get the project in a prime position to succeed before asking people to back it. We're confident that we have prepared as well as it is possible to prepare for the production process over the next two years, and we're eager to have you along to back us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Full Video of the Shea's BTTF Collection Livestream!", "update_content": "That's right, the wait is almost over!

We are also pinball fanatics. For the last seven years, we\u2019ve been developing modern videogame recreations of classic pinball tables. We have licenses from the original manufacturers of the tables (Bally, Gottlieb, Stern and Williams) to do this. Our latest project is called the Pinball Arcade and is currently available on a wide variety of platforms: the iPhone, iPad, Android, Kindle Fire, Ouya, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PS Vita and Mac, with versions coming soon for the PC, Nintendo Wii U, and PlayStation 4.

We first acquire the actual physical pinball table we want to digitize. We want our videogame version to play exactly the same as the table played when it was new, so we start with a restoration of the table. We then strip the table down to the bare wood playfield and take high-resolution digital photographs of every part. We use these to create three-dimensional computer models of each of the components on the playfield. When the modeling is complete we export the data into our graphics engine, which displays the table on each of our target platforms. \nNext, we implement the table logic and sound. We do this by emulating the electronics from the original pinball tables. Most complex tables were controlled by what are by modern standards primitive computers. We\u2019ve created ROM-emulation technology that allows the same program that controlled the original table to run on our target devices. This means that every rule, sound effect and light sequence is exactly correct in our digital version. The idea that you can run the original code that controlled a huge cabinet-based pinball machine on your iPhone is pretty cool!\n\nThe last step in digitizing a table involves tuning the pinball physics. We\u2019ve continuously improved our pinball physics engine for the last seven years and we\u2019re very proud of it. We can individually control reflection angles and physics parameters for every section of any component on the playfield. We use the original table as reference when doing this to ensure accuracy. Finally, the table goes through a review process where it\u2019s critiqued by pinball experts and approved by the table manufacturer. The end result of this painstaking process is an exact digital recreation of the pinball table you can play on your handheld device or in your living room!\nWhat we\u2019re most proud of is that we\u2019re preserving these tables for future generations to enjoy. We can remember when these tables were in every arcade, pizza parlor and bowling alley, but they are becoming increasingly rare. If you find one, chances are it\u2019s not been well-treated and many features are burned out or broken. If you\u2019re a pinball fanatic like us you can buy one and restore it, but they are expensive, maintenance-intensive, and there are fewer of them every year. In fact some of these tables can cost more than $15,000!  We want everyone to be able to appreciate these tables, not only people who can afford to spend as much money on a pinball table as a car.  Chances are very good that our children will never get the opportunity to appreciate the great pinball table we did- unless these tables are digitally preserved.\nSome of the greatest pinball tables were based on licensed properties. Often when a manufacturer created a special new table they\u2019d base it on a popular cultural feature of the times: a movie, a band or television show. Their original license to use these properties have long since expired, so when we want to create digital versions of these tables we must research who now owns the rights and negotiate with them. Sometimes the discussions are easy and sometimes they are very difficult. In addition if the table features actors on the backglass or playfield we must secure licenses to use their likenesses (sometimes from their estates if they are deceased). Some table also featured popular music of the times that we must secure composition and performance licenses for. It can be a daunting task!\nOne of the licensed tables that we\u2019ve always wanted to digitize is Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This table was released by Williams in 1991 and is unquestionably one of the greatest pinball tables of all time. It was designed by the legendary Steve Ritchie (who also designed Firepower, Black Knight, High Speed, and Star Trek: The Next Generation).  T2 was the first game by Williams to use a dot-matrix display. The table was also the first game to feature a video mode and a swing out cannon that can be fired by the player. It's one of our favorite tables ever!\nWe\u2019ve succeeded in negotiating all of the licenses we\u2019d need to digitize Terminator 2: Judgment Day and bring it to the Pinball Arcade. Unfortunately there are several licenses involved: in addition to the Williams license, we need a license for the Terminator 2 property, the actor likeness of the Terminator (Arnold Schwartzenegger) on the backglass and play field, and the right to use the actor voiceovers during gameplay.  When we add up the costs of each required license and calculate what we\u2019d have to charge for the table, we\u2019ve realized that the Terminator 2: Judgment Day is just not commercially viable. The more we charge for the table the fewer people will be able to buy it- and our goal is to expose as many people as possible to this great table, not just a select few.\nHere\u2019s where you come in!  The licenses for Terminator 2: Judgment Day will cost $66,000 (and that\u2019s just for the licenses- we\u2019ll cover all of the development expenses ourselves). Thanks to the amazing generosity of pinball fans throughout the world, our previous Kickstarter project for the Star Trek: The Next Generation pinball table raised $7,000 more than we needed for the Star Trek: licenses and we're applying this towards the license costs of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. If we can raise the remaining $59,000 we\u2019ll be able to digitize Terminator 2: Judgment Day and preserve one of the greatest pinball tables of all time. If we don't reach our goal no credit cards will be charged, but if we raise more then the goal we\u2019ll be able to digitize other licensed tables as well, including the next table we'd really like to pursue- Bally's incredible classic The Addams Family!\nWe\u2019ve put together a tempting list of rewards to say \u201cthank you\u201d for helping out. Plus the top five contributors will get their initials featured as the default high scores for the table, immortalizing them as true pinball fanatics! Please join us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've digitized over 20 of these tables, and we are very confident in our ability to deliver a digital version of the Terminator 2 table that our fans will enjoy. However, the process of creating these tables is very complex and delays sometimes occur. We're targeting a release date of August 2013, but it's possible this date might slip if we encounter unforeseen problems in development. Also, the lead time for deployment on some platforms (particularly the consoles) is longer, so it is likely the table will release later on these platforms.\n\nIn addition, we have had problems in the past with deployment on some platforms. In particular, our publisher for the Xbox 360 version of the Pinball Arcade filed for bankruptcy last year, and we have been unable to ship new tables for the 360 since then as we fight in court for the return of the publishing rights. We are highly confident that we will be able to deliver the Terminator 2 table on the Xbox 360, but we can't say with certainty when that will be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "New Kickstarter: Pinball Invaders!", "update_content": "FarSight Studios has just launched a Kickstarter to bring you a NEW pinball experience by Trick Gaming Studios!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "New Kickstarter: AC/DC\u00ae Pinball", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Wii U North America Release 4/21", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Pinball Arcade: Doctor Who", "update_content": "Hey Everyone!\nWe will be live streaming the new Addams Family\u2122 pinball today (2/19) at 3:00pm PST!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Pinball Arcade coming back to 360!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Addams Family\u2122 Twitch Stream", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Season Two Released on PS4!

With your support, we could also develop Taxi Journey on Linux, android & iOS tablets, PSN and Xbox.\nBehind TAXI JOURNEY lies a treasure trove of memories \u2013 the immense joy and pleasure we had playing games such as Limbo, Braid and Machinarium.\nLet\u2019s not forget that Lexis has a very experienced team. In fact, it has been developing games for over 20 years and has earned the trust of publishers such as Ubisoft, Namco Bandai and even Disney.\nUniverse\nTAXI JOURNEY is an original game somewhere between an adventure game and a puzzle game. It is set in a universe that combines charm, humor and mystery.\nGino, a big guy who doesn't say much, is a rather odd taxi driver. Having no money, he can only afford a car without an engine and without a passenger seat so he has to carry his clients on his back and pedal instead of drive.\nIt all begins when he encounters Zoe, a strange little girl with mysterious powers, who takes him to strange and distant lands where they meet a host of loveable and funny characters as well as some rather disturbing ones who will do anything to stop them.\nCompletely drawn in pencil, Taxi presents a very strong and personal graphic universe. It takes its inspiration from different movies and games such as the movies of Tim Burton and Myasaki and the very beautiful Limbo.\nGameplay\nThe aim of this game is to get Zoe to her destination by bypassing various obstacles using the laws of physics (dexterity), finding solutions to situations (puzzles) and interacting with various characters - but only by working together will Gino and Zoe succeed.\nWhile Gino is at the wheel, Zoe can throw magic projectiles or put up her protective umbrella \u2013 the two characters make a perfect team. Like Limbo, Braid or Machinarium, TAXI JOURNEY relies on dexterity and thought processes.\nBut in TAXI JOURNEY, we are keen to focus on the story and the \u201cadventure\u201d dimension. As you advance in the game by solving puzzles and bypassing obstacles, we also want you to be moved by Gino and Zoe\u2019s budding friendship and feel genuinely concerned about their plight.\nKey features\nA universe full of charm, humor and mystery \nA truly touching story\nExciting puzzles that will test your little grey cells \nQuests and byroads \nAn experienced team that has already published numerous games\nDesigning a campaign for KickStarter is a way to fund the development of TAXI JOURNEY and create a memorable game. But it\u2019s not just a question of money.\nWe are keen to have your input throughout the production stage and get your feedback on our decisions and choices.

We're Blind Ferret and we make comics. You may have heard of Least I Could Do, Looking For Group, Gutters, Something Positive, Hijinks Ensue and The Bear? Well, that's us. On this project we've got:\nRyan Sohmer on writing duty.\nLar deSouza on art direction.\nRandal Milholland as a producer and editor.\nand Ariadne MacGillivray as everything else.\nPaladin Studios\nWe are Paladin Studios, an indie game developer based in The Netherlands. We create games that make you smile - be it a sweet twinkle, loud laugh, or evil grin. For LFG that will be an evil grin. You may know us from Momonga Pinball Adventures, a pinball game where you join a flying squirrel on an epic adventure to save his tribe.\nWell look at you with all the questions! \"Looking For Group\" or LFG is an award-winning comic available for free online. It is a fantasy based comic that features characters that will seem familiar if you are a fan of role playing games both pen and paper or video game in nature. It updates twice a week, Monday and Thursday. You can click here and flip through the archives to better familiarize yourself with the comic. Go ahead, I'll wait. \nIt is written by the eccentric Ryan Sohmer and the ursine Lar deSouza. \nLFG & The Fork of Truth is a 4-player co-op video game based in the LFG universe. It will be available on the PC, Mac and Linux. You had best believe that we will be porting it to consoles and tablets if certain stretch goals are met! You could play the game solo but I'd be lying if I said it would be as fun. You and your friends get to play the parts of Cale, Richard, Benny and Krunch as you run around Legarion. I know that everyone will want to play as Richard and a few friendship will be lost because of this. We feel like the game will be worth those lost friendships. And you can always get more friends, right?\nIt is a top-down button masher, a bit like Gauntlet, and will start with 12 playable levels. Each level will be a different area of Legarion. I say 'start with' because, well maybe you should just check the stretch goals at the bottom. \nYou and your group will burn down villages and cut a swath through farmland! Or you could do fetch quests for farmers and help people with goblins. It's really up to you.\nYou will interact with familiar faces and visit recognizable places. You will yield legendary weapons from the comic and you'll find some shiny new weapons with which to stab people. \nThe game takes place between issues 1 and 12 of the comic and will be like a side-story. Some of the those unanswered questions from the comics may just find their answers in the game *winky face*!\nMan, enough of this reading. Am I right? Pictures please!\nThis world is starting to take shape! But what will everyone sound like?\nExciting, right? Just look at these screen caps, aren't you excited as heck to play this game?!\nLet's get down to the nitty-gritty.\nA very good question. We have produced an exquisite pie-chart to show you how the $600,000 will be used:\nSeriously, look at how good this pie chart looks!\nHere is a fun interview with Sohmer and Derk for The Jace Hall Show: http://www.jacehallshow.com/news/gaming/preview/20130625/ridiculously-silly-violent-universe-lfg-fork-truth/\nWe got a fun write-up on Incgamers.com : http://www.incgamers.com/2013/06/looking-for-loot-lfg-web-comic-series-launches-rpg-kickstarter\nAnother interview with Sohmer, this time for MMORPG.com : http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/7544/Looking-for-Group-Fork-of-Truth-Interview.html\nNew interview with Sohmer! This one is from Tentonhammer.com: https://www.tentonhammer.com/interviews/ryan-sohmer-on-the-LFG-game\nQ: Shut up and take my money! Which level should I choose?\nA: If you just want to get your hands on the game, the $25 digital download reward is perfect (or if you\u2019re an early bird you can get it for $20!). There\u2019s also a $50 tier where you get in-game goodies. If you\u2019re looking for a bigger package, you should definitely have a look at the $100 Physical Goodies reward - it\u2019s got a Richard figurine and the digital download. If you\u2019re a really big fan, check out the $175 Collector\u2019s Edition reward - it has a signed boxed version of the game and all the other stuff you get in the lower tiers. There\u2019s other rewards too - go check it out!\nQ: What genre is the game?\nA: It\u2019s a top-down action RPG, with a focus on 4-player cooperative play.\nQ: Which platforms can I play it on?\nA: Fork of Truth will initially be available on PC, Mac and Linux. We have stretch goals for ports to other platforms - including consoles and tablets. \nQ: Why does Richard sound different from the shorts?\nA: Well, he\u2019s the same guy, but in the game he\u2019s not singing. At least not all of the time.\nQ: What kind of co-op will it be? Internet? LAN? Couch?\nA: For the PC that\u2019s LAN and online. But if we get to do the console ports, it's going to be good old-fashioned couch multiplayer. Just grab the controls and some pizza, and you should be good to go.\nQ: Can I also play alone?\nA: Yes, but we haven\u2019t made up our minds on how that works yet. It could be a lonely adventure, or perhaps some nifty A.I. teammates or hot-switching between characters. Either way, it\u2019s going to be more fun when you play together. Time to get some friends!\nQ: For the NPC level, how important will this NPC be?\nA: We\u2019ll give the NPC a good spot in the game - perhaps a questgiver for a sidequest. It depends on the design and name, it has to fit the world somehow. But we\u2019ll come up with something nice :-)\nQ: It says that Sohmer has veto rights, but I do want to get my ideas into the game.\nA: For all the higher-level rewards (Blacksmith and upward), we will contact you to get your ideas on how you want your weapon / character / tavern etc designed. We will do our best to incorporate it in the LFG world, but we need to keep the final word on what is acceptable and what isn\u2019t. In addition, there might technical limitations that we have to work with. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a collaborative effort and we\u2019ll work it out with you so that everybody\u2019s happy!\nWe really do.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur first and foremost priority is to deliver a game that does justice to the world of LFG. To us, that means it has to convey the essence of LFG: The heroes, the humour, and the \u201clook and feel\u201d of the LFG world in general. \n\nTo find this sweet spot, we can design things that look awesome on paper. But in reality we will need to get our hands dirty and test our hypotheses. So we will prototype the heck out of every little idea, and use playtesting sessions to gather feedback and see if it works.\n\nThis explorative approach has the risk of becoming too open-ended. This is why we work with Scrum, a management methodology that allows for rapid iteration and experimentation, while staying focused on results. We will learn and innovate along the way, but we will do so within a rigid framework of sprints, daily standup meetings, reviews and retrospectives. We will keep you posted on our updates, and as a backer you will be able to post feedback and suggestions. We will always take your comments to heart when making decisions. \n\nIt is possible that a situation occurs where we reach a dead end or where we need to rewrite parts of the game. If this happens late in the project, we potentially suffer from delays and/or budget issues. We would rather fail early, so we counter this by doing as much testing as possible before we scale up the team and go into production mode. In other words: Only when the core design issues have been solved, and when the storyline and game mechanics are complete, do we ramp up the team and proceed to the production phase. The production phase is also based on Scrum, but with clearly set production milestones that encompass multiple sprints.\n\nThe final risk is quality. We will support several platforms from the start, and this makes Quality Assurance an important part of the project. The solution is to involve an external QA team early on in the development process. We also schedule plenty of dedicated QA time at the end of the project, to make sure the game is meeting industry standards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ryan Sohmer\n12 created \u00b7 109 backed\nRyan Sohmer is the award-winning author of the comics \"Looking for Group\", \"Least I could Do\" and \"The Bear\".See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Thank you!

We've made one for you!\nOZombie is a narrative-driven action-adventure game set within an alternate version of the Oz universe created by L. Frank Baum. The game's themes and characters are inspired by Baum\u2019s deeply imaginative books (all 14 of them!) then filtered through the story and art treatment you've seen applied to our other games like Alice: Madness Returns and Akaneiro: Demon Hunters.\nOZombie will be first and foremost a single player game.

Join the fight against Scarecrow and his demented minions and restore the ruined world of Oz to its former glory. . \n\n\"Emerald City\" in background -- illus.\n\nWhile inspired by Baum, our Oz will be a non-conformist version, distinct from both his original, and ALL subsequent adaptations (including American\u2019s Oz project, which Atari killed nearly a decade ago). Honoring Baum\u2019s sublime vision, Oz is a real place, rather than a young girl\u2019s dream. That idea was an MGM invention.\nOur antagonist is Scarecrow, once king of the Emerald City, later ousted in a coup, and eventually exiled to a life of solitude, despite being described as \"the wisest man in all Oz.\" There's a lot of frustration, misunderstanding and rage contained within his life's journey. After enduring such insults, who can blame him for wanting to retake his rightful position and establish an Oz where his intelligence and rule will never again be questioned?\nOur Oz is mystical, filled with magic, enchantment, and a vast collection of unique \u201cOzite\u201d artifacts. Where Scarecrow holds sway, you\u2019ll find adapted and evolved hardware imported by visitors from other lands, usually represented in a style called \"steampunk,\" which has its own particular look and feel. Other countries still under resistance retain much of the beauty of Oz.\nThe Land of Oz, as in the books, is divided into four diverse countries, with four distinctive populations \u2013 Munchkins are in the East, Winkies in the West; Gillikins in the North and Quadlings in the South. At the center of Oz you'll find the legendary Emerald City, the capital and home to the ruler of Oz. Beyond these native territories and the deadly deserts that surround them are many more lands to be explored.\n\"Map of the Countries Near to the Land of Oz\" -- illus.\nOur Oz, distant and remote, is an island set in the Pacific Ocean. Freed from the constraints and conventions of Western culture, we can explore themes of society and self-reliance in a sort of 'clean room' environment. Dorothy will arrive by boat, a refugee from a world on the brink of ecological and societal collapse\nDorothy in a boat \"Back to Oz\" -- illus,\n\"A new Dorothy for a new Oz\" -- illus.\nAs a kid I was a huge fan of Robert Heinlein\u2019s stories. There are several \"Heinlein themes\" that I like and want to explore: Individual liberty and self-reliance, the obligation individuals owe to their societies (and vice versa), the influence of organized religion on society - and the tendency of society to repress nonconformist thought. Hence, \"zombies\" are destroying Oz in a mindless (heh) fashion, without thinking of the future consequences of their actions. The fact that they are \"zombies\" or that their leader is obsessed with \"brains\" is less about the traditional \"brain eating\" concept of zombies and more about mindless conformist behavior.\nThe Immortals of Oz will play important roles in the larger narrative theme - Ak, the Master Woodman and Bo, the Master Mariner - represent various aspects of nature and balance in Oz. When Dorothy arrives, Scarecrow has already managed to murder Kern, the Master Husbandman, god of farming. \nAfter converting most of the Land of Oz to his faction, Scarecrow now seeks to destroy the remaining Immortals. He fights to free Oz from \"lazy magic\" and to begin a new era where \"life matters because there is death.\" His idea of utopia is one where creativity, passion and imagination are evil and should be repressed. Mindless repetitive activities and Luddite prejudices align with his goals. Happiness comes from conformity.\nNot zombies of the flesh-eating variety, OZombie seeks to speak to the individual who goes about their daily life oblivious to the socio-political forces that shape and determine the quality of life. In his search for brains, Scarecrow has turned the peoples of Oz into mindless automatons, one and all.\nThe OZombies sing a siren's song (do a dance, cast a spell, worship an object?) other Ozites cannot resist. By the time Dorothy arrives most Ozites have forgotten why they still bother to resist - defeat seems inevitable, things are too far gone and hey... being an OZombie isn't all that bad.  \n\"Scarecrow\" -- illus.\nScarecrow has infected a larger society in which survival has become the only value; do anything to survive is the mantra that all his followers conform to and perpetuate. So killing him is neither victory nor resolution. Dorothy will have to do much more -- build communities and persuade allies to root out and destroy the damage to multiple cultural and political institutions to restore a humanistic civilization. The return of individual integrity, responsibility, and non-conformity is arduous and dangerous.\nThis is Dorothy's challenge. This is YOUR challenge. \nThis is me with RJ Berg on a trip to meet Chairman Mao. RJ is a founding partner in Spicy Horse and has been my creative partner since we were teamed up at Electronic Arts over 14 years ago. Apparently, Mao is dead. \nAt EA, RJ and I worked together to create the world, characters and narrative for American McGee's Alice. When development on Alice finished EA fired RJ (after 15 years of employment) and allowed the game's developer, Rogue Entertainment, to go out of business. In protest I quit my position at EA and went independent with RJ. Since then we've worked on crafting stories for games like \"Grimm,\" \"Alice: Madness Returns,\" \"Akaneiro: Demon Hunters\" and other Spicy Horse projects. We collaborate on all things story, but tend to divide our efforts between major story elements and arcs (which I largely drive) and dialog (which RJ largely writes). This collaboration has served us and our products well.\nWhen it comes to themes, a lot of my \"narrative voice\" comes from my own youth, which might be described as \"troubled.\" Fortunately, RJ understands quite well the parts of my past that drive the dark inspiration for stories like \"Alice.\" It's against this backdrop and via this creative collaboration that I feel mine and RJ's best storytelling is done. Following in what's become a tradition for our games, OZombie will encourage players to explore themes and challenges related to independence, personal identity, coming of age, trust, overcoming adversity, and perseverance.\nSpicy Horse Games was founded in 2007 and has developed a diverse collection of games across PS3, 360, PC, Mac, Linux, web and mobile. Almost all of our games have contained a \"twisted fairytale\" theme because it's a narrative and artistic domain we feel comfortable exploring. With a focus on interesting projects and high quality of life for our employees, we've managed to attract and retain some of the best and brightest artists, animators, programmers and developers from around China and the globe.\nSpicy Horse has the longest and most distinguished tenure of all the indie Western development studios in Shanghai. We have established a reputation for delivering unique games, built a positive development culture and proven that indie development in China is not only possible, but highly rewarding for everyone involved.\nMysterious, maybe a little ominous, The Box is rumored to hold secrets related to OZombie and/or Alice: Otherlands. Only American knows for sure. Pandora and Jim's attempts to open The Box resulted in pain and frustration. What they didn't know is that only a magic number can open The Box. That magic number is 6000. When our campaign hits 6000 backers The Box will open and its secrets, whatever they may be, will be revealed. The Box will then be free to choose another owner and to hold a fresh cargo of secrets.\nThe Box\n1st Stretch Goal: 6000 Backers, we will open the Box!\n2nd Stretch Goal: 11,000 Backers, Chris Vrenna joins to compose the soundtrack!\n3rd Stretch Goal:  \nThese items can be purchased in addition to your tier pledge.

That's over 2 quadrillion  times more permutations than the original 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube for all you cube geeks, over 208 billion  moles of permutations for all you chemistry geeks, and all you math geeks can check my math.\nThe X-Cube Scrambled\nThe X-Cube was invented using a 3D printer. Now that the X-Cube has been prototyped, I want to share it with everyone. This is a fundraising campaign to bring the X-Cube to mass production.\nHow are you going to mass produce and sell the X-Cube?\nYou can preorder an X-Cube by pledging to the campaign.\nA friend of mine, Scott Brown, is the head of product development for Marbles the Brain Store. Marbles is a chain of stores based out of Chicago that sells all types of brain games. I reached out to Scott and he said he would be thrilled to carry the X-Cube in stores.\nHe even introduced me to a trusted manufacturer in Hong Kong. This manufacturer has given me a quote for injection molding, assembly, and packaging. That's where the fundraising goal came from.\nI'll be updating the production process at http://xcubeproject.blogspot.com/.\nAnd you're letting us download the files to print one? \nYep. The X-Cube was was born on a 3D printer. Even if you don't want to print one, you can view the STL Files (using STL viewing software) and find out how the X-Cube works. Pay what you want to support the Kickstarter and you get to download the files!\nMy mission is to show that 3D printing technology is a powerful tool for bringing an idea to life and sharing an invention with the world.\nThis technology allows me to share my invention with audiences I would never have been able to reach before. The internet now allows inventors to share their work with a vast new audience in the same way artists and musicians can share theirs. By making this project open source, it can become bigger than I could ever hope to make it by myself.\nI hope people get as excited about the X-Cube as they did with the Rubik's Cube. I hope the project gets people excited about 3D printing technology. I hope it changes the way we share ideas and bring them to life.\nX-Cube Wireframe View (via Solidworks)\nDigital assembly of the X-Cube (via IGS Viewer)\nHow did you get the idea for the X-Cube?\nWhen I was in the 7th grade, a teamate of mine in FIRST Lego Robotics  taught me how to solve a Rubik's Cube. It became my first true love. We sat together every day on the school bus, and I spent countless hours learning its quirks. Two years later during the summer of 2008, we took our relationship to the next level. Using a dremel tool and a plastic casting kit, I hand built a 3x3x5 logic puzzle. You can see that here. It's not the most well crafted puzzle, but I was proud.\nWhen I was working on the 3x3x5, I came up with a design that allowed the extension of another two faces. I decided I would call rhis one the \"X-Cube.\" But I knew I would not achieve precision building it by hand. That\u2019s when I turned to 3D printing. The cube\u2019s progress was halted until I gained access to such a printer.\nFour years later during my sophomore fall semester at Illinois Tech, I was inspired to revisit the project. I brought the X-Cube CAD files to our Idea Shop and had the puzzle 3D printed. I decided to share a video of my creation on Reddit, and I woke up the next day to thousands of views! The video went viral and reached 1.5 million views in 9 days. That's when I knew I needed to share this. \nWhat about patents? Won't Rubik's try to cut your hands off?\nErno Rubik patented his cube in Hungary in 1975 but never obtained an American patent. New twisty puzzles are fair game! But I will not be patenting the X-cube. I would rather spend my time sharing the puzzle than suing people over it. A patent is for keeping something out of someone's hands, which runs opposite to the spirit of the puzzle.\nKnock-offs happen. It's inevitable with any product in today's world. But  knock-offs can reach markets that I cannot! I just want to get the X-Cube out to the world. I'm sure it will be successful whether or not it is patented.\nI'm not completely unprotected though. As a contingency, I have filed a provisional patent for the X-Cube. This means I can still patent the technology a year from the date I filed, else the possibility expires and the puzzle is unpatentable.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first venture I have undertaken. This process is new to me and will be both a great challenge and great learning experience. The X-Cube must be injection molded, assembled, stickered, packaged, and shipped, each of which will present new and unique challenges. There are even obstacles I have yet to foresee in bringing X-Cube to full production. I vow to produce a quality puzzle; if it is not up to my standards, production delays may arise.\n\nI am working on this project full-time so I can overcome these challenges quickly. I have a solid network of supporters who can help me make it through the production process. I have an experienced manufacturer, a great mentor from Marbles, and I'm connected to the maker community in Chicago who I can turn to for guidance when I need it.

Make sure to read the FAQ) PayPal contributions so far: $1,753\nGreetings!\nHello, I'm Lars Simkins. I'm a VFX artist by trade and an indie game developer by passion. I'm here to make that first person exploration/survival game we've all been dreaming about.\nI can still remember the first time I played Daggerfall. Yes, it was uglier than a monkey's armpit and controlled worse than a bumper car on a frozen lake. \nBut it also created the feeling of a world that lived on even after I'd stopped playing, and that feeling still sticks with me all these years later. A world where you could spend hours searching every pixelated nook and cranny. A world of potential. A world of EXPLORATION...\n...and then a Dragonling would chomp my face because I hadn't spent ten hours grinding in the easy regions. Arg! So frustrating! \nOther games have touched on that elusive feeling, especially Elder Scrolls and early Fallout games, but as fun as they are and as much as I love hardcore RPG mechanics, I've always dreamt of a game that emphasized exploration above all else.\nFRONTIERS is that game\nDalarna - North Tower View\nBenneton Gateway\nIn 2011 I finally decided if no one else was going to make it, I'd give it a try. For a full feature list check out the 'Game Features' section below. The trailer you see is the result of hundreds of hours of work and many thousands of dollars out of pocket.\nI'm close to finishing this thing. Another six months ought to do it. But it needs a push - and that's where you guys come in.\nI've taken stock of exactly where the game needs attention and I've already got a small team of hand-picked programmers & artists lined up to flesh out the content that will take this game from scrappy Alpha to polished final release. Finishing the base feature set will take $50,000, broken down roughly like so:\nBeyond the bare minimum to finish the game there are stretch goals. These are features that aren't strictly necessary, but which I scream, you scream, we all scream for because they're awesome and fun. As many of you know I've spent several weeks listening to and discussing your feature requests. Until now I've avoided making promises about most of them (especially when it came to co-op, the most requested feature of all), but after crunching the numbers I can finally tell you what we're shooting for, and what we need to make it happen:\nPayPal contributions so far: $1,753\nCan't pledge with Kickstarter / Amazon? You can use PayPal! All PayPal contributions are put towards stretch goals.\nMajor features\nHere are the base features that are already prototyped / in progress / completed in the alpha.\n\nOther cool features\nRelaxing Pace & Tone \u25cfThis isn't a hack & slash game or a deep, complex RPG. It's an exploration game, and the pace & tone reflect that. There are challenges and tense moments, but they're something you seek out, not something that's thrust upon you. And while there is some complexity to be found in the skills and weapons system, it's not overwhelming.\nImmersive Fast Travel \u25cf Unlike most open world RPGs where fast travel feels like teleportation, fast travel in FRONTIERS won't break your sense of immersion. You get to watch as your character makes the journey, with the sun rising & setting and the landscape rolling by. (To see it in action check out the Videos section.)\nSurvival & Hunting \u25cf Stay fed & warm using your Survival skills. Hunt live game with bows & traps, or gather nourishing mushrooms with book smarts. Eat it raw and damn the consequences or become a master chef and prepare filling recipes  The survival elements in FRONTIERS are engaging and fun without being oppressive. Whether you want to hunt, gather, buy or steal, you'll be able to find a play style that matches your tastes.\nMinecraft-Style Crafting \u25cf Craft almost any item in the game - from weapons to potions to chocolate cake - with grid-based blueprints.\nBeautiful Fantasy Soundtrack \u25cf Steve can't wait to get started on new tracks for each region. I don't even have to tell you how good he is, just give the trailer another listen.\nImmersion Settings \u25cf My goal is to let nothing break your immersion. Everyone has a different threshold for GUI intrusion - you'll be able to tweak sounds, your HUD, glowing paths, your crosshair and even object highlighting styles.\nI'm shooting for January 2014 - but take that with a grain of salt. Even the least ambitious, most experienced teams can slip behind schedule. And if we start hitting some of the bigger stretch goals all bets are off.\nThe good news is that a venn diagram between game dev and VFX has a lot of overlap, broadly speaking, and no skill carries over better than time management. After six years of delivering complex shots for TV shows & films with pressure cooker deadlines, I know a thing or two about creating high quality material with changing requirements under intense pressure. I've also got a great infrastructure for working with an offsite team.\nPlatforms & Distribution\nFRONTIERS will be available on PC, Mac and LInux.\nIf all goes well the plan is to distribute the game on Steam, but I will also be trying to make it available on GOG.com for folks who like to keep their games totally DRM-free. (If your reward includes a copy of the game, I'll make sure a DRM-free option is available for you.)\nGeneric Assets\nQuick side note for all you game developers out there: I plan to make any generic assets I create or commission for the game freely available - tree models, textures, weapons, C# scripts, etc. I wouldn't have made it this far without support from sites like Open Game Art and the Unity community, so this will be a chance to contribute to the growing pool of high quality art & code available to aspiring game developers.\nIf you want to know more about the game, check out these links, videos and screenshots! I talk about features in a lot more detail elsewhere, especially on Greenlight.\nOfficial Pages / Information\nFRONTIERS Official Page\nIndieDB Page\nAAD Games Devblog\nArticles\n\nPC Gamer - Exploration, discovery and survival in a one-man made indie RPG\nPolygon - How one man is creating open-world exploration in Frontiers\nIndie Game Magazine - Trailblazing with Lars Simkins\nIndiestatik - Do It Yourself: Frontiers Is An RPG-Sized Exploration/Survival Game Made By Just One Person\nScreenshots\nFor all kinds of pretty images, check out the Greenlight gallery.\nVideos\nFor more videos, check out the AAD Productions YouTube channel.\nEnough of the jibber jabber! Let's get to the good stuff!\nAdd-Ons!\nWhat are add-ons? They're fun extras that you can add to your existing pledge, regardless of the reward you claimed.\nIf you want an add-on, just increase your pledge without changing your existing reward. For example, if you already have an Early Bird Ranger reward and you'd like to add a Butterfly, pledge another $50. Then at the end of the campaign you'll receive an official backers' survey asking which add-on you wanted.\n(Using PayPal? Same basic procedure - just make sure to shoot me email after you've contributed the difference!)\nStandard Rewards\nIf you have questions about any of these rewards let me know and I'll answer them in the FAQ.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm proud of the fact that I've never missed a VFX deadline, but with a game this complex there's always a chance that January 2014 will slip through my fingers.\n\nIf I ever feel the deadline slipping you will know before anyone else. My policy is the simplest policy - transparency across the board. (I can guarantee you'll be sick of hearing about my problems within a month.)\n\nI should also address the elephant in the room - is it even possible for one guy to create a game this big? The short answer is no, and that's why I'm bringing on a small team! But the other thing to keep in mind is how simple this game is compared to its influences (like Daggerfall). The focus on exploration allows me to prune mechanics and prevent the game from getting overwhelmingly complex. That's how I've been able to make it as far as I have, and that's how the team will be able to finish the game in the end.\n\nThanks for reading!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "The Final Update", "update_content": "FRONTIERS is Finished\nA new build - the final build - has been pushed to Steam.

Or will you use propaganda to influence the citizens of the city and overthrow the controlling powers?\nSatellite Reign will be released on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.\nThe world's governments are controlled by mega-corporations, democracy to the highest bidder. Society is structured for the benefit of those in power. The poor exist in the dark squalid underbelly of the city, while the wealthy swim in opulence and luxury on the upper tiers, and the vast middle-class are too comfortable with their lives of convenience to see the world for what it really is. Corporate police patrol the streets, brutally maintaining the status quo, all under the guise of keeping the people safe.\nThe time for change is now, as a mysterious organisation rises from the slums of the city. They'll have to bribe, steal, hack and augment their way through the barriers between them and their ultimate goal...but what are they trying to achieve?  To free the masses from the corporate stranglehold, or to take control for themselves?  That, is up to you.\nThis is one big, open, living metropolis. The city isn't just a cool location (although it is pretty cool), it actually functions like a city; the streets are bustling with people by day, and controlled by criminal organisations by night. Power grids actually power the city, information and finances flow from one district to another, and you can use all of these things to your advantage.\nThe entire game-world is designed around emergent gameplay. Civilians, police and corporate soldiers will all react uniquely to your actions. Power conduits, communication networks and security systems are there for you to hijack, modify or destroy. Learn how the city and its inhabitants operate, then exploit them all to advance your agenda.\nThe city is huge and you can move around and tackle objectives however you want to. You won't be spoon-fed one mission after another, you'll be able to use whatever means you can to get to your final goal. Bribe scientists to advance your technologies, and kidnap doctors to augment your agents. Steal money from the banks to fund your war against the corporations, and exploit neural implants to bend the will of others. Or, try to take your objectives through good old-fashioned brute-force.\nDistinct character classes give you total control over how you approach a situation. Different classes with different combinations of augmentations, gear and weapons gives you the ability to customise your team and your experience.\nNot every problem is easily solved by shoving a gun in its face. Sometimes the situation requires a bit more subtlety, a bit more finesse. Try siphoning cash out of the corporate account, bribing a bank manager to \u201cmisplace\u201d his security pass, or steal the identity of a corporate soldier to pass through security checkpoints unseen.\nFrom our previous experience with the Unity Engine, we could look no further. Its flexibility, ease of use, and quick turnaround on development means less barriers between the creators and the creation.\nIts robust scripting system and one click approach to deployment allows us to simultaneously develop releases for Windows, Linux and Mac.\nFrom Left to Right: Dean Ferguson, Chris Conte, Mitchell Clifford, Brent Waller and Mike Diskett.\n5 Lives Studios is an independent developer. Our core team consists of five dedicated industry professionals with many years of experience. Not only are we all industry veterans, but we also have a long history of working together, allowing us to make games like a well-oiled machine. Some of us have worked together for nearly a decade! Collectively, we have worked on a wide range of genres and notable titles including the Syndicate series, GTA IV, Darksiders II, Star Wars, L.A. Noire, and many more.\nKickstarter is continually proving itself to be a utopia for creativity. It gives developers like us the chance to get back to our roots, so we can make the games we want to play. We\u2019re free to explore and implement ideas without publishers demanding that we reshape our vision for broad, generic appeal.\nAnd most importantly, it gives you the opportunity to have your say. You get the chance to bring back the types of games you loved. Not only that, but you're also in the unique position to give input on the actual development. This new age of developers and gamers being able to work together paints an exciting, bright future for the industry we all love. \nWe will be thrilled to meet our initial funding goal. Doing so will allow us to achieve our core vision for Satellite Reign, but should we be fortunate enough to exceed our target, every bit extra will go into expanding the experience even further. We've got loads of great ideas on how we can expand Satellite Reign, which we'll reveal as the campaign continues. \nOur first stretch goal will allow us to bring on Russell Shaw, the composer from the original Syndicate series. He'll bring a truly authentic soundscape to the world of Satellite Reign.\nNote: Currency Conversion Rates are an estimate based on exchange rates in June 2013. Final conversion rate may vary.\nBackers who pledge for the \"Transistor\" tier or higher will receive an exclusive Kickstarter-only Satellite Reign t-shirt!\nT-Shirt designs are not yet final, so feel free to tell us what you think!\n\"Bob\" Miniature Figurine available in the \"Bobbylicious\" tier and above.\n\"CTO\" backers who claim the right to design and name a weapon in the game will work closely with 5 Lives Studios to ensure proper balancing of the weapon within the overall structure of the game. The final results are subject to the approval of 5 Lives Studios. All rewards that entitle the backer to naming an in-game character or item are subject to review and approval by 5 Lives Studios.\n\"Hammerhead\" Oil painting by Duncan Mattocks\nThanks for supporting us! And in turn we pledge to support other Kickstarters through http://kickingitforward.org/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n5 Lives Studios is a small team and our ambitions are high, but we have extensive experience delivering quality games with limited resources and in short time frames.\n\nOur design is truly scalable. Our initial goal will allow us to produce a game which retains the core gameplay and design concepts without sacrificing the depth of the simulated city.\n\nThe structure of the simulation systems and design means minimal bespoke code and scripting of events. The simulation systems are fully modular and independently operating, while at the same time interlinking to build a complex and believable world. This allows us to build new systems and simulations which can easily slot into the core systems at any time without breaking the overall structure of the game and code.\n\nWe carry the same modularity across to our art pipeline. The environments are built with modular building blocks, which gives us the flexibility to iterate quickly, and allows for a large range of variety in the game world.\n\nTogether, based on our experience as individuals and as a team, we're confident that we will achieve our goals for Satellite Reign. Our initial funding goal will allow us to deliver a rewarding and engrossing gameplay experience which can be expanded in both depth and size if we are fortunate enough to exceed our immediate funding goal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #76", "update_userinfo": "Unity Awards and Mod Support!", "update_content": "Greetings Agents!

Upon her release at age 18, Nicole plans to take matters into her own hands , to extract revenge on the asylum, her father's killers, find her sister and stop the flow of human trafficking within the corrupt walls of Queen City.

After witnessing a brutal murder in her family, Nicole Mitchell becomes \u201cRazor,\u201d named for the steel blades strapped to her arms. In a world set almost exclusively in the back alleys of Chinatown, Razor dispatches thugs at night and helps wayward teens during the day. By far one of my favorite comic books of all time, and also one of the most overlooked.

The subject matter of a ultra-violent female vigilante turned off many publishers, so I decided to self-publish under the banner LONDON NIGHT STUDIOS. The 1st issue exceeded all expectations, which enabled me to quit the day job and draw comics full time. The flagship title, RAZOR UNCUT reached issue 51, which is a major feat for any independent comic book publisher. Between 1992-99 Razor has appeared in over 100 different publications. To this date back issues of Razor comics and cards are actively bought sold and traded on eBay and online comic retailers.\nOne of the very 1st METAL comic book covers-UNLOCK IT AT $20K\nTHE FUTURE OF RAZOR\nEverette Hartsoe's RAZOR is currently in film development with MOST FILMS' Jeff Most  ( the producer of THE CROW ).

While he learns of his legacy, destiny and importance to the battle, Darien establishes bonds with new, strange friends and is taught his magical craft of Kishpu.\nThe first series consists of all of these elements as well as setting up the mythology of the Sarru Kishpu, the world of Eridu and their enemies. We\u2019re introduced to Darien\u2019s three friends \u2013 Unura, Tirwa and Anthaar \u2013 each aliens with their own powers that become crucial in the end game against their hated enemy, Orasmas Xul Sarrum. We\u2019re introduced to the school \u2013 Lambdu Kishpu. We learn of the hierarchy of the royal court and parliament of Eridu. \nWhile the story starts on Earth, we will be taken to the far reaches of the galaxy, meet new races and discover strange new worlds.\nThe first StarMage comic run will be released as a six part mini-series but will have the opportunity to grow well beyond as long as you, our defenders of the realm, continue to support us!\nThe Creators\nJC De La Torre (author of Ancient Rising, Nightmares from Eberus, Serial and Continuum Force) teams with artists Ray Dillon (The Last Unicorn, Peter Pan, Game of Thrones, Treadwater) and Franco Cespedes (Asusto, El Hallazgo, Rustlers, Badlands) to deliver an epic creator owned comic series.\nThe Kickstarter\nAll funds raised by this kickstarter campaign will go into the production of Issues 1 and 2 of Star Mage as well as fulfilling the rewards. If the funding goes beyond our goal, it will also give us a head start in getting issues 3-6 into print.\nThe artwork for issue one is completed and print ready, Issue two is currently in production and should be completed by the end of this campaign.\nLater in the summer we'll be announcing a publisher that will help us package and distribute our comics. However, these books are 100% creator-owned, there's no publisher's financing. Our Kickstarter goal is enough to bridge the gap and get a copy of the first two issues in the hands of readers this fall!\nThe exclusive kickstarter versions of the comics are independent of the publisher, will be printed and mailed by us directly to you through our printer.\nStretch Goals!\nWe made our goal in less than 72 hours, but we're not done yet folks.

After the campaign got off to a slow start, we elected to re-evaluate the project as a whole and determine what we truly needed to make this thing work. First was adding Franco Cespedes as an artist with the series. Second was determining that the rewards we were offering were inadequate and overly priced. \n\nWith Franco's addition we were able to cut costs and set this project for a much more manageable level. We also finished the first book and began production on the second. \n\nAlso the guidance of Ray Dillon, who has worked on kickstarter funded projects like Womanthology (with wife Renae), Peter Pan (with wife Renae) and Treadwater has been invaluable. We are confident we'll be delivering a kick ass product to your door (or electronic device).\n\nOther risks: These are creator owned books and as such there are risks in that one of us could have some life altering situation that could delay the project. However, with issue one already in the can and issue two on its way, we're confident that shouldn't be a problem.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Star Mage Tradepaperback is coming December 3rd!

Also, if you're interested in making a pledge, our order form might help you keep track of what you're interested in: http://www.mythical-lairs.com/order.html. Orders will be confirmed with the survey at the close of the Kickstarter.\nWHO WE ARE\nMythical Lairs is a new company entering the field of dungeon terrain. At present, the majority of our products are based off of Hirst Arts molds, and while we plan to always offer designs from that line, we hope to offer additional unique designs in the future as well.\n** Please note that we are officially licensed through Hirst Arts. Please visit the links page on the Hirst Arts site or go HERE for confirmation prior to sending Mr. Hirst a deluge of e-mails asking if we are licensed.\nWe have a strong commitment to our customers \u2013 one of quality, affordability and sustainability.Each piece that we produce is mixed and poured by hand, and is personally inspected before shipment. While not indestructible, these pieces have been tested by the harshest tests available \u2013 a group of neighborhood children. Individual components have been thrown, hurled-you name it, and have proven to be durable. Finally, every aspect of our operation is done here in the United States with products produced in the US.\nWHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE PICTURES AND WHAT I ORDER?\nThe prototypes pictured here are just that \u2013 models built using several tiny pieces to obtain a finished product. This is where we learn what works and what we like and don\u2019t like about a particular piece. Please keep in mind  the prototypes were cast using an inferior product, therefore you may see bubbling in the prototype pieces that won't be present in the final products. The finished products will be cast from one piece (or a couple of pieces that are then professionally adhered) rather than several tiny pieces. Each piece (barring accessory items) will have a thin cork padding on the bottom to protect tabletops and prevent slipping. All pieces will come with a dungeon gray wash, allowing them to be used straight out of the box or custom painted per your preference.  Please note that all of our pieces are cast from the same custom materials and have a slightly rough stone feel to them.\n* All pictured pieces, unless otherwise indicated have been painted and are not representative of the dungeon gray wash. Please refer to the Altar of Sacrifice for an example of the standard dungeon gray wash that our pieces will have upon delivery.\nGREAT! CAN WE GET TO THE GOOD STUFF YET??\nYou bet!

I've tried to limit that as much as possible. You will notice that the pledge levels for Accessory Packs do not allow the addition of any rooms. By doing this, I can offer a lower shipping and handling rate to our international customers who are only interested in accessories.  For each pledge amount International customers will pay the S&H specified. For additional or \"add-on\" items, there may be an additional small S&H fee to go along with ordering additional items.\nMusic in video: Midnight Dub by Macabro from Free Music Archive ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUpon successful funding of the project, we have determined it will take approximately 2 weeks to obtain the necessary supplies to make the molds. Concurrently with this, it will take approximately 4-6 weeks to make the individual pieces to be used as the model for the molds. There is an extra 10% of time factored in for the \"unexpected's\" that will inevitably occur. However, we should be able to start producing the items within a 2 month timeframe. \n\nAll casting materials have been tested and determined. The mold making materials have been narrowed down to 2 options, and should the thousands of reviews on these products be inaccurate, it may cause a slight delay in testing a 3rd option. While unlikely, this is a possibility. \n\nRisks would include possible time delays in waiting for supplies (though the supplies needed do have a history of being in stock. However, if, for example, a natural disaster were to occur, or I were hit by a bus, it would understandably delay things a bit!).

A character driven piece that touches on the danger in change and the loss of familiarity. \nOur intentions behind this short are to make the viewer question how devastating a change in routine, no matter how small, can be. They will also be left with the question, 'where do your loyalties lie?'\nWhy did I decide to take the 'Kickstarter' route?\nThe major factor is that, like most indie directors our worst nightmare is funding! As I'm sure you're all aware, films are a very expensive process to complete and short films are no exception to that rule. Luckily,  I have the location, talent and crew all arranged for this project. Everyone involved has thankfully agreed to take part free of charge! (I know, hard to believe in this climate right?)

To hire this camera costs a pretty penny which is why our minimum budget is \u00a31300 but as with many things, the more money we have the better equipment we can hire which inevitably means the better the project looks. We need to make the full target or we don't get anything so any help you can give will be extremely appreciated.\nWe will be shooting over the course of two full days and the minimum we need to spend to make this happen is:\n\u00a3400 on lighting\n\u00a3600 on camera and lenses\n\u00a3100 on sound equipment\n\u00a3100 on camera stabilization (such as a portable Jib and a shoulder mount)\n\u00a3100 on promotional items for pledges\nAs stated above, this is all minimum. There are better cameras, lenses, microphones, etc, so the more we accumulate the better the end product.\nTo help visualise this we've also made some STRETCH GOALS (extremely optimistic) which are:\n\u00a31500 - We will be able to hire a Matte box along with filters and a follow focus kit. (This will help to improve the overall look of the visuals on the project)\n\u00a31750 - We will be able to invest more money into the costume department. (This helps to get the audience engaged in the scenes as I'm sure you all have experienced)\n\u00a32000 - We will be able to hire TWO Canon C300's with Matte boxes and follow focus'. (This will greatly increase productivity and enable us to have more footage to edit with by the end of the shoot.)\n\u00a32500 - Enables us to hire a RED EPIC-X instead of the Canon C300. (This will give our project a 'cinema ready' look instantly and really increase the quality)\n\u00a33000+ - Now we'd be really cooking on gas and be able to hire better equipment, shoot for an extra day, book extra locations, etc.\nSo...\nclick on the green box in the top right hand-side of this page with the words BACK THIS PROJECT written inside it and donate anything you can to help us achieve our goals! We have some really cool rewards for people who are willing to help towards our end goal so be sure to check them out!\nOnce we've finished filming and have completed the post production process we are going to submit the short into as many film festivals as we can. Any amount of money we raise in-between these stretch goals will go towards the submission costs and also towards improving the quality of the promotional items (That's the things you get so it's very important!)\nFinally, I know you're probably wondering, \"Does he have enough experience to make this project a reality?\"\nWell...I\u2019ve been making short films along with the writer of this project Andrew Perez for nearly two years now but have been filming a large range of different projects since I was in secondary school.

We decided to do this in order to sharpen our skills with film making so by the time we get to this stage we know exactly how to create a film, all the pre production planning, post production processes and the marketing procedures. \nWe now know we're ready to step to the next level and with your help entertain the masses in the way we've always wanted to since we were little rascals!\nSo in closing...\nShow us support in any way you can, every little helps and if you can't support us financially follow us: \nOn our Twitter accounts at:\nhttps://twitter.com/DreiShortFilm\nhttps://twitter.com/pacifistfilms\nOr our Facebook pages at:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dreishortfilm\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Pacifistfilms\nand spread the word about our project!\nThanks for taking the time to read this page and any help you can provide is SERIOUSLY APPRECIATED!\nThank you! \nNathaniel Tomlinson", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are aware of the fact that all projects have the possibility to encounter obstacles...we have met a few on our past films but we are also aware that they only cause truly effect the end result when you allow them to.\nWe've had actors not turn up, the weather forecast be COMPLETELY wrong and even (on our first short film) arrived at a location and realised we left the memory cards at home!\nThe good thing with this project is that we've encountered all of these issues before and still found a way to rectify the mistakes, so be assured, regardless of whether things don't go completely to plan we will do everything within our power to make sure this project is completed.

As the Hong Kong Action Movie Card Game, it's stood the test of time and continues to be enjoyed by gamers worldwide. Afterall, what's more fun than cyborg monkeys battling Confucian monks in downtown Kowloon while truck-driving heroes set booby traps for evil, squeaky-voiced sorcerers?\nInner Kingdom Games, hot off the success of last year's Kickstarter campaign to bring Shadowfist back into the mainstream, is ready to follow-up Combat in Kowloon with two great new expansions: Reinforcements and Revelations!\nAbout the Game\nShadowfist is the mile-a-minute, sword-clashing, butt-kicking, Uzi-spraying, boat-exploding, car-chasing, monster-crunching, Hong Kong cinematic action card game that is so epic it would take fourteen John Woos to film and a cast the likes of Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh. And that's just in the first five minutes!\nIt's widely considered one of the finest multiplayer card games ever made, with a balanced, fun and fast-paced rules set. Combat in the game is played out realistically and all players are always in the game! Unlike other card games, multiplayer Shadowfist is not about elimination or scoring points. Players only leave the game when they run out of cards and the comeback potential is unlike any game you've ever played! \nIn Shadowfist, players vie for global domination, by harnessing the chi, or life force, of the world. They who control the chi flow, control life and with it, the world. Chi flow is harnessed through control of Feng Shui Sites. Like the ancient Chinese system of geomancy to help one improve life by receiving positive chi, Feng Shui sites enable their controller to influence regional dominance. This is conveyed in Shadowfist through the win condition of controlling five Feng Shui Sites to win a multiplayer game.\nWhat this Kickstarter offers:\nThe primary products for this campaign are the two 50-card, non-randomized Shadowpacks that feature a mix of all six factions plus new unaligned cards and Feng Shui Sites.\nThese two expansions also feature two awesome new mechanics for the Shadowfist experience: Token Characters and alternate-cost events!\nToken Characters enter play from the effects of other cards, such as events, Sites, Edges or even existing Characters. They have a designated Fighting Score, a \"notional\" play cost and are all Toasted when they leave play.\nEach of the six factions have a new alternate cost event that features a flavorful and appropriate effect based on the factions' strengths. The kicker is that these events may alternately be played at no immediate cost, with the secondary condition that the player must skip their next power generation phase!\n(We're still toying with whether to use a bold-faced ability for the cost reduction or to keep spelling it out with each card.)\nExisting cards for Shadowfist will always be welcome in open formats, and players are free to engage the new environment in the non-collectable model at their leisure.\nWhether you're a returning player, back from a long hiatus; a veteran Mr. Suitcase who's been playing since 1995 or a new visitor looking for a great new card game where a Barrel Full of Monkeys faces off against Snake Demons and Thunder Knights, this release has something for you!\nRewards\nExplore the reward levels for the right one for you, and if you're looking to start off with a great collection, consider supporting the campaign at multiple levels! Just total the amounts of the levels you like and pledge that amount, then shoot me a note letting me know which levels you wish to receive.\nFor example, if you want one copy of all game releases, plus an extra three copies each of the two new expansions, you want the \"Sifu\" and \"Master\" levels. You would select the Master level, pledge $150, then shoot me a note indicating that you'd like these two levels (or just list the items).\nThank you for your support!\nDaniel Griego\nInner Kingdom Games", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nInner Kingdom Games is excited to bring you these new Shadowfist offerings.

We can't wait to share this unique learning space with you ****\nThe Plan:\nTo quilt a yurt to use as a classroom for our forest preschool program.  We will construct a 15ft yurt in the forest and then, with the children, watch the four seasons unfold around us.  With each season we will make one quilted wall panel - so that, in the end, we will have a beautiful external wall depicting the four seasons in our forest (with spaces in between for the windows and door).\nThe end design will be inspired by observational drawings by the children, discussions about the forest around us and my own quirky and playful design aesthetic!  The children will be involved throughout the design process, watching and giving input as the design evolves.\nThe School:\nIt started out as a forest playgroup meeting in the beautiful parks of Charlottesville, VA.  With the purchase of three beautiful, forested acres just outside of town we now have a more permanent place to meet. We are now a forest preschool where we play, explore, build, grow, roam, dig, climb and run. We have a creek to wade, an organic garden to water, plants and animals to study and big rocks to climb. But sometimes we also want to slow down and come together as a group to read, chat, create or rest.  We want to build a purposeful space for the group and allow the children to develop a sense of ownership of this space.\n\"If you don't know where you are then you don't know who you are\" Wendell Berry\nSchool is now enrolling for Fall 2013!\nKeeping It Local:\nWe are committed to supporting local artisans wherever possible. \nWe will be working with Hal & Asia from Laurel Nest Yurts in North Carolina.  They have been so helpful in advising and planning this project and we are super excited to have one of their beautiful yurts to embellish!\nWe will work with local carpenters to build a beautiful wooden deck/platform that will double as the yurt floor.\nSustainable Design:\nThe yurt is in itself a building with very minimal environmental impact.  It is primarily made of wood and canvas.  The exterior quilted wall will be sewn of yet more canvas! We will be building the yurt on a simple wooden deck in the forest.  It will have no plumbing or electricity  - we are a forest program after all!\nWhere the money will go:\nWhy so much for a bit of wood and canvas I hear you ask?  It is a LOT of heavy canvas and wood!  All funds raised will go directly to providing the following parts;\n* Lots of canvas for the four quilted wall panels!\n* The use of an industrial sewing machine to work through all that canvas\n* Wooden platform on which the yurt will sit - this also doubles as the floor\n* 15ft Wooden yurt frame - basically a lattice of wood and ceiling beams, which gives the yurt its unique strength and shape\n* Insulation layer (a layer of double bubble reflective foil) to help naturally regulate the temperature - no air conditioning here!\n* Canvas outer walls,vinyl windows and wooden door to let us bring the outside in!\n------- We hope that you will consider supporting this creative venture.  The children are super excited at the prospect of building their very own school house this fall.  The nature studies have started and their dreams are there.  Let's make those dreams a reality!--------\nRemember, we only get the funds if we meet our goal by the end of the campaign.

HOWEVER, WE ARE STILL APPRECIATIVE OF ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS, WHICH WILL GIVE US A BIT OF A CUSHION AGAINST UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALLOW US TO ENHANCE OUR MARKETING. WE APPRECIATE EVERY PLEDGE MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW.\nIn the late 1980s Gene Roddenberry and Robert H. Justman gave Marc Cushman permission and encouragement to write the definitive history of \"Star Trek\u00ae: The Original Series\". They backed up their stamp of approval by providing Marc exclusive access to all the production documents generated by the series -- everything from the creation of the idea by Gene Roddenberry to the last day of production. \nUnfortunately, as Marc was completing the writing, he was diagnosed with advanced, stage-three cancer. But, the first volume is ready to go to press and we are raising this money for a much needed marketing campaign to help Marc get his passion project into the hands of Trekkers around the world as soon as possible.\n\"These are the Voyages\" is a three-volume book set that provides stunningly detailed documentation of the creation, production, and post production of both pilots and all three seasons of \"Star Trek\u00ae,\" including story development, the writing of the teleplays, casting, set design, shooting, editing and the struggle to complete innovative special effects that were state of the art for their time. \nThe set contains hundreds of previously unpublished insights and recollections from actors, directors, producers, and production crew, capturing what went on from every perspective, including memos dictated by Roddenberry while reading drafts to the series scripts. The books offer a unique look behind-the-scenes in the form of original staff memos, contracts, schedules, budgets, network correspondence, and the censor reports from NBC Standards and Practices. \nGene\u2019s son, Rod Roddenberry, has said, \u201cThis is going to be the bible to STAR TREK\u00ae and how it was made. This is a book that I\u2019m going to keep near and dear and utilize throughout my life.\u201d \nHere is just some of what you\u2019ll find in the first volume of \"These are the Voyages\"::\n\u2022 Hundreds of previously unpublished insights and recollections from the actors, writers, directors, producers, and production crew of the series, capturing what went on from every perspective \u2014 including lengthy new material from series creator Gene Roddenberry, privately recorded before his passing and finally made public here.\n\u2022 A unique look behind the scenes in the form of original staff memos -- including Gene Roddenberry's own memos, recorded while reading drafts of the series scripts -- contracts, schedules, budgets, network correspondence, censor reports from NBC Standards and Practices, and other newly-uncovered documentation. Read about the making of each episode as the episodes are being made, straight from the typewriters of the people who were making them.\n\u2022 The passionate memos and letters of writer/producer Gene Coon, who never gave an interview concerning Star Trek\u00ae before his death, and whose voice is finally heard as his extraordinarily important contribution to the series is fully explored.\n\u2022 The documented truth behind the writing of \"The City on the Edge of Forever,\" Season One\u2019s most acclaimed episode and winner of the Hugo and Writers Guild Awards. Rumors about who wrote what in this episode have been circulating for years. Now, what really happened and who deserves credit, is revealed at last.  \n\u2022 The surprising and dramatic story of how Season One\u2019s most criticized episode,\"The Alternative Factor,\" went awry and became a jumbled mess.  \n\u2022 The actual Nielsen ratings, secret for 45 years, are made public here for the very first time for every episode. (And guess what\u2026they were a lot better than NBC ever admitted!) Transport yourself back in space and time to witness the true history of Season One of Star Trek\u00ae: TOS. Go behind the closed doors of NBC, Desilu/Paramount, the producers\u2019 offices, the writers\u2019 room, the sound stages and shooting locations, and learn the actual facts behind all the blood, sweat, tears, politics, and spellbinding creativity that brought Star Trek\u00ae into being\u2026and changed the world.\nThese books have been more than twenty years in the making and embody Mr. Cushman's intense passion for the material and his desire to deliver that material to Trekkers everywhere. \n\"These are the Voyages\" is Marc Cushman's second TV series bio. The first book, \"I Spy: A History and Episode Guide to the Groundbreaking Television Series,\" co-written with Linda J. LaRosa, with a foreword by Robert Culp, was published by McFarland & Company, Inc. in 2007.\nIn addition to that book, Marc's writing credits include work for \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" \"Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction,\" \"Diagnosis Murder\" and \"Bachelor Pad.\"  His feature film credits include \"Midnight Confessions,\" \"Teresa's Tattoo,\" \"The Magic of Christmas\"  and \"In the Eyes of a Killer.\"     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll three volumes are written.

A typical game will last anywhere between 15-40 minutes depending on the amount of players and the point limit.\nYou'll start the game with players choosing a Bounty Hunter to play as. Players will then take turns rolling dice to capture bounties. The bounties are shared amongst Hunters so only the Hunter who deals the final hit will capture the bounty. But beware, only bounties that have been claimed are worth any points. You can claim bounties by ending your turn or continue the hunt and capture even more at the risk of losing anything you've earned. Use your Hunter's special ability to gain an advantage and press your luck if you think it's safe- you never know what lurks around the next corner. \n**UPDATE**  Take a closer look at some of the bounties you'll encounter in the \"Anatomy of a Bounty\" update. \nThe creation of Hunters of Arcfall isn't possible without the help of Kickstarter.

The largest challenge will come from production and art deadlines. Based on production, custom dice and gaming cards are common tabletop components and there isn't anything out of the ordinary to cause them to be delayed or unacheivable.

These characters are the crew of the Crimson Drake, a sturdy sailing vessel that our heroes use when their adventures take them to sea. Of course, it can be combined with any previous Red Dragon Inn sets to allow for larger games and new match-ups!\nSlugFest Games is a small publisher in a small industry. Even though we have been making games for over a decade now, there are still high risks associated with each new project. As a result, we have been forced to print relatively small runs of our games, usually only 5,000 copies at a time, and this has prevented us from ensuring that our game is available year-round. Long-time fans of our games know that when we sell out, it can take us up to 6 months to get back into stock again, and that isn\u2019t groovy for them or the friendly local game stores that carry our products. Your support will go directly into covering the costs of a larger print run of The Red Dragon Inn: 4 so we can ensure that everyone gets a copy!\nWith Kickstarter we gain the following advantages:\nThe infusion of cash we get from backers significantly reduces the amount we have to spend out of our war chest to print new games.\nThe number of backers we get gives us critically important data about how many copies we should print. (Over-printing and under-printing are both really bad for us!)\nStretch goals allow us to add more cool stuff to the project (more on this below).\nPut these all together and it means that we can spend more effort making the games you want to play, and less effort worrying about whether our games will sell.\nStretch Goals are additional rewards that we will be able to provide based on the total amount of funding we receive for this campaign.\nUnlocked! $20,000: The Sea Event Deck is an optional addition to The Red Dragon Inn.

They would follow the same steps as above, but instead increase their pledge from $40 to $90 ($50 for the Welcome to the Party! pledge level with $10 of international shipping + $40 for the Red Dragon Inn 2 Add-On Reward with $5 of international shipping).\nThat's it!

I plan to publish it through Amazon.com's Createspace website. The majority of the manuscript has been written and now the book simply has to go through the editing process, have maps made by me and have a cover done before it will be ready to be scheduled for publication. I am seeking investors to help fund my cost of editing and cover art, mapmaking software, applying for a copyright and applying for ISBNs and paying to have the book actually published along with the various rewards paid out to investors. Anything above and beyond my overhead costs will go toward marketing my book setting up and maintaining a blog or personal website for fans.\nMy book has already received great feedback from experienced readers of fantasy who have read the beginning portion of the book. During the kickstarter you may view a sample of my work on my blog at www.bloodandshadows.net. I will have the entire prologue from \"Blood and Shadows\" on display.\nAs for what \"Blood and Shadows\" is about, well, it's more than just a story about good versus evil or a quest to save the kingdom from drowning in blood and being terrorized at the hands of a huge organized assassins guild. It's a book about love found and love lost, about death and betrayal. It's about a band of adventurers seeking to stop the nefarious plot of an assassin warlord who, as mentioned, wants to bathe the kingdom of Tar Ebon in blood and rule with a fist of terror. Along the way the adventurers will run across many strange scenarios. We also see things from the point of view of one of the assassins, which adds another level of depth to the book.This book also has magic of varying sorts, based around the concept that matter and energy can be manipulated by the human mind.\nMy book introduces a world and some major characters that will be pivotal in the coming books within my universe. In this book we see hints that there is more at stake than what meets the eye. The entire future of humanity hangs in the balance and one wrong move can end everything. So the theme of the saga that this book begins is that humanity faces extinction if the people of the planet Tar Ebon cannot unite. The series is about the preparation for the final fight for the survival of the human race.\nAlso note that for perhaps one of the few times in the science fiction/fantasy genre I plan to make my saga cross-over from fantasy to science fiction (or more like science fantasy) as time advances in my universe. So while my saga begins with a fantasy novel it will end with a science fiction/fantasy novel.\nI encourage everyone reading to consider investing in this project. Consider your investment not just an investment in one book but an investment in a series of future books that I am confident you will enjoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project there are potential obstacles. After I'm successfully funded there is a risk that the cost to publish could be more than expected, though I believe I've priced everything out. \n\nThe actual publication date of the book could change depending on how long it takes for the cover art to be done and for the editing process to be completed. I certainly don't want to rush the editing process and so plan on mitigating that risk by beginning it early. The plan is to publish the book by September.\n\nBeyond that, there's virtually no risk of this book NOT being published once funded, unless something unforeseen happens in my personal life related to my health or the health of a loved one.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Standard edition books have arrived!", "update_content": "Hey everyone.

Their controversial tactic of \"recruiting\" opponents to their team contributes greatly to this!\nNew Purgatory Daemons\nThe Daemons consistently skirt the edges of legal play, often exploiting the loose interpretation of Kaosball's already loose rules, both to win and increase the entertainment value of their games.  Their latest tactic is the spreading of fires across the field.  Their own innate or imbued resistance to flame makes this a hazard only for opponents, and the Daemons exploit this advantage ruthlessly!\nMt Clobberton Ogres\nThe Ogres have shown both strengths and weaknesses of what some commentators call the \"direct\" style.  The Ogres have managed to hold their own against more purely finesse-oriented teams that have frustrated similar teams. \nTempleton Amazons\nThe Amazons are the reigning KBL Champions, doing the double last year of winning both the Chalice and maintaining the best overall record in the league.  Moreover, the Amazon's physicality has forced a number of other teams to change their tactics.  They have not only proven themselves, they've stamped their distinctive style on the game itself.\nRingers\nAlso included are these great Ringers, who can play for any team (provided you have the cash!)\nPanther\n\"Well it's like I said to my ex; you can look, you can ask, but this just ain't your game to call, sugar.\"\nPanther's ripped up fields across the continent and shows no signs of slowing down.

No one knows where he comes from, or anything about his species.  He's never even said why he plays Kaosball.  The fact is he plays, and he plays quite well!\nCretin the Ettin\n\"I am the greatest player the game has ever seen.\" \"Except for me.\" \"Except for no one.\" \"Except me!\" ad nauseum\nEttin as a species are strong, athletic and antisocial.  A few do make their way from the badlands to civilization, with mixed (and often highly publicized) results.  Unfortunately, the most personally and professionally successful of these immigrants is Cretin....\nPanda Monium\n\"You can't touch the Panda!\"\nPanda Monium is another one of those enigmas inexplicably drawn to Kaosball.  Ancient traditions hold that pandas are sacred, and touching them is a big no-no.  This is quite literally true for Panda Monium, and he's turned this to his advantage on the Kaosball field!\nRewards!\nContribute to the Kickstarter and get Kaosball, the Worstshire Goblins and Kong Bad, a Kickstarter and convention exclusive Ringer!\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t no AYE in team, but there is MEAT. And that\u2019s you when we\u2019re done.\u201d\n-Coach Dru\nThe Goblins approach Kaosball with the same attitude they approach life: We'll do things our own way.  Worstshire's reputation as a rough and rowdy town with little to recommend it is well deserved. The Goblins are Kaosball\u2019s anarchs, the team who spit on authority and defy convention. Their team power turns the crossfield into a giant mosh pit, and if your runners or bruisers are surrounded by Goblins, prepare to be crowd-surfed right out of the action!\n\"It's just a game man... Chill out!\"\nKongbad is one of the most memorable ringers in the game today, and not simply because he's a huge ape.  His laidback and easygoing approach to life, love and Kaosball make him a fan favorite!\nHe's made a long career manipulating play to cost opponents points in unusual ways, and he's very good at it.\nOptional items\nJust the internal components, less the teams, coaches, and rulebook.

Power and control are everything.\u201d\n-Coach Prof\nMoonshire is a dangerous place, where any unassuming science major could be moonlighting as a monstrous terror of the night. Enter the Lycanthropes, champion team of this cursed land, who use this newfound control over immense lupine power at will. Bruiser wolf or runner human? Why choose?\nSt Cloud Paragons\n\"The game may have changed, but our principles have not\" - Coach Z\nThe Paragons are a beacon of truth and righteousness in the bloody sport of Kaosball. By focusing their team\u2019s collective soul, they can temporarily sacrifice themselves to boost their teammates to superhuman feats and score like you wouldn\u2019t believe!\nSalem Warlocks\n\u201cKaosball is magic. Pity for those that refuse to learn.\u201d\n-Kid Lightning, coach \n\u2018Ribbit.\u2019 That\u2019s about all the defeated enemies of the Warlocks can muster after a crushing defeat by these ancient arcanists. While other teams are bound by the petty rules of reality, the Warlocks take advantage of their tradition and heritage, and bend the very nature of the game to their will.\nPort Royale Pirates\n\u201cThe good things in life are free, but the best things used to be yours.\u201d\n-Coach Freeman\nHold on to your cash, the Port Royale Pirates have come to Kaosball! With their uncanny ability to loot an enemy player with every successful play, this team can cheat and bribe the ref with near impunity. Can anyone stand up to this combination of flourish and gleeful abuse of the rules?\nStretch Goals!\n\"Hah! You like that?

Word got out quick that he was fixing the fights, and the safe in his office was cleaned out before the law turned up. I wasn\u2019t the only one who got the short shrift last night. Ratso had pissed off more than his share of customers, including the ones in high heels and eye shadow. It\u2019s going to take gumption, savvy, and a healthy dose of duplicity to come out on top of this disaster.\n- Tom Bullitt\n\nThe Big Fix is a strategic and psychological card game that puts each player in the shoes of one of Film Noir\u2019s most iconic roles. As the Private Investigator, the Femme Fatale (or Homme Fatale), the Politician and more, players uncover clues and trick their friends, all while searching for their enemies\u2019 true intentions. Six roles, five agendas, three vices, and twelve character cards combine randomly so that a new story is told every time you play.\nCharacter Cards\nFrom top to bottom, The Big Fix is designed to play and feel like a Film Noir. Our goal was to create a game which is not only fun and strategically deep, but makes its players think and act like they were a character in a Film Noir. The game emphasizes individual agendas, simultaneous and interconnected player storylines, and temporary alliances driven by mutual benefit - all of which are key themes and motives in Film Noir. Winning at The Big Fix requires strategy, cunning, and a hard-boiled attitude.\nPlayers score points by accomplishing the goals on their Role and Agenda cards, getting away with their Vice, and by trading their points with other players (by trading, we of course mean bribing and extorting). The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.\nA Vice (Gambling), an Agenda (Murderer), and a Role (P.I.)\nThe most common way that players interact with the game and other players is with Moxie cards. Modeled after playing cards, Moxie cards are what make up a player\u2019s hand.\nMoxie Cards\nDepending on the number of players in the game, each game will take between 6 and 8 turns, or days. Each day has a dawn, day, and night, which comprise the three phases of a turn. Watch our gameplay demo for a demonstration of each of the phases.\nThe dawn is the first phase of a turn. In the dawn, each eligible player puts a card from their hand face down onto the table. When each card has been placed, all players flip their cards up simultaneously. The player with the highest numbered Moxie card of each suit wins a bonus, such as the ability to steal a clue from another player or to draw a card from the Clue deck.\nAfter dawn comes the day, the biggest and most important phase of the game. In the day, players take turns bidding and battling over clues by playing larger and larger Moxie cards. The winner of a Clue can elect to reveal it for all to use, keep it for themselves, or bury it. At the end of the game, players score about half of their total points by ensuring that the right clues are going into play and the wrong ones end up buried.\nAfter day comes the night, the most deceptive phase of the game. Like in the dawn, each player places a card from their hand face down on the table. Players who played a Savvy card flip their cards up first and chose a target from the players who played either Gumption or Duplicity, attempting to catch players who spent the night satisfying their vice and revealing players hidden traits.\nIf there are no more cards in the clue deck at the beginning of a turn, the Detective reveals him/herself and attempts to convict the Murderer. After the conviction, players reveal their Hidden Agendas, tally up their points, and declare a winner!\n90 Moxie Cards\n32 Clue Cards\n12 Character Cards\n6 Role Cards\n6 Agenda Cards\n6 Vice Cards\n6 Fingerprint Cards\nRulebook\n\nStretch Goals", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risks in this project are related to getting the game printed and shipped to your door without incident, the only parts of the project which we can't completely control. We\u2019re almost halfway done with the art, and we already know the game is great fun. We have quotes from several reputable and reliable printing companies and we anticipate no complications in getting our game printed through any of them. That said, we have never shipped or printed a card game at this large of a scale before and there could be a few delays on our way to a January 2014 ship date.\n\nWe may end up adding extra cards to the deck or design a bigger/nicer box, which would result in a higher quote for printing. Since we have quotes from multiple companies, we have a backup plan in place in case we can't work out our changes with one of them. These printing risks are a very small concern and pose a problem only if we barely get funded. Any money we raise beyond our initial goal turns these small risks into new and exciting options.\n\nWe fully expect there to be an issue or two when it comes to shipping. Stuff gets lost in the mail, addresses get incorrectly recorded... you get the picture. There\u2019s a lot of factors when it comes to shipping a game which are completely out of our hands and we can\u2019t guarantee that a game won\u2019t get lost in the mail. We will absorb any unforeseen costs associated with shipping (including reshipping lost packages), and have planned for these costs within our quote. Much like with printing, any additional funding we receive beyond our goal will alleviate these risks.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "The Big Fix is arriving soon!

OR for throwing at your RPG Game Master, punish an abusive character, or waking up that sleeper in the corner! This is a FULL set (the only foam set with d6 and [stretch goal] Ten's d10 being included at one low price) of large soft foam polyhedral dice.\nThese soft foam dice are great for many uses. From your spawn's first set of dice (ages 3+), to helping the hard of sight old fart DM see the numbers, to educational uses (yeah I said that), to just throwing them at your Game Master!\nThe basic set will include six dice, 1 of each of these 2\" (tall) foam dice:\n4 sided die (1-4)\n6 sided die (1-6) (numbers not pips)\n8 sided die (1-8)\n10 sided die (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)\n12 sided die (1-12)\n20 sided die (1-20)\n\nThese dice are just the right size to fit in your fist and they are squishy too! Fondle them without shame. Roll them and knock over miniatures without remorse. Best of all the 4 sided die doesn't hurt when you step on it!\nIf you want two rewards, you can just add the total of the other reward to your pledge.\n.\nNOTE: The dice shown in the video are very similar dice but not the actual dice we are making. They are only shown for demonstrational purposes.\nThe final color of these dice will be done all in DEEP PURPLE with white lettering- unless we reach the stretch goals that allow voting. The font will change to something more stylish but very readable.\nThese dice are made of non-toxic Polyurethane and then tampo printed (stamped) for long lasting markings. Child safe (if they don't eat them!), Cat friendly, and recommended for ages 3+\nFor a video demo of rolling the dice: http://youtu.be/YMLuz2h27Rg\nPrototypes from the factory:\nThe dice will come packaged in a plastic bag with a printed cardboard hang top.\n.\nNOTICE: Add-Ons can be only added non-EU and non ESSEN orders as we do not have these extra items in the EU to ship them and would cost an extra shipping charge. If you still want them, you can pay for an International shipping charge instead of EU to get them there. We can probably stick a bag into a first class envelope to get to you though. So again, NO LOOSE DICE will be shipped to the EU.\nTo buy any item off the ala-carte menu you simply need to modify your pledge to add the dollars listed to your total pledge amount, but leave your reward set to the original reward. After the campaign finishes, we'll use a system called BACKERKIT to allow you to spend your over pledged amount in a cart like checkout system.\nRETAILERS: We encourage backers to name a local store in their area they would like to pick up their dice from instead of having them mailed. These dice will also be available in distribution later this year but you'll be the first to get them if you back us here.\nWe will include a 7th die for FREE with ALL sets!

Well we include 7 dice instead of 5 for the same price. LR doesn't include a d6 die! Ours will be a bit smaller and all the same color so they look less like kids toys. Ours is sold in normal distribution channels so they don't have to special order. We have more/different colors and FUDGE dice for all your collector customers!

We are doing our best to minimize the chance of problems and delays as much as possible.\n\nThe steps we have taken to prevent such delays are the following:\n\n1) we have already printed the first of our CAD designs and made resin copies of it. These will be shown during the kickstarted to evaluate size, design and strength of our products. It also helped us to make sure the 3d designs were ready for industrial production.\n\n2) we have chosen to initiate our production in a factory with whom we already did business in the past. We had several options but we have chosen one of the most expensive because of our successful previous collaboration and to minimize the risk of delays.\n\n3) we have already paid for the tooling of the steel mold that includes our first theme! We have pictures that will be shown in the KS. This mold will be ready in a few days, and we should get the first test plastic prints while the KS is live. \n \n4) we have already completed the CAD files for the first two themes of our terrain elements and at least another theme will be completed in the next few days, giving us enough room to complete a few more themes during the kickstarter.\n\nConsidering the above factors, delays or issues should be very limited if none. We spent several months planning this KS and looked at many variables and possible problems, taking corrective or proactive actions when required.\n\nThe biggest challenge is in the number of themes we might unlock during the kickstarter and the delivery time for some of the additional themes resulting from the stretch goals.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #158", "update_userinfo": "The Modular Underground Project Dungeon is now LIVE!", "update_content": "Happy New Year to all of you!\nWe wish you an amazing 2016, full of games, fun and miniatures painting.\nAs you all know we are all back in Amsterdam and we finally solved our biggest issue: the warehouse.

G'wan g'wan.\" Neil Gaiman\n\"Alan Moore & Mitch Jenkins (of UNEARTHING) have a cool Kickstarter to shoot the film His Heavy Heart. Check it out... \" Chris Staros (Topshelf)\n* * *\nWe (Alan Moore, Mitch Jenkins and Lex Projects) are turning to Kickstarter to fund the making of His Heavy Heart, a short film written by Alan, shot by Mitch and produced by Lex. \nHis Heavy Heart is the piece de resistance of the 5 part cycle. Really, it's the icing on the cake. It seeks to provide some closure to our troubled leading man Jimmy, which frankly, I think we could all do with. At the moment, he is trapped in the unsettling and deeply sinister limbo of the Working Men's Club. Neither present by choice, or given the means to abscond his surreal situation, he hurtles towards his inevitable descent into the next stage of his story.\nIt's the final piece in the Jimmy's End series of shorts that are the foundations of a planned full length feature film - The Show. This feature will eventually expand on the world created in this five part cycle.\nMoney pledged from you for this project will go towards the creation of His Heavy Heart as well as the production of all the amazing and exclusive rewards available here. Any additional funds raised during the Kickstarter process will go into further development of the existing series and towards the forthcoming feature film. \nSquirrels and Hitchcock issues aside (come on, you've watched the pledge video, right?!) we have the story in our heads and on paper, and we need you to come on board and help us finish the final chapter in this epic journey into an unknown world. \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWell, it's pretty simple really. We want to make the film that is in our heads and the draft that's on the paper. It's difficult to fund short films in the traditional manner, especially something like the Jimmy's End cycle which is comprised of different lengths and varying subject matter. We want to stay true to the original vision and produce a film that is as close as feasibly possible to Alan's screenplay and Mitch's directorial vision. Kickstarter is a unique opportunity to create our vision with the help of our fans. We are committed to developing our independent projects and want to work with our fans to realise our ambitions.\nTHE FILMS...\nThe Jimmy's End saga is made up of five shorts. Rather like a comic book series, each film in the cycle contributes to the overall story, as well as having a clear, standalone narrative and purpose.\nWhat we've made so far....\nPart 1: Act of Faith\nThe eerie, and borderline surreal short starring Siobhan Hewlett that begins our introduction to the world of The Show. Faith Harrington, a young female reporter on a local newspaper who has an exotic private life, prepares for a stimulating evening at home that doesn\u2019t go according to plan. Act of Faith is the introduction to this series of five films and features Siobbhan Hewlett. It's a lonely, almost monological look at surreal game of chance and poor circumstance. Act of Faith was shot in December 2011 and acts as a prelude to the longest section of the series, Jimmy's End.\nPart 2: Jimmy's End\nLouche and hard-drinking womaniser James Mitchum (Darrell D'Silva) finds himself wandering into one strange bar too many. Filmed though the lushly textured eye of Jenkin's light saturated photography, Jimmy's End is a deliberate foray into the uncanny constructed through Moore's eyes.\n\"Jimmy\u2019s End\u2019 came about after a photoshoot I had done for Alan\u2019s fanzine called Dodgem Logic and I just really wanted to recreate that photo shoot as a short film. Alan then offered to do the screenplay, but it was only after that that we then thought, hang on, if we take everything we have learnt from Unearthing and put that into the short film then it will make for a much more diverse and cohesive kind of project, because every single element means something and furthers the narrative.We have a series of short films that we call showpieces and they all fit together like a little jigsaw, building up to the feature film, The Show.\" - Mitch Jenkins\n\"Jenkins has expertly crafted a haunting glimpse into the world of those tortured by their desires\" - Shorts of the Week\n\"Defiantly avante garde, this louche and oddly sinister vignette suggests that Moore...is determinedly disinterested in regurgitating his own comic-book back catalogue: we're definitely not in Smallville any more.\" - The Guardian\nYet to be released...\nPart 3. Upon Reflection \nLeonard Brock talks shop in a fly on the wall view of St. James Working Mens Club. The arrival of a visitor disrupts the maudlin equilibrium of the evening.\nPart 4. A Professional Relationship\nMatchbright and Metterton - a working partnership, a meeting of two minds. A Double Act. Well at least that's the general concept. All is fair in love and war.\nBoth Upon Reflection and A Professional Relationship act as companion pieces to Jimmy's End and add depth to certain scenes that are not lingered upon during the film. They deserved a title and moment of their own and allow us to get to know other members of the Working Mens Club in intimate settings. But you'll have to wait a little longer to find out any more...\nPart 5. His Heavy Heart - \nThis is the last part of the cycle and we need your help to complete it!\nHis Heavy Heart pulls James out of that white light and back into colour.\nWe don't want to give away too much at this stage, but we can give you three facts about His Heavy Heart.\n1.

The event will see over 200 retro gamers compete in a variety of retro games and play on the biggest screen in the UK. The event is run by gamers, for gamers, and will feature consoles and computers from the 70\u2032s, 80\u2032s and 90\u2032s, developer sessions, demos of modern retro inspired games and \u201cplay the creator\u201d tournaments. Players will compete for amazing prizes such as unique custom gold consoles, golden joysticks, giveaways from game publishers and signed retro goodies. Visitors will also be able to play a variety of classic retro console, computer games and handhelds and we are looking into having some original arcade cabs and pinball on free play available for high score competitions. \nWe have VIP guests in attendance from creators of iconic games (who you will get a chance to play them at their own games!) to gaming world champions.\nOne of the other show highlights is our retro gaming timeline where we will showcase computers and consoles in chronological order, playable with the most popular game from each system. Visitors can experience a visual and interactive history of gaming across the decades.\nSO WHEN IS THIS TAKING PLACE?\nWe have booked a provisional date of Friday 4th October 2013 (9am-5pm) with the BFI IMAX. This date should hold until the completion of the Kickstarter campaign (and we can pay the full booking fee), but it may be subject to minor variation. Do not worry however, RetroXtreme 2013 will happen.\nOMG, THAT SOUNDS AMAZING! SO HOW DID THIS ALL COME ABOUT?\nYeah thats what we thought! It basically came from a childhood dream of one of the RetroXtreme 2013 team (James) to play games on a cinema screen. Like many other ideas he has had, its a bold one, but he\u2019s never been one for doing things by halves! He thought, well if I was to get the chance to play some games on a cinema screen, where would I do it? Well, if we were going to do it, we were going to do it on a BIG scale so the IMAX was the natural choice. So after rallying his friends to help out, RetroXtreme 2013 was born. The rest as they say is history\u2026\nSO WHY DO WE HAVE TO REGISTER AND PAY VIA KICKSTARTER?\nWell, we contacted the IMAX and pitched the idea and they loved it, but due to the massive costs involved we could not secure the booking at the IMAX without spending a small fortune. That carries inherent financial risks for us personally, if the tickets do not sell as we anticipate, then we are out of pocket by a LOT of money and the event will not happen. By using Kickstarter as our campaign funder, we can ensure that the event will only go ahead once all the tickets have been sold. Not only does it de-risk it for us, but for you too, as you will not pay a penny unless the event is fully booked and guaranteed to happen.\nWHO ARE THE RETROXTREME 2013 TEAM?\nRetroXtreme was formed by James (aka RetroNerd) a serious retro collector and gamer who has been gaming since the age of 3 and 33 years later he is showing no signs of stopping soon! The rest of the team are his close friends and his Partner who between them all span experience in global operations management, event management, project management, financial management and game design. We are all gamers at heart and have all been playing since the 8 bit glory days. RetroXtreme 2013 really is an event run by gamers, for gamers.\nHOW DO WE BUY TICKETS, CAN WE PURCHASE IN ADVANCE?\nTo be able to buy tickets, they must be purchased through the Kickstarter campaign. The tickets are limited to 224 players and 220 visitors so these will sell out fast, so to make sure that you are ready to buy when the campaign launches, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, register your email on our mailing list or keep visiting the website.\nWHAT FACILITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE DURING THE DAY?\nWe have the whole of the BFI IMAX to ourselves, that includes all of the facilities, dining areas and a fully licensed bar. All food and drink will need to be purchased separately on the day.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGetting 30 year old consoles working on a state of the art IMAX projector!

As of May 29th at 1:22pm PST, Mind\u2019s Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade is fully funded! Many thanks to our backers to their support. We still have many exciting stretch goals to achieve. The continued support of backers new and old will allow us to accomplish a whole host of additional goals. Check the stretch goals section below for the full list.\nCURRENT STRETCH GOAL:  French translation option available for all standard Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade book formats - will unlock at $240,000\nRECENTLY UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS: Brazilian Portuguese translation option available for all standard Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade book formats - now available\nKickstarter Stretch Goals and Pin Images\nTwenty years ago, White Wolf unveiled Mind\u2019s Eye Theatre. It ushered in an entirely new era of immersive and interactive entertainment, and added a vibrant new dimension to roleplaying games. Even though it has been years since a new MET book has been published, legions of dedicated Mind\u2019s Eye Theatre fans around the world are still playing. They have been waiting patiently for an updated version of their favorite Live Action Roleplaying game \u2013 and with your help, now they\u2019ll get it! \nMind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade draws on more than two decades' worth of material from the iconic World of Darkness game setting. The rules are designed and adapted specifically for the Live Action Roleplay environment, while maintaining the fidelity of the original game. Modern design methods meet classic feel in our new expression of the game!\nAll the clans. All the bloodlines. All the disciplines. This is a complete game, containing everything you need to enjoy Vampire The Masquerade in one of its most thrilling formats.\nA streamlined character creation system that is quick, yet comprehensive. \nA new cinematic yet mathematically-balanced rules system developed specifically to support the story and style of a live action environment for Vampire The Masquerade. \nDetailed settings for Camarilla, Sabbat, and Anarch games, with custom rules designed to enhance the story of each setting. \nGorgeous new full-color art that faithfully depicts this dark and decadent world. \nSupport, guidance, and advice for Storytellers, covering everything from how to write plots, run engaging scenarios, or personalize a setting for your chronicle. Learn how to manage a chronicle in a world where players want to play 24/7 and to customize your setting for the story you want to tell in your chronicle.\nA brand-new NPC creation system that allows you to quickly create allies and antagonists at the challenge level required for your chronicle. \nA new equipment building system that allows storytellers to quickly recreate any real world item (such as weapons, equipment, and vehicles) required for the chronicle. \nThis Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade Kickstarter allows us to complete and publish the book. We estimate delivery in December 2013 for the standard book. We have been working tirelessly for many months to write and test our new product. Now we need your help to bring it to life - or \"unlife!\"\nWe plan to publish the book as a fully searchable PDF and print-on-demand physical book (softcover and hardcover) and, if we reach our stretch goals, as a beautiful deluxe hardcover edition. And yes - there will be a complete index and no more Page XX!\n\nWe have published several rules previews to give our community a taste of what they can expect in the new product. You can view them all by clicking the links below.\n\nOur core goals and an overview of what you can expect\nThe resolution mechanic will still be Rock-Paper-Scissors\nNo more Bomb or Win-All-Ties\nGeneration Rules changes and Writers Roundtable\nGeneration rules preview\nFan Questions about Generation\nVentrue \"slice\" preview\nThe \"Vertical Slice\" Alpha Playtest Packet\n\nIt's very easy. Choose the reward tier you like and you'll receive the reward that matches your contribution. Please read the handy column to the right for the full list of pledge levels and rewards. Backers who choose PDF versions will receive them first via coupons from our online sales partner, DriveThruRPG.\n\nWe set the project to fund at $60,000 because this is the minimum amount we need to create the PDF, softcover and hardcover formats offered in the current tiers. We chose to use stretch goals as a way to create \"bigger and badder\" rewards for backers while keeping the minimum need to fund the basic book creation as low as possible. We want to make this book without breaking anyone's bank account to do it!\n\nPlease read the \"Add-Ons\" and \"Stretch Goals\" sections for information about how to upgrade your reward tier to include a la carte items such as extra copies of the books, dice rings, and clan pins. You can change your reward tier level and add-ons at any time until the Kickstarter is completed. This means you will be able to change to the deluxe tiers, add on additional support PDFs or order more clan pins as these stretch goals are met.\n\nWe said CLAN PINS! This was the number one most requested item by far as a Kickstarter reward. We are pleased to announce that not only are we offering clan pins, but we are also offering them at a much higher quality than previously manufactured. These pins will use enamel engraving to create both depth and true color vibrancy. We know clan pins are very important to the LARP community, and we want to make something you will wear with pride.\nAll of the clan, bloodline and sect pins are now available thanks to YOU! The pins available are:\nBrujah\nGangrel\nMalkavian\nNosferatu\nToreador\nTremere\nVentrue\nLasombra\nTzimisce\nAssamite \nGiovanni\nRavnos\nFollowers of Set\nBaali \nBlood Brothers\nCaitiff \nDaughters of Cacophony \nGargoyles\nHarbingers of Skulls \nKiasyd\nNagaraja \nSalubri\nSalubri Antitribu \nSamedi\nTrue Brujah\nAhrimanes \nAnda \nCappadocians\nChildren of Osiris \nLamia\nLhiannan\nNoiad clan pin option\nSerpents of the Light\nAssamite Antitribu \nBrujah Antitribu\nGangrel Antritribu \nLasombra Antitribu\nMalkavian Antitribu\nNosferatu Antitribu\nPander\nRavnos Antitribu \nToreador Antitribu \nTremere Antitribu \nVentrue Antritribu\nSabbat sect pin option\nCamarilla sect pin option \nAnarch sect pin\n\nTo order clan pins, please follow the \"add-on\" instructions in the add-on section below. You will need to manually update your pledge amount to include the price of your clan pins. Clan pins are $20 each - you can order as many as you want! (Check the add-ons section for the prices of pin packs. The more you buy, the lower the per-pin cost!) You do not have to choose the clan of your pin when you select your add-on. You will choose the clans for your purchased pins upon the completion of our Kickstarter. You will be able to chose from any of the 47 available options, listed above.\n\nClan pins will be made at a higher quality level than previously offered. The Tesla pin is an example of the engraving and enamling process for the new pins.\n\nWe hope to raise more than just our $60,000 goal. That $60,000 will fund the creation of the standard book - but we want to bring our community something more than standard! Our goal is to always go above and beyond. In that spirit, we have a number of stretch goals planned so we can make even more items the community desires and deserves.\n\nAvailable at launch: Brujah, Gangrel, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Toreador, Tremere, Ventrue, Lasombra, Tzimisce, Assamite Giovanni, Ravnos, and Followers of Set clan pin options\n$62,000 - Baali clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$64,000 - Blood Brothers clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$66,000 - Caitiff clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$68,000 - Daughters of Cacophony clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$70,000 - Gargoyles clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$72,000 - Harbingers of Skulls clan pin option  - AVAILABLE\n$74,000 - Kiasyd clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$76,000 - Salubri Antitribu clan pin option  - AVAILABLE\n$78,000 - Nagaraja clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$80,000 - Blood & Betrayal Booster Bundle (see add-ons section for complete description) - AVAILABLE\n$82,000 - Salubri clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$84,000 - Samedi clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$86,000 - True Brujah clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$88,000 - Ahrimanes clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$90,000 - Deluxe book with leatherette cover only (see the deluxe section for more)  - AVAILABLE\n$92,000 - Anda clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$94,000 - Cappadocians clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$96,000 - Children of Osiris clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$98,000 - Lamia clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$100,000 - UNLOCK: all deluxe books will have silver page edges - AVAILABLE\n$102,000 - Lhiannan clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$104,000 - Noiad clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$106,000 - Serpents of the Light clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$108,000 - Assamite Antitribu clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$110,000 - Storyteller Secrets - Guidance and Advice for MET: VTM Storytellers (see add-ons section for complete description) - AVAILABLE\n$112,000 - Brujah Antitribu clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$114,000 - Gangrel Antritribu clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$116,000 - Lasombra Antitribu clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$118,000 - Malkavian Antitribu clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$120,000 - UNLOCK: all deluxe books will have black and red sewn-in bookmarks - AVAILABLE\n$122,000 - Nosferatu Antitribu clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$124,000 - Pander clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$126,000 - Ravnos Antitribu clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$128,000 - Toreador Antitribu clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$130,000 - UNLOCK: all deluxe books will have all-new Tim Bradstreet art for all bloodlines - AVAILABLE\n$132,000 - Tremere Antitribu clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$134,000 - Ventrue Antritribu clan pin option - AVAILABLE\n$136,000 - Sabbat sect pin option - AVAILABLE\n$138,000 - Camarilla sect pin option - AVAILABLE\n$140,000 - Pickering Lythe - An Original MET Vampire the Masquerade Setting in Edwardian London (see add-ons section for complete description) - AVAILABLE\n$142,000 - Anarch sect pin option - AVAILABLE\n$155,000 - UNLOCK: all deluxe books become the \"Tim Bradstreet Edition\" with every piece of art being an original work by the iconic Vampire: The Masquerade artist, Tim Bradstreet - AVAILABLE\n$180,000 - Spanish translation option available for all standard Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade book formats - AVAILABLE\n$200,000 - Italian translation option available for all standard Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade book formats - AVAILABLE\n$220,000 - Brazilian Portuguese translation option available for all standard Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade book formats - AVAILABLE\n$240,000 - French translation option available for all standard Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade book formats\n$260,000 - German translation option available for all standard Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade book formats\n\n\nTrue Brujah bloodine photographic art by Jamais Vu\n\nWe have a number of add-on items that may be purchased as \"a la carte\" additions to whatever reward tier you choose to purchase.

Thank you!\nNothing says \"Vampire\" more than black leatherette covers and great art from Tim Bradstreet! (Unless someone figures out how to print a book entirely on pages made of blood...) We want to go beyond any book every created for Mind's Eye Theatre and create a completely unique Deluxe edition. We have enabled this format as a series of stretch goals and unlocks. But what does that mean?\nThe Deluxe edition reward tiers have been unlocked! (Including the Caine Package, if you're wondering where his name is in our reward tiers). We have hit all stretch goals for the Deluxe. It will have a black leatherette cover, silver-edge pages, and sewn-in fabric bookmarks.

This means that it will feature the 13 Great Clan images from V20 as well as 27 all-new Bradstreet pieces for the included bloodlines and sects. Simply put, every piece of art in the Deluxe will be a Tim Bradstreet original.\nThe By Night Studios Team has had a lot of help from a wide variety of personal and professional friends.

If we experience significant delays during final testing, layout, or shipping, we may deliver the book in early 2014\nSOLUTION: Use modern technology to keep us on track.

You do this by buying and selling goods for gold while employing a network of local characters, secret knowledge, hidden locations, bribes, dirty tricks and a healthy dose of cunning to evade the attentions of the customs officers and the other players.\nCornish Smuggler doesn't have any dice and in fact there is very little that is left to random chance in this game.\nCongratulations to everyone for making our funding goal!This couldn't have happened without your support for this fantastic game - Thank You!!!!!!\nBut...we're not finished yet and we STILL want Cornish Smuggler to be the best game possible, and that is down to how much extra funding we can raise.\nKickstarters come first -  there is no way that we can produce Cornish Smuggler without you and we want you to know that. We really appreciate your support and will make sure you get your copy first, even if it means delaying mainstream distribution to do so.\nCheaper Smuggling! - The RRP for Cornish Smuggler will  be \u00a340, so by backing this Kickstarter, you will be receiving the game at a greatly discounted rate...including free postage if you are in the UK!\nHelp us create an even better game! - Whether it's more cards allowing a wider scope for strategies, upgrading Cornish Smuggler to 5 players or allowing for a double sided board.  The more funds we can raise for Cornish Smuggler NOW, the better the final game will be.\nKickstarter exclusives - by backing the Kickstarter you can get your name in the rulebook and receive exclusive additions to the game that simply won't be available in the retail version.  Look at our stretch goals below for more information.\nCheaper Shipping Options - International shipping can add unwanted cost to Kickstarter projects so we've created two reward levels with combined shipping for ordering multiple copies of Cornish Smuggler. Find a friend and save save save!\nFree Shipping Option! - Cornish Smuggler will be at Essen, at ArmardaCon and also for any local backers...we are only in Penzance!

For more information, please have a look at our rules:\nThere are three different resource types in Cornish Smuggler, which have different value in the game:\nGOLD: which you need to win the game, but also to pay for things like Goods and Characters.\nREPUTATION: which is more valuable at the start of the game as it generates Influence for you each turn, but also adds to your final score.\nINFLUENCE: which is the most cost effective way to facilitate your smuggling.\nWith most Actions, you can choose how you would like to make this happen.You don't have to pay all bribes in Gold and you don't have to move your goods around based just on Influence.You have a choice about how to do everything.\nAll the while you are playing Cornish Smuggler you have to think about the Customs Officers.The movement of the Customs is dictated entirely by the actions of the players.Whenever contraband is landed or sold, the nearest Customs Counters will start moving towards the location of the landing or sale, and if they catch you, then your goods will be immediately seized...although if you've employed the right people you can always try and seize them back.\nWhen selling goods, players can choose how much to sell them for; making a choice to either increase their Reputation and Influence in the community by selling cheaply, or maximising their profit by getting the best price possible. An increased reputation allows a player to transport their contraband more easily and evade customs, but to win the game they must have the most gold out of all the other players. However, the strength of the Customs forces is directly linked to how much Gold is made, - so timing is everything!\nEach copy of Cornish Smuggler will come with the following components:\nBig Board!!!\nWooden Components\n40 wooden player counters\n10 wooden Customs counters\n16 x unique wooden Goods Shapes\n4 wooden ship counters\n60 x wooden Influence Counters\n4 x wooden Goods Counters\n\nCards\n40 x Character Cards\n40 x Secrets Cards\n12 x Storehouse Cards\nCardboard Tokens\n9 x Ship Cards\n36 x Gold Counters (of varying values)\n45 Reputation Counters\n4 x player mats\nCharacters\nSmuggling was rarely about just one person, and often whole communities were involved.Each Character in Cornish Smuggler not only affects your Reputation and increases your network, but comes with a special ability- and a cost.You will have to choose carefully who to employ.\nFor more information on the characters click here.\nGoods Shapes\nEach game of Cornish Smuggler contains 16 Good Shapes of different shapes and sizes.When buying goods, players must be able to fit them on their ships -so choosing the right shapes is key.\nLarger goods sell for more Gold, which you can sell in larger towns more Gold also.However, if Customs is on your tail you might think it's better to offload you contraband quickly by selling in a smaller town for a lower profit.\nStorehouses\nEach player starts the game with a secret storehouse where they can hide their goods from interested parties.Each storehouse is a different size so make sure you buy goods that can fit in them.You can buy more as the game progresses and some Characters will give you some for free.\nBribing\nEvery Customs officer has his price and will ignore your goods for the rest of the game if bribed.Bribe costs will increase as more Gold is made though- and there's always the possibility that someone else might bribe your man.\nPlaying Time\nA two player game will take approximately 90 minutes, three players 120 and 4 players 150.\nWhen we started creating Cornish Smuggler, we wanted to make a game that wasn't just interesting mechanics, it was imperative for us to create a game that lets the players feel that they were actually smuggling!For this reason, we have chosen not to compromise on the range of strategies that players can employ, meaning that this game isn't suitable for players under 13 years and works best for ages 16+.\nWe've found that Cornish Smuggler works brilliantly as a game that promotes conversation during play.This is partly due to the sheer weight of historical texture that surrounds smuggling and partly because of the level of interaction between players.It's not just the Customs that you have to watch out for!\nDesign Goals\nOur original goal for Cornish Smuggler was to create a game that:-\nGives players a series of choices to make - they choose how to play the game.\nHas a nail biting finish - where the endgame is very, very close and hard to predict.\nIs balanced - no one player is able to charge off into an early and unassailable lead.\nWorks - all elements of the game work perfectly together and there is no one card, or bit of text that causes confusion.\nHas a good rulebook - properly cross-referenced and has plenty of illustrations and examples.\nBlind Playtesting\nWe've been designing Cornish Smuggler for over a year now and we're very confident that we've made a really good game, but we didn't see that as enough.\nAt the beginning of April we put out an open call for people to playtest our game, inviting them to do everything they can to break the game.Putting the game in front of people that we didn't know, of all different levels of experience, has meant that we've been able to be very proactive with the game design in light of the feedback that we've received - transforming Cornish Smuggler into a game which most definitely fulfils all of these goals.\nLevel Of Production\nAs you can see, Cornish Smuggler is not a finished game...but it is very, very nearly finished.This game will be in live development all the way until the end of this Kickstarter.\nWhat this means is that we will continue to respond to feedback from our playtesters, improving and updating the layout of the rulebook and of the cards right up until we hit that Big Red production button.We might even get lucky and find one last bug in the game.Everything we find wrong at this stage is something we can fix and improve.Once we've started production it's much harder to make any changes!\nWe're a very small team, but we are extremely dedicated to Cornish Smuggler and will continue to pull as many all nighters and call in as many favours as we can to make sure this game is the best that it possibly can be.\nOur commitment to you is quite simply to provide the best game that we possibly can.\nArtwork\nThere are 40 different Character cards in Cornish Smuggler and each one will have a unique character illustration on it.  All of these illustrations are being created by Sam Brookes, an immensely talented artist from Falmouth University.To see more of his work, please click here.\nThe perfect box art for Cornish Smuggler has been created by St Ives based artist Donald McLeod.  It's not just us who thinks that Donald's paintings are perfect for boardgames.Another of Donald's paintings was used for the hugely successful Sails Of Glory game.\nFulfilment\nWe've researched a huge variety of fulfilment solutions for Cornish Smuggler and have selected only established companies with good credentials.\nTiming\nWe are confident that we will be able to get Cornish Smuggler dispatched by the second week of October, so depending on where your copy is being posted to, you should definitely receive it by the end of October.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project, the main risk that exists is that we will experience delays in getting Cornish Smuggler to you when we plan to.Packages occasionally 'disappear' and events outside of our control are always a possibility.However, our team has proven experience of not only dealing with such events, but overcoming them.\n\nWe will do everything that we can to mitigate any problems and we will keep you informed every step of the way. Communication is a key component of any Kickstarter, so we will be posting regular updates throughout the campaign and will notify you immediately if any problems arise.\n\nWe will try everything that we can to produce the best game we can, as quickly as we can.\n\nIf you have any questions about any aspect of this project then please post in the FAQ section and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Cornish Smuggler Immortalised in Essen: The Game!!!", "update_content": "Hello Cornish Smugglers,\nJust a very quick update to let you know that Cornish Smuggler (the game you helped to make!!!) has been immortalised in Essen: The Game which is currently on Kickstarter.\nFabrice Beghin, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Delporte, Etienne Espreman & the team at Geek Attitude Games have made...\nEssen: The Game\n()"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Waggle On Cornish Smuggler!", "update_content": "Hello Cornish Smugglers!\nAs you might have noticed, it's been a little while since our last update and we've been pretty busy!!!

You can add the whole lot for $250 (less than half retail) or the first ten for only $70, if you are thusly inclined.\nThe Rise of the Lowly\nGazillions of years in the future the vaunted Hoomanrace is extinct and Oith's dominant lifeforms evolved from cockroaches, snack cakes, and the dregs that survived the various apocalypses in this highly original tabletop roleplaying game.\nSpork and Sorcery adventure in a shattered world inhabited by the descendants of cockroaches, worms, snack cakes, and stranded aliens. Discover the arcane secrets of hocus pokery, dementalism, smellcasting, and contanimation. Battle hideous beasts risen from the rubble of ancient civilizations. Enjoy a light lunch at the Primordial Soup Kitchen.\nMutha Oith is a world of grand adventure and deadly peril; a world of conflict and danger. It is a land of epic heroism and great evil, a realm of horror and violence, a bold land where even the lowliest croach can become a king by his own mop and the most wretched gob of filth can become a gawd.\nAre you werm enough to follow your destiny? Do you have the nuggets to take your rightful place among Oith\u2019s most valiant heroes? If so, strap on your esophagator hide shield, pick up your battle spork and your big ass cleaver, mount your pygmy slog, whisper a prayer to Jelvis, kiss your larvae goodbye, and open the goosin\u2019 book.

It will closely match the hardcover edition of The Whole Hole - A Gadabout's Guide to Mutha Oith - Volume 01: Keister Island and all the other products in the Low Life family. As an added bonus, I will personally sign and customize every book that's backed through this campaign.\nLow Life is supported by several related products, including a line of high-quality pewter miniatures, a series of card games and game enhancers, and a horde of other nifty things that will come to fruition if our Stretch Goals are met. You can learn a lot more, and nab yourself some free downloads, at www.muthaoithcreations.com.\nLow Life: The Rise of the Lowly uses the fantastic Savage Worlds rules system by Pinnacle Entertainment Group. The Savage Worlds Deluxe rules (less than ten bucks from PEG Inc.) are required to play the game, but not to enjoy the book, which is presented in such a way that all the game related jazz is in the appendices at the back so as not to interfere with the reader's enjoyment of the story. If we reach the requisite funding level I will also produce Pathfinder and Fate Core editions.\nI'm intrigued. Tell me more...\nHere are the nine playable species that are introduced in the core rulebook:\nBodul - Cremefillian - Croach - Werm - Smelf - Horc - Pile - Tizn't - Oofo \nMilestone Goals\n200 Backers: We'll add a Low Life name generator to the website (www.muthaoithcreations.com).

Click here for a more concise list of goals and rewards.\nIf you pledge an amount that offers you rewards whose funding level is not attained you will be given the option to make up the difference with duplicate products or original artwork. As a bonus, the poster map will be given to everyone who pledges $55 or more (as long as the funding level for that reward is reached).\nItems of equal value are interchangeable. For example, if you already have the Dementalism card game and would prefer another set of Bennies instead, it's all good (as long as both projects are funded). Just send me a message to let me know what you want. To add anything to your pledge, increase your funding accordingly and send me a message to let me know. Of course, it's a much better value to pledge at the levels that give you entire Heaps, but it's your call.\nIf you are still confused about Heaps and Stretch Goals PLEASE CLICK HERE for more information.\nHEAP #1\n5 Art Cards: These 4\"x6\" high-quality, full-color art prints are suitable for framing and feature five characters from Low Life.

Since I'm depending on myself for all the writing, illustration, and design I have nobody to fall back on if illness, injury, or misadventure should interfere. Still, I'm an experienced and award-winning producer of such things (writing, illustration, and design, not illness, injury, and misadventure) and I don't foresee any issues.\n\nI've learned from past campaigns not to set my projected completion dates unreasonably. I don't want to rush through this and produce an inferior project just to get it out in time. At the time of this writing, I have over 90,000 words written and over 200 illustrations completed. The bulk of what's left to write and illustrate are the adventures, and the number of those I include in the book depends on the funding level we reach. If I should fall victim to the iniquities of decrepitude or get devoured by something hideous, enough of the project has already been completed to allow a capable descendant to pick up where I left off. My amazing wife, Heather, knows many people in the industry who would be eager to scavenge the remains.\n\nBecause I'm doing all the creative work myself I don't have to depend on other freelancers to get their part done on time (a problem that has plagued certain past projects).\n\nBritne, my executive henchperson, will be helping with order fulfillment, so once the projects arrive from the printer we'll be able to ship them to you in a timely manner.

You can get a deluxe, printed, full-color edition as a backer reward, but my main goal with this is to try and find a way to do a great, ongoing webcomic without having to starve for love of the project.

I have been in the comic book industry for 20 years. I have been proud of my career as I have been involved in some great projects. One most notably where we discovered long lost comic material by the legendary Winsor McCay . The artist for whom the animation Oscar award is named after. I have created a new title called MONSTRA: ZOMBIE DESTROYER.\nMONSTRA: ZOMBIE DESTROYER is a 125 page full color graphic novel printed on the highest quality glossy paper stock utilizing the pinnacle of current printing and production methods. We will also produce a limited deluxe hardcover of the graphic novel as well as a 11 x 17 sketchbook featuring pencil art from the first issue and concept art.\nThe story involves a sentient zombie and her slacker boyfriend at the outset of the end of days. The government has contained an initial outbreak of infected undead . A widespread zombie infestation has been averted through military involvement and the establishment of quarantined areas around the country. Small sub-sections of the human population have been discovered to be immune to the bites in varying degrees. This results in humans with this immunity being highly sought after for military service and biological testing. Monstra is one such human who has a partial resistance causing her to be half zombie half human.She joins a military outfit with her boyfriend which is assigned to eradicate zombies who roam the quarantined areas.\nThis title will be one of numerous titles which are included in a self-contained interactive new universe of comics characters I call UNIVERSE BORN.\n    Where do you come in?- Hopefully you will be reading our book sipping a margarita in four months.

Plus payment to all contributors outside the lead team who have any work dedicated to the book such as coloring , design, layout, post up, editing, and the whole gamut of talented people it takes to put out good comic books.\n   We have a whole range of rewards packages.

The game begins as you wake up, and find yourself trapped inside a mysterious Mansion. Find a way out before being overrun by monsters which include the undead, demons and witches, vampires and werewolves, and mad scientists to boot. There are plenty of playable characters, and a lots of monsters to defeat. Save your friends under distress, heal each other, and work together towards the escape, room after room. But beware, not every player can be trusted: some may harbor secret agendas, or even be traitors. Save yourself, save your friends, fight mythical monsters, find treasures! There is always more to discover, and surprises are just around the corner...\nA tribute to Table-top games: \nIf you are like me, then you are tired of seeing kids, even toddlers, playing their iPhones and iPads at restaurants, in parks, etc... instead of playing with other kids, or interacting with physical objects. But, I think we are all guilty to some degree, just think about how many hours YOU spend looking at a computer, or mobile screen? God forbid your work also requires sitting in front of a computer all day. I say, get off angry birds, and pick up Escape From Monster Mansion for yourself, or get it for a friend in order to embark upon a face-to-face, social gaming experience that will charm and delight even the most addicted mobile gaming fans. \nRoom Cards: offers a dynamic map each game\nThere are plenty of rooms waiting to be explored: \"The Atrium\", \"The Lab\", \"The Dungeon\", \"The Study\", are just a few to name. The Zombie Mansion will look different every game, as players begin in the \"The Prison\", and advance to new rooms one at a time by drawing new room cards fresh from the deck, and connecting them to the existing map. Players must decide if they want to stick together, which forces certain players to sacrifice their immediate goals; Or, players can split up, to cover more ground (Ahhh, the cliche moment when people split up in horror films)... \nCharacters: memorable and unique!\nEach character has a unique back story, and personal quotes. There are fighters, healers, trappers, and finders. Fighters fend off the Monsters, healers help others recover from injuries, trappers guard against surprises, and finders restock on the supplies, and find the way out. \nItems: the unique skill system will drive player interaction\nThere are many items to choose from, but players can't use them unless they have the necessary skills. Fighters can use weapons such as guns; Healers can use med kits; Trappers can use traps; And Finders can use chests and books to restock on supplies. Players have to work together, otherwise they are sitting ducks.\nMonsters: killing them is rewarding!\nMonsters are challenging, but not without rewards. There's a wide range of monsters to be fought, and by defeating them players are rewarded with items, food, and even level-ups! Players who level-up gain new skills, which allow them to use more items and become more powerful all round. \nAgendas: secret identities, and added complexity\nEach player begins with a private agenda. If you are a SURVIVOR, your goal is to simply haul yourself through the Monster Mansion, and escape. If you are an INFECTED, then your goal is also to escape. But the added catch is you must reveal your identity if you become heavily injured. If you are a VIGILANTE, you must insure that no INFECTED players escape, at all cost. If you are a PSYCHOPATH, you must escape, but leave everyone behind. \nGame Demo Video: Coming soon!\nMaker video: Coming Soon!\nSpecial perks of Pledging:\nYou'll get special rewards, such as custom characters, and director's cut rooms, etc. Plus, it's all for a good cause. C'mon people, support your indie developer. Expansions will be on the way. (hint: Escape from an alien vessel...)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGAME BALANCE:\n\nThe core mechanics are solid, and highly social. But, to have a good game it needs to be balance. Every player must feel like they have a role to play, and has a fighting chance against other players. The good news is, we're already play testing. ALOT! \n\nMANUFACTURING:\n\nSo far, the prints have been darker than expected. In order to maximize the aesthetics, we hope to fix that for production. \n\nBEING MISSION DRIVEN:\nMy true mission is to slowly create a movement for social games, as opposed to games being custom crafted to be private addictions. I plan on making many games to come, but this one is my first, and I hope to make it fun and professional as it should be, no matter how challenging the task proves to be!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Payton\n5 created \u00b7 65 backed\nStorytelling is my passion, ever since I was a kid telling stories to my little brother.
