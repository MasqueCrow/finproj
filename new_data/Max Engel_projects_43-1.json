[{"backer": "Max Engel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Before we begin, there are three things you should know:\n1. These products start shipping in May 2021. You won't have to pick which phone case/model you want until then.\n2. Back NOW to lock in Kickstarter-exclusive prices (up to 30% off!).\n3. Like what you see but not ready to commit? Pick the $1 reward titled \"Back Now, Pick Later.\" You won't have to pick which products you want until we're ready to ship them, and you'll still get that sweet Kickstarter discount.\nNow, onto the good stuff:\n\nMeet Mobile.\nMobile by Peak Design is a protective, slim, beautiful phone case and an ecosystem of mounts, accessories and chargers that mount to it. We turn that slippery little super computer in your pocket into a machine that can truly keep up with your life.\nWe've reimagined every freakin' way you interact with your phone and added utility, strength, and thoughtful UX. Oh yeah and everything we've made is built-to-last (we guarantee all these accessories to outlast your phone).\nAlready know you want to order these products? Never backed a Kickstarter? Love Adam? Watch this video:\nOkay so now let's get into what the marketing team refers to as the high level benefit statements:\nSafe and secure means bulky and cumbersome, right? WRONG, actually. Protection shouldn't penalize your pockets. You don't want over-engineered, you want correctly-engineered.\nOur phone case protects (your phone), respects (your pockets), connects (to our ecosystem), and it does it all with some of that famous Peak Design engineering know-how. Activate x-ray goggles: \nTo recap: a lightweight polycarbonate chassis surrounded by a molded bumper of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with a laminated skin of 210d recycled poly/nylon fabric (looks good, feels good, thin as hell) featuring a rugged PU coating and right in the middle of it all is our brand new, 2.4mm thin SlimLink Mounting System with a zirconia ceramic locking insert and array of magnets. Yes, there will be a quiz at the end of the page.\nMeet the Loop, an immediately deployable, mega comfortable, super durable little grip-assistant that we've engineered into the back of our phone case without making the case any thicker. (Not a grip kinda person? No worries, the Everyday Case comes both with and without the Loop.)\nIt's our Everyday Case with even more functionality. The exact same 2.4mm thinness, but with the added functionality of the deployable 'Loop'. There is no wasted space here: we are using every part of the animal.\n\nAll of our Mobile products utilize our brand new SlimLink Mounting System. SlimLink has dual locking mechanisms: a soft lock made possible by a magnetic array embedded in our cases and mounts, and for for more demanding applications mounts a hard lock made possible by a zirconia ceramic insert that interfaces with mechanical claws on our most rugged mounts. No other phone mounting system has the same combination of slimness, magically easy UX, ruggedness, and looks.\nGot a phone case you are emotionally attached to or a phone we aren't yet making a case for? Then nab our Universal Adapter. It attaches with a super strong adhesive to most cases and phone backs and unlocks all the connection magic of our Mobile ecosystem:\nWe are in this for the long haul: SlimLink is our new standard for phone mounting. Mounts, accessories, and chargers you buy right now for your current phone will work just as well with your next phone. And then the phone after that. And the phone after that. And so on and so forth until we all have microchips installed directly into our brains or whatever.\n\n We use premium materials and manufacturing processes to build products that last. You can depend on these mounts and accessories to be around. And in the unlikely event that something falls apart before its time, our lifetime guarantee and world-renowned customer service team will take care of you in no time.\nWe believe good environmental policy starts with thoughtful products (making products that last a long time with heavy use is much better for the environment than making products that don\u2019t) and we are proud members of the following incredible orgs: Climate Neutral, 1% For The Planet, Certified B Corporation. \n\nTo be able to use all of the Peak Design mounts and accessories, you must have either a Peak Design Everyday Case or Universal Adapter. To use just our soft-locking products, you can use our case or adapter OR a case of phone compatible with Apple's MagSafe system.\n\n      Do you have an iPhone 11, 12, or Samsung S20? Get our Everyday Case!\n      Don\u2019t have one? Then our Universal Adapter is for you!\n\n\nA note on why we keep coming back to Kickstarter. \nWe've mentioned it a few times already: this is our 10th Kickstarter campaign.\nWe launch our products on Kickstarter because it gives us the freedom to run our business exactly how we want. The funds we generate on Kickstarter make it possible for us to continue developing products without seeking outside investors. That means we're not beholden to growth goals, revenue targets, or product timelines imposed by other people. Instead, we focus on doing what we love: building the best things we can possibly make, fueled by support from the best customers we could possibly ask for.\n\n                                From the beginning, our backers have steered the direction of our product roadmap, both with their feedback, and with direct participation in our design process via surveys and focus groups. This close collaboration is made possible by communication and community-building tools of the Kickstarter platform.\nThank you for letting us continue on this incredible journey. We cannot wait to get these products into your hands.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 10th Kickstarter project since 2011. As with all of our campaigns, we're launching products that are late in the design phase, but still undergoing final tweaks. The items you receive might look a little different that what you see pictured in our video. But, that's part of the fun of backing a Kickstarter campaign: you're joining us for the ride as we bring these products to life. Inherently, you're taking on a little more risk than if you waited until these products were available for sale on Amazon. But you're also receiving a reward: you'll get these products first, and at a significant discount (up to 30% off!). You'll also get an intimate look into our process, as we'll be sharing design and testing updates throughout the campaign.\n\nThroughout the years we've gotten pretty darn good at setting accurate expectations and delivering on our promises. But no matter how much we've got our poop in a group (official midwestern terminology) things can still go awry. If they do, we solemnly promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of what we see as the top risks that could affect fulfillment:\n\nRisk 1: Apple MagSafe integration doesn't go as expected. Days before we launched this campaign, Apple launched their iPhone 12. With it, they announced MagSafe, a magnetic phone connection system. We are confident that our SlimLink connection system will have a high degree of compatibility with Apple's (see FAQ for details on that). But, we're actively working on the design updates and validation testing to achieve this integration. We could run into an issue that delays fulfillment. Or we could discover a specific compatibility use case that we are unable to solve for. Like we said before, our backers will be coming along for the ride. We plan to post pictures, videos, and updates giving you a detailed look into how our MagSafe compatibility testing is going.\n\nRisk 2: There's a worldwide magnet shortage. This is also related to Apple's MagSafe announcement. We expect that many 3rd party mobile accessory developers will be scrambling to develop MagSafe-compatible cases and mounts. We don't know exactly what the world's magnet supply looks like, but we do know that demand is probably going to go up. There's a chance our magnet suppliers might get overwhelmed, which could delay our fulfillment. We don't think this is likely, but this is 2020. Nothing is off the table.\n\nRisk 3: General supply chain and logistical risks. Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. Sometimes we get the wrong parts or materials in. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products. Global shipping and warehousing logistics is mind-boggling. Hence we outsource that stuff to experts. But even the experts aren't immune to weather, port congestion, and other uncontrollable factors.\n\nRisk 4: Acts of God. We always list this as a risk in our Kickstarter campaigns, usually in a tongue-in-cheek way. But this year is different. We're in a pandemic right now, one that affected many supply chains across the world. We're based in San Francisco, surrounded by land that's been burning for a better part of the summer. Shit happens, and when it does, our first priority is the health and safety of people and communities.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur phones are brilliant machines that deserve brilliant accessories, not throw-away gadgets. That's why every Peak Design Mobile product is individually serialized, register-able, and guaranteed for life. We're setting up our refurbishment facility to allow us to rework and resell broken products, like we do with our bags and camera gear. Many of our mounts are made from machined, anodized aluminum. These products are designed to last you for many phones to come.\nReusability and recyclability\nThis is Peak Design's first line of products to feature packaging that is 100% recyclable cardboard stock...no metal, plastics, magnets, or anything that would traditionally need to be separated from your packaging to recycle it. Open the box, grab your product, and drop the box into the recycle bin.\nSustainable materials\nAll Peak Design phone cases are laminated in high-performance nylon canvas fabric. This fabric provides important functional and aesthetic benefits to our cases. We recently achieved Bluesign approval of this important material, meaning that it is certified to have the lowest possible impact on people and the planet.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPeak Design has been building a supply chain in China and Vietnam for 10 years. We've developed a code of conduct for all of our manufacturing partners that includes parameters around employee pay, safety, working conditions, company policies, and sustainability. We invest in 3rd party audits to ensure our factories can meet these goals.\nSustainable Distribution\nPeak Design is 100% carbon neutral. That means that zero net greenhouse gases are emitted when making/delivering the Mobile products. We achieve this by measuring the Scope 1-3 carbon footprint of each product, from raw material mining to manufacturing to shipping to the end customer. We then reduce or offset that carbon footprint by purchasing verified carbon offset credits. Peak Design is fully carbon neutral, all the way back to the beginning of our company.\n\nIn fact, we co-founded a nonprofit (Climate Neutral) to help businesses of all kinds measure, reduce, and offset the entirety of their carbon emissions generated by making and delivering their products. There are over 150 Climate Neutral Certified brands (and counting). Kickstarter themselves have joined this certification label!\nSomething else\nIn addition to the above, we're a Certified B-Corp. We're also members of 1% for the Planet, meaning we donate 1% of our top-line revenue (including the revenue of this project) to environmental nonprofits.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Pick Your Kit (no Case/Adapter)", "descp": "Getting an iPhone 12 but NOT interested in hard-locking accessories (I.E. bike mounts, motorcycle mounts, Creator Kit)?

The pivots allow Heroclip to hang in the most awkward spaces and the swivel allows easy access to whatever you need from what you are hanging.

Over the past year, with feedback from our customers, we've built several rounds of prototypes of the large size of Heroclip. We have taken everything we learned about manufacturing, quality control and logistics from our previous production runs and created a process to ensure that all of our production goes as smoothly as possible. Our company already has a track record of delivering products on our promises, and we have produced and sold over 650,000 units of product.\n\nDespite our company's success so far, the reality is that producing goods in high enough volume so that they are affordable to all (we truly believe that the Heroclip line will benefit EVERYONE's lives) requires capital.  With your help, we can bring the extended Heroclip line to life!\n\nBased in Seattle, WA, the Heroclip team is dedicated to designing and making products that make adventure of any kind and size more convenient. We believe in making gear that can go with you from activity to activity and like to see our products as \u201clifestyle catalysts\u201d that enhance your life, no matter what you are doing. Members of our team bike, go on RV trips, ski, hike, raise kids (and dogs) (and cats), remodel homes, go wine tasting, do Crossfit and more, and we love that our products help us with all of these things. We love hearing from our customers about how they use their Heroclips (there are some very creative uses out there!), and we\u2019re excited to hear from you in the future, too.   \n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been in business for 5 years, and we have a wonderful, long-term relationship with our manufacturer.

Read the full update here.\n The \"Smell of Space\" \n\"\u2026a rather pleasant metallic sensation... [like] ... sweet-smelling welding fumes, burning metal, a distinct odour of ozone, an acrid smell, walnuts and brake pads, gunpowder, fruit, rum, and even burnt almond cookie.\"\nDecades ago, NASA asked specialists to develop the \"smell of space\" to help train astronauts before launch into orbit. NASA's goal of simulating Space during training is to eliminate any surprises Astronauts might experience in Outer Space. Astronauts experience a high G Force Centrifuge simulator for blastoff training, carryout extreme underwater to trainings in Zero G weightlessness for when they reach outer space, and learn what to expect for everything in between. After all, it isRocket Science. The history of the \"Smell of Space\" has been clouded behind various accounts of existence. Ever since the first space walk, astronauts were shocked by the lingering odor when returning back into the spacecraft. Some describe it as gun powder, rum, fruit, seared steak, or a BBQ. The first space tourists also noted a pungent aroma once the hatch opened, 'like burnt cookies'. We had to find out for ourselves...What does space smell like? We dug deep. With a bit of luck (and a beautiful thing called a FOIA request), we found our lead. A perfumer based in the UK. \"The smell of space is so distinct that..NASA reached out to [a fragrance maker] to re-create the odor for its training simulations\". Bingo. Two exclusive commercial contracts later, a secret shelved formula based on verified astronaut accounts, a very large minimum order of fragrance...and we're all off smelling space! We've had Space Ice Cream...this just takes it a small step further. (Or maybe it's a leap for all man kind?)\n \"Will you pledge your support today to help mass manufacturer Eau de Space, so that everyone can experience the 'Smell of Space' for themselves?\"  \n We've partnered with award winning perfumers, some of the best in the world, and secured the rights to launch this product exclusively. Our team consists of top Fashion, Tech, Design, and Logistics experience--all with a desire to increase interest in STEM fields through experiential education. Click \"Register your School\" below to add your STEM program. Eau de Space is our first product launch under this important initiative, and we hope there will be many more. \n\"Still on the fence? When's the next time you'll get to smell outer space?\"\nWe're ready to manufacturer the smell and all we need is meet our MOQ (Minimum order Quantity). Then we can bottle and ship the smell of space directly to you.\nBuy One, Give One\nTom's founder, Blake Mycoskie founded his shoe company on the \"One for One\" model. The One for One model is designed so that for every shoe purchased, one is donated to someone in need. This model, and shoe, was so popular that other large companies like Sketchers were inspired to release shoes in a similar fashion, one of which they named \"Bobs\". \n \"For every bottle of Eau de Space you buy, we're going to donate one to a K-12 Science, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) program in need.\" \nIt's a big promise, and isn't the best decision for a company trying to make a profit. But, we really believe in the cause and hope you do too. Imagine if a child that smells Eau de Space today is inspired to become an astronaut, scientist, or engineer. One day, that same child may even become the first human to walk on Mars. That's the kind of impact experiential education has on early teaching programs in the formative years of child development. And it's a really neat mission to be a part of. \n\u00a9 Eau de Space 2020.

Having just joined the Wonderful Ones after finishing a year of comprehensive training, Earth Defense War III is his first experience in combat.\nThough technically still a rookie, he is extremely gifted, achieving a record score in both the written and field sections of the CENTINEL tactical examinations. Brimming with passion for justice, he takes a firm stance against those who threaten peace, but his by the books attitude and serious personality can occasionally rub people the wrong way. Sometimes Red's seriousness crosses the realm of reason, and those around him find getting through to him almost impossible. The opposite is rarer, though, as Red has an incredible memory, and never forgets something after being told.\nHis deep crimson CENTINEL-Suit boasts balance in all levels of performance, demonstrating diverse aptitude in any mission. The Vulcan Knuckles equipped to both his arms are capable of intense blows and machine-like accuracy, which can be even further increased in power via the \"Unite Hand\" Unite Morph technique.\n\nA Wonderful One whose cover occupation is as a detective for the Los Angeles Police Department. Though young, he has gained experience and success in a variety of missions: taking down warring mafia families, counter-terrorism, and even taking part in military operations.\nHaving a strong sense of identity, and a stronger dislike for authority, Blue is not the easiest Wonderful One to deal with in the organization; however, his ability to act quickly and make decisions in the blink of an eye has led to a chain of successful missions. Yet, despite these successes, his hot-headed personality has makes Blue prone lose himself in anger, peppering his record with a significant number of failures.\nBlue insists on making a scene for everyone to see, so in combat he acts arrogant, taunting the enemy, and is prone to posturing into different poses that might look \"cool.\" Unfortunately, reactions to his antics are conspicuous in their absence.\nPoor at teamwork and preferring to work alone, Blue does not actively try seek meaningful relationships with others. Instead, he accepts only those who are able to prove their skills, but this acceptance leads to a deep respect.\nHis weapon, the Valiantium Blade, is said to become sharper with every slice, forged with a special alloy able to cut through anything in the galaxy. His Unite Sword can deal lethal blows to even battleships.\nChose to be a Wonderful One due to his incredible skill with firearms and other ranged weapons, Wonder-Green is currently a mere middle school student. Yet, despite his youth, it is said that he can shoot through the hole of a donut a 100 kilometers away, while eating a donut himself.\nPossibly due to his privileged upbringing, he often seems to feel like the world revolves around him and is prone to ignoring the reality of his surroundings. He also unwittingly rude, leading to occasional clashes with Blue and Pink; clashes Green himself seems unbothered by. In fact, at least with Pink, he almost seems to enjoy being scolded.\nEven during the tensest of missions, he possesses a completely carefree nature; that is until something goes south, then he instantly breaks into panic. Far clumsier than most would ever suspect for a Wonderful One, the world prays that the care with which Green uses his rapid-fire proton gun Christine Daa\u00e9 is another, more careful, side of him that holds great pride in his position. (Or so the world hopes...)\nHe has developed a close friendship with Black, as both are similar in age and love video games, comics, cartoons, and general mischief-making. This mischief-making extends to his love of junk food, a forbidden fruit under his parents, but a near constant indulgence as Green partakes in missions far beyond their strict reach.\n\nChosen to go to the Olympics in gymnastics while still in high school, Wonder-Pink is by far the most flexible and agile of any Wonderful One. She matches this with an advanced proficiency in melee weaponry, specifically with her Beautiful Whip, knit from a next-gen stay-press alloy \"Belmont alloy,\" for which she is unrivaled.\nPink is known for her \"laissez-faire\" personality, behaving carefree and sunny during even the most severe missions, as if her duties were just another after school club; however, it is that relaxed attitude that, more often than not, spells disaster for the team. Exceedingly sensitive towards trends, she has decorated her issued weapon with a variety of accessories, and her tendency to prioritize fashion over the mission can occasionally give her superiors headaches. Nevertheless, Pink's excellent physical aptitude and peerless acrobatics have led the team to countless victories.\nExtremely emotional, she sometimes reveals her terrifying true colors when angered. Pink is especially sensitive to anything said by Green, and she will gladly turn her tormentor into her whipping boy when set off.\nPlus many many more heroes!\nIn The Wonderful 101: Remastered, you don\u2019t just control a single superhero. You control a whole team, united to face off against the forces of evil. As you travel around the city, you\u2019ll rescue civilians, who will then join your cause, bolstering your ranks.\nThe Wonderful Ones have more than just numbers on their side. To solve puzzles and smash evil, the Wonderful Ones can perform a \u201cUnite Morph\u201d, combining together to create fists, swords, bridges and other incredible constructs.\nTogether with Wonder Red, Wonder Blue, and the rest of the Wonderful Ones, it\u2019s time to save Blossom City, and the rest of the world!\nThe most powerful tool for the Wonderful Ones is the incredible Unite Morph. By combining together, the Wonderful Ones can turn into a variety of awesome shapes, from whips to swords to giant fists.\nIn-game, players draw specific shapes on the battlefield with the control stick, and the Unite Morph initiates!\nUnite Morphing isn\u2019t just for combat, though! The Wonderful Ones can use their powers for traversal as well, whether it\u2019s a faraway ladder or a precarious rope bridge, there\u2019s nowhere The Wonderful 100 can\u2019t reach!\nUnite Hand\nPLAY\n\nThe famous fist of justice used by Wonder Red, Unite Hand is the Wonderful Ones\u2019 most basic Unite Morph. Used to pummel, smash and brutalize foes, the Unite Hand can also be used to rotate cogs and empty gacha monsters of their contents.\nUnite Sword\nPLAY\n\nWhile not as strong as the Unite Hand, the Unite Sword has a longer reach, and is sharp enough to cut through chains. As an added bonus, the Unite Sword\u2019s pristine broad side can also reflect lasers back at enemies.\nUnite Gun\nPLAY\n\nWhile the Unite Gun isn\u2019t one of the strongest Unite Morphs in the Wonderful Ones' arsenal, it really shines in long distance situations. The gun can hit both enemies and environmental objects, allowing the Wonderful Ones to defeat distant foes or solve otherwise inaccessible puzzles. \nUnite Whip\nPLAY\n\nThe Unite Whip is a Unite Morph created from combining with a flexible, thorned whip. Not only can it attack enemies from afar, it can also tie them up, making it perfect for dealing with armored foes, spiked walls, and other prickly surfaces. It can also be used to latch onto certain surfaces to swing the whole team over gaps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there are always risks during the development and porting process, we are

After the success of our first two Air Deck and three Nanobag campaigns, and more than 37k backers later, we\u2019re now ready for our sixth campaign.  \nThe Air Deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do\n Created with feedback from the community, here are our seven new designs: \nOur 7 designs: Red Classic, Electric, Night Sky, Aqua Mandala, Geometric, Retro and Blue Classic\nCheck out some of the feedback we've received from our Air Deck 2.0 backers.\n52 Playing Cards + 2 jokers\nWaterproof and washable\nCompact travel friendly size\nLightweight\nDurable heavy-duty 'casino quality' 0.31mm PVC\nPremium printing\nSlightly textured on both sides for better handling\nSturdy 0.4mm waterproof synthetic paper tuck box\nPlaying card size : 3.43 x 1.26 inches (87 x 32mm)\n\nPS. When pledging, just select the number of decks you want. You get to choose which designs you want in the backer survey we send out after the campaign is over.  \nOur mission is to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers\nThe Air Deck 3.0 takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket\nAir Deck 3.0 is made with the same high-quality materials as the original, but there\u2019s a few new things:\nFive fresh new designs voted on by our community.\nThe boxes now have indents to make them easier to open.\nWe'll be planting even more mangrove trees to offset our emissions many times over. We believe being a climate positive company is important. 1 tree gets planted for every two decks sold.\n\nFive fresh new designs voted on by our community\nThe boxes now have an indent to make them easier to open\n\nThank you for helping us reach both our stretch goals!\nWith the Air Deck 3.0 we did not want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world\u2019s best manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high-end plastic materials. The materials were taken through scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally, we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want for our deck.    \nThe Air Deck 3.0 is meticulously cut\nThe Air Deck is made of a casino quality PVC\n The Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and is 100% waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of. \nWhile regular paper playing cards tear, stain, and break easily, Air Deck 3.0 is extremely durable\nThe cards are 100% waterproof, so you can use them in the pool, bathtub or even the beach.\nYou can also wash the cards.\n\nThe cards are slightly textured on both sides to provide cushioning and excellent handling\nIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals. The end result is a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on both sides to provide cushioning and excellent handling. \nThe Air Deck 3.0 shuffles easily\n\nWe created the new designs for Air Deck 3.0 with the wonderful supportive feedback we\u2019ve received from our community. Despite their smaller width, the cards are as easy to read as standard sized decks. The full-sized length ensures that they also handle much like regular cards, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.\nThe narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands\nBlue Classic, Aqua Mandala, Night Sky and Red Classic comes with traditional looking face cards, while Retro, Geometric and Electric has a more minimalistic look: \nOur face card designs\n\nEach deck consists of 52 standard playing cards and 2 jokers\n\nWe love traveling this beautiful blue ball we call home, and we believe we should care for it as best we can. There\u2019s only one planet earth after all. We consider the Air Deck 3.0 to be an environmentally conscious product to begin with, as it contains half the materials of its competitors, and is made of durable materials which provides a long product life. However, with this campaign we\u2019ve upped our commitment to the planet by planting one mangrove tree for every two decks sold with our tree planting partner, Eden Reforestation Projects.\nMangrove trees are one of the most effective tools to bind CO2 to the soil, thus preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere. A mangrove tree can sequester up to a ton of carbon dioxide by the time it reaches 40 years old. As a bonus, they also help sustain coastal ecosystems, protect shorelines from damage by storms and acts as a filter to maintain water quality.\nWe will plant mangrove trees with Eden Reforestation Projects\n\nThe idea for the original Air Deck was conceived by fellow globetrotters Ursus Negenborn and Rune Kippervik while traveling South East Asia. We love playing cards, and we just couldn\u2019t find a deck that was perfect for carrying at all times. As we\u2019re big fans of optimization, we decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers ourselves.\nThe Air Deck founders\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 950+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $400M raised between them.\nPromoted by Palm Tree Digital, the marketing power behind some of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns of 2019.

Since this is our third project, we\u2019ve ironed out the kinks, and we feel confident that we can deliver a great product. Logistics has already been worked thoroughly out, and we will ship tracked to all customers, to ensure a reliable delivery. Our factory is standing by, and will start production as soon as we are funded. As with any project, unforeseen events can occur, but we've done everything we can to keep unknown factors to a minimum.

The direct translation from this Japanese is \u201ctime numerals\u201d \nThe seven segment digit was patented in 1903 for a method of telegraphically transmitting numbers to be printed on tape. The first digital wrist watch was an LED prototype in 1970. Perhaps this type of digit is fading away as our interface design, and display technologies advance, but let\u2019s not forget how they have taken such a prominent place in the background of our everyday lives. Our new Tokiji watch gives them the respect they deserve. These vivid digits are generously spaced on a rich, black dial, surrounded by a handsome, minimal case. \nThis watch features a striking display based on a unique approach that we have spent years developing. This breakthrough process is something that we began to develop with our original digital watch, but have refined this process for Tokiji.\nAll digital watches hide the frame of their liquid crystal display (LCD). This is usually done by printing a masking window on the underside of the watch\u2019s lens. What always irritated us, is that the black of the LCD, and the black of the mask are essentially the same. However, when they are overlapped, the light is refracted, so they always look different. The window\u2019s shape stands out, and is not particularly related to the watch\u2019s overall design. It is simply something that the watch designer has to work around.\nOur digital display eliminates this problem with an original process developed by us. After much trial and error,  we found the best way to remove all of the air, and space from between the lens, and the LCD display, so the light can pass straight through. Because the light is now uninhibited, both of these blacks line up perfectly. This allows us to eliminate the window all together, and make our mask the shape of the actual display graphics. \nThe result of this process makes for a very deep, and consistent black across the entire watch face to accentuate its vivid digits.\nMovement:  custom digital module \nBatteries:  two V371 silver oxide batteries*\nDimensions:  \u00d838 x 8.5 mm  / \u00d81.5\u201d x 0.35\u201d \nFunctions: Time, Date, Alarm, 2nd Timezone, Stopwatch, Backlight\nCase: 304 stainless steel \nLens: hardened mineral glass \nBands: premium calfskin leather, or stainless steel mesh\nWeight with leather band: 50 g / 1.76 oz. \nWeight with mesh band: 70 g / 2.47 oz. \nWater resistance: 3 ATM (30 m / 100') \nWarranty: 2 Years  \nIn this campaign, we are offering two case styles: uncoated stainless steel, and IP black plated stainless steel. These can be combined with one of three bands: black leather, stainless steel mesh, and IP black stainless steel mesh. Once the Tokiji campaign is complete, we will be in touch every backer directly to take their preference. \nWe believe that the products we choose for ourselves, particularly the ones we carry with us throughout the day, are extensions of us. They should act to reinforce our persona, not distract from it. Therefore, as policy, we never display our logo on the face of your watch. Our branding is always close by on the back of the watch. Commonly, this information is etched onto the removable caseback. In this case, ours is set outside of the caseback, to make this an ideal location for etching your personal message. We are planning to offer this service in the near future.\nFinal assembly, and quality check will be directly overseen by us at our Tokyo studio. \nAll of the leather, and mesh bands we produce have release levers attached. No tools are required to easily remove, and replace these bands.\nNormal Timepieces packaging, and warranty card.\nPLAY\n\nNormal Timepieces was founded by Ross, and Madoka McBride in 2006. Ross is from the United States, but has lived more than half of his life in Tokyo. Madoka is from Hiroshima. Their motivations for creating this brand is an analogy to their relationship itself. It was founded on the combined influences of pioneering mid-century American design, as well as the Japanese sense of minimalism, and craftsmanship. Wikie Sato joined this team in 2015. Her previous experience was perfectly tailored to Normal with her Hong Kong upbringing, graphic design studies in Australia, and work experience the Japanese fashion industry.\nIf you would like to know more about us, and the Normal brand, you can always see more information on our website <www.normaltimepieces.com>, and through our social media accounts <Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook>.\nPLAY\n\nTokiji in action. \nPLAY\n\nThis is a video of us playing with an idea of how to present Tokiji for its first public display. \n\nSHIPPING\nPlease note that if you live outside of Japan, we will be sending your order through the postal system by EMS. These shipments are express, and insured. Once sent out, we will email you its tracking number so you can monitor its progress. We will cover the shipping cost. However, you will be responsible for any applicable custom fees that your country\u2019s post office may require for delivery. Additionally, the estimated delivery time is generally 7~14 days. However, this may take a little longer due to the standards of destination country\u2019s postal system.

After the success of our first Air Deck campaign, we\u2019ve been busy figuring out how we could improve on our original Air Deck campaign. After 18 months of work, and great feedback from the community, here are our three new designs:  \nOur three new designs: Classic, Warp Speed and Astronauts Playing Cards\nOur mission is to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers\n52 Playing Cards + 2 jokers\nWaterproof and washable\nCompact travel friendly size\nLight weight\nDurable heavy-duty 'casino quality' 0.31mm PVC\nPremium printing\nSlightly textured on both sides for better handling \nSturdy 0.4mm waterproof synthetic paper tuck box \nPlaying card size : 3.43 x 1.26 inches (87 x 32mm)\nFREE tracked international shipping! \nPS. When pledging, just select the number of decks you want. You get to choose which designs you want in the backer survey we send out after the campaign is over. \nAir Deck 2.0 easily fits on small surfaces, such as a plane tray table\nAir Deck 2.0 is made with the same high-quality materials as the original, but we've made a couple of upgrades (apart from the new look):  \nOur new decks are designed so they\u2019re even more resilient to wear and tear.  \nThe boxes (including our current 1st generation Air Decks) are upgraded to .4mm waterproof synthetic paper, which makes them more durable than the .3mm we shipped with the original campaign. \nThe ink on the box is now more resistant to scratching.\nWe'll be planting mangrove trees to offset any CO2 emitted from production and shipping of the cards.\nThis time around we also offer stretch goals. Several other designs were also popular in our community feedback surveys. For us to be able to offer these, we need to reach a couple milestones:\nStretch goal #1 and #2 reached!\nThe idea for the original Air Deck was conceived by fellow globetrotters Ursus Negenborn and Rune Kippervik while traveling South East Asia. We love playing cards, and we just couldn\u2019t find a deck that was perfect for carrying at all times. As we\u2019re big fans of optimization, we decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers ourselves. \nThe Air Deck founders\nThe original Air Deck that started it all\nWith the Air Deck 2.0 we did not want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world\u2019s best manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high-end plastic materials. The materials were taken through scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally, we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want for our deck.\nWhile regular paper playing cards tear, stain, bend and break easily, Air Deck 2.0 is extremely durable\nThe cards grip nicely and have a premium feel\nThe Air Deck 2.0 takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket\nThe Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and is 100% waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of. \nThe cards are 100% waterproof, so you can even use them in the pool or the bathtub\nIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals, to help us find the optimal material and design. The end result is a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on on both sides to provide excellent handling.\nThe Air Deck 2.0 handles well and shuffles easily\nWe created the new designs for Air Deck 2.0 with the wonderful feedback we\u2019ve received from our community. \nWarp speed and Astronauts playing cards come with the same minimalist fronts as the original white decks. For our new classic design, we\u2019ve given the jack, queen, king and the joker a more traditional look. \nDespite their smaller width, the cards are as easy to read as a standard sized decks. The full-sized length ensures that it also handles much like a full size deck, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.\nOur Classic design has traditional looking face cards\nWarp Speed and Astronauts Playing Cards have the same minimalist look as our original deck\nThe Air Deck 2.0 comes with a durable waterproof synthetic paper tuck box\nWe love traveling this beautiful blue ball we call home, and we believe we should care for it as best we can. There\u2019s only one earth after all. The Air Deck 2.0 is an environmentally conscious product to begin with, as it contains almost half the materials of its competitors. In addition, we\u2019ll also offset any CO2 that\u2019s emitted from the production and shipping of the project, by planting mangrove trees in Myanmar with Worldview International Foundation. Mangrove trees are pretty awesome, as they\u2019re one of the most effective tools to bind CO2 to the soil and prevent it from escaping into the atmosphere. They\u2019re ten times more effective than most other tree species, and as a bonus, they also help sustain coastal ecosystems, protect the shorelines from damage by storms and acts as a filter to maintain water quality. The more decks that gets pledged, the more trees will be planted. \nWe will plant mangrove trees with World View International Foundation\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe designs of the cards have been finalized, and we\u2019ve made the prototypes you see in the video.

Logistics has already been worked thoroughly out, and we will ship tracked to all customers, to ensure a reliable delivery. Our factory is standing by, and will start production as soon as we are funded. As with any project, unforeseen events can occur, but we've done everything we can to keep unknown factors to a minimum.

Don\u2019t let bad air ruin it. With Wynd Halo and the Wynd Home Purifier, you can monitor\u2014and physically perfect\u2014your environment. \nWynd Halo has 10 sensors to monitor allergens, smoke, germs, pollution, and more. It features a new innovation called Air ID which classifies the actual pollutants in the air so that you can take the right course of action. Wynd Halo pairs seamlessly with the Wynd Home Purifier to remove any contaminants from your environment quickly and automatically.\n We take 20,000 breaths every day, but what\u2019s in the air we\u2019re breathing? Wynd Halo can tell you and make it better. \nWynd Halo monitors the air and gives you a summary of your environment at a glance.\nWynd Halo houses more sensors than any other environmental monitor. It also introduces a new technology called Air ID, which determines the actual composition of your air\u2014from pollen, to pet dander, to smog\u2014so that you can take the right course of action to improve your environment. \nWynd Halo fits in anywhere. You can put it in the bedroom, office, or baby\u2019s room\u2014and mount it on the wall using the wall-mount accessory (available as an add-on).\n Most air quality sensors just measure the general concentration of things (particles or chemicals), but can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s actually there. We think it\u2019s important for you to know whether your air has pollen, forest fire smoke,  or smog from the nearby industrial plant.\nOver the past two years we\u2019ve developed an innovative technology called Air ID. By combining raw sensor data with contextual data from the cloud, Air ID can tell you what you are actually breathing.\nIn response to issues detected via Air ID, the Wynd app can recommend actions to help you stay healthy.\nGet recommendations from the Wynd app based on Halo's analysis of your environment (iOS and Android)\nSee surrounding air quality and environmental information for a global network of air quality stations via the Air Bubbles network.\nIn addition, the Wynd app can alert you of any major issues in your environment so that you can quickly react to serious issues.\nJust let Wynd Halo know what you\u2019re doing, and it\u2019ll optimize your environment for that activity.\nHalo will launch with 5 customizable optimizations. In each setting, Halo can activate connected devices such as purifiers (including the Wynd Home Purifier), thermostats, humidifiers, and lights. Over time, we\u2019ll be adding more optimizations via software updates.\nTo change temperature, light, and more, Halo works with platforms such as Alexa, Nest, and Apple HomeKit. \nWe designed the Wynd Home Purifier to work seamlessly with Wynd Halo. Wynd Halo monitors the air, and the Wynd Home Purifier cleans it up. The Home Purifier uses Halo data to remove allergens, mold, germs, chemicals, odors, and air pollution from your home.\nThe Wynd Home Purifier achieves rapid cleaning speeds by using 2x the filter surface area of typical purifiers and precision turbine engineering. This design increases airflow while lowering noise\u2014meaning it can clean quickly and quietly.\nThe Wynd Home Purifier isn\u2019t just any air purifier. It\u2019s the most powerful air purifier in its class, able to clean 537 cubic meters of air per hour\u2014or, 1,200 square feet in 30 minutes.\n* Class is defined as connected (wifi and app-enabled) air purifiers with prices less than $500 USD. \nThe V-Series HEPA filter is designed to clean a broad range of pollutants in your environment, including both particles and gases.\nThe Wynd Home Purifier uses a proprietary HEPA filter that removes particulates and gases, including allergens, mold, germs, toxic odors, air pollution, and more. \nThe Wynd Home Purifier\u2019s filter removes pollutants big and small from the air.\nIn addition, the filter material is embedded with silver to kill germs. In third-party testing, the filter killed 99.97% of staphylococcus aureus (staph) and escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria that was on the material. \nAt its core, Wynd Home Purifier works seamlessly with the Wynd Halo so you shouldn\u2019t need to make any manual adjustments. After pairing with the Halo, the Wynd Home Purifier goes to work when needed to maintain a healthy and clean environment.\nThe Wynd Home Purifier doesn't just operate on full blast all day: It only turns on when needed. With smart scheduling, if you\u2019re not home, the purifier can turn down automatically. It turns up a couple hours before you get home, so that the air's fresh when you return\u2014and it even lowers its volume when you're home, so that you can enjoy a quiet atmosphere. Smart scheduling saves electricity and extends filter life.\nIt can also work with other IOT platforms, like Alexa and Apple HomeKit, to control its cleaning power.    \nWith automatic optimizations and integration with internet connected devices, your Halo and Home Purifier can automatically optimize the air around you for whatever you're doing.\nWe are honored to be working once again on industrial design with Mike Nuttall, the co-founder of the world-famous design firm, IDEO. His focus on making technology products intuitive, elegant, and timeless is core to our philosophy at Wynd, and can be seen in many elements of the Wynd Halo. See below for his narration of the Halo design story. \nWe went through dozens of different designs before finalizing the shape and function of the Wynd Halo\nWorking on the CAD design of the Halo\nDesign of the Wynd v2.0 app, which will support both existing Wynd products as well as the Wynd Halo, Wynd Home Purifier, and future products to come\nThe Wynd Halo houses 10 unique sensors that provide insights into each facet of your environment. Each sensor is tuned to monitor key health and comfort metrics.\nWhen we needed a PM (particulate matter) sensor for our first product in 2015, we realized there wasn\u2019t one available that was right for us\u2014so we got our in-house team of MIT alums to invent one. Since then, we\u2019ve had a lot of time to improve it. The latest version is highly accurate, measures various particle sizes, syncs with the cloud, and automatically recalibrates. \nWynd Halo houses a particulate matter (PM) module which classifies particles at a highly granular level. Every second, over 100,000 readings are analyzed.\nWe also improved the laser: The new PM sensor uses a blue laser\u2014which has a finer wavelength\u2014to measure particles as small as 0.1 microns (700x smaller than the diameter of human hair). These particles are key elements of pollution, allergens, dander, and germs.\nWynd\u2019s PM module uses a blue laser at 402 nanometers to measure particulates as small as 0.1 microns. Other PM sensors use red lasers which are far less precise.\nOn the hardware, Halo analyzes the measurements from the PM sensor 100,000 times per second to determine the size and fundamentals of various pollutants.\nThe PM module can generate highly detailed particulate models, such as this one\u2014which shows the profile of household dust and dander.\nIn addition to particulate matter, Halo includes a number of other sensors, including volatile organic compound (VOC), temperature, humidity, light, noise, and others\u2014so that you can get the full profile of your environment. \nWynd Halo combines measurements from all of its sensors to produce actionable information about your environment.\nMost pollution sensors measure things in generality. For example, particulate sensors report only report dust concentration and size. We wanted to go deeper and ask the question: What is the actual composition of the air? Is it pollen, dander, smog, or something else?\nUsing a combination of hardware sensors, machine learning algorithms, and cloud data, Wynd Halo can determine the actual composition of pollutants in your air\u2014from plant pollen to traffic pollution. Knowing the composition of what\u2019s in your air is fundamental to taking the right action.\nThe Wynd Home Purifier was specifically designed to maximize airflow. Most purifiers use one filter, but ours uses two: This doubles the air intake area, so that the purifier can output massive amounts of air. Dual filters create super-fast cleaning speeds and significantly lengthen filter life.\nThe purifier houses a powerful turbofan which spins at 987 RPM to clean your space quickly. At max, the Wynd Home Purifier generates 537 cubic meters of air per hour, which is enough to clean a 1,200 square foot space in under 30 minutes.\nInternals of the Wynd Home Purifier showing the powerful turbofan, capable of spinning at 987 RPM to generate over 537 cubic meters of clean air per hour\nHere's a quick demo of the Wynd Home Purifier in action:\nThe Wynd Home Purifier cleans a tank full of pollutants in 30 seconds.\nADD-ON INSTRUCTIONS\nYou do not need to choose a different reward tier for your add-ons.\nNEW BACKERS:\nAdd the amount for each add-on item you want to your Pledge amount \nSend us a direct message (click \"Contact me\") on Kickstarter telling us which add-on items you want (i.e., \"a set of V-Series Filters\")\nAfter the campaign is over, we'll confirm with you which add-ons you want.\nPREVIOUS BACKERS:\nClick the Manage button to manage your pledge amount\nClick Change your pledge and add the pledge amount for each add-on item you want\nSend us a direct message (click \"Contact me\") on Kickstarter telling us which add-on items you want (i.e., \"a set of V-Series replacement filters\")\nAfter the campaign is over, we'll confirm with you which add-ons you want.\nNEW BACKERS USING THE KICKSTARTER APP:\nAdd the amount for each add-on item you want to your Pledge amount \nComment on the project or send us a direct message (tap \"Contact\" on the Wynd Technologies, Inc. page) telling us which add-on items you want (i.e., \"2 sets of V-Series filters\")\nAfter the campaign is over, we'll confirm with you which add-ons you want.\nPREVIOUS BACKERS USING THE KICKSTARTER APP\nTap the Manage pledge button to manage your pledge amount\nAdd the appropriate pledge amount and tap Next \nNavigate back to the Wynd campaign\nComment on the project or send us a direct message (tap \"Contact\" on the Wynd Technologies, Inc. page) telling us which add-on items you want (i.e., \"2 replacement filters\")\nAfter the campaign is over, we'll confirm with you which add-ons you want. \nWe created Wynd out of a need to enable healthy and comfortable environments for ourselves and our families wherever we go. \nRay (founder) frequently traveled to Asia, where poor air quality is a well-known problem. He hated the way pollution made him feel, and wanted to be able to take healthy air with him on the go. We launched our first product, a smart and portable air purifier, on Kickstarter in 2016 and it became the most funded air purifier ever. \nWe are excited to be back and introduce two products, Wynd Halo and Wynd Home Purifier, that bring worry-free, fresh air to your home. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any smart hardware project, there are natural risks and challenges in engineering and manufacturing. The final manufacturing timeline could face delays due to technical difficulties, supply chain issues, and other reasons. \n\nHowever, we've done our best to minimize risks for backers: We\u2019ve mass produced multiple products in the tens of thousands of units before, including the Wynd Personal Purifier on Kickstarter in 2016. In addition, we already have fully working prototypes that have demonstrated all the key functionality. We also have already been working with our factory for over half a year in preparing for the evaluation, design, and production validation phases to come. Our electronics and firmware are also at an advanced stage. In addition, the accompanying Wynd app is being developed and on track.\n\nWe'll do our best to be as transparent as possible and keep you informed, and work hard to resolve any issues as they may arise.

The result? A watch crafted with the utmost care that carries a strong symbolic value and contributes to rebuilding conflict torn societies.\nAt TRIWA, we have developed watches for over ten years with the goal of transforming the industry. With our Humanium Metal watches we\u2019ll be taking this transformation to the next level by creating watches from the metal of destructed illegal firearms. With your help, we will make a contribution in the fight against armed violence.\nWe've partnered with non-profit organization IM Swedish Development Partner, which retrieves and melts down illegal firearms from conflict torn societies, turning them into Humanium Metal. We then buy the metal, refine and mold it into watch cases that are later made into TRIWA x Humanium Metal Watches. \nThe very purchase of Humanium Metal makes a difference: a portion of funds made from the sale circles back to the society where the firearms were originally collected and supports the victims of armed violence.\nWe have treated the Humanium Metal with the respect it deserves, molding it into a solitaire piece with contrasting metal treatments. The watch is filled with symbolic references, such as the Humanium Metal logo that is punched on the case, the embossed indexes on the dial and the fiery red second hand, date display and crown center.\n You\u2019ll be able to choose from two sizes: 39 or 34 millimeters with either a vertically brushed dark grey dial or light steel dial. Our latest model is the Hu39-DA which features automatic movement and comes in recycled green canvas, and black or brown tanned leather.  (Now avaialble in a light version as well!)\nAll TRIWA x Humanium Metal watches backed on Kickstarter will exclusively come with a scratch resistant sapphire glass and each model is numbered to designate the order in which the watch was produced.\nHumanium Metal by IM is an award winning material made from destructed illegal firearms and melted into a usable metal. The metal is crafted out of something that used to be a destructive force, now turned into something good. The sales from Humanium Metal generate financial resources used to rebuild conflict torn societies and support victims of armed violence. \nHumanium Metal is part of IM Swedish Development Partner\u2019s strategy to help fulfill United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development.\nThe Humanium Metal has been refined into 316L stainless steel to meet the high standards of an everyday wristwatch.\nBy buying a TRIWA x Humanium Metal watch, you can help the world become a more peaceful place. \n1. IM Swedish Development Partner collects illegal firearms from conflict torn societies\n2. The weapons are deconstructed, separating metal from wood\n3. Afterwards, the parts are melted in a furnace and casted into what we now call Humanium Metal\n4. This is where TRIWA comes in. After purchasing Humanium Metal, we will use the material to craft our new collection, allowing monetary funds to circle back to the conflict torn societies where the firearms were collected.\nThe collection consists of 4 models and a variety of straps to choose from. Each model is molded from the Humanium Metal in a classic, three hand configuration with punched indexes and a contrasting red second hand, date display and crown. All watches come with either an olive green canvas strap made from recycled plastic or a Swedish organically tanned leather strap in black, brown or tan colour.\nAll TRIWA x Humanium Metal watches come in an exclusively made box with an imprinted TRIWA x Humanium Metal logo and a certificate of authenticity.\n **NEW**\nAnyone who upgrades their pledge (by $44 / SEK 389 / \u20ac38 / \u00a334) can get an additional strap at a 35% discount, along with special packaging and a tool to help you switch straps. \nThe Humanium Metal initiative by IM has been endorsed by many international peace advocates.\nWe are a Swedish watch and accessory brand founded in 2007 by four friends Harald, Tobias, Didrik and Ludvig. Our goal is to transform the watch industry through innovation, creativity and design. And, our name TRIWA is an acronym for TRansforming the Industry of WAtches.\nWe are also proud to be the Stockholm city timekeeper with 34 clocks around the city.\nThe Team Behind TRIWA x Humanium Metal\nTobias Ericson - Sales Director & Co-founder\nJohan Imbro - International Sales Manager  \nLudvig Scheja - Creative Director & Co-founder\nTove Thambert - Head of Product Design\nDidrik Wachtmeister - Head of Production & Co-founder\nRebecca Ericson - Social Media Manager\nHarald Wachtmeister - CEO & Co-founder\nEach watch comes with a certificate from IM, Swedish Development Partner, ensuring the material\u2019s authenticity.\n                                                                             ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDelivery time: We\u2019ve been working with the same supplier for almost ten years and we have a really close working collaboration.

(1st stretch goal)\nOrder\u2014RED with black leather strap.\nOrder\u2014WHITE with silver Milanese mesh bracelet.\nOrder\u2014BLACK with black Milanese mesh bracelet.\nOrder watches fit any size wrist.\nThe modern design is an instant classic.\nInspired by the fast pace of NYC and the iconic NYCTA Subway signage.\nHow to read the time\nOrder has no watch hands. Instead, the entire watchface is perforated with an ascending number of dots, which rotate to align with the frame and tell the time in 15 minute intervals. \nThe designers hope to inspire the wearer to not worry so much about the exact time; instead, to focus on the world around them.\nFor everyone\nThe 40mm case is designed for both men and women.  \nOrder runs on a Ronda 512 Swiss Parts Movement.  \nThe watch has a 316L stainless-steel enclosed casing, available in black or silver. \nThe casing is ultra thin\u2014only 8.7mm.\nAll straps are interchangeable with TTT#1\u2014Hidden Time Watch\u2014thanks to the smart docking system.\nUltra thin\u2014only 8.7mm (0.34in).\nCreating Order \nFor the Order watch, we partnered with graphic designers Hamish Smyth and Jesse Reed from their design office of the same name, Order.\nOrder compliments the NYCTA Graphics Standards Manual.\nHamish and Jesse met while working at Pentagram under Michael Bierut, where they launched many well-known design projects, such as the Mastercard rebrand and the Hillary for America presidential logo. While at Pentagram, they started their independent publishing imprint Standards Manual, beginning with the reissue of the NYCTA Graphics Standards Manual (launched here on Kickstarter!).\nThe duo working on the NYCTA Standards Manual.\nOver the next couple years, they also reissued the NASA and EPA Graphics Standards Manuals on Kickstarter\u2014raising over $2 million combined\u2014along with self-publishing four other titles. Following their departure from Pentagram, the duo opened the only bookstore in New York specializing in graphic design. It sits right in front of their design office, Order. \nThe Standards Manual shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\nHamish and Jesse\u2019s work with the NYCTA Graphics Standards Manual inspired their design for the watch, where they focused on representing time in a simple, graphic form. As the face rotates, the perforated dots reveal the hour indicated by an alignment with the frame. The wearer is then able to conceive time as a series of ordered dots that multiply as the day progresses, allowing for a new perception of time.\nCircular icons in the NYC Subway signage.\nEarly order sketches and ideas.\nPreliminary designs for Order.\nDeveloping the watchface.\nThe 12-hour cycle.\nEach watch face displays time in the same way.\n \nSmart docking system\nStraps are available in white or black leather, or silver or black Milanese mesh (you will choose during the survey process).\nOrder comes with an interchangeable strap system that secures straps with a simple pull and click within seconds. You can find out more about our straps from our Hidden Time campaign. \nThe smart docking system allows for easy strap swaps.\nEach TTT edition comes in unique packaging designed especially for the collaboration.\nThe watch also comes with a limited edition collector's plaque.\nPackaging design for Order and Hidden Time.\nAbout The Trio of Time\nThe Series 000, Series K452, Hidden Time, and Order watches from Anicorn.\nThrough The Trio of Time, we have the privilege of collaborating with local designers from incredible cities around the world. Together, we create a unique timepiece and bring our story to Kickstarter, where backers then help us bring the project to life, and choose our next destination.\nThe watch and strap combinations between Hidden Time and Order are endless.\nStunning black and white leather straps for Hidden Time and Order.\nIn 2017, we began in Seoul with Korean designer Jiwoong Jung, who designed the first timepiece of the series, Hidden Time. The campaign was successfully funded within 48 hours from more than 2,000 backers worldwide.\nOrder expands our vision to challenge the perceptions of time.\nThe first edition of the Trio of Time, Hidden Time.\nWe're really excited to be launching this second edition in New York City\u2014the destination our backers chose from the first TTT campaign. If Order is a success, you will help us choose our next stop on this journey!\nWhy Kickstarter? \nKickstarter has allowed us to not only bring our timepieces to life, but also establish our business. Most importantly, it has gifted us with a strong community that supports the work we do. \nWe are deeply humbled by your support, and we can't wait to keep bringing you exciting projects. \nOrder's watchface is just the right size for wrists small and large.\nThank you!\nYour support will help us make Order a reality.\nAfter successful funding, you'll help us decide on our next city to visit.\nAnicorn's The Trio of Time will then collaborate with a new designer, in a new city, to tell a new story.\nJoin us on our journey to complete The Trio of Time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know there are always risks with production, but with our extensive experience we are confident we can get our watches out to you on time.

We're also the luckiest goobers on the planet; we engineer and make world-class photography gear, and we both shape it and share it with the Kickstarter community.\nWe've got new stuff, and you can pre-order it by backing this Kickstarter project. Your new gear will ship worldwide before the end of this year!\nThis is Peak Design's 7th Kickstarter project! Holy Toledo, we can't even believe it ourselves.

Check out the Add-On Menu and increase your pledge amount accordingly\nFor detailed instructions, scroll down to the bottom of this page or see the FAQ.\nJump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ\nWhat are we making?\nAll-New Capture v3\nIt's a metal clip that lets you rigidly carry any camera on your backpack strap, belt, or bag. Take your camera more places, keeping it secure and instantly accessible. Our new design is made of beautiful machined and anodized aluminum, and is smaller, lighter, more durable, and more comfortable than ever before. There's a also new Pro Pad for heavy rigs or all-day carry.\nAll-New Slide + Slide Lite\nThey're the world's most quick-connecting, versatile, stable, and comfortable pro camera straps, one for DSLRs and one for mirrorless. All hardware and materials have been updated for better comfort, smoother operation, increase durability, and gorgeous aesthetics.\nWhy did we make 'em?\nThere are a million straps, harnesses, and holsters out there for carrying cameras, and none of them met our needs. They were bulky, flimsy, frumpy, floppy, and frustrating. We knew we could do better.\nWhy are we updating them now?\nYou (our Kickstarter backers) brought Capture, Slide, and Slide Lite to life several years ago, and those earlier versions are really, really great products. Since then, we've learned tons, and we knew we could make these core products even better. Our backers demand the best, and we feel inclined to give ya'll just that.\nPeak Design has enormous plans for 2018. But before we start our next adventure, we had to give these three products the performance and aesthetic upgrades they deserve. Like momma used to say: dance with the one who brought ya. Now, let's meet these products:\n Capture: why is it so exceptionally dope?\nCapture is, in our humble opinion, the best damn way to carry a camera. It keeps your camera rigidly secure, yet instantly accessible with the click of a button. \n   Jump to:  Add-On Menu  |  Reward Menu  |  FAQ\n    Slide + Slide Lite: What makes 'em so freaking sweet?\nHave you ever used a traditional camera strap? You're probably all too familiar with bouncing cameras, clunky connectors, annoying shoulder pads, tripod incompatibility, and frumpy looks. With Slide and Slide Lite you get none of that, and all of this:\n    Jump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ \n  Now for the nitty gritty.\nWow, you've really made your way down the page. Maybe that's because you're looking for more details. Well, lucky for you we didn't spare a single one.\nJump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ  \nAnd now for the big question...\n    Reward Menu \nAdd-On Menu\nNot sure how to use the Add-On Menu? Read this FAQ.\nNot sure how to use the Add-On Menu? Read this FAQ. For more info on what all these products are, visit peakdesign.com.\nWhy such a short campaign?\nThere's a lot going on at Peak Design right now. We've launched over 20 SKUs in the last few months. It's almost holiday season. And, we'll soon be launching our own flagship retail store in San Francisco. We're keeping this campaign short and sweet so we provide top-notch service to our backers without dropping the other balls we have in the air. We also want to ship all rewards out before the end of the year! \nWhen will it all ship?\nWe expect all rewards to leave our warehouses by mid December. That means that many of you will receive awards before the end of the year and even before the holidays.\nPlease note that we cannot guarantee that rewards will ship by a certain date, and once rewards are in the mail, we have even less control over how long it takes them to reach your doorstep. We'll do everything in our power to get rewards out the door by early December, but we can't make any absolute promises. See the FAQ for details.\n  This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter project since 2011, so we've had ample time to hone our design, manufacturing, shipping, and supply chain management processes. Most importantly, we've gotten pretty darn good at setting our customers' expectations accurately and delivering on our promises.\n\nBut no matter how much we've got our poop in a group (official midwestern terminology) things can still go awry. If they do, we solemnly promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. Sometimes we get the wrong parts or materials in. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products.\n\nShipping Risk: It's the holiday season, the busiest shipping time of the year. Every year, record breaking volumes can cause port congestion, over-stuffed warehouses, and shipping service delays.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have the Wellness Coach Convention and the Artisan Toast Convention scheduled for the same weekend (can you imagine finding a place to brunch, let alone park the Subaru?!). Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Slide Lite", "descp": "The small strap.

Our most versatile watch yet, equally at home in the office or out on the weekends. Its clean, balanced design comes alive through subtle details and uses of color. Everything is designed in-house, and we labored over every detail to get the balance just right. This is a watch that stands out just the right amount - a watch of subtle distinction you can wear for years on end.\nAnd it's not just the design that makes it special. The Kerrison has an automatic movement that registers at 28,800 beats per hour, scratch-resistant sapphire crystals on the front and back, and a 42-hour power reserve. Serious specs that match the thoughtfulness of the design.\nThe Kerrison is available in 4 unique colorways, each in 2 different sizes (42 mm and 38 mm). 8 different versions available in total so that you can find the version that's perfect for you.\n  Martenero combines a respect for the traditions of watchmaking with a unique vision that always looks forward. With a strong respect for the craft, we are driven to make our watches new classics in their own right. Original and contemporary, but always timeless.\n   Martenero has been featured by:\n   We're offering the Kerrison in four distinct colorways, all of which have different dial finishing. No matter what your aesthetic is, we have a version that's perfect for you.\nWHITE & BLUE\nThis version has an enamel gloss finish throughout the dial, and the color contrast between the interior and the outer ring makes it easily stand out from the rest. A watch that people will notice.\nWhite & Blue 42mm\n  White & Blue - 38mm\n  DARK BLUE\nWe opted for a pure matte finish on the dark blue dial. While the dial is a muted color, the bluish green indices and second hand give this model just the right amount of colorful detail.\nDark Blue - 42mm\n  Dark Blue - 38mm\n  WHITE & SILVER\nThe dressiest color colorway of them all. The silver outer ring with sunburst finishing gives this version a dressy touch that makes it perfect for any occasion.\nWhite & Silver - 42mm\n  White & Silver - 38mm\n   BLACK & DARK BLUE\nLook closely, and you'll see that the outer ring contrasts slightly not only in color with the black interior, but also in finishing. Matte interior with enamel gloss outer ring gives this watch a very unique look. The mint numerals and a red second hand give it additional pops of color.\nBlack & Dark Blue - 42mm\n  Black & Dark Blue - 38mm\n    While the design of the Kerrison is very clean, the construction behind it is surprisingly complex. The stainless steel case is custom designed and has complex brushed and polished finishing throughout, and the lugs are twisted and show off these different finishes.\nThe multi-layer dial has applied numerals and indices, and a variety of matte, gloss, and sunburst finishing. This is a very high level of detail that's normally associated with watches at a much higher price point, and it gives the Kerrison a very premium look.\n      The Kerrison is powered by a Miyota 9015 movement that registers at 28,800 beats per hour. This is a very high quality Japanese movement used by premium watch brands, and it's similar in accuracy to much more expensive Swiss movements. It's an automatic movement, so it will wind itself naturally as you wear it. It's hacking, meaning that the second hand stops when you set the time, allowing for more accurate time setting. And with a power reserve of 42 hours, this is watch you can set aside for a while and it will continue to tick away. \n    Our leather straps are made of genuine leather in the US. Matching edge paint on the sides and a hypoallergenic leather lining give the straps a very refined and finished look. The stitching details on the sides show that each strap is made by hand.\n  Black Strap\n  Espresso Strap\n  Marine Strap\n   Chestnut Strap - NEW!\n  Cognac Strap - NEW!\n  Ruby Strap - NEW!\n  Sand Strap - NEW!\n  Oxblood Strap - NEW!\n  All of our watches are designed, assembled, and tested in New York. Assembly and testing takes place in a Brooklyn workshop staffed by a family of watchmakers that has been in the business for two generations. This level of experience ensures that every watch that goes out the door has been subject to the highest level of scrutiny.\n     Mechanics\nMovement: Miyota 9015\nType: Mechanical (Automatic); Hacking\nBeats Per Hour: 28,800\nPower Reserve: 42 Hours\nSpecs\nCrystal: Sapphire (Front and Back)\nCrown: Screw-Down\nWater Resistance: 50 Meters\nCase: 316L Stainless Steel\nStrap: Genuine Leather\nDimensions for 42mm version:\nDiameter: 42 mm\nLug To Lug: 50 mm\nThickness: 10.8 mm\nLug Width: 20 mm\nDimensions for 38mm version:\nDiameter: 38 mm\nLug To Lug: 47 mm\nThickness: 10.8 mm\nLug Width: 20 mm\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any project involving manufacturing, there is the risk of production delays and quality control issues.

We designed the Regatta Chronograph models with the firm belief that style should never get in the way of function but should naturally derive from it.  \n  Rossling & Co. has been crafting watches for over 5 years; with the Regatta Chronograph being our sixth collection. We have developed strong expertise in design, manufacturing and fulfillment and have solid relationships with experienced manufacturing partners. \nEvery component of the Regatta is made from superior materials to ensure flawless operations for years to come. Our watches are designed to be an heirloom, to be passed down to the next generation. \n    Quality leather is not only durable and hard wearing but it develops a beautiful and unique patina as it ages. We use buttery soft Italian calf leather for both the outside and the lining. After you wear it for a few days, the strap will conform to the shape of your wrist for a custom fit.\n5 models in the Regatta collection feature stainless steel mesh straps (also known as shark-proof straps). All versions are 100% waterproof and corrosion resistant. The adjustable clasps makes for a perfect fit.\nThe watch case is made of highly polished stainless steel (316L) for ultimate durability and strength. The caseback is made of the same material. Water resistance is rated at 50m/165ft/5ATM.\nThe Regatta Chronograph collection showcases 3 different dials (black, white and navy), all with a classic, crisp design. The dials feature applied hour markers and a square date window at 3 o\u2019clock.\nChronographs have been used for centuries for maritime navigation. All Regatta models feature a quality quartz chronograph movement with a 4 min per year accuracy.\nIn addition to time and date, the watches feature 3 chronograph functions: elapsed time, accumulated elapsed time and split time, all with a 1 second accuracy.\nThe watches will be numbered and hand-assembled as a limited edition. Only 359 serialized watches will be made for each model. Each watch will be delivered with an international warranty card and a certificate of authenticity.\n    PLAY\n\n  Named after the Hamptons on the eastern tip of Long Island, world-famous summer playground for high society. The watches in this series are inspired by the sailing lifestyle. Light colored dials for the classical man. Subtle, recognized by those in the know, it exudes confidence and charisma.\n    PLAY\n\n  Inspired by the deep-water port of Astoria, founded by J. J. Astor, one of New York\u2019s first business moguls 200 years ago. The Astoria series, with its black dials, is for the man of the world. It conveys an air of mystery and effortless charm that makes it irresistible.\n       PLAY\n\n  The Newport series is named after Rhode Island's famous port, venue for the America's Cup for over 50 years. It is home to many gilded era mansions famous the world over. The blue dials are reminiscent of the ocean. The Newport is for the man that does not fear being noticed. It has undeniable presence and a strong personality.\n  We are delighted to introduce the Rossling & Co. Regatta Chronograph, our latest watch collection. Featuring classic good looks and superior craftsmanship. It will impress with its attention to detail.\n        As a special thank you to our backers, we decided to add extra bonus gifts for all multiple watch rewards:\nIf you reserve 2 Regatta Chronograph watches, we\u2019ll send you a complementary watch roll ($79 value).

All straps are interchangeable so you will be able to swap straps and change the style of your watches in seconds.\n  You will love your new Rossling & Co. Regatta watch.

We believe the most timeless and desirable watches are often the simplest however, it seems many modern watch brands add unnecessary complexity to their designs. For this reason we decided to create BALTIC. We want to focus on a more authentic approach, bringing together the purest watchmaking techniques to create a vintage-inspired timepiece for your wrist.  \nThe results are neo-vintage, 1940\u2019s-style watches with mechanical movements and well-proportioned cases inspired by the traditional Step Case watch (recognisable by its distinctive ridge or step surrounding the hesalite glass).  \n   Wristshot - HMS 001.

Design | The Verge | Gessato | Hypebeast | Highsnobiety | Design Week | DesignTAXI | Designboom | Discovery Channel | Futurism\nIntroducing Hidden Time\nIn 2014 we released our first watch, the concentric disc Series 000, and were funded within 72 hours. In 2016, we launched the space-obsessed Series K452, and were funded within 24 hours.\nNow, we\u2019re back on Kickstarter to introduce our first international project, The Trio of Time, and release our third watch, Hidden Time.\nHidden Time in three editions\n  Black watch + midnight straps\n  Rose gold watch + coffee straps\n   White watch + snow straps\n  The Trio of Time \nThe Trio of Time (TTT) is our very first experimental world tour to explore how international creativity reinterprets the perception of time. \nWe will collaborate with a local designer in three different cities around the world to create a timepiece together, which will be released here on Kickstarter. \nEach watch will feature a unique design that represents the designer\u2019s view on passing time. And with each watch we will share our experience with the Kickstarter community; in fact, backers of each campaign will be able to vote on our next destination.\nHidden Time is the first edition of TTT\nThe first TTT collaboration: Hong Kong to Seoul\nOur TTT journey begins in Seoul, Korea.\nSeoul is a prominent design city in Asia. With a rich history and rapid growth rate, the city features abundant resources for art and design. Many talented designers have launched studios in the city, contributing to both the local industry and the world at large.\nWe met with industrial designer Jiwoong Jung, an artist as fascinated by time as we are. Jung\u2019s product design work has been featured in the 2012 and 2014 Maison & Objet Paris exhibition, among others, and in international design publications.\nBeautiful architecture in Seoul\n  A few of Jiwoong Jung's beautiful products\nTogether, we are releasing Hidden Time\nEarly designs of Hidden Time\n  The watch's beautiful gradient makes time disappear as it passes by\n  Jiwoong Jung working on our first collaboration\n  The rose gold edition offers a slight variation on gradient colors\nHidden Time, the vanishing timepiece\nHidden Time's watch face features a beautiful gradient display under a crystal covering where numbers are firmly printed. As hours pass, the hour gradient disc rotates and \u201chidden time\u201d is revealed.\nThe watch helps you focus on time in the moment, using a modern interpretation of the camouflage effect to hide the passing hours.\n\u201cMy research on how to naturally pass time began with how hiding occurs in nature, which led me to one of the best known examples\u2013\u2013the chameleon\u2019s protective color. Their defense mechanism is a kind of optical illusion, but a simple and effective way to have two things together naturally when superimposed.\u201d \u2013\u2013Jiwoong Jung\nHidden Time in black\n  A beautiful light violet gradient compliments the rose gold edition\n  Time disappearing as hours pass by\n  A striking balance between lines and gradients\n  Coffee straps feature a matching rose gold buckle\n  The powerful watch is thin and lightweight\nWatch time pass in a new way \n  How to read Hidden Time\nFeatures\nTypeface\nCrystal printed watch face over rotating gradient graphic. \nIncludes a unique type, Favorit, in collaboration with Dinamo Typefaces (Johannes Breyer and Fabian Harb).\nFavorit typeface from Dinamo Typefaces\n   For everyone\nThe 39mm case is designed for both men and women. \n316L stainless-steel enclosed casing.\nAvailable in black, rose gold, or silver.\nUltra thin - only 8.7mm (0.34in).\nHidden Time is the perfect size for any wrist\n  The timepiece stands out while complimenting your look\n   Docking system\nInterchangeable strap system that secures straps with a simple pull and click within seconds.\nStraps available in white, coffee, or midnight (you will choose this during the survey process).\nAnicorn's smart docking system allows for easy strap swaps\n      Straps can be interchanged to fit your current outfit or mood\nSwiss accuracy\nDriven by a Swiss Ronda Caliber 515 Quartz Movement, a high grade and reliable jeweled model that allows for smooth spinning with great accuracy.\nThe Swiss Ronda 515 is known as one of the highest quality quartz movement motors, with slim dimensions and long preserved running time.\nThe jeweled model allows for seamless spinning\n  Packaging\nWe know how important delivery is, which is why we\u2019ve created a beautiful new package for this edition of The Trio of Time.

Through solving environmental puzzles and defeating formidable enemies, you will come to explore the millions of possible spell combinations on your path to becoming a real mage! \nThe story is being written by bestselling author Ed Greenwood, creator of the Forgotten Realms fantasy world for Dungeons and Dragons, which served as the basis for games like Baldur\u2019s Gate and Neverwinter Nights, as well as about 170 other fantasy books. \nThis epic adventure has an immersive soundtrack that was recorded live by the Video Game Orchestra and orchestrated by Shota Nakama (Final Fantasy XV, Kingdom Hearts II.5 HD Remaster).\nFeel free to listen to a mash-up of our original OST while reading!\nMages of Mystralia was created around a new and innovative spellcrafting system that allows you to create millions of new ways to fight enemies and solve environmental puzzles!\nTo accomplish this, you are given a spell book with four basic spell types:\nYou can modify these spells by adding and combining different runes to them.\nBehavioral runes: Adds a specific behavior that stacks with other behaviors attached to the spell.\nAugment runes: Modifies the runes to which they are connected, changing the variables of the behavior.\nTrigger runes: Nests additional spells within the current spell when certain trigger conditions are met.\nAs the game progresses, your spell book's contents will grow, opening up an exponentially growing number of options. You can then mix and match runes in order to create mega-spells that are greater than the sum of their parts. For example:\nIf we start with an Actus Orb of Fire...\n By adding the 'Move' behavior rune, we get a fireball.\n And adding a 'Duplicate' behavior rune gives us a triple fireball.\nNow if we attach the 'Duplicate' behavior rune to an Ice Ego spell instead, it gives an ice sculpture that can be used as a decoy to escape enemies.\nThen, we can add the 'Periodic' trigger rune to our ice sculpture to nest another spell. When prompted, we select the triple fireball. This creates an ice turret!\nFinally, attaching the 'Right' augment rune on the turret will make it turn clockwise, shooting in 360 degrees.\nYou can also use 'Rain', 'Impact', 'Teleport' and many more amazing runes to create even crazier spells!\nFour spell types, four elements and eighteen runes can be placed on the spellcrafting grid in order to create tons of incredible combinations! Whenever we put the spellcrafting system in front of new players, someone invariably comes up with a new spell we've never seen before!\nSo you're not constrained by what we, the game's creators, put in the game for you to discover. Instead, you are limited only by your own creativity and imagination.\nAt PAX East, PAX West, PAX South, PAX East again, SXSW and the PlayStation Experience, the reaction to our spell system has been incredible! But don't take our word for it, here is what the media had to say:\nLearn more about our unique spellcrafting system!\nWant to learn more about Mages of Mystralia's unique approach to spellcrafting? We've got you covered! The following video combines parts 1-3 of our spellcrafting tutorial, narrated by none other than Dan Adelman himself.\n\nKeep in mind that this video only gives you a (very) small insight of all the possibilities offered! What spells will YOU create?\nMages of Mystralia has responsive action-adventure controls that have been perfected to feel intuitive and fun.\nBut be careful... The world of Mystralia is a dangerous place. Monsters roam freely in the wilds and you never know what enormous creatures lurk in the shadowy corners of the realm... \nThis polished gameplay, combined with the moving soundtrack and beautifully rendered cel shaded graphics really allowed the team to bring this immersive game to a level of quality that they are extremely proud of.\nIn Mages of Mystralia, you play as Zia, a young woman who discovers that she has been born with an innate sense of magic. Unfortunately, arcane powers have been banned from the kingdom, forcing her to go into exile and learn the ways of magic as she looks to gain some control over her powers and stumbles into a story of epic proportions!\nOn her journey, she meets other exiled mages and discovers runes with magical properties, realizing that she can combine these in different ways to come up with millions of new spells!\nWhen Ed Greenwood set to the task of writing the story of Zia\u2019s adventure, he couldn\u2019t help but flesh out the entire world and its lore. The history of the kingdom of Mystralia was an interesting enough story in its own right, so we worked with acclaimed webcomic creators Brian Clevinger and Carey Pietsch to tell that story in comic book form.\nThe more you know your Mystralia history, the better you\u2019ll be able to identify the subtle references to these events of the past and how they\u2019ve come to shape Zia\u2019s present.\nA wide range of different environments are spread out across the vast world of Mystralia, where villagers, merchants and mages live. You will explore the many different areas of the game in order to find epic treasure, solve mind-bending puzzles and experiment with spells in order to become a true mage!\nMages of Mystralia\u2019s original orchestral score was performed by the Video Game Orchestra and orchestrated by Shota Nakama, one of the masterminds behind the scores of Final Fantasy XV and Kingdom Hearts II.5 HD Remaster.\nFurthermore, the music in the game is dynamic, meaning that depending on the setting and the actions a player makes, the music will adapt itself, adding instruments, accelerating or slowing the pace and basically modulating to fit every in-game situation!\n Some of the projects our team members have worked on previously :\nBorealys Games is made up of experienced developers who\u2019ve spent years working in the AAA industry, which really allowed the team to add that extra layer of polish to the gameplay and visual elements of the game.\nThe game is already a lot of fun and the players' response at events has been heartwarming, but we still have some polish (improved animations, particle effects, and enhanced sound effects - among others) that we think will really take the game to the next level. In addition, we also have a few features up our sleeves as stretch goals that we would love to obtain.\nMore importantly, we want to get feedback on the game from our most ardent supporters, who will get the beta immediately after the campaign is processed!\nAlthough the team has had years of experience in the industry, Mages of Mystralia is the studio's first public appearance and we are coming to Kickstarter to find and grow our core player community.\nWe want fans of magical action-adventure games to join us as we look towards the game's official launch in Q2 of 2017!\nRecently there have been several Kickstarter campaigns that have raised an amount of funding to prove that the concept is viable, but then seek publisher or outside investor support for what they really need. We are taking the opposite approach. We built our proof-of-concept, got investment, and made our game. It is fully playable beginning to end, and many would consider it complete.\nBut as we\u2019ve observed our playtesters and gotten feedback, we\u2019ve generated a ton of ideas that would not take too long to implement but have the power to take this game to the next level. Adding all of those little tweaks and extra polish will only add a couple months to our schedule, so for a relatively modest sum, we can have a huge impact.\nOf course, we already have plans for how we\u2019d like to expand the game post launch with new game modes. If we exceed our goal, we\u2019ll be able to staff up more aggressively and deliver those new features sooner than if we had to wait for the game to launch.\n Adding digital copies to your order is simple:\nSelect your preferred pledge tier from the right of the page.\nAt checkout, add 25$CAD ($19 US) for each extra digital copy you would like.\nAt the end of the campaign, you will receive a Backer Form to confirm your add-ons and preferred platform(s) for your digital keys.\nAdding a physical add-ons to your order is simple:\nSelect your desired pledge tier from the right of the campaign page.\nAt checkout, simply add the value of your desired Add-on(s) and the shipping fee that corresponds to your location.\nAt the end of the campaign, you will receive a Backer Form to confirm your add-ons, address and T-Shirt size(s).\nBox Art shown as reference only and subject to change.\nThe Silver Treasure Chest contains:\nOne Mages of Mystralia pin\nOne Mages of Mystralia t-shirt\nOne soft-cover copy of the 64-page Mages of Mystralia comic book by Brian Clevinger and Carey Pietsch\nOne full-color 11x17 Mages of Mystralia poster\nThe Golden Treasure Chest contains:\nOne Mages of Mystralia pin\nOne exclusive Mages of Mystralia dev team t-shirt\nOne soft-cover copy of the 64-page Mages of Mystralia comic book by Brian Clevinger and Carey Pietsch\nOne limited full-color 11x17 Mages of Mystralia poster, signed by Ed Greenwood\nOne double-vinyl version of Mages of Mystralia's original OST, orchestrated by Shota Nakama and performed by the Video Game Orchestra\nFinal Week Standalone Add-ons!\nDue to popular demand, we've also added the following standalone physical add-ons.

Now we finally want to show you what we have accomplished so far and ask for your support so we can start to work on our dream project full-time! \nWith Kickstarter we hope to raise the funds necessary to finish the development of our game while still staying independent and keeping our creative freedom.\nIf you don't know what Kickstarter is: you can buy the different editions of the game and if we reach our goal, the game will be developed and you will receive everything you ordered at the release of the game!\n\nYou can find out more about it here.\nIn Lost Ember you uncover the secrets of a fallen civilization as a wolf that has to find his place in the world. With the ability to control every animal you see, you have everything you need to find your way to Machu Kila - the city that shall answer all the questions that your mysterious companion raises.\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay in Lost Ember focuses on experiencing the world and the story from fascinating perspectives. Each animal you can play offers new possibilities and opportunities for breathtaking moments. Dive into deep waters, fly at lofty heights, dig underground as a mole or even climb steep cliffs with a mountain goat. We want players to move through our world in their own pace without interrupting their gameflow with combat, too hard puzzles or dying in general.\nTHE COMPANION / STORY\nOn your journey you are guided by a companion that used to be part of the old Inrahsi culture and witnessed the fall of his world. As the last soul of the old civilization he wandered the world for an eternity, searching for someone who could help him on his quest. \nHis ability to show you his memories - echoes of the past - lets you relive what he's been through. These memories can be unveiled at different places throughout the world.\nDuring the game, the wolf and his companion form a deep relationship of friendship and trust. \nSWITCH PERSPECTIVES / GAMEPLAY  \nWhile the main character is the wolf, players can possess any other animal they encounter in our world which gives them great mobility. Some of the animals featured in Lost Ember are parrots, fish, moles, eagles, capybaras, mountain goats, buffalos and more. Additional animals are planned as part of some of our stretch goals.\nThese animals inhabit different areas in our world and while some occur in various scenarios, others may only populate a specific region. On their way to Machu Kila, the wolf and his companion cross through a lot of distinct areas with their own flora and fauna.\nLost Ember will be available for XBox One, PC and Playstation 4. If you buy the game here at kickstarter, you will be able to choose your preferred platform at release. \nWe plan to bring the PC version to Steam and GOG.com. Vote for us in our Greenlight campaign to get Lost Ember to Steam!\nPowered by Unreal Engine 4\nYes, Lost Ember will be playable in VR! We already tested it with HTC Vive and Oculus Rift and let me tell you: it's awesome! We don't consider Lost Ember a \"VR game\", however, and still concentrate on the game itself and not the VR part. But if you have a VR headset at home, you will be able to switch on the VR mode at any given time and dive even deeper into our world. Whether we'll be able to bring Lost Ember to Playstation VR is still unsure.\nCraig Connor (former Music Director at Rockstar North) and Will Morton (former Senior Audio Designer and Dialogue Supervisor at Rockstar North) from Solid Audioworks produce all music and sound for Lost Ember! With a combined experience of over 30 years in the games industry working on games like GTA I-V, Red Dead Redemption, L.A. Noire and more, they bring a ton of expertise and talent to the team. You can find out more about them at their homepage www.solidaudioworks.com.\nWe founded Mooneye Studios about 2 years ago after meeting in a game development masters program in university. We all worked in the games and media industry for several years and together as a team on some smaller projects. Soon we realized that we work extremely well together and since none of us wanted to work in a big company with huge hierarchies and no real creative freedom anymore, we took an a bit risky step and quit our jobs to start our own indie studio.\nAnd that's us! :) From left to right we are:\nPascal M\u00fcller - Programming - @RichAndBit\nTobias Graff - Programming - @tobiasgrf\nFlorens Huhn - Narrative Designer - @FlorensWho\nMatthias Oberprieler- 3D Artist - @MOberprieler\nMaximilian Jasionowski- Art Direction - @M_Jasionowski\nTo make supporting our campaign as rewarding to you as possible, we thought of a bunch of really cool stuff that you can get in our reward tiers! The individual items are illustrated below:\nWell, this one is pretty self-explanatory: you will get the game as soon as it's released for either PC, XBox One or PS4.\nYou will be mentioned in Lost Ember's credits!\nIncludes the digital copy of the game and your name in our credits\nThe soundtrack for Lost Ember featuring music and sound by Craig Conner, Music Director for the entire GTA series and more, and Will Morton, former Dialogue Supervisor & Senior Sound Designer at Rockstar North.\nChoose between 3 extra skins for your main character. Extra skins are only available during the kickstarter! After that, there won't be any option to change skins in the game.\nYou will get the PDF version of our artbook with a lot of concept art from the very early days up until the final product. We will explain some of our design decisions and try to give you an in-depth look behind the scenes of the development.\nWe will design a high-resolution wallpaper exclusively available to kickstarter backers!\nA digital map of the game world with an overview over all the different areas from the wide grasslands to the decayed city of Machu Kila.\nIncludes Digital Game Edition with everything above\nGet our printed hardcover artbook to browse through the pages and always have it at hand in your bookshelf.\nIncludes Digital Plus Edition and the physical artbook\nLooking for that extravagant touch? Get our soundtrack on a 12\u2033 Vinyl-LP! You will also have the option to choose a CD version of the soundtrack, if you don't have a way of playing a vinyl LP.\nYou will get access to the closed beta version of Lost Ember and help us to improve the game!\nRevisit the places you found in-game and follow your path to Machu Kila on a poster of our game world! \nYour chance to actually be in the game! Find your name on a memorial plate for fallen heroes, that is discoverable by all players and even holds a memory to uncover.\nA few very rare legendary animals inhabit our world. While all players can find and possess some of these legendary animals, you will be able to find 3 additional animals that are kickstarter-exclusive!\n6 additional deluxe wolf skins that are only available on kickstarter and let your wolf shine in a new light!\nIncludes Physical Artbook Edition with everything above\nThe Limited Boxed Edition of Lost Ember contains a key for the digital download of the game in an kickstarter-exclusive case with the soundtrack on CD, as well 3 postcards printed on high quality paper.\nA handmade statue of Lost Ember's main character, crafted by the incredibly talented Isabel from www.allerleiunfug.de! This statue will be cast in resin, very high quality and roughly 18cm (7 inches) high.\n  A DIN A2 (that's 420 x 594 mm or 16.5 x 23.4 inches) poster of this amazing artwork.\nAdditionally to the regular poster, you will get one that is signed by the whole team!\nBe one of the firsts to get your hands on Lost Ember with our alpha access key! Make Lost Ember an even better game by giving us your feedback and ideas.\nIncludes Explorer Edition with everything above\nYou will get 2 tickets to Lost Ember's release party at the release of the game! We will celebrate with an amazing party in our hometown Hamburg in Germany. \nYour travel costs are not included in this package.\nThe old Inrahsi emperors were buried in the tombs of Machu Kila. Massive statues still remind their descendants of their grandiosity. You can become one of them! You will be immortalized as one of the statues that we will design with you after your image. The tomb will be discoverable by all players and even be a part of our story.\nYou will get a premium mention in our credits to let the world know that you were a huge help in finishing our game!\nIncludes Physical Gold Edition with everything above\nAnd, because it's not long until Christmas, we thought of a little something to give to all our backers! We will send all of you a PDF with 11 different cards to print at home! So if you think about getting Lost Ember or some of the rewards as a present for your loved ones, you now have the perfect card for it :)\nWe've planned much more for Lost Ember than we have shown you here! In case we exceed our goal of ~$110,000 (100.000\u20ac) we can include even more awesome features. These are the first stretch goals we have planned:\n       Aside from our regular stretch goals, we planned a few social stretch goals through which you can decide which animals will be added to the game on top of the current 9! Participate at www.lostember.com/animals!\n                     Kickstarter helps us secure funding for the development of Lost Ember while retaining full creative control. \"Creative control\", you ask? That means we can continue developing freely and independently without interference from the outside. \nNow I'm gonna be honest here: with our target goal of $110,000 (100,000\u20ac) we still would need some additional funding from publishers or alike. However, the money would get us to a first, full alpha version of the game. It is the minimal budget that brings us to a point where we feel comfortable enough to talk to publishers about deadlines and all the features that we want in our game. \nWe're certain to be able to get that last chunk of money to finish Lost Ember, as we are already talking to several publishers who all are extremely interested in our game. So Lost Ember will be finished with just $110,000 (100,000\u20ac) from Kickstarter. But to get to a point where we could finish the game with full creative freedom we would need about $390,000 (350.000\u20ac). With that we could truly make Lost Ember everything we want it to be. \nNow maybe some of you ask themselves, for what we need that much money. Well, one big reason is that we not only have to pay us and our office space, but also taxes, payment providers, and Kickstarter, who take 5% of the raised money. We made this little pie chart to visualize this for you.\nBecause we are a small independent team without a huge marketing budget, we thought of a little something special to spread the word about Lost Ember and our kickstarter campaign: During our campaign we will visit different youtubers, press and other indie developers in a camper van we got from Tobias' mother and uncle and play a pre-alpha demo of Lost Ember with them! \nWe want to show you how the current game looks and feels to give you a better idea of where it is heading. To make that a little more fun for you, we will make videos of the whole thing and upload them as often as we can to our youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/c/mooneyestudios.\nSo make sure to support the campaign to get notifications whenever we release a new video! :) You will be able to follow us and check out where we are constantly on a GPS map at our website at lostember.com/tour and, if we are anywhere near you, feel free to drop us a line and if possible, maybe we can arrange a meet-up and show you our demo in person!\nSPECIAL THANKS\nWe thank Jacob Pavek for prividing the Song \"Illume\" for our Kickstarter Video.

And of course there is always the possibility that we don't get that. But with as many interested parties as we are already talking to at the moment and a successful kickstarter campaign in our bags, the likelihood of this is pretty low. And even if it happens, we can always go back to doing contract works or side-jobs as we do at the moment. That would of course increase the development time, especially if we get significantly less than $390,000 (350.000\u20ac), but we can definitely promise you that we'll do our best so that Lost Ember will see the light of day as soon and as magnificently as possible!\n\nAnother risk of the development is the release date, of course. We hope to be able to bring Lost Ember to you in early 2018, but there are always unforeseen factors that can delay the release of a game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Special thanks!", "descp": "Thank you for your support!

Now that smartphones and tablets are overtaking handhelds we need good games to play, real games for gamers, on a dedicated gaming platform more than ever. \nWe have chosen AMD\u2019s powerful embedded low-powered SoC with its blazing fast performance and power efficiency on portable devices. Thanks to their latest technological advances, the dream of playing your PC games on the go is becoming a reality.\n  With more than 10,000 games out of the box, and you don't need to purchase them again. Just load and play any game from your Steam\u2122 Library.\nMore than 5 hours of battery life.\nPowerful enough to play almost any game on Steam: Portal 2, DOTA, Left 4 Dead 2, Team Fortress 2, SOMA, Civilization V, Metro: Last Light Redux, Borderlands 2, The Witcher 2, etc.\nHaptic touchpad controls: The evolution of the mouse! And if you are a more old-school gamer, you can configure your own control scheme using the Z-Pads!\nAll your favorite games: AAA, indies, strategy, RTS, action, FPS, adventure, MMO, mods, etc. The Steam\u2122 catalog is bigger and better than ever and great new games are arriving every day. \n Check here for the list of Steam\u2122 games currently supported on Linux: https://steamdb.info/linux\nOr the Windows compatible Steam\u2122 games list here: http://store.steampowered.com/search/?tags=-1&category1=998&os=win\nYou can also play games outside of Steam\u2122. SMACH Z is a handheld PC and you can install any game or program that you want. You can also play web games, MMOs, emulators or anything else that you can do on your PC.\n  CPU: AMD Merlin Falcon RX-421BD (12-15w) SoC at 2.1 GHz \nCores: 4/4 \niGPU: Radeon R7 at 800 MHz \nRAM: 4GB (SMACH Z) || 8GB (SMACH Z PRO) DDR4 2133 MHz \nHD: 64GB (SMACH Z) || 128GB (SMACH Z PRO) \nScreen: 6\u201d FULL HD (1920x1080). Capacitive touch-screen.\nBattery: 5 hours of gaming. \nMicroSD Card Slot. \nUSB 3.0 type C. \nHDMI video output connection. \nWi-Fi connectivity 5.0 Ghz. 4G LTE mobile network connectivity (PRO model only) \nBluetooth connectivity. \nFront-camera 3-megapixels (PRO model only)\n*Some specifications depend on Stretch goals, you can check Stretch goals at the end of the page. \nThese are the technical specifications of the AMD SoC model that will be used in SMACH Z:\n  Explore the SMACH Z's epic final look on this 3D simulation.\n   When pre-ordering SMACH Z you can choose between Windows 10 or Linux.\nWindows 10:  With Windows you have more compatible games and programs. However we won't be able to adapt the OS to our console, so it may not be as easy to use as the Linux based system.\nLinux (SMACH Z OS): We're able to modify and adapt the OS to SMACH Z creating a better interface and experience. We recommend choosing Linux for better performance. More and more games are becoming compatible with Linux with time; now there are about 2,500. \n  The button layout will use two haptic touch pads, a joystick (clickable), 4 action face buttons, 4 trigger buttons and 2 additional action buttons in the rear-back.\nAnyone will be able to create their own custom control schemes. The touch pads are also buttons with different areas of detection, so they can be used in many ways.\nIf you are a \"classic\" gamer, and you prefer more traditional controls... you can use the Z-Pads add-ons. They are adapters to configure the SMACH Z controls by attaching them to either touchpad.\nThis simple yet magic solution will permit you to play with a real D-Pad on your SMACH Z, add a second stick or add more buttons. There are plenty of combinations!\n* Z-Pads are sold separately.\nMore powerful, more storage, front-camera and 4G connection. Recommended if you are going to play demanding games, for youtubers or for MMO players that need to always play online.\nVersions specs comparison:\nSZ PRO: 8GB RAM vs SZ: 4GB RAM. \nSZ PRO: 128GB HD vs SZ: 64 GB HD. \nSZ PRO: Front-camera vs SZ: No camera. \nSZ PRO: 4G connectivity vs SZ: Only WIFI.\n  The following benchmarks have been run on the final hardware of the SMACH Z PRO: Merlin Falcon RX-421BD (12-15w) SoC at 2.1 GHz with Radeon R7 at 800 MHz and 8 RAM, running on Windows 10.\nMetro: Last Light Redux (720p. High settings) ~ 35 FPS\nCompany of Heroes 2 (720p. Medium settings) ~ 25 FPS\nJotun (1080p) ~ 45 FPS\nSkyrim (720p. High setting) ~ 25 FPS\nJust Cause 2 (720p. Medium settings) ~ 35 FPS\nSpiral Knights (1080p) ~ 50 FPS\nOverwatch (720p. Medium) ~ 30 FPS\nTorchlight II (1080p. Very high settings) ~ 35 FPS\nXcom: Enemy Unknown (720p. High settings) ~30 FPS\nCivilization 5 (1080p. High settings) ~ 28 FPS\nTomb Raider: Survival Edition (720p. Medium settings) ~ 40 FPS\nAlien: Isolation (720p. Ultra settings) ~ 35 FPS\n  We hope this gives you an idea of the kind of games and power that you can expect from SMACH Z. We will continue testing with more games and publish new videos on updates. Please don't hesitate to ask for your favorite games.\n* Remember that these benchmarks are being run on the AMD development board with the final hardware, and not directly on the current cased prototype, which have weaker hardware. Check the prototypes section for more information.\n      SMACH Z is a handheld PC with plenty of other possibilities. Some examples: \nStreaming. SMACH Z has been designed to be an stand-alone handheld, but If you are using SZ in your house, you can also stream games from your PC or Playstation 4 via WIFI. This allows you to play games that aren't supported by Steam OS or use the power of your PC to play more demanding games. Just lay down on your couch or bed, with your PC with Steam open, and load any game you want directly from your SMACH Z.\n\nPlay on the TV via HDMI. You can connect SMACH Z to a TV and use it as a home console, that you can bring everywhere. You can even connect another gamepad and play multiplayer! \n\nEmulators. SMACH Z will be the best handheld device for emulation, and Retro Z-Pads will bring your fingers back to the past. NES, SuperNintendo, Megadrive, Playstation 1 and 2, Nintendo64, GameCube or even Wii games will be in your hands. \n\nMultimedia Center. We plan to integrate KODI, an open source software for playing videos, music, podcasts, and other digital media files. \n\nBrowse internet and use programs. SMACH Z is a portable PC, so you can install anything on it.\n\nPortable PC. Connect a keyboard and mouse and plug it to a monitor and you will have a PC that you can bring with you easily.\n\nGamepad: Use SMACH Z as a gamepad controller for your PC too.\n \nTwitch and Skype: With the SMACH Z PRO you can make videos of yourself playing games from the beach or do Skype calls.\n\nOpen Platform: We want to keep SMACH Z an open console. If you prefer to install another OS, you are free to do whatever you want with it. We will give the community all the info and code needed to support another OS or develop additional features. \n\nAttachable extra battery: Add a second battery in the back of SMACH Z for +5 hours of additional gameplay outdoors. \n\nAccelerometer & Gyroscope: A cool way to control racing or airship games.\n\n4K Video: SMACH Z SoC has hardware-accelerated High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) decode of 4K video playback.\n  The prototype will not be the final form of the console. We're updating the look and form of SMACH Z to make it more comfortable to handle with the new 6\" screen size. The main modifications include:\nMade more prominent grips, to make it more comfortable \nReduced the touchpads from 40mm to 35mm. \nMoved the option buttons to the top, to access easier \nAdjusted positions of buttons and other aesthetic changes. \nThe final version will also be much thinner and compact with an estimated weight of approximately 400 grams. \n      SMACH Z Deep Black is the basic edition. But you can also get it in other different colors: Pearl White, Red Fire, Radioactive Green and Indigo. Plus, another 2 new color editions will be decided by the backers in the development forums.\nYou can choose any color combination when you pre-order your SMACH Z in Kickstarter without additional cost. Also, if you change your mind, you can decide the color later.\n  Clickarm is a modular hardware and firmware platform for the development and manufacturing of devices. It offers scalability and enormous economic savings both in research and in product deve\u00adlopment and manufacturing. The Clickarm modular platform is inspired by the spirit of the Com\u00adpatible PC and by the Wintel platform. \nPLAY\n\n\n\nUntil today there was no standardized alternative equivalent in the world of mobile devices based on high integration embedded solutions (mobiles, tablets and other mobile devices). Clickarm means the perfect interaction between hard\u00adware and software (firmware). \nWith Clickarm the performance of your SMACH Z can be improved even after its purchase. You will be able to purchase more modules of RAM, storage or even a new SoC and install it easily yourself or send it to us.\n  SMACH Z will have passive cooling only, using the latest Copper Foam technology in heat sinks. Testing shows that these heat sinks can outperform their comparable competitors by up to 6\u00baC/W, making this new range a major breakthrough in thermal management.\nThe large surface area created by the interconnected pores of the foam coupled with the excellent thermal conductivity of copper allows either for the height of the heat sinks to be reduced or improved thermal performance in the same form factor.\nThe copper foam is coated with a thin, hard layer of high temperature copper oxide that improves the emissivity of the foam to improve its radiant properties and reduce the temperature of the components.\n  By participating in this Kickstarter you will help a PC handheld console become real, but it's also a good opportunity to get your SMACH Z earlier than everyone and at much lower price. Check the rewards at the right column.\n  The goal of 250.000 is the minimum to make SMACH Z real, but to make it more awesome we need all of your support.\n    Know someone who would be as hyped as you are about SMACH Z? Share our campaign with them. We also have cool rewards for all the backers when we reach social goals:\n1,000 shares: Exclusive SMACH Z wallpaper \n5,000 shares: Digital SMACH Z Christmas card.\n10,000 shares: Exclusive SMACH Z sticker for all the backers. \n                                                   SMACH Z will open a new window for game developers to distribute their games. Even if all PC games will be compatible, we're willing to work with developers to help to adapt the games to SMACH Z.\nAdditionally, we'd also love to have games designed specifically for our platform too. Every SMACH Z is a dev kit, and you don't need to purchase a license or SDK. But if you are a developer willing to develop for SMACH Z, take a look to the Developer's Perk: It grants access to full development support, in the technical side as well as on the marketing for gaining visibility on our platform.\nWe really hope SMACH Z will bring more opportunities for Indies, to innovate and experiment with new ideas.\n\"That thing looks great! I hope it works out!\" - Terry Cavanagh - VVVVVV developer\n\"SMACH Z looks interesting and you seem to have found a space in the gaming world to fill.\" - Vishnu Vijayakumar - Tale Worlds - Mount&Blade developer\n\"The concept sounds fantastic!\" - Andy Schatz - Pocketwatch Games - Monaco developer.\n\"Smach Z's portability and power really bring something to the table that other Steam Machines don't. Can't wait to have one of these in my hands\". - Enrique Corts - Super Mega Team - Rise&Shine developer.\n\"This looks awesome!\" - Alex Nichiporchik - TinyBuild Games - Party Hard developer.\n  Case Prototype: The current cased prototype is fully functional and has a similar look, but it's not the final form factor and it doesn't have the final hardware:\nIt uses a Bay Trail SoC with 2GB RAM.\nIt's bulkier and heavier than the final form.\nAll controls and functionality works.\nIt runs Windows. \nIt's using clickARM.\nIt's capable to run old 3D games such as Left4Dead 2 and Half-Life 2 at 15 FPS natively. \nDuring the Gamescom the cased prototype was not 100% complete and had problems with power. Because of that it only ran some small games.\nHere you can see some images of the \"making off\":\n        And here finally working:\nAMD Merlin Falcon development board: This is a different prototype that demonstrates the power of the final hardware. It's not cased, it's a board with the final SoC configured with the same settings, and RAM as the final console will have.\nNote: When testing framerate and performance we're using the AMD board. If in the videos show the cased prototype, it is because we're streaming from the AMD board. \nSince the first announcement of the project a year and a half ago, we've been listening to all your suggestion to improve SMACH Z:\n6\" Screen. We run a poll and the results where very clear. You prefer a larger screen and that's the biggest change from the original design. \n\n1080p screen: 720p is more than enough for a 6\" but with a little bit more we can go full HD. \n64GB storage capacity: 32GB is quite small for a lot of awesome games. This one is a priority for us. \nWindows 10: You want all your Windows only games on your SMACH Z and we will work on supporting it too.\nBattery Life: 5h are great, but extra batteries are your only salvation on a long trip. \nD-Pad: Classic controls has been one of the most demanded features. We are confident that with the Z-Pads everybody will be happy, and we plan to continue listening to your feedback. All the backers will be invited to participate in the development forum to give feedback and vote for SMACH Z features. For example, choosing the colors of certain models.\nLower Kickstarter goal: We've been looking for private investors to reach the goal and be able to go on.\n  We still need to work on the final version of the console, for 6 months, updating the form factor, integrating the final hardware and implementing the final cooling system.\nPrototype production: April-August 2016 \nFinal unit production: September 2016-February 2017\nShipment to backers: April 2017\nLaunch to market: December 2017-Q1 2018\n      Any reward has to add 5\u20ac shipping to United States and European Union or 10\u20ac for the rest of the world. However, if we get to the Stretch Goal shipments will be free for everyone! If you have any doubt related to shipment to your country send us a message at support@smachz.com\n  SMACH Z will fulfill European standards. We stand firmly behind our product. SMACH Z includes a 2 year limited warranty. For more information, please see:\nhttp://smachz.com/warranty\nIf you need help, during or after the campaign has closed, you can reach us at support@smachz.com\n  SMACH Z is being developed by a team of experienced video game industry developers, in association with a hardware manufacturer (ImasD), with more than 10 years of experience.

To order a Tiny Tower please click the button below or above.\n  You can also follow us on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter.\nThanks again!\n    Laptops are extremely versatile but ergonomically they\u2019re not ideal. The longer we spend on them, the more we hunch over them, causing pain in our neck, shoulders and back.\n                                      The Tiny Tower is a beautifully crafted, portable and height adjustable laptop stand that can be used to create a really comfortable setup .. in the caf\u00e9, in the office, at home or wherever you are. \n      We know that everybody is different, so the Tiny Tower adjusts your screen quickly and easily to the right height for you to work comfortably. Simply change the height at the push of a button. Over 3\" (8cm) of adjustment is available through 10 different height settings.\n  The Tiny Tower folds down in under 10 seconds into a compact unit that's easy to carry with you. To create the ultimate mobile workstation, use it with the Tiny Tote \u2014 our high quality zipped nylon pouch that carries your Tiny Tower, keyboard and mouse.\n  Own a Tiny Tower in a colour that matches your laptop .. or your style! As a crowdfunding only special, you can buy a Tiny Tower in Classic Silver, Space Grey, Rose Gold and Gold. We don't intend to make to multiple colours available when the Tiny Tower hits retail shelves .. so make sure you get one now.\n  Aluminum is the main material used in the Tiny Tower because it's both lightweight and strong, making the Tiny Tower very stable. Your laptop will sit on a special non-slip polymer made by 3M to firmly secure your laptop. We've sweated the details like this to make sure you have a lasting product. The Tiny Tower feels great in your hands and even better on your desk.\n    The Tiny Tower has a smaller footprint than your laptop, freeing up more desk space. \n  Your laptop will sit on a special non-slip polymer made by 3M to firmly secure your laptop. The Tiny Tower can be used with the fingers concealed inside the arms or extended for added security. It's your choice.\n  The Tiny Tower will reliably support both Windows and Mac laptops 11\" up to and including 15\u201d. It will even support the Microsoft Surface and Surface Pro.\nThe Tiny Tower is truly versatile.\nIt can be used at a standing desk (please note that it's not designed to replace a standing desk or worksurface).\nThe Tiny Tower supports Microsoft Surface natively and other tablets including the iPad provided they come with a self supporting stand.\nEach Tiny Tower comes with a quality slide on protective sleeve.\n(From L to R) Used at a standing height table. With a Microsoft Surface. Tiny Tower with protective sleeve.\n  The Tiny Tote is a custom designed carry pouch made to hold your Tiny Tower, wireless keyboard and mouse. There's also room for other items like your headphones and spare batteries. The Tiny Tote is constructed with a quality nylon outer shell and has a lined and padded inner divider to ensure that nothing gets damaged. The Tiny Tote is available separately.\n  The Tiny Tower comes in a beautiful bead-blasted and anodised aluminum finish in silver and black. Plastic components are made from quality engineering grade composites that are strong yet light at the same time.\nWhen we designed the Tiny Tower, we wanted to create something that would provide superior ergonomics and also look great in any workspace.\n          A digital copy of our beautiful custom illustrated laptop usage artwork will be sent to every one who pledges.\n        We ship to all EU countries.\nFor EU backers in selected countries, you will not need to pay extra customs, duties or taxes.

Each time we built a new one, we aimed to remove complexity whilst improving functionality and ease of use. We worked hard to ensure The Tiny Tower offers super simple height adjustment. It works just like the extendable handle on checked travel luggage. We also knew that to have it fold into a compact and lightweight unit is important, allowing you to take it with you and protect your posture whenever you work. \nSnapshots from our time spent with suppliers.\nWe've travelled to Asia several times and collaborated with multiple suppliers to finalise our manufacturing plans. We are ready to build the tooling required for large volume manufacturing. We are confident and excited. We believe we're further down the development path than most hardware projects that launch on Kickstarter.\n      The Big Tiny Co is a Sydney-based hardware company led by Matt Cramsie (right) and Anhtai Anhtuan (left). We\u2019re passionate about beautiful design, flexible working, and health and wellbeing. We believe that superior ergonomics and great design should go together.\nMatt has over 15 years experience designing products for Australia\u2019s leading furniture companies. His products have earned him an Australian Design Award and several design awards overseas. The Tiny Tower is his most personal product and he is very proud to launch it here on Kickstarter.\nAnhtai has built a 12 year career in product management and technology. He has a Masters in Management and is responsible for operations, making sure that quality made Tiny Towers roll off the production line and get delivered safely to your doorstep.\nOrigin of the Tiny Tower\nThe original idea of the Tiny Tower came about when Matt suffered a serious disc herniation in his neck combined with numbness down his right arm in 2014. At the time, Matt was constantly hunching over his laptop, which added a significant load on his neck.\nMany existing solutions to raise the height of your laptop don't offer the trifecta of functionality that is needed: height adjustment, portability and an attractive design you'd be proud to use. So being an award-winning industrial designer who is obsessive about ergonomics, Matt decided to create the Tiny Tower to fill that gap.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Tiny Tower has been in development for over 18 months. We built seven fully working prototypes to test the product's functionality and durability.\n\nWe are working to limit the risk of any delays in production and delivery by developing the product to a point where both we and our suppliers are confident we are ready to start production tooling.\n\nWe\u2019ve built partnerships with 2 experienced manufacturers to mitigate as many risks as possible. We know there will be unexpected challenges along the way and we are committed to being transparent and informing you of any potential hurdles as we progress.\n\nWe are confident and excited. We believe we're further down the development path than most hardware projects that launch on Kickstarter.\n\nEXPERIENCE\nAs mentioned, the design, engineering and manufacturing teams have many years of experience working on the design and manufacture of products with very similar materials and assembly techniques.\n\nSHIPPING DATES\nWe are allowing extra time for tooling and manufacturing and are confident we will ship by the scheduled dates. We want to get your Tiny Tower to you as soon as possible! If things take longer than planned, we will always keep you informed.\n\nCHALLENGES\nOur biggest challenge is meeting our funding goal!

Check outAll Rewards & Add-ons. Still confused? Check outHow to Back this Project.\nWe have no traditional investors. Instead, we launch products here on Kickstarter. The funds we raise here not only go towards manufacturing, they also help us design future products.\nAre these camera bags?\nLet's make one thing abundantly clear: these ain't just camera bags. They're Everyday bags\u2014crafted by a team of designers, engineers, and photographers to meet the needs of everyone in the modern world. \nWe may have cut our teeth in the camera accessories world, but these bags are for everyone, just like our (award-winning*) Everyday Messenger that we designed and launched a year ago with the help of renowned adventure photographer Trey Ratcliff. Peak Design Everyday Bags are unrivaled as camera bags and uncompromising as everyday companions.\nEveryday Backpack\nSimply put, a backpack without compromises.

We don't want to toot our own horn too vigorously (nobody likes an overly vigorous tooter) but we've got some great experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality goods and fulfill lots of orders for them. We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.\n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make, when we say we'll make it. But know what? Sometimes 10 shipping containers of product get stuck outside a shipyard for 3 weeks. We pad our schedule for these kind of things, but sometimes not enough.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, god forbid, the Dodgers could come to town. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

You can still subscribe through our store, and stay on top of all Kill Screen news by signing up for our mailing list. \nA NOTE TO OUR US BACKERS: Please check out our FAQs to learn more about our FREE US SHIPPING. \nFive years ago, we published the first issue of Kill Screen thanks to a successful Kickstarter. Independent games had begun to break into the mainstream, with Braid and then Limbo proving that small teams could make financially successful games that at once simplified and expanded the possibilities of gaming. We wanted to expose the innovation we saw making its way into the mainstream and treat games like any other art, colliding them with film and music and design. That is why you\u2019ll see that our new magazine is changing visually, with a sleeker design, cleaner image, and a more personable, grown up feel.\nSo on just six thousand dollars that we raised on Kickstarter, we produced 9 issues of our magazine, helped launch the careers of many fantastic game writers, published a daily website that has consistently pushed the boundaries of game criticism, and put on three conferences that have thrown the relationship between games and culture into stark relief.\nWe are now back on Kickstarter to reinvent our current magazine: to be much bigger, bolder, and better looking than ever before.\nKill Screen is back on Kickstarter because we owe so much to the success of our first project. Without our initial successful Kickstarter and this amazing community, we would not have been able to publish our magazine or build our company into what it is today. We remain an independent publication, and we want to stay that way. So it\u2019s up to this Kickstarter and our lovely supporters to make this revamp a reality\u2013\u2013 if the project isn\u2019t funded, we won\u2019t be able to make this happen.\nThere are a lot of exciting new changes to our magazine. Firstly, it's going to be physically larger and will contain full-color portraits of the creators we're featuring. We are working once again with Shapco for our printing needs. They are a family-owned company in Minnesota that has been in business for almost forty years.\nWe\u2019re going to showcase the independent creators that are important to us through reported features, visual essays, and rigorously researched, long-form criticism. We\u2019ll dig deep into the most important new games by sending writers and photographers to find out how they came to be: not through Skype interviews but through a week of embedded reporting.\nWe'll continue to seek out the most thoughtful, curious writers in videogames and give them space to thoroughly grapple with games past and present. \nOur magazine will feature writers from top publications, including the Wall Street Journal, the New Yorker, GQ, the LA Times, and many, many more.\nAn issue of Kill Screen will be an essential collection of videogame writing, with a laser focus on what\u2019s important and new alongside Saturday-afternoon longreads. People familiar with the site will see their favorite writers off the leash, exploring the things they love with unprecedented resources.\nThose who don\u2019t have time for videogame writing in their day-to-day will have a sumptuously designed, one-stop-shop to know what matters. We believe games are for everyone. We want to show you why.\nFor an idea of who we'll be covering, here's who has already committed to be featured in this project, among others:\n-Ben Esposito, Donut County\n-Teddy Diefenbach, Hyper Light Drifter\n-Nina Freeman, Cibele\n-David OReilly, Mountain\n-Jenny Jiao Hsia, Beglitched\n-Winnie Song, Badblood\n-Jane Ng, Firewatch\n-Marc Ten Bosch, Miegakure\n-Fullbright, Tacoma\n-Erica Gorochow, Specimen\n-Brendon Chung, Quadrilateral Cowboy\nThe change we saw coming in 2010 has taken root. Videogames have grown up! The promise of \u201cindie games\u201d now thrives in little online spaces and onstage at E3; game jams pop up, and blast out dozens of games worth playing and talking about. Perhaps most importantly, this is the first time in history when gaming\u2019s old monoculture has started breaking down. Now you can have taste in games, the same way you might in film or music. You don\u2019t have to like Call of Duty on one end of the spectrum or Gone Home, on the other; there are a million shades of gray\u2014and blue, and purple, and taupe, and so on\u2014to choose from. All of which creates a new challenge for Kill Screen: to inspire a life well-played. Our magazine launched as \u201csmart\u201d videogame writing, but in 2015 it needs to be more than smart: it needs to be deeper, better reported, and curatorial to cover an exploding culture.\nTop, left to right:\nRachel Catlett - Project Associate\nJamin Warren - Founder and CEO\nJudy Romano - Business Development Associate\nMiddle, left to right:\nDavid McDowell - Photographer\nJustin Kielbasa - Designer\nBottom, left to right:\nJane Mai - Business Assistant\nZach Budgor - Editor \nClayton Purdom - Editorial Director\nPledge $5 or More: You will receive a digital issue of our new magazine and your name forever on a weird digital monument to our backers, designed by Camp Cult's Cale Bradbury.  \nPledge $25 or More: You will receive a physical copy of our new magazine, plus a digital copy of Boss Fight Books' Super Mario Bros. 2 by Kill Screen's own Jon Irwin, a digital issue of our new magazine, and your name forever on a weird digital monument to our backers. \n Pledge $30: DIGITAL LOVE TIER.

We're boosting our schedule to a rigidly-kept quarterly event, we're including beautiful color photography rather than solely illustrations, and we're going to be sending out writers for international embedded reporting. And of course, we want to be able to pay the writers and artists that work with us what they deserve rather than trying to make do on a shoestring budget.\nOur funding goal is much higher this time around than it was during our first campaign. Kickstarter was a very different place in 2009, and you couldn't ask for large funding goals to support the quality of publication you wanted as easily as you can now. We wanted to make a quarterly publication, but it proved impossible to do so on just $6,000. So this time we're asking for upgraded funding to support an upgraded publication.\nWe have an extremely thorough model to calculate costs to make this magazine, and we've spent a great amount of time carefully determining how much money we need to do the magazine right for a full year. We don't want to undersell it and risk not being able to fulfill.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy upgrading our magazine to a quarterly publication we recognize that we're giving ourselves a lot more work. Luckily we have an awesome full-time staff, as well as a group of dedicated writers that are ready to handle the larger work load. Our full-time team is twice as big as it was during our run of the magazine to this point. Of course we initially wanted our publication to be quarterly, but we were overconfident when we believed $6,000 was enough to make that dream a reality. We have learned a lot over the last eight issues of our magazine and have come out with a wealth of knowledge about making it a reality, including a higher funding goal to enable our team. \n\nBy including photography and embedded reporting, we are certainly opening ourselves up to a challenge. However for the first time in Kill Screen's history, we are lucky enough to have a staff photographer rather than relying on many different freelancers. This will create creative consistency in the visuals in the magazine as well as meaning that we have a staff member dedicated to this portion of the magazine. We also have an international team of writers that enables embedded reporting beyond our previous issues. The longer release calendar of our quarterly schedule will also enable us to plan content well in advance. \n\nFinally, making a magazine is not easy. Luckily, we've already done this eight times (nine including issue zero). We are using the same printer we've used many times over and have a great working relationship with them. For the first time in our history we have a new, dedicated full-time staff ready to make this magazine happen and deliver it on schedule.

To make the keyboard more stable when opened, it needs to be locked on a plane of 180 degrees upon opening. Just for the locking mechanism of the keyboard alone, we had repeatedly tested over 20 plans. After half a year\u2019s effort, we finally chose a structure, which is a subversive design for all folding keyboards. In addition, in order to increase the production capacity and address the problem of deformation of hardware housing, we made a new design for the production process of the frame of the keyboard, and made significant improvements to the die-casting molds, reducing the housing casting molds to 5 sets from 24 sets and reducing the manufacturing procedures by 20%.\nWe would like to thank all our supporters for your suggestions and support!

It's more than a camera bag, it's your day-to-day essential carry workhorse, and it does things other camera bags can't.\nIt comes in Charcoal...\n...and in Heritage Tan...\n ...and it will make your everyday carry experience wonderful, no matter what you're doing.\n                                                                                             When something is \"totally dialed,\" that means that every last bit of it does its job perfectly and fits together flawlessly. This bag is totally, indubitably, unequivocally dialed. See why:\nTo reiterate:\nIt adapts to your gear and lifestyle.\nWhat do all camera bags have in common? Foam cubes. Big ones. Bulky ones. Square ones. What do all cameras and lenses have in common? They're not square.\nFlexFold\u2122 dividers: instantly customize them to organize your gear and maximize your space for everything else. Fold 'em over and stack gear on top. Note that the final divider color is the same as the rest of the inner bag.\nLike we said before, The Everyday Messenger is not just a camera bag, it's an everyday bag. And since no two days are quite the same, we designed a shell that expands greatly to accommodate the perpetual \u201cone last thing,\u201d and also lets the bag maintain its shapely figure when your load is light. \nFlexFold\u2122 dividers allow the bag to expand and contract depending on load. Typical camera bag dividers are about 3x the thickness and designed to have a fixed width. Note: final divider color will be the same as the rest of the bag interior.\nThe semi-rigid shell expands from a capacity of 13.5L to 20.5L without the need for slack material. \"I like a floppy messenger bag,\" said no one, ever.\nLastly, it adapts to your activity too. No more switching bags when you travel or hop on your bike\u2014one bag, with straps that let you wear it in a multitude of ways.\nThe main strap is made of internally-padded seatbelt webbing, and it adjusts for messenger or shoulder carry style. Removable stabilizer strap can also be worn as a waist strap to take weight off your shoulder.\nCarrying a tripod? We've got you covered. Slip your tripod leg through the sleeve in the main flap, fold the flap over, and place the silicone band (included) around your tripod legs. Carry a tripod will full access to the rest of your bag.\nThe versatile straps can be configured for easy, secure luggage carry. Use the shoulder strap to sling your bag around large rollers, or use the stabilizer strap as a standard luggage band.\nIt gives you instant access to everything you need.\nYour hands are always full. Full of cameras, toddlers, beer...sometimes all three. Hence we invented a new way to open and close a bag:\nThe patent-pending MagLatch\u2122 is a digital-safe magnetic latch that opens/closes securely, blindly and one-handedly. It can latch onto 4 different catchpoints, depending on your carry load. There's no other piece of hardware quite like it.\nStill, you don't always have time to open a flap. Unlike traditional messenger bags, The Everyday Bag has quick-zip access to the main compartment, as well as an outer pocket layout designed around the workflow of photographers, commuters and travelers.\nFront access panel has 8 stretchy mesh pockets for bits-n-bobs. Water resistant top zip gives instant access to main compartment. See images at the top of the page for final interior pocket colors.\nWhat's faster than getting your camera from inside your bag? Getting it from outside of your bag. Peak Design started as a company that made Capture\u00ae, a clip that lets you carry your camera on the outside of your bag. Naturally, we had to incorporate the perfect Capture attachment point:\nYou'll find 2 diagonal straps on the side walls, designed for attaching the Capture Camera Clip. Keep your camera secure/accessible and free up carry space. Capture is included in our $375 Reward, and also available in our Add-On Menu below.\nA dedicated, protected 13-15 inch laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve and document pocket makes this truly an everyday bag, even if you're not carrying any photo gear.\nThere's a clever place for every bit and bob imaginable, like the pen sleeve in the laptop compartment and the Anchor link key/ID tether in the side pocket.\nIt protects your stuff like a boss.\nOur favorite messengers are roomy and built to repel water, mud and unwanted flotsam. Our favorite camera bags are padded and protective cradles for our digi-babies. The Everyday Bag had to be both.\nThe shell, made of lightweight Kodra\u00ae synthetic canvas, is waxed and DWR-coated to repel water. It also contains high-density tessellating foam pads to protect from bumps and bruises.\nThe super soft poly-spun twill interior is soft on your photo gear, but will hold up to years of stuffing and re-stuffing your bag with you-name-it.\nBar-tacked stress points, reinforced with ultra-tough Hypalon. Beautifully anodized aluminum hardware.\nWe built The Everyday Bag to last a lifetime. In fact, we guarantee it will.\nIt looks totally dialed, with zero slop.\nDangling strap ends, cheap internal fabrics, cookie-cutter plastic hardware...these are what we call \"slop.\" Many bags out there have slop because it's cheap and it's easy. We designed this bag with a strict no-slop policy, and the result is a product that looks, feels and functions like a premium product should. \nNo corners were cut in the building of this bag.\nThe form of The Everyday Messenger took a cue from the past, incorporating timeless elements and shapes from classic messengers and camera bags. Then we fused that with modern materials, custom hardware and Peak Design\u2019s less-is-more aesthetic.\nYou use the inside of a bag just as much as you do the outside. So, we designed an inside that you'll want to look at again and again.\nClassic lines and textures, but with refined hardware and technical materials.\nWe\u2019ve created 2 color schemes - Charcoal with red accents and Heritage Tan with blue accents (shown above). Pledge now, choose your color when the campaign ends.\n                                                      Behind every good bag is a wing-bag. The Field Pouch\u2122 is a manager of cords, hard drives, toiletries, socks, Pogs slammers and all those other pesky doo-dads that can\u2019t seem to get along with the big boys.\nHello. Is it keys you're looking for?\nKeys, hard drives, laptop chargers, pens, and even small lenses can fit inside the stretchy mesh pockets that line its interior.\nThe Field Pouch fits in both the main compartment and the front panel of The Everyday Messenger. It\u2019s made from the same materials, contains 5 stretchy mesh pockets, and holds a lot or a little without losing its shape. It also comes in Charcoal or Heritage Tan.\nStowe The Field Pouch in the main and front compartments of The Everyday Messenger.\nLike its big bro, The Field Pouch expands and contracts depending on what's in it. It saves you space and saves itself from looking embarrassingly floppy and misshapen. Note that this animation depicts an older prototype.\nYou can even attach Peak Design straps to the Pouch (via Hypalon loops on either side) and attach Capture on the front Hypalon strap. It becomes the perfect excursion bag for you and a mirrorless camera.\nAttach any Peak Design camera strap to The Field Pouch and have yourself the perfect excursion bag, which is a type of bag that is not at all like a man-purse.\nThe Field Pouch and The Everyday Messenger. 2-gether 4-ever.\nTo pre-order The Everyday Messenger, click the button below and pick a reward that contains The Everyday Bag. Simple as that. If you want more stuff that isn't in your reward, then follow the instructions in our Add-On Menu (scroll 2 sections down). Once you have pledged, sit back and relax. We'll collect your shipping/fulfillment info when this project is complete, in late September.\nOnce you pledge, you're in for a fun ride. Throughout our campaign we'll be updating backers with footage of our latest production units and having live Q&A hangouts with Trey Ratcliff and the PD team.\nNot sure how the Add-On Menu works? Scroll down below.\nWant to add additional items to your reward like another Everyday Messenger or Field Pouch? Perhaps you want to add on a Capture clip, so you can carry your camera on the outside of your bag. Either way, adding stuff to your reward is easy:\n1. Choose a reward level.\nEverybody must choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose 2 reward levels. Just one. You will get all items in that reward\u2014you cannot swap things that you don't want for things that you do want. For example, you cannot order the PD Dream Pack and switch out CapturePRO for an extra Slide. See the FAQ for why we can't do this.\n2. If you want to add something, check out the Add-On Menu.\nIf (and only if) you want something additional to your reward, check out the Add-On Menu above. If it's in the Add-On Menu you can add it to your reward by increasing your pledge by the amount specified in the menu. You can only add things to your reward that are in the Add-On Menu.\nIf you want to add a Peak Design product that is not in the Add-On menu, don't worry. We will give you a chance after the campaign is over to add additional products to your shipment for a special discount. See the FAQ for further explanation.\n3. Relax, you're done for now.\nAll details like shipping information, color preference and add-on specifics, will be collected via survey after this campaign has ended in late September.\nCaptureLENS and Lens Kit are 2 new products that let you change and carry lenses easier than ever before. Watch this video to see it in action:\nWe launched CaptureLENS halfway through this Kickstarter campaign, and right now it is only available to Kickstarter backers through our Add-On Menu. Instructions on using the Add-On Menu are above, and below, and in the FAQ. How's that for a helping hand?\nIn our opinion, CaptureLENS + The Everyday Messenger is the most convenient, rapid-fire lens changing solution in the world.\nRight: Lens Kit has loops for attaching Peak Design Anchors, letting you sling a spare lens across your body. Left: CaptureLENS works on any belt or strap.\nOther specs you should know about CaptureLENS:\nIt works with Canon (EF mount), Nikon (F mount) and Sony (E and FE mount) lenses. You'll specify which mount you need in our post-Kickstarter survey.\nCaptureLENS ($80 add-on, $90 MSRP) includes a standard Capture clip (nylon backplate) plus a Lens Kit adapter plate. It does not include a plate for camera bodies.\nLens Kit ($40 add-on, $50 MSRP) includes just the adapter plate. It's for people who already own (or plan to own) a Capture clip. Lens Kit is compatible with all versions of Capture.\nHow to pre-order CaptureLENS and Lens Kit:\n1. Become a backer of this project. Click here to do that.

After this project is complete (late September) we'll send you a survey where you can specify which model you'd like.\nSlideLITE is a new camera strap designed specifically for mirrorless and small DSLR cameras.\nFor those familiar with our other camera straps (all of which were launched here on Kickstarter) SlideLITE sits smack-dab in the middle of our lineup. Not too bulky, not too skinny, it's perfect for your ultralight mirrorless companion.\nSlideLITE contains the same adjustment hardware that Slide does. But SlideLITE is a skinnier 3.7cm (1.25\") and does not have internal padding.\nWear SlideLITE as a sling, neck strap or shoulder strap. It connects to your camera with our patent-pending Anchor link quick-connect system. And, it looks damn good.\nHow to pre-order SlideLITE:\n1. Become a backer of this project. Click here to do that.

Want SlideLITE sooner? Pre-order it from one of our retail partners. There's a list of them in this update.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Peak Design's 5th Kickstarter project. We don't want to toot our own horn too vigorously (nobody likes an overly vigorous tooter) but we've got some great experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality goods and fulfill lots of orders for them. We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues, and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.\n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nForecasting Risk \nIf all goes well during our funding campaign, we'll finish up with a giant heap of preorders for our new products. Of course we're trying our hardest to predict our future demand and plan accordingly, but it's far from an exact science. While this ain't our first Kickstarter rodeo, our forecasting capabilities aren't the same as what you might expect from a big company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk \nAs Peak Design continues to mature we're getting better and better at managing our supply chain. For example, two years ago we set up two fully-operating parallel supply chains to shore up our ability to make quality products, at high volumes, on time. We're totally stoked on how far we've come. But it's safe to say that there is still some risk here. If a container shipment is delayed for 2 weeks in customs or a batch of new parts doesn't pass QA testing, our fulfillment schedule\u2014even if padded\u2014can start to slip.\n\nActs of God \nWe're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, God forbid, the Dodgers could come to town.

Sense is the first system that combines the insight of your sleep patterns with the data of the environment in your bedroom, including noise, light, temperature, humidity and particles in the air.\nWith Sense's Smart Alarm, it can even wake you up in the morning at the right point in your sleep cycle, to avoid that groggy feeling we all hate so much. All easily available via our iPhone and Android applications.\nWhat People Are Saying\n\u201cThis sleek sleep tracker analyzes your bedroom, and your sleep patterns\u201d\n\u201cSense, Crushes Kickstarter With $120K In A Few Hours\u201d\n\u201cSense tracks your sleep without intruding on it.\u201d\n\u201cIt could be the answer to your sleeping problems.\u201d\n\u201cThe idea is that being aware of not only the quality of sleep, but also the room's conditions, can empower users to improve how they sleep.\u201d\n\"We spend a huge portion of our lives in bed \u2014 so maximizing that experience can have huge benefits.\"\n\u201cWith Sense, Hello wants you to look beyond how you\u2019re sleeping to why you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d\n\nSense\nTechnology has enriched our lives in many ways. But it has its downside, and sleep is one of its biggest victims.\nSense uses technology so we can take back our sleep. Without imposing itself. Without intrusion.\nEverything with Sense is designed to fade away and work in the background, letting you just sleep.\nWhen you wake up, see your previous night's sleep and everything that happened.\nSense system includes:\nSense, a beautiful device that sits on your nightstand monitoring the conditions in your bedroom and disturbances at night\nSleep Pill, a small but incredibly sensitive sleep tracking sensor that clips invisibly to your pillow\nMobile applications that bring it all together\nThe app tells you how well you slept, or didn't, by giving you a unique Sleep Score each night.\nYou can begin to correlate interruptions in your sleep to external conditions and disturbances. You can play back key sound disturbances via the app to say \u201cAh, the garbage truck broke my sleep cycle at 3am. I didn\u2019t even realize that.\u201d\nIf Sense sees a problem with your environment, it lets you know.\nSense even contains a speaker, so it can play white noise, or similar sounds such as pink noise or calming rain, if that helps you sleep better. The speaker is also used to play Sense's Smart Alarm, which wakes you up at the right point in your sleep cycle.\nSleep Pill\nSleep Pill fits snuggly to your pillow\nSense comes with a little device called Sleep Pill. It simply attaches to your pillow and invisibly tracks your sleep at night. You don't need to put on any uncomfortable wearables or remember to charge something or press a button. Sense knows when you're falling asleep, soundly asleep, thrashing about, or waking up. Everything.\nHidden inside such a tiny package is a 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope, capable of picking up the tiniest of your movements throughout the night. This is all then sent wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy and ANT to Sense seamlessly in the background. No worrying about pairing or syncing. It just happens.\nThere is nothing to remember to charge or plug in; Sleep Pill lasts a whole year. And if it gets tossed in the washing machine, no worries. We've designed it to be completely water-proof and next to indestructible.\nHave a partner? No problem. Just clip on a second Sleep Pill and Sense is able to detect each of your sleep pattern's separately, as well as see if your partners snoring or movement is disrupting your sleep.\nSleep Score\nSense's Sleep Score takes into account all of the sensor data and variables that it monitors to generate a score out of 100 for your previous night. It looks at both the environment of your bedroom, such as disturbances during the night or whether your room was too bright for an ideal night\u2019s rest, as well as how you actually slept yourself.\nA pitch black room might boost your score by +10, but a car alarm going off repeatedly might lower it -20. Sense will give you a breakdown of your score, begin to notice problem patterns and help you to fix whatever is preventing you from reaching 100 each night.\nSmart Alarm\nWe all have a natural sleep cycle, but a normal alarm will wake you up regardless of when's best for you. Sense's Smart Alarm knows the right time to wake you up, so you will feel alert and refreshed.\nHere's how that works. Your Sleep Pill tells Sense when you begin to naturally stir, a signal that you're ready to wake up. If you've set your alarm for close to that time, the Smart Alarm will go off, waking you up at the perfect time for your sleep rhythm.\nIf you want to be up by 9:30, but you're already half awake at 9:15, then your alarm should go off then, not wait for you to fall deeper into sleep and force you awake later feeling terrible.\nHidden at the top of Sense is a powerful speaker that Sense uses to play the alarm sounds that'll wake you up.\nSensors\nSense contains sophisticated sensors that are able to sense noise - in your bedroom and beyond; pick up on light, whether continuous or flashing; monitor temperature and humidity conditions; and identify particulates such as dust and pollen.\nAmbient Light Sensor monitors the levels of light in your room. A good night's sleep is helped dramatically by having a completely dark bedroom without sudden interruptions such as a phone or car headlights.\nTemperature and Humidity Sensors are able to detect the temperature and humidity throughout the day in your bedroom, helping Sense learn how you like your bedroom and under which conditions you sleep best.\nParticulate Sensor can spot the tiniest of things floating around in the air, so tiny you can't even see most of them. But they are there, and they are potential sleep interruptors for many; more than 50 million people suffer from nasal allergies. If the pollen count is high in your neighborhood and Sense detects a rising level of microscopic particles in your bedroom, you should know.\nWireless, Audio and More\nWi-Fi allows Sense to always be connected to your home network via a powerful Wi-Fi chip inside, letting you know what is going on in your bedroom, even when you're not home.\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) lets you control Sense when you're near it. Sense uses BLE for things like setting alarms and changing settings quickly.\nANT is a low energy communication protocol that lets Sleep Pill and Sense communicate with one another seamlessly.\nProximity Sensor to see when you wave your hand over Sense to check the current conditions or stop your alarm in the morning.\nSensitive Microphone to pick up on snoring, sleep talking and noise disturbances in the night.\nSpeaker for playing sounds to help you sleep and wake you up.\nRGB LEDs to give Sense its iconic glow.\nDesign\nToo often technology simply looks like just another piece of technology. With Sense, we wanted to design something that would fit into any room. The design itself functions to help all of the intelligent sensors inside work perfectly, while remaining out-of-sight.\nSense is available in two beautiful colors, cotton and charcoal.\nBehind the soft-touch polycarbonate shell is an acoustic mesh that wraps around the whole device. This mesh hides and protects everything inside, all while having the sensors function perfectly.\nWhat's Inside?\nSense isn't just a pretty face. It's built to last. Its serious mechanical structure protects four printed circuit boards that are stacked on-top of one another. For us to fit so much into such a small space, we really had to get creative with things. The resulting design is something we think is as beautiful inside, as is out.\nWho is Sense For?\nSurvey after survey reports that most of us\u2014as much as two-thirds\u2014aren't getting enough sleep. Sense is for them. But Sense is also for more than them. Because millions think they're getting better sleep than they really are.\nSleep improves our memory and immune systems; it helps in weight management and dealing with stress; it makes us more creative and productive. We've built Sense for anyone one who cares about those things, which is pretty much everyone.\nHow We Got Here\nFor the past few months, we've been heads down designing, prototyping, coding, testing, breaking and building.\nWhere We Are Now\nWe recently successfully completed our first EVT build (engineering validation testing). This involved manufacturing, assembling and testing the functionality of all the sensors involved in Sense and Sleep Pill.\nWe've started doing in-home testing with our team and will be gradually increasing the size of our testing in the coming weeks and months.\nNext Steps\nWe are now starting our second EVT build to incorporate a number of changes and improvements we discovered while testing. After this, we will freeze changes in the electronics and move into DVT (design verification testing) where we will test everything from the mechanicals, to the electrical, to firmware and make sure everything works as designed.\nThe final stage is doing a PVT (production verification testing) run which is designed to assure the required quality and robustness.\nWe've selected experienced manufacturing partners that have built and shipped billions of devices. We're willing to bet you own a few of them.\nTimeline\nAugust - Kick off DVT\nSeptember - Ship initial rewards (t-shirts and posters) to Kickstarter backers\nOctober - Kick off PVT\nNovember - Ship initial units to Kickstarter backers\nBuilding with Sense\nYou'll always have access to your data via our API. Take it, play with it, graph it, do whatever you want with it. It's yours. That's important to us.\nWe enjoy tinkering with and building on-top of other products we like. Sense will let you have that experience.\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on what you might want to build with Sense, and how you could directly interact with the hardware, and the data it collects.\nOur Team\nWe're a team of designers, engineers, and operations staff based in San Francisco, California. Collectively, we have built products and services that millions of people around the world use and love.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWhen building a product that is focused on something so personal as sleep, we didn't want to build it hidden away somewhere in silence. Over the coming months, we want to learn from you what your patterns are, what affects your sleep, what you care about and make sure we build the best possible product.\nWe're also having a lot of fun working on Sense and want share everything we're learning along the way with you.\nRewards\nThat's all Folks.\nFollow Hello on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and our website.\nAnd lastly, thank you; we can't wait for you to use what we're building.\nIf you missed our Kickstarter, you can now pre-order Sense.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're making something physical; atoms are harder to manipulate than bits and harder to fix when they break; so we've worked (and continue to work) very hard to make sure we don't mess things up.\n\nHello is a team of engineers and designers who have individually worked on products used by millions of people, from iPhones to Fitbits, we understand what goes into making hardware and we know how to do it.\n\nOur manufacturing partners most certainly will have made products that are in your pockets, on your desk, or plugged into your wall somewhere.

JUMP creates a new category of product \u2013 one that fulfills these previously ignored aspects of the user experience.\nWe have therefore developed a new solution: something that is thoughtful, intelligent and efficient by design.\nJUMP is not just a charging cable; it also provides your smartphone with a substantial power boost wherever you are, without ever having to remember to charge it. Perfect for work, play, and travel.\nJUMP Delivers\nWe managed to pack 800mAh into this compact form factor that weighs less than two AA batteries. This provides over 3 hours additional talk-time: more than enough time to get you out of (or into) trouble.\nJUMP charges itself every time you charge your smartphone\nJUMP is your everyday charging cable that syncs and charges your smartphone. The 19 inch (48 cm) cable supports high-speed data transfer.\nUnlike power banks, JUMP charges automatically every time you charge your phone, giving you complete reassurance that whatever situation you are in, there\u2019s always power in your pocket.\nWe developed intelligent technology called AutoCharge\u2122 \nAutoCharge\u2122 is an efficient circuit prioritization system that detects when the battery inside your smartphone is full, and automatically redirects the power to charge the batteries inside JUMP.\nIt's always ready and charged\nJump provides a significant power boost to your smartphone when you need it most.\nIt's compact and lightweight\nJUMP fits easily in your coin pocket. (50mm x 50mm x 13.6mm)\nWith it\u2019s compact size, JUMP is small enough to hold behind your phone as you call.\n JUMP is case-friendly\nIt even fits with the official iPhone case\nWe designed JUMP to be your everyday charging solution. One of the priorities was to ensure it is small and compact, no bigger than your average rolled up cable, allowing you to take it with you wherever you go.  \nThe cable management system enables you to carry JUMP easily and neatly; no more messy cables thrown into your pocket or bag.\nPrecision-engineered channels securely hold the cable, allowing you to pull out the desired length during charging, as well as fastening whilst on the go.\nIntelligent design that is robust, compact and portable\nQuality of the components are extremely important to us \u2013 we wanted to create a device that cannot only withstand the stresses of everyday use, but is also something that looks and feels really good.\nWe custom made cables from a hard-wearing resistant nylon, resulting in cables that are durable and long lasting. We wanted to use materials for the casing that would ensure strength and longevity; therefore, we selected a thermoplastic blend of PC and ABS.\nThis is what we have been waiting for.\nFeatures Overview\nThe Design Story\nToday's Working Prototype\nElectrical evaluation of the first working prototypes have proven AutoCharge\u2122 and we are confident that JUMP will provide substantial additional charge to an iPhone 5s as we move forward towards production.\nWhy Kickstarter \nWe wanted to share JUMP, our latest product, through Kickstarter first. We recognize that Kickstarter hosts an important community: artists, innovators, and the intellectually curious. We wanted to share the background and development of JUMP with you because we value your opinions and support. We believe we have started a new product category within the portable charging market; one that we hope you would like to follow the progress of. Your support means everything to us, and all of the funding will go towards vitally important aspects of making this product a reality.\nNATIVE UNION\nnativeunion.com\nNATIVE UNION is a creative and lifestyle brand that has received critical acclaim from the design community.\nIn 2013 NATIVE UNION launched SWITCH, a wireless portable speaker, conference call device and mobile phone charger. During the year it has received numerous accolades and awards including; Good Design Award, Chicago, Gold Winner of A\u2019Design Awards, Italy and winner of Design for Asia, Hong Kong. Previous products have been awarded the Good Design Award, Tokyo, Design Plus Award, Frankfurt, iLounge, Las Vegas. At NATIVE UNION we have a track record of creating, designing and producing innovative and thoughtful products.\n Technical Specifications", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt has taken nearly a year to be where we are today, and it has been incredibly challenging from a design and development perspective to achieve such great battery performance in a compact sleek design.\n\nThis upfront R&D has inherently reduced the amount of risks still involved in the project and we now face the final major task of bringing all the elements together, through; tooling, testing, compliance and production. \n\nOf course by developing and manufacturing a product with new technology, there are still risks involved. At this stage we foresee the largest of these hurdles, aside from the normal challenges involved in any development, is Made for iPhone (MFi) compliance testing and shipment of individual products around the world.\n\nJUMP is the first MFI accessory that combines a battery and sync product and is classed as a charging cable; this puts us in new territory within the MFI certification process.\n\nTo reduce risk and challenges, we have partnered with a world-leading manufacturer of MFI products; this provides us added insurance and confidence to pass the Made for iPhone (MFI) certification. \n\nDe-bugging the software involved in AutoCharge\u2122 and within compliance of MFI will take further fine tuning and testing as we want the most efficient device for power vs size on the market today.\n\nThe last challenge is getting the individual product to each of our kickstarter backers \u2013 with tighter restrictions on the shipping of singular products that contain batteries around the world today. Our in-house logistics team has spent a considerable amount of time searching to find a logistics partner that has a proven track record of dealing with this issue and we believe we have greatly reduced the challenges involved.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Guess who's back?", "update_content": "Dear JUMP Cable Backers,\nWe are excited to announce that we'll be launching our latest product on Kickstarter two weeks from today, on October 26th at 8 AM PDT.\nYou may remember that we\u2019ve been wanting to come back to Kickstarter for some time now.

Our Drifter is haunted by an insatiable illness, traveling further into the lands of Buried Time, steeped in blood and treasure hoping to discover a way to quiet the vicious disease. Echoes of a dark and violent past from the dead eras resonate throughout and he can't help but listen.\nHyper Light Drifter is a 2D Action RPG in the vein of the best 8-bit and 16-bit classics, with modernized mechanics and designs on a much grander scale.\nVisions for this game have been fluttering in my skull for ages; something dark and fantastic, with giant forests to navigate, huge floating structures to explore, deep crumbling ruins to loot, massive throngs of enemies to rend, and behemoths both flesh and mechanical to overcome. I want it all to be as beautiful as possible, forging color with the dark and eerie wastes and intimidating landscapes. It plays like the best parts of A Link to the Past and Diablo, evolved: lightning fast combat, more mobility, an array of tactical options, more numerous and intelligent enemies, and a larger world with a twisted past to do it all in.\nRip through enemies with responsive, fun combat; engaging and brutal. Upgrade weapons, discover new equipment and trek deeper than ever.\nTraverse a dark, detailed and interconnected world with alternate paths and secret loot. Miyazaki films have taught me that beautiful animation and design add life to a world. From characters to background elements, everything is lovingly crafted while I hum show-tunes and squint suspiciously at the flickering pixels until they perform as intended.\nA challenge - The game is accessible and easy to pick up, but difficult to master and complete; enemies and hazards become more vicious and numerous, so players must use clever tactics to avoid death. (Some yell hurtful phrases at players simply to bring tears to the cereal bowl below.)\n  Core Mechanics\nPrimary weapon - Composed of phase shifted Hard Light (also known as Solid Light), your sword acts as the primary means of offense; it's quick, brutal, and can slash through most anything. Best of all it never runs low on energy.\nSprite Companion - An indispensable personalized drone, the Sprite manages your inventory virtually, maintains your shields, seeks out hidden paths and lights the way in the darkest of times. Functionality may be expanded with new modules.\nSecondary items - You'll come across a variety of advanced weaponry, items and gear throughout your travels; Light Rail Pistols, Heavy Rifles, various hi-power explosives and enemy-aware Seeker Drones. All of these are powered by limited batteries, found scattered throughout the world. \nDefense System - A rechargeable Hard Light Diamond shield which offers total protection from attacks for a short burst of time. If timed correctly projectiles can be reflected back at enemies for extra damage. Can be upgraded to extend duration.\nDash Module - Multi-use gear that enables a triple speed dash; can be used to evade attacks, cut across gaps and chasms, break through certain blocks and rubble and even stun enemies.\nRifle\nRoly Poly\nFrom Sean Ward\nEnemy Sprites\nFrom Nick Wozniak\nFrom Ian Schlaepfer\nBoss Reveals\n#1\nSprite work: Johan Vinet\nName: Rivan The Tamer\nAttributes: User of searing RedShift light, causing great destruction when attacking.

I want to fully indulge this vision, so I will use the funds to further the quality of the game rather than bolster any after-thoughts.\nOn $180,000 Goal:\nThere are so many great artists, illustrators, writers, wonderfully creative people that I'm surrounded by and I want them in on this! I plan to commission small pieces of art to flesh out the world; they can create new character that live in this world, write new lore, and punch out some rad art, all within the limitations of the history and style of this world. All work will be collected in the Companion Art Book and their pieces featured on our site once they start producing!\nOn $200,000 Goal:\nThe Companion Art Book is a physical compendium of knowledge and reference materials, high res unused art assets and never before seen art works for the project. It will also include commissioned pieces and extended lore for the world and characters within created by several artists throughout the community as well as a collection of some of the fan art that has been and continues to be posted. (Love it all!) this will be available for purchase after the campaign has ended, once everything has been commissioned and compiled. \nNotes on PS4 + Vita + Wii U + OUYA support\nREVISION! I'd like for everyone to be able to get the version they want. If you have already contributed at the $10 tier, simply pledge an additional $5 and I'll compose a survey after the campaign is over to determine which version you would like a key for. Cross-buy is undetermined for right now. If you have already contributed at $15 or more, you will be given the choice of PC, Linux, Mac, PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA. That's as simple as I can make it for now!\nDetails on the Challenge Mode\nThis mode will have several mix-up mini quests for you to test your skills at; you'll have wave-based challenges where you fight off increasingly difficult hordes to see how long you can survive as you level up, boss rush runs, speed runs and other odd modes that wouldn't typically fit in the main game. All will have a scoring mechanism that unlocks achievements, plus we are working on local co-op for this mode.\nPhysical Box and Manual\nWe will be able to provide and ship out a slick designed SNES style physical box and manual to go with your digital download! Both printed in full color and shipped directly to you. This is NOW a Reward Tier AND you can get it as an add-on for any Tier if you add $35 to your pledge! The Stretch Goal allows us to offer it outside of the Kickstarter for any who would like to nab it down the line.\nThe game is in a prototype phase, planned initially for PC, though I would love to expand to other platforms. \nHaving worked with Beau Blyth of Samurai Gunn fame on the programming side, the framework for the game is in place - remaining mechanics and the body of the game will slot nicely into current systems. All will be refined until it feels sleek, satisfying and fun. \nThe venerable and talented Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland) has been gracious enough to jump on board to compose the soundtrack!\nThe bigger task ahead is asset generation; enemy sprites (which use dozens of frames of hand drawn art, including the major Boss encounters), new level designs (plus fancy lighting!), and sound design.\nIf I reach the $64,000 stretch goal, I will be able to hire a secondary animator/designer which will allow more time to sink into expanding the world.\nThe $75,000 goal will allow for an even deeper soundtrack with bonus tracks plus a SFX pro.\nI have planned for a potential release date in mid 2014, with beta access at least two months prior, allowing time to tweak and bug-fix and adjust according to player feedback. A more solid schedule will become apparent for backers once resources have been assessed.\nThis project has rapidly evolved into a much larger world and story and needs the help of the community in order for it to thrive.\nCompleting this game by mid 2014 requires focus and time; the initial goal will afford me these two (current) luxuries.The higher stretch goals will allow a fully realized version.\nPaying outside help - This is a passion project for me, but other friends and professionals (such as Beau and Rich) need to be compensated for their tremendous talents. Having a sound effects producer/musical talent as well as an animator to assist would lighten the workload considerably and allow me to concentrate on the overall structure and scope of the game, as well as fine tuning all of the time consuming little things.\nCompany and operation costs - In order to begin selling through any platform I'll need to establish Heart Machine as a full game company, which takes a fair chunk of money and time, plus licensing, living costs and bills factor in.\nImproving and fixing - Getting testers, implementing community feedback, using every ounce of my soul to produce a game I've been dreaming of for decades.\nAccess to the Game \nI have been researching distribution methods. Now I have PC, Mac, Linux (DRM-Free or Steam), PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA.\nThe closed Beta will surely hold some valuable insight, and in order to implement that knowledge delays may happen. I will do my best to keep Backers informed of progress on all fronts.\n  Concepts\nAlex Preston (Heart Machine) -alxpreston.com, @HeartMachineZ\nLead Designer + Animator + Secondary Programming\nI've been an illustrator and designer for a good long while now. Developing games has been a passion of mine since I was a child, though I've never had the courage and support until now to actually release something into the wild. Spread your neon wings you sweet pixelated bastard!\nBeau Blyth (Teknopants) -teknopants.com, @Teknopants\nLead Programmer + Tremendous Hair\nDeveloped loads of rad fast-paced arcade style games including the upcoming super bad-ass Samurai Gunn.

Also payment.\nRich Vreeland (Disasterpeace) - disasterpeace.com/, @Disasterpeace\nMusical Score + Piercing Eyes\nThis chip-blasting machine of a man has produced tons of fantastic game albums, most notably Fez. (Which completely wrecked my mind for a solid year.) I've been lucky enough to get him aboard on this project to develop the soundtrack; you know he'll deliver something special.\nWill Wiesenfeld (Baths)- bathsmusic.com, @BATHSmusic\nContributor + Super Fantastic Beat-dropper\nA supreme talent and fine craftsman of music and smiles, also known as the one-man pound-storm of deep beats and carnal wailing that is Baths, has produced the trailer track. Is producing another track for the game during production.\nTeddy Diefenbach (TeddyDief) -teddydiefenbach.com, @TeddyDief\nA thoughtful soul who created The Moonlighters and Shove Pro, co-founded Rad Dragon, is a programmer and game designer extraordinaire. Dives deep into things such as systems design, narrative design and his ultimate mission of recreating the golden age of late 90s Squaresoft.\nThe Game\nAll copies will be sent out upon release 2014. Planned platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac OSX and now PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA. PC copies can be DRM-free or Steam keys (thanks to our backers pushing us through Greenlight!). Everyone in the $10 tier will get the PC/Mac/Linux game on release, $15 and above will net you an option for PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA, and the $25 tier receives a Kickstarter exclusive version of the game with bonus side quest.\nInstruction Booklet\nA nifty little booklet to bring you back to the days when manuals meant something; revealing a little known move, a secret passage, or simply bolstering the story and context of the world outside of the game. This particular Instruction Book will include all of those items and more, with illustrations to accompany important sections.\nCompanion Book (Art and Stories)\nThis beauty will contain tons of concept illustrations, sprites, sketches, notes on characters and the world, plus revealing knowledge of the finer details of this realm. This process has already generated a lot of assets that won't be used in game, so I'd like to provide a look behind-the-scenes of a project like this. Plus silly drawings of cat creatures and Pork-Peoples will be stuffed into the pages for pure entertainment purposes. Much mocking of lowly creatures shall be had!\nOriginal Soundtrack\nThe master Rich Vreeland (Disasterpeace) will be composing the eerie OST for this game! I'm jazz-handin' all around this room with excitement at this very moment, nearly unable to continue typing! The full OST will be included in digital form at the $40 Tier with bonus tracks. Boom!\nAlternate Drifter\nReceive a Kickstarter-only alternative main playable character to destroy and explore with. He might have a variant weapon, glowing eyes, and sinister intentions.\nResplendent Print\nA 18x24 archival quality print of the main character posing in a fantastic manner (probably with creature parts flying about) will be yours to man-handle or gently place in a frame. Hand signed and numbered, with a lovely thank you note on the rear to haunt you in your sleep.\nImmortal sprite\nYour name will be translated to the in-game rune system, thus immortalizing your very being into this world beyond. These symbols will be used in special locations. Real names only, please. (No, Crack McButtson is not a real name.)\nDesign a dastardly enemy\nPut your skills to use and help design the look, behavior, name and location a new enemy will appear. This is no fools errand; you'll be creating (digital) life itself, and thus comes the responsibility to nurture the sad heap until it's of age to brutalize Drifters every moment it can.\nDesign a mid-boss creature\nHave you always wanted an angry spider to lob shells at you? Well we can help bring your vision to life! Together we will build an entire mid-boss encounter, with behavior patterns, chamber layout, the look of the creature and it's rewards. As above, choose attributes wisely.\nT-Shirt Special\nThe $60 tier will net you a snazzy design from Casey Hunt in small, medium, large or XL. This will be available to purchase sometime after the Kickstarter as well, so those who have already donated won't be left without something to wear.\nParty in the city\nYou'll join us (a bunch of goofy independent developers) for a wrap party evening of hangabouts, Smash Brothers (plus other multi-player games) and general raging at Glitch City, the Culver City Indie game space. You'll also receive a hand-signed print, a few high fives, and some great big smiles. Your name will be listed in the credits under the Major Thank-You section. \nReference Sheet\n  Add-Ons\nYou can add extra rewards to your current tier if you so desire (remember, no need to change your tier, just add the amount and we'll see the amount and a note from you during the survey):\nAdd $5 - Digital OST for the game\nAdd $10 - Unlock the Alternate playable Drifter\nAdd $15 - Additional Copy of the Game for any platform\nAdd $30 - Limited run t-shirt (no international yet)\nAdd $35 - SNES style physical box and manual (no international yet)\nAdd $42 - Limited Compact Print (11x14) (no international yet)\nAdd $60 - Printed Softcover Companion Art Book (no international yet)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter months of planning and writing and drawing and programming the vision for the project became vivid and succinct. That was the biggest hurdle to overcome. The second was exposing this to the public eye, as that can be a terrifying prospect; and here it is.\n\nCreative endeavors like this are difficult and often unwieldy beasts with many mouths to feed and razor-tipped claws to bind. I've written and planned as much as I possibly could up to this point, and with the framework in place I have the bulk of the more difficult obstacles conquered. Issues will come, as they always do in any long-term project, but I feel thoroughly prepared; I have the proper tools and skills and a large support network through our shared community space Glitch City which is bursting at the seams with excellent developers with vast wells of knowledge and years of experience prototyping, building, and releasing games. I feel incredibly lucky to be tapped into this community and to have such reliable friends willing to lend a hand with resources I may need in the future to complete this game.\n \nI've done what I can to get this far through some rather extreme health struggles, and I don't plan to stop.

We kick off the final 7 days of our Kickstarter campaign with our latest collection of movies, songs, animations, and artwork of all kinds, from Mighty No. 9 fans and supporters all around the world!\nFINAL GOAL: $4,000,000: ONLINE BATTLE RACE MODE!: REACHED!\nThe ultimate online competition! You and a friend compete online, racing to the end of slightly customized versions of single-player stages. You can see your rival as a \"ghost\" image in your game, but you can't affect each other...save for the enemies you defeat being sent over to impede your opponent\u2019s progress! It's an all new twist on versus mode play that will give Mighty No. 9 life well beyond the single-player campaign!\nFor more details on other goals, check out the Stretch Goal section further down the page, and our handy FAQ at the bottom!\nMighty No. 9 is an all-new Japanese side-scrolling action game that takes the best aspects of the 8- and 16-bit era classics you know and love, and transforms them with modern tech, fresh mechanics, and fan input into something fresh and amazing!\nYou play as Beck, the 9th in a line of powerful robots, and the only one not infected by a mysterious computer virus that has caused mechanized creatures the world over to go berserk. Run, jump, blast, and transform your way through six stages (or more, via stretch goals) you can tackle in any order you choose, using weapons and abilities stolen from your enemies to take down your fellow Mighty Number robots and confront the final evil that threatens the planet!\nNote: All images on this page are concept art and not actual in-game screens.\nEvery aspect of development\u2014art, level design, music, programming, etc.\u2014is being handled by veteran Japanese game creators with extensive experience in the genre, and with Mega Man in particular, all the way up to and including the project\u2019s leader, Keiji Inafune himself! Backers will have unprecedented access to seeing this team at work through blogs, podcasts, videos, concept art\u2014the works!\nMighty No. 9 is being developed for the PC with gamepad support (of course!), and will be made available through Steam and DRM-free digital distribution methods. Other platforms, including home consoles, Mac, and Linux, are a high priority, but only if we can afford them via stretch goals. Should we reach those goals, anyone funding the project will be allowed to choose which version of the game they would like to receive. The estimated release date is spring 2015.\nThis project is on Kickstarter so it can involve YOU, the fans! Not only will this make it possible, through crowdfunding, for us to make the game exactly as we envision it, but it also allows us to bring dedicated fans of this genre together to assist the team in shaping aspects of the game\u2019s design. We need your help! Let\u2019s make something amazing, and let\u2019s do it together!\n  So what makes Mighty No. 9\u2014the character as well as the game\u2014different? Simply put: the ability to transform! Of course our hero, Beck, earns new weapons as he defeats each of his fellow Mighty Number boss robots, but more than that, his body itself can also reconfigure into new shapes, allowing for all kinds of new skills and abilities! \nFor example, his limbs might become giant magnets, enabling him to walk up walls or rip away enemy shields... Or maybe extendible spring-loaded hands would allow him to activate far-away switches or work as a grappling hook... Or he could have a tank-like body, easily crossing over spikes and pushing objects around the levels... These are just a few possibilities we\u2019re considering (the game is still in the design phase), but you get the idea!\nAnd it\u2019s not only killing bosses that gets Beck new powers. Taking out other enemies with a certain weapon, or hitting them in their weak spot, can expose one of three types of \u201cxel\u201d (pronounced \u201ccell\u201d) energy Beck can sap (if he\u2019s quick enough), store, and unleash later via his own Mighty Skills! Give yourself a double-jump and speed boost for a limited time, unleash a concentrated flurry of powerful punches directly ahead, or set off a blast that hurts everything on the screen! Whatever final form it takes, this system will add depth and strategy to the action, as you choose how to approach and defeat even normal bad guys to best fuel your special powers.\nOnce, you worked together, side-by-side\u2014but now, your fellow Mighty No. robots have lashed out, taking over key strategic locations across the globe and infesting them with their minions. You have no choice: the other Mighty Numbers...Must. Be. Destroyed!\nBut it won\u2019t be easy. Although they were originally designed for industrial purposes, the Mighty Numbers have all become fierce warriors, seasoned through seasons in the most popular spectator sport of the future: robot-on-robot combat in the Battle Colosseo!\nWe can\u2019t reveal everything about the Mighty Numbers just yet (partially because we wouldn\u2019t want to dump it all out at once, and partially because we\u2019re still working on their designs!), but here\u2019s a taste of what we\u2019re aiming for. Keep checking back for more to be revealed soon, and study what you see here closely\u2014learning the tactics and weak points of these mechanized monsters will be your only hope of defeating them!\nOverheard at recess: \u201cBilly Backer says you can trick him into the water to make him freeze himself and he dies instantly!\u201d (Note: Not true. ...We don\u2019t think.)\n\u201cTommy\u2019s brother heard if you magnet his missile back at him and pause the game right when it hits, he loses all his health down to one!\u201d (Note: Also False. Probably.)\nAny game of this scope takes a team\u2014a big team, way too many to highlight here (keep an eye out for an update with more comprehensive staff info)\u2014but here\u2019s a sample of some key personnel for the purposes of this Kickstarter campaign:\n  That\u2019s where you come in. As a backer to Mighty No. 9, you will become a member of the Mighty community, and in a way, an extended member of the development team, where your input\u2014taken in aggregate along with your mighty brothers and sisters\u2014can help shape the game. How will we get your feedback? Well, for example: \nSURVEYS: Within the first few weeks of a successful Kickstarter campaign, members of the Mighty community can take part in a survey to help judge their overall priorities: difficulty balance, length vs. replayability, favorite features of older games and what you hate\u2014things like that.\nPOLLS: From time to time, the team will ask the community to choose between ideas or characters they\u2019ve come up with. For example, the first poll planned is to choose between several designs to pick the look for Beck\u2019s trusted partner, Call. (That\u2019s right: Beck & Call.)\nYou can vote for your favorite Call from now until the end of our Kickstarter; click on the image above for details!\nCONTESTS: Later on in production, the team will hold a contest within the Mighty community to design an enemy! Come up with your coolest or craziest design and a fun way to sell the team and your fellow community members on it, and who knows? \nAND ??? These are just a few of the ideas the team has already that all backers will have access to. (At higher pledge levels, more involved but necessarily-limited interactions like beta access and more are likewise possible.) \nWhat form will all the final fan interactions take? Hey, you tell us! We can\u2019t promise we can do anything you ask for, of course, but we can promise to always be asking, and more importantly, always be listening. That\u2019s what this project is all about! :D \nWe\u2019re proud to announce we\u2019re working with Humble Bundle for digital reward fulfillment and Fangamer for physical items! These guys have built a name doing exactly this kind of thing\u2014we trust them, and so can you. Now, on with the rewards!\nIf we can make our initial Kickstarter funding goal and nothing more, you can rest assured we are going to deliver a complete and fully satisfying game experience. But given the choice and the necessary funds to make it happen, we have a whole bunch of \u201creally nice-to-have\u201d ideas for additional content, features, and platforms (!) that would be extra icing on our already delicious \u201cneed-to-have\u201d cake! Of course part of any extra money will go toward making up the budget of the game itself, but if the following funding numbers are reached, we're also excited to offer:\n$1,200,000: Two More Stages: REACHED!\nOur initial goal sets the table with six main stages and bosses, plus a final stage leading to the ultimate showdown\u2014but now we can invite Mighty Nos. 7 and 8 to the party, each complete with their own, unique stage!\n$1,350,000: Mac and Linux Versions: REACHED!\nWhy should Windows users get to hog all the fun? Now we can offer Mighty No. 9 on both Mac and Linux as well!\n$1,500,000: New Game Plus and Turbo Mode: REACHED!\nIf we pass this goal, we\u2019ll design a New Game Plus mode that allows those who finish the game but are still thirsty for more to carry over certain powers or items from the first play-through for a more challenging \u201csecond quest\u201d version of the game. We\u2019ll also work in a Turbo Mode that lets you play through the game at a faster speed for extra challenge.\n$1,750,000: The Making of Mighty No. 9 Video Documentary: REACHED!\nGet an in-depth look at the creation of Mighty No. 9\u2014and an unprecedented peek into the typically ultra-secretive Japanese game development industry\u2014with three 30-minute documentary episodes produced by the wizards at 2 Player Productions (the same team behind our pitch video and the amazing Double Fine Adventure documentary)!\n$2,000,000: BONUS Boss Rush Mode: REACHED!\nThat\u2019s right -- we\u2019re adding a stretch goal here without pushing any of the other goals back! (Think of it more like a stretch reward.) :) After a lot of feedback (which we agreed with) on the big gap before the next goal of PS3/Xbox 360/Wii U console versions, the team really wanted to have something for everyone to aim for and celebrate along the way. So we took our best-bang-for-the-buck potential future goal and will include it as a bonus feature if we can hit $2 million: a separate mode where you can challenge all the Mighty No. Bosses, back-to-back, with a clock ticking to keep track of your best time, so you can share, compare, and show off your skills to your friends! \n$2,200,000: PS3/X360/WIIU CONSOLE VERSIONS: REACHED!!!\nThis one deserves ALL CAPS AND THREE EXCLAMATION MARKS! Now we can bring this game to the audience that made the genre what it is in the first place: console gamers! Specifically, we\u2019ll make digital versions for release on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U platforms. (You\u2019ll be given the option to choose any of these instead of the PC version.) \nThank you so much to all the fans who made this dream possible!\n$2,400,000: Challenge Mode: REACHED!\nSimilar to the Challenge Modes in games like New Super Mario Bros. U, this special extra mode would remix parts of existing levels and enemies to create dozens of mini-missions you can use to test your skills in a variety of enjoyably frustrating ways! \n$2,550,000: Extra End Stage & Boss: REACHED!\nWe\u2019ll add another full stage, complete with an intense, original boss battle (!), to the final area Beck will take on once he defeats the other eight Mighty No. bosses!\n$2,750,000: BECK & CALL ONLINE CO-OP CHALLENGE MODE: REACHED!\nWe\u2019re excited about all our stretch goals, but even so, this one is really special to us: based on your feedback, we wanted to offer something that both included Call as a playable character and put her on equal footing as Beck, while not breaking our schedule or budget. We also wanted this to be something new -- something the genre has never seen before. And that\u2019s how we came up with this: over a dozen missions you can play online with a friend, playing as Beck and his community-appointed partner, Call! Like the single-player offline challenge Mode, these missions will be parts of levels remixed, but this time around the theme of cooperative play. Players will need to use Beck and Call\u2019s different powers to complement each other and defeat these special challenges! \n$2,900,000: Intro Stage and Boss: REACHED!\nWe add an epic introductory stage\u2014complete with a closing boss encounter\u2014that players will take on before facing any of the Mighty No. boss levels! This will help ease everyone into the world of Mighty No. 9, and serve as a nice primer on the basic game systems and controls!\n$3,100,000: Support Character: REACHED!\nBeck will get a faithful sidekick to swoop in with special powers at his time of greatest need! The exact form this character will take is not decided yet, so we\u2019ll all be able to see it get conceived and designed together\u2014but it will be some kind of assistant that will drop in for a limited time, help out somehow, and then zoom away!\n$3,300,000: PS4 and Xbox One Versions: REACHED!!!\nYes! We heard your calls and are proud to report we can finally offer next-gen versions of Mighty No. 9 here! We know by the time the game ships in 2015, many of you will be proud owners of one next-gen system or the other -- or maybe both! If we reach this level of funding, we can add the PS4 and the Xbox One to the list for every backer getting the digital version of Mighty No. 9 to choose from! To recap, that would mean you could choose one of the following: PC, Mac, Linux, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PS4, or Xbox One! \n$3,500,000: PlayStation Vita and 3DS versions: REACHED!\nThat\u2019s right! At this level, we can make digital versions of Mighty No. 9 for the two most popular handheld systems out there: the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS! (These will both be added to the list of available systems to choose from, so every backer who is set to receive a download version of Mighty No. 9 can choose either of these as the system for their game download, instead of a home console or PC version.)\n$3,700,000 SINGLE PLAYER CALL STAGE & BOSS FIGHT!: REACHED!\nYes! We heard the feedback from our community, and at this level, we would be thrilled to fulfill this popular wish -- to add an all-new single-player level, including a boss fight, where you can play as Mighty No. 9\u2019s heroine, Call! We agree it would be a fun addition and a great way to mix up the action, so fingers crossed we can make it this far!\n$3,800,000: OPTIONAL RETRO-STYLE CHIPTUNE SOUNDTRACK + FX!: REACHED!\nYou\u2019ve seen the names of the legendary musicians attached to this project: Manami Matsumae, Takeshi Tateishi, Ippo Yamada... It\u2019s a veritable who\u2019s who of veteran game composers. So we thought, why not tap into that retro vibe and cook up an optional chiptune version of the entire Mighty No. 9 game soundtrack, including classic sound effects? That\u2019s right \u2013 we\u2019ll remix the entire soundtrack, retro 8-bit-style, and the game\u2019s sound effects, for you to listen to in-game as you play, as an option you can toggle on or off in the settings menu!\n$4,000,000: ONLINE BATTLE RACE MODE!: REACHED!\nThe ultimate online competition! You and a friend compete online, racing to the end of slightly customized versions of single-player stages. You can see your rival as a \"ghost\" image in your game, but you can't affect each other...save for the enemies you defeat being sent over to impede your opponent\u2019s progress! It's an all new twist on versus mode play that will give Mighty No. 9 life well beyond the single-player campaign!\nWe're working out the details of our upcoming stretch goals now. More info here as soon as we have it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe all know game development is inherently unpredictable\u2014delays and unexpected costs being the two most common \u201cknown unknowns.\u201d The good news is, in their more than 15 year history, developer Inti Creates have shipped over 30 different games on eight different platforms, and our project lead, Keiji Inafune, has either worked on or overseen 30+ games in this genre alone, as well as having lead one of the biggest Japanese studios, and some of the biggest AAA games ever. So not only do we have extensive experience with running successful game productions in general, but also experience designing, building, and shipping games of this type specifically, with an established track record of being on time and on budget.\n\nAnother challenge: we are working in two languages here\u2014Japanese and English\u2014with developers and backers on both sides. While we feel this is a huge plus, as it adds appeal and makes our project unique, there\u2019s no denying it also adds unique requirements in terms of communication and workflow. The good news here: We all have experience making and marketing games for BOTH English-speaking and Japanese-speaking audiences, and are taking extra precautions in pre-planning and during development to buffer and budget for things like interpretation, translation time, etc., all to ensure we stay on the same page with our backers and with each other.\n\nFinally, what we see as our biggest challenge: properly involving the community. How exactly do you ask for and integrate fan feedback and contributions while keeping a project like this on track in terms of vision, scope, and schedule? This is still something of a wild frontier in the game industry, as it\u2019s only recently that any of us have had the tools to make this feasible. And especially in Japan, where we have honestly lagged behind our Western counterparts in the variety of ways we\u2019ve been able to interact with our fans up until now.\n\nWe\u2019ve been researching different projects\u2019 approaches\u2014and some of us even have experience from similar experiments in the past\u2014but as far as we can tell, there\u2019s really no one established \u201cright way\u201d to go about it. However! We do think, in this case, even knowing that we don\u2019t know all the answers up front is important: it reminds us we need to listen, to establish methods of ensuring we hear our backers\u2019 choices and feedback, and keeps us more flexible. We are trying to work in a new way with this project that will allow us to show more things earlier than we typically would, while ensuring that everyone seeing it will have the correct context to see it in, and that there will still be plenty of nice surprises in the final product. \n\nOne aspect we already know to account for is anytime you ask a (hopefully!) large group of people to choose between options, especially when you\u2019re asking some of the most passionate fans in all of gaming, you are going to end up, by necessity, with some portion of them disappointed, and you\u2019re going to hear about it. We know we\u2019re ready for the ride, and even better, we\u2019re excited as hell to take it. The biggest thing we believe we should all keep in mind, both as creators and as backers: we\u2019ll be learning more and more as we go along, so let\u2019s be patient and work together.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #123", "update_userinfo": "IMPORTANT NOTICE from Fangamer / Fangamer\u304b\u3089\u5927\u5207\u306a\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b", "update_content": "Hello Mighty Backers!\nFangamer has recently sent out the following notice.

Thank you! Keep up the support and let's hit our next goal soon!\nWait... What are Stretch Goals?\nStretch goals are extra content that we can accomplish if the funding goals are met. For instance, if we hit 200,000, then we will have enough resources to implement a 4 player battle mode! It\u2019s not to say we will won\u2019t see these features in the future some time (don\u2019t be too worried! ), but if we reach the stretch goals, we can promise them with confidence! Here is a description of the stretch goals:\nMusic Player\nSound Test! Adds an in-game music player that lets you listen to all of your favorite Shovel Knight tunes. Collect song scrolls in the levels and take them to the bard, who will play them for you with perfect accuracy! We might even have some special, hidden songs... You\u2019ll also be able to hear all the SFX samples, but we don\u2019t know how the bard does that.\nAchievements\nWe tend to like achievements because they change the way you play the game! This stretch goal will add a bevy of achievements to ALL VERSIONS of the game.  These aren\u2019t just going to be stock achievements; they will be creative and wonderful. Can you beat Shovel Knight without losing a life? Prove it!\nNew Game Plus\nStart the game over with your weapons and items fully upgraded. However\u2026 enemies are going to be tougher, resources more scarce, and new challenges may arise. With new game plus, it\u2019s like a whole new game! Kind of! +!\nPlayable Boss Knight\nPlay the full game as a member of the Order of No Quarter! If we meet this stretch goal, we\u2019ll hold a vote to see who it will be. Expect the game to play differently! For example, Propeller Knight could have the ability to hover for short distances, but would be a low health \u2018glass cannon\u2019 of sorts. Even the story and dialog will change a little bit to reflect the changes!\nLinux / Mac Versions\nWant to play Shovel Knight on your weirdo computer? Many folks have asked for Linux and Mac versions. We hope to support Mac and Linux either way, but this goal makes it happen for sure, and in a more timely fashion (hopefully in 2013!).\nGender Swap Mode!\nWe want Shovel Knight to be enjoyable by boys and girls of all ages, everywhere. With this mode, the main characters\u2019 genders will be swapped, giving us a chance to do it before the internet has a chance to. The story will also change a bit to reflect the changes. Can you defeat the Evil Enchanter?\nChallenge Mode\nAdds a comprehensive batch of challenge rooms  to Shovel Knight. In this mode, Shovel Knight will be tasked with a variety of mini-quests like \u201cdefeat all the enemies!\u201d or \u201creach the goal in time!\u201d. Expect things like pacifism challenges and other rules-benders\u2026 and expect some tough-as-nails challenges too!\n4 Player Battle Mode!*\nWe\u2019ve talked a ton about multiplayer for Shovel Knight. While full-on multiplayer is out of the scope of this project, we could totally do 4 player couch co-op battles! Imagine playing as Shovel Knight ( or any of the extra playable knights ) and duking it out in the arena! Several modes would be ideal:\n\u00b7         Cash collecting, where you fight for treasure that appears in the level. Knock your buddy to make gems fall out and collect them!\n\u00b7         Racing, where all players would have to make their way to the end of a stage\n\u00b7         Last man standing, where the only goal is to slash mercilessly\u2026 to the bitter end!\n*This is couch co-op only, not online. We hope to bring this feature to all platforms, but the 3DS isn\u2019t guaranteed because multiplayer is Wi-Fi only.\nPHYSICAL.ACTUAL.REAL.BOX.\nIf we reach this stretch goal, then we will make a physical box of the game, which will be mailed free to backers pledging at the $50 tier and above! Plus, ALL backers will receive the digital version, to print or view at your leisure. NOTE: This box art is only a mockup. We might have a surprise or two for the final box art! Johnny Vila, your prayers have been answered :P\n3rd Playable Boss Knight!\nCall this goal unoriginal, but we don\u2019t care. We\u2019re too excited to play as another boss knight! Let\u2019s get to this pledge level and have one more knight (who will be chosen by the community) make the cut! Rally! For the Order of No Quarter!\nAll Bosses Playable in Battle Mode!!\nIf we reach this goal, the entire Order of No Quarter (including the Enchantress herself!) will step into Battle Mode, for the ultimate battle royale. Wild new combat styles abound! Play as your under-appreciated favorite and beat up the more popular knights that got voted into the main campaign!\nShovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. It's a hot mashup of new and old that may remind you of Mega Man, Castlevania, or Dark Souls! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this valley with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and save his lost beloved. He wields a ShovelBlade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!\nBut, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost.\nIf you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, and real heart\u2026 Shovel Knight is for you! If you don\u2019t, then what? How could you not be into that stuff? Keep reading, you\u2019ll come around!\nEvery great game needs a great set of baddies, and Shovel Knight\u2019s are a doozy. Shovel Knight\u2019s Nemesis is The Enchantress, a mysterious and powerful conjurer. Her Order of No Quarter has swept over the land, stationed in locations Shovel Knight is sure to visit. In order to get to the Enchantress, he\u2019s gonna have to beat them all!\nWe love themed bosses and themed levels; this love is on full display in Shovel Knight! Each knight in the Order has been lovingly crafted to have a distinct look, theme, and personality. These epic boss battles are really going to shine! We already love our villainous bunch, so let us share them with you.\nThis is Polar Knight: the Sabretooth to Shovel Knight\u2019s Wolverine. He\u2019s guarding a stranded ship in the frozen south. Titanic and terrible, he is the largest and most brutish of the Order of No Quarter. Some time in the past, Shovel Knight and Polar Knight have crossed Shovels before...\n\u2022 Pros: Wields Snow Shovel, Doesn't feel cold but is quite considerate!\n\u2022 Cons: Annoying laugh ( it's like water torture )!\nAnd Propeller Knight! He commands the Enchantress' flying machine with the cocksure attitude of a sky pirate! With his Heli-Helmet, he can zoom short distances with ease. Shovel Knight encounters Propeller Knight on top of the aircraft as it zooms through the sky; earth fights against air in a true battle of elements!\n\u2022 Pros: Talented Fencer, Mechanical Heli-Helmet, Debonair!\n\u2022 Cons: Arrogance, Lightweight, Outrageous Accent!\nSometimes, the bomb is mightier than the sword. Deep in the recesses of his alchemical lab, Plague Knight perfects concoctions both poisonous and explosive. Toxin, disease, and death are his playgrounds. Even his comrades give Plague Knight a wide berth, because he spreads more than just the common cold. With an array of mysterious and magical bottles at his side, Plague Knight could be considered the black sheep of The Order of No Quarter.\nPros: Maniacal scientific mind, fearlessness bordering on recklessness\nCons: Physically weak, short stature, shy at parties\nMole Knight... the shovel may rule the confines of man-made gardens, but in the wild, the titan of tunneling is the mole! Mole Knight embraces this truth wholeheartedly. With his modified drop-forged armored claws, he mockingly tears through the earth with brute strength! Mole Knight calls the subterranean Lost City his home... an ancient abandoned metropolis. Shovel Knight must pass through the Lost City, but chances are slim he won\u2019t be challenged to see who is truly the master of digging.\nPros: Great eyesight, shrewd, high endurance\nCons: Obsessive personality, gets sweaty in armor\nTinker Knight! Some knights love rushing into the glory of battle, ready to crush the skulls of their enemies! Tinker Knight is not one of those knights. He does his fighting before the battle begins, laboring on diabolical devices that do his work for him. The wrench is the tool of his trade, doubling as an engineering device and a melee weapon. Some are quick to dismiss Tinker Knight\u2019s lethality... usually just before falling victim to one of his mechanical monstrosities!\nPros: Gregarious demeanor, hard worker\nCons: Rough hands, works long hours, always out to prove himself\nWe\u2019re going to be sharing more of the Order of No Quarter as the Kickstarter proceeds, so check in often!\nShovel Knight is rendered in a pumped-up 8-bit style. We are adhering to the NES color palette, but adding many modern touches. For example, We have tons of scrolling background layers, giving a real illusion of depth.\nOur pixel animation and attention to detail is top-notch. Every character, even minor foes like these wizards, have painstakingly crafted animations and personalities.\nDetailed, living backgrounds and animation! Big, beautiful pixels! Just look at the screens!! With Shovel Knight, we are developing a next-gen 8 bit game!\nLike all of our favorite games, Shovel Knight has been designed gameplay first! We are especially dedicated to precise control. Pixel-perfect hit boxes, toenail jumps, and mobility mastery are our obsession. That wonderfully elusive 'feel' of great control.\nWhen thinking of the initial concept, we started by saying \u201cwhat if we built a whole game around a downward sword thrust? It would be great to sink into dirt, attack foes by stabbing from above, and maybe even bounce on hard ground! Ok, digging as a major mechanic\u2026 how about it\u2019s a shovel instead of a sword? That way, we can have him use the flat blade of the spade to flip things over and slash!\u201d\nFrom that gameplay concept sprung all of the ideas for Shovel Knight. We've learned from games like Mother 3 that a game becomes much stronger when graphics, story and tone work together to unify the gameplay experience!\nGreat music is central to great games, so it\u2019s with incredible excitement that we can announce that Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman is composing the soundtrack for Shovel Knight! For those of you who don\u2019t know, Jake is one of the most talented audio guys in the game biz, contributing on games from Mighty Switch Force to Contra 4 to Shantae. His most recent work on Double Dragon Neon has garnered as much praise as the game itself!\nNugget love\nTrue to our sense of collaboration, our team likes to involve audio early and often in development. For Shovel Knight\u2019s music, we\u2019re taking an NES+ style approach, adding sound channels and detail for a fuller sound that\u2019s still authentic. In addition to the main theme highlighted in the trailer, check out the track written for Pridemoor Keep, the level we\u2019ll be debuting at PAX!\nIf you liked that, you should just go listen to everything on his website (virt.bandcamp.com) because it\u2019s amazing. And check out the Official Shovel Knight Soundtrack Album backer reward below! WE LOVE JAKE! \nYacht Club Games is an independent game developer started in 2011 by Sean Velasco and a crew from WayForward. We are a fun-loving bunch of gaming geniuses who have dedicated our lives to video games ever since we saw our first pixels. However, our serious and solemn goal is to make really awesome original games that fuse modern and retro sensibilities, and we have the pedigree to prove it! Our team is comprised of top talent that has worked on some amazing titles, including Contra 4, A Boy and His Blob, Thor: God of Thunder, Mighty Milky Way, BloodRayne Betrayal, and most recently, Double Dragon Neon.This is our maiden project as Yacht Club Games, which means we are determined to impress.\nSo what are we all about? We want to create fun and challenging gameplay. We want to both tug at your heartstrings and delight you with levity and charm. We want to make games that you play together with friends and family. Most of all, we want to give everyone the same collective types of game experiences that have defined our generation. It\u2019s such an exciting time to be a fan of games; the industry is experiencing a renaissance and creativity is flourishing. We are so, so excited to develop games that we love, in hopes that you love them too!\nShovel Knight is currently nearing the end of preproduction. This means that the game design has been written, the main character designs and story have been created, and we have a plan for moving forward. We have an early build of the game that proves out our game mechanics and technology; you can see some footage in the trailer and we'll also be at PAX East!\nHowever, many things are still up in the air. Enemies and objects need to be designed and drawn. Audio, Animation, and Backgrounds need to be crafted. Lastly, we need to polish everything to a mirror sheen. Basically, we have what you saw in the video. Now we need to make the whole game.\nSo, we think this is a great time in the process to involve the community. We have a skeleton to build on, but we want you to be the meat!\nVideo games are expensive and time-consuming to develop, so the usual way to get one made is to acquire funding from a publisher. We have had great partnerships with publishers in the past. However, working with a publisher has its drawbacks; you are beholden to them, and they are generally risk averse. We wanted to go to the community, because Kickstarter provides us a unique opportunity to interface directly with our fans and make a game where fun and quality are always the top priorities.\nWe believe in Shovel Knight. We know that the final game is going to be great. We\u2019re so sure of this that we quit our full time jobs to work on it. We\u2019ve poured a massive amount of time, money and effort into our labor of love, but it\u2019s not enough to finish the game. In order to make Shovel Knight a reality, we need you!\nWe have amazing rewards that we are as excited to give out as we are to make! Check \u2018em out below!\nThe Game!\nGet a digital PC copy ( PC, LINUX, MAC, STEAM ) of Shovel Knight, hot off the digital presses! Digital!\nAlso, ALL pledge levels $15 and above will be able to choose on which platform they want their stalwart blue hero!!!\nInstruction Booklet\nThe final Instruction book will have illustrations, not sketches!\nAh, the Instruction Booklet\u2026 the comfort food of books. We still have a few of our favorites, the pages worn and cramped with notes. Together with you, we can bring the lost art of instruction booklets back to the limelight! The Shovel Knight Instruction Booklet is full of important safety information, awesome character art, enemy lists, hints, and space for notes. We are taking the utmost care to make sure that these booklets are true to their predecessors, right down to the way they smell.\nWe want the kids of today to feel the excitement of reading the booklet in eager anticipation of the game\u2019s release, so we are going to send you the booklet FIRST, so you can read it and reread it, and go crazy with anticipation!\nShovel Knight Coffee Table Book\nThis is a Book of the Game! The goal is to make something fun and funny, an entertaining compendium of the whole Shovel Knight production. Design Discussions and sketches! Concept Art and Illustrations! Game Maps, pixel animation sequences, and work-in-progress versions of everything! As we develop Shovel Knight, we\u2019ll be chronicling the process and we want to put it all here on display. As a crazy indie startup, you know there is going to be a lot of juicy stuff!\nShovel Knight Official Soundtrack\nWe already told you how awesome Jake Kaufman's music is. Hopefully you are thinking that Shovel Knight is looking pretty awesome too. Well, now you can own the combined awesome with this pressing of the Official Shovel Knight Soundtrack! Laid delicately into a bejeweled case, this CD and accompanying liner notes will be adorned lovingly with customized art. This is what you want. It\u2019s what we want! It\u2019s what we all want!!\nOfficial Shovel Knight Dirt Signed by The Yacht Club\nThis is the best product photo ever, bwahaha!\nOwn a real piece of the Shovel Knight Saga! At this reward level, we will hand-sign and deliver a handsome, wax-sealed envelope filled with Official Shovel Knight Dirt. We have obtained dirt ( at no small expense, mind you! ) from each area of Shovel Knight\u2019s Kingdom; Gearwork Dirt from the base of the Clockwork Tower, Besmirched Dirt from the Village of Plague, and more! The dirt you receive will be chosen at random, but trust us when we say that all of the dirt is very special. Get it fast, because when it runs out, it\u2019s gone. We\u2019re not made out of dirt here!\nDesign Hangouts\nNow you can take part in our design process! We will be broadcasting on a private video channel available only to our beloved Kickstarter backers! You can be a fly on the wall and listen to us as we hash out the finer details of the design and work through problems, or you can jump in and tell us what to do! There is no guarantee we will listen, but many can attest to our receptiveness to ridiculous ideas. Budding game designers, armchair directors, and trolls can all have lots of fun!\nOriginal Concept Art / Game Design Card\nSuper Design Index Cards!\nThe Yacht Club loves index cards: we use them to quickly communicate ideas! Puzzle setups, boss patterns, and sketches of new enemies; they are hastily scribbled onto cards and passed around! It\u2019s completely awesome, and it also means that by the end of a project, we have a lot of really cool index cards lying around. We are going to send you an original one of these cards! You can specify if you want a design card or an art card. Maybe you\u2019ll get the very first sketch of an enemy that's in the final game!\nYour Likeness In the Game\nAppease your ego by having us painstakingly hand-craft a pixel version of you, which will appear somewhere in Shovel Knight. Send us a photo and we will recreate you in 8-bits and immortalize you forever\u2026 but where will you appear in the game? We know where we are going to put you, but it\u2019s a secret for now!\nSuperDeluxe Canvas Poster Signed by The Yacht Club\nThis is a really super high-quality 24x36 poster, signed by the team and sent to you. Suitable for framing ( you had better frame it! ), this poster will feature the classiest art we have by the end of the project.\nDirector For A Day!!\nAs Director for a day, you will get to design a major character, boss, midboss, or scenario. We\u2019ll take you through the whole process from conception to completion, helping massage your design into the game with probably hilarious results! Check out the details below! NOTE: ( Actual implementation time may be longer than one day )\nYacht Club Sleepover!\nCome to sunny Southern California ( or if you are already here, just drive over to us ) to meet and spend the day with the Yacht Club! We\u2019ll do a studio tour, get a fancy meal (or drive-through if you don\u2019t have a collared shirt, but you can order whatever you want and we'll get like a whole extra bag of hot sauce), and then go back and play games for as long as we can stay up! Maybe we could also wear our jammies and talk about who we have a crush on! Oh, or if you would rather not, that\u2019s ok too\u2026 we\u2019ll take our cues from you I guess.\nYacht Party with the Yacht Club\nIf there is anything the Yacht Club loves as much as making games, it\u2019s partying hard to celebrate a game launch. At this reward level, you will join us in SoCal with other Yacht Club superfriends on an hours-long voyage in celebration of Shovel Knight\u2019s release! All of this is going to be on a Real Yacht on the Real Ocean, which we will be renting for the occasion ( the yacht, not the ocean ).\nListen as we regale you with tales of the game dev trenches! Stumble about as you try to get your sea legs! Sing karaoke and be merry, because tonight, my friend, we are all superstars!\nDid I mention our special musical guest Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman, who is going to play live?\nIt\u2019s gonna be epic as hell. You should totally come.\nFollow us on Facebook! If you'd like to support us, liking and sharing us would be very appreciated!\nFollow us on Twitter! We always have something dumb to say!\nWatch our YouTubes! New videos and other excitement will be posted here.\nHelp us get on Steam! We need your votes!\nLastly, if you want to reach out to us for ANYTHING, hit us up at: kickstarter@yachtclubgames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking great video games is hard. Like, really hard! Art, design, and technology have to be blended seamlessly to create a cohesive experience. On top of that, it takes time to iterate and expand on ideas. There is a reason lots of awesome games take forever to come out!\n The biggest risk is that Shovel Knight would take longer than anticipated. If production were to go late, cash would be the biggest problem. If catastrophe truly struck, our backup plan would be to pool our remaining funds and partner with venture capitalist or publisher to get the game done.

Like most movie theatre owners, we bought this theatre for our love of great films, and to provide a valuable spot for people in the community to come together, not as simply a business to run.  This passion is what has kept the theatre running for the last several years.  The studios are ceasing the production of 35mm film, phasing it out entirely by the end of 2013.  Already, it is becoming harder and harder to get our hands on a 35mm print to play.  As a small movie theatre in a small town, it is hard enough to lobby the distributors to rent us films, but now that they are producing fewer 35mm films, we are more behind the eight ball than ever.   The large theatres in the country have already converted to digital projection, but the small ones  like us, can't incur the expense of conversion, so many are turning to Kickstarter and other sources to fund this huge cash outlay. Besides, we have been stapling, taping, gluing and tying our ancient and obsolete equipment together with string to keep the projectors whirring upstairs.  Repairing them is next to impossible at this point.  The jig is up.  Village Picture Shows MUST convert to digital, or go out of business. \nThe cost of this conversion is astronomical for a such a small business.  Many theatres have found the cost of going digital is more than their entire theatre/business is actually worth.   Given that, and the little if no profits a small theatre can make, getting a loan is out of the question.  This is why Village Picture Shows, like loads of other small town theatres,  is turning to the community and its customers from out of town who understand the importance of Manchester keeping a movie theatre.\nReady for the good news?  Here it is!  This is a ONE TIME project.  Once the projectors, lamp houses, sound, computers, etc.  to run it all are installed, the theatre should be good to go and on its feet until Hollywood decides to throw us their next big idea!  Since it took over 100 years for them to come up with digital movies, we aren't that worried :)  AND with this new system, we should have a much easier time convincing the distributors to give this little town the films we want.  PLUS, we will be able to bring alternative programming to the community.  Wanna watch a big sporting event live on a  big screen with fresh popcorn?  DONE!   How about a ballet performance?  DONE!  An opera?  DONE!   We will have the opportunity to be far more creative with what we bring you!  Did we mention the INCREDIBLE picture quality and sound?  No more crackling sound, \"melting\" pictures, broken film, frustrating stops and starts...nope...all will be a thing of the past (thank goodness!).\nReaching our goal is important.  We chose Kickstarter to fund this project because the funds are only released if the target goal is achieved.  In other words, it's all or nothing, which is the position the theatre is in right now.   Any funds pledged over the target amount will be put directly into improving the theatre for the public...every penny!   We have every intention of painting, cleaning the seats, replacing the flooring, removing all gum, goo and spittle, etc..  If we achieve the target amount, this will be done with our own elbow grease, our employees working for free, any volunteers that will help and within a two to three week period after the funds are released. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risk is not raising enough to complete the project.

We are not really a candidate for the RealD program because of the expensive long term commitment and the upcharge of at least $2 per ticket (most larger chains use this).  There is a great looking and easy to use system made by Volfoni which we might be able to buy at a reasonable price.  Would be nice to own it and not be beholden to anyone for more fees.  The other decision to make is what alternative content company to go with.  We will be taking meetings in New York City to determine which we want and which we CAN get.  We are solid with our choice of projectors (the Christie Solaria One) and are about to have another evaluation of our sound situation.    Once again, with any extra funds collected, we will start in the booth and work our way down to the theatre space.  Proving that at Village Picture Shows, the trickle down theory works!

The new wave of devices such as GameStick - built on truly open platforms that bring affordable gaming to the big screen could prove the start of an interesting revolution - one which I thoroughly support and watch with interest.\"\nRomain Tisserand, CTO & Co-founder of DotEmu: 'We are very excited to bring our portfolio of games, (including Another World, R-TYPE and Raiden Legacy), to GameStick\nMAJOR UPDATE TO PRODUCT DESIGN!

Crazy.\nWe think that's because traditional games consoles and content are too expensive. So 12 months ago, we set out to challenge that by making the most affordable, open and portable TV games console ever created. At $79 GameStick offers the most affordable route to playing games on your TV.\nOpen\nThe mobile games market thrives on the use of open platforms and we wanted to bring the same ethos to TV. Open, so that more developers can innovate and develop quickly. Open, so that players can access more great games and get better pricing. Open because it's about time that the walls keeping independent developers out are smashed down. And so, harnessing the Android ecosystem, GameStick is a completely open platform. If you love creating or playing games, you will love GameStick.\nPortable\nPeople are always on the go. Traditional consoles are big. We set out to create a big screen games console that was so small you could pop it in your pocket. It's tiny! So small in fact that GameStick fits inside it's own controller so you can take all your games with you to any TV you like, anywhere. Simply plug it into the HDMI slot, grab the controller and play away.\nMark 1 Prototype Model: Stick + Controller\nGameStick Carry Case\nThe Dock is an optional, multi function accessory for GameStick - Click here for more info!\nGames\nUsing Android as the underlying operating system gives us access to all the innovation and content within the mobile, tablet and now PC world. At the last count, (we're still counting), there were 700,000 Android games in the Android ecosystem. So far we have identified 200 titles that will be great to play on GameStick but we are working with our network of over 250 developers including great studios such as Madfinger, Hutch, Disney and others to bring you the best line-up. What's really cool is that the average cost of a game on GameStick will be just a few dollars and many will be free to play.\nAndrew Eades, CEO of console and mobile game developer Relentless  Software talks about why GameStick will appeal to Indie developers.\nBut that's not all..\nWe're about driving and supporting innovation and to prove that, we are making everything we build - our tools, services and developer community available to other manufacturers. We think this will really accelerate change - a good thing for player and the industry as a whole.\nJoin the revolution\nWe want to unite gamers around the world through the most basic of human instincts - the desire to play. We all love to play and this project is about bringing the widest group of gamers possible via an open ecosystem.\nIn the US alone, we spend 250 BILLION hours a year watching TV - that's 73 days per person. We suggest it's time to stop watching and start playing.\nStatus\nWe have been developing this project for a little over a year now. We have a working prototype of the GameStick as demonstrated below. It's not as pretty right now as it will be but it's ours and it's working. We're 90% of the way to getting the final pre-production sample in our hands. GameStick works with any Bluetooth controller supporting HID including, we are delighted to say, the Greenthrottle Games controller. Our own Bluetooth controller is in the final design stage designed and is with our engineering and our manufacturing team in China for PCB development. The last thing we are looking at is the final positioning of the GameStick transport slot, which we may move to the rear of the controller - we expect the pre-production samples to be ready in 5-6 weeks.\nOur production plan is as follows:\nWe need you!\nThis is a big project. We are very lucky to be able to use our existing back-end infrastructure and developer network to get this off the ground. The investments we have made over the past few years allows us to scale up and share our innovation with the wider industry. But.... like all big projects, we need support to bring this to market in a big way. It just can't happen without you.\nOur mission is to help change an industry that is as ripe for change now as the music industry was 10 years ago. We can only do that by being bold and focused on bringing you the best games at the best prices via great products. We would really appreciate your support.\nAbout us\nWe are PlayJam - an award-winning company that for the past 3 years has strived to bring games into the living room via Smart TV. In that time, we have built the largest games network on Smart TV which to date comprises of free to play games.

One thing we have learned along the way is that it is never simple. We think we've found a great route with GameStick and have been fortunate enough to be able to use a lot of the underlying technology we have already developed to help get this project off the ground.\n\nWe've worked with some great partners from leading chip manufacturers to R&D and hardware development houses in Asia to get to this point. We have faced some significant design challenges along the way, not least in terms of packing the technology within such a small form factor but also in terms overheating issues in earlier prototypes which we have now solved through our choice of processor.\n\nWe believe we are now 80% there but we need to put the latest prototype through 3rd party rigorous testing. We also need to convince the developer community that their games belong on TV. We have some great games lined up already from some of the most successful Android developers out there but there is still more work to be done. Our energy and focus thus far has been directed at getting to working prototype and planning for launch. Going forward, we will be calling on the more than 250 developers we already work with on TV to join those that have already committed to GameStick plus anyone else as excited as we are by this opportunity.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Update.", "update_content": "Hello Backers, \nFulfilment is now in full swing with most of the units having been delivered or with various mail / courier services.

Sony does too, and they've already given us the go-ahead to put Sportsfriends on the PlayStation 3!\nWe want to take the current prototypes to completion, adding tons of different ways to play while keeping them simple at heart. Publishers aren't interested in local multiplayer-only games, so that's where you come in. We need Kickstarter funding to make this project happen.\nBack us with $15 or more, and you'll get this package of four games PLUS exclusive rewards. And you'll make it possible for us to finally bring these games to the broader public and to YOU!\n\"This is a game that people need to play.\" \u2013Ben Kuchera, The Penny Arcade Report\n\"Joust rides at the vanguard of a genre that's as old as written language, but entirely new to video game culture.\" \u2013Griffin McElroy, The Verge\nJohann Sebastian Joust is a no-graphics, digitally-enabled playground game that I designed for motion controllers like the PlayStation Move. Players try to jostle their opponents' controllers while protecting their own. How fast you can move your controller depends on the varying tempo of the music. If your controller is ever moved beyond the allowable threshold, you're out! The goal is to be the last player remaining.\nI first prototyped the game in 2011 at the Nordic Game Jam. Right after the jam, a large throng of people assembled to play the game for hours. From then on, I knew I had stumbled upon something special. Over the past year I worked on J.S. Joust on the side as I finished my PhD, showing the game at exhibitions and festivals around the world. At this year\u2019s Game Developer Choice Awards, J.S. Joust even won the Innovation Award, beating out heavy hitters like L.A. Noire and Portal 2.\nOne of the design goals behind J.S. Joust was to make a motion-control game where people look at each other, rather than at a screen. The kind of raucous experience I wanted to design was influenced by my previous work on experimental party games like B.U.T.T.O.N.\nPlaying J.S. Joust in the streets of Copenhagen (Photo by Jakob Moesgaard)\nNow I'm eager to expand and polish the game! The final version of J.S. Joust will contain a variety of new play modes, music options, and adjustable settings - for instance, Traitor Mode. In one new music mode, I want to assign a separate instrument to each player, such that their \"voice\" drops off when they're eliminated. More generally, I want to allow players to tweak the base game system in a whole bunch of ways, so that each player community can find their own preferred ruleset.\nIt turns out that J.S. Joust is a little too weird for publishers. After all, what do you do with a game that has no graphics or single-player mode? But I know the game is a blast, and I hope you'll help support a commercial release!\nReach me on Twitter: @doougle\n(Photo courtesy Official GDC flickr stream)\n\"It has that perfect mix of pixel elegance and stellar fluid motion, like watching basketball through mosaic sunglasses.\" \n\u2013Marc Weidenbaum, Disquiet\n\"... like Super Smash Bros from a superior reality.\" \n\u2013Adam Smith, Rock Paper Shotgun\nBaraBariBall is a fighting/sports game for two or four players. Players score by dunking the ball in the water on the opposing team\u2019s side but lose a point for falling into the water themselves.\nIn addition to a wide range of tactical maneuvers, players have seven air jumps, allowing for unprecedented control and ridiculously awesome aerial combat. BaraBariBall favors responsive controls, improvisation and tactics, and currently features three unique characters with a wide variety of attacks and special abilities.\nCheck out my illustrated How To Play manual.\nBaraBariBall has been featured at events such as the NYU Game Center's 2012 No Quarter, the EVO 2012 Indie Showcase, the Tokyo Game Show's Sense of Wonder Night, IndieCade's Night Games, Eurogamer's Rezzed, Juegos Rancheros, Fantastic Arcade, Wild Rumpus and many more.\nShould this Kickstarter be funded, I will continue development with an eye toward new arenas, improved animation and audio, additional game types (team battle! challenge mode! three player mode!) and further balance and playtesting.\nThe BaraBariBall team also includes Richard and Marcus Terrell, as well as Michael Fisher on tabla.\nReach me on Twitter: @getdizzzy\nSuper Pole Riders will be an enhanced, extended version of my hit pole-vaulting polo game, Pole Riders. In Pole Riders, two athletic men pole-vault into the air to try to kick a ball, suspended on a rope by a pulley, into their enemy's goal. It's a no-holds-barred sport of launching yourself off your opponent's head, kicking him off his pole, and flipping the other guy into orbit with your pole. It brings the awkward physics-based controls of my single player game QWOP to a local multiplayer battle.\nSince I shipped the original Pole Riders, we've shown it at a number of parties and events around the world. It debuted at Babycastles in New York before the web launch. It was at Prince of Arcade in Montreal, Juegos Rancheros in Austin, Wild Rumpus in London and San Francisco, among others. I've heard from a number of game developers that they play Pole Riders tournaments in their office, at places like Maxis and Harmonix. The more I watch people play Pole Riders competitively, the more I've seen how it could be developed further. Now I want to make an enhanced edition that can do things that were technically impossible in the web version.\nThe original version of Pole Riders at AOPATAD 2012\n\nFirst, I want to make the game playable by four players at once, so that each game in the Sportsfriends set can be played by a party of four. More players means more poles, which will place more strain on the physics engine, but I think a downloadable title can handle it.\nSecond, I want to have a number of arenas with more interesting geometry. In some, you'll only be able to reach the ball by vaulting into the air. In others, you'll have to work quite hard to reach the goals, which will be at the top of hills or at the exits to a greco-roman amphitheater. \nFinally, the most important addition of all: you'll be able to impale your opponent on your pole, and wave his lifeless body around as a kind of club.\nReach me on Twitter: @bfod\n\"In the sense of creating true human connection, Hokra shoots and scores.\" \u2013Jessica Conditt, Joystiq \n\"It\u2019s got all the fast-paced competitive teamwork and maneuvering of a game like NBA Jam.\" \u2013Ryan Rigney, Wired\n\nHokra is a minimalist digital sports game. A fast-paced, competitive game for two teams of two players each, Hokra features simple controls and minimal rules while retaining the depth that makes multiplayer games exciting for advanced players. Like the sports from which it draws inspiration, Hokra is engaging to both player and spectators.\nHokra has been shown at over a dozen events all over the world, from its debut at NYU\u2019s No Quarter exhibition to Babycastles, Wild Rumpus, and IndieCade 2012, where it won the Audience Choice Award.\nHokra at IndieCade 2011 (Photo by Elliot Trinidad / IndieCade)\nPeople have already had a lot of fun playing Hokra at these events, but I\u2019m still working to make the game even better. I'm currently experimenting with new arenas, including some with moving goals, walls that impede movement, and special terrain where players move slowly. I\u2019m also adding a super hectic 8-player mode. I can\u2019t wait to get the final version of Hokra into everybody\u2019s hands!\nReach me on Twitter: @RamiroCorbetta\nWith Sportsfriends, our goal is to bring people together to the same physical space to enjoy simple, spectator-friendly videogames.\n\nOnline multiplayer is great and everything, but there\u2019s nothing quite like gaming together with friends who are there with you in person, or competing in front of a cheering crowd. Think back to those games you played at the arcade, or on the playground, or on your friend\u2019s couch. Many of our favorite gaming memories come from local multiplayer games, and we want to celebrate that kind of co-located play.\nSportsfriends takes some our favorite aspects of popular sports \u2013 playful competition, performance, and spectatorship \u2013 and tries to make those elements more palatable to a broader game-loving audience. You don't have to be a sports fan or even a fan of sports games to enjoy Sportsfriends.\n\nWe want to draw attention to what's happening in front of the screen, between the human beings playing and watching.\nSportsfriends is more than your typical \"bundle\" of games. It's one tight-knit package of multiplayer games that all embrace a similar design philosophy. The four of us made our games around the same time, and we\u2019ve all influenced each other. By collaborating on one project, we hope to make something that transcends any of the individual games.\nDeveloping videogames is expensive, especially for console and for multiple platforms. Games like ours that require joypads or motion controllers make the task even trickier.\nChief among our project costs, we'll need to hire two expert multi-platform programmers to port all the games. The four of us are primarily designers, so we can't do it ourselves. We're eager to get these games out to the public, so we want to hire programmers who can help us do this efficiently.\nWe'll also need a bit of graphic design and sound design work to help tie the four games together into one cohesive, quadrathlon-tastic package.\nThe good news is, Sony likes the games enough that they'll help us a little on the back end and with marketing. But we\u2019re still far short of the funds we need to port the games and wrap them together in one package. The fact is, our four games don\u2019t look or play like most console titles. We need your help and support to get us to the finish line and to prove that, yes, people are interested in these games.\nBy self-publishing this compendium, we want to show that the gaming public does indeed care about local multiplayer; that the future of this medium concerns more than just fancy graphics, but also innovative design and replayability; that sometimes, the best games of them all are the simplest.\n\u2022  We plan to debut on PlayStation 3 (digitally via PSN) in Fall 2013, with a Mac/PC/Linux release shortly afterwards. \n\u2022  If you donate at $30, you'll get alpha versions of the games shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\n\u2022  Hokra, Super Pole Riders, and BaraBariBall require controllers, and cannot be played with a keyboard. We'll try our best to support a wide range of controllers.\n\u2022  For J.S. Joust we're investigating Sixaxis support and also Wiimote support (for the Home Computer version), but in the meantime PlayStation Move controllers and Bluetooth will be required.\n\u2022  Due to Bluetooth issues, native Windows support for J.S. Joust may not be possible. We'll look into it. Meanwhile, for you Windows users, you'll be able to boot your PC directly into a special Linux version from a standard USB thumbdrive. We'll provide full directions.\n\u2022  We hope to support additional platforms in the future, but we want to target PlayStation 3 and home computers first!\n\u2022  Right now we can only guarantee the PlayStation 3 version to the following countries: United States of America, Canada, Mexico, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom. We hope to support additional countries too - stay tuned.\nFRIEND OF SPORTSFRIENDS\nAll backers receive a set of special high-res (digital) Sportsfriends wallpapers - perfect for your desktop background! Illustrated by Nils Deneken:\nRELEASE COPY\nEverything above, PLUS a copy of Sportsfriends when it's all finished! \nSee \"Release Plans\" above for technical specifications, platforms, applicable countries, and release schedule.\nAll RELEASE COPY backers (no matter which version you choose) will also receive a copy of Jan Willem Nijman's unreleased tennis game, TENNNES.\nMuch like Hokra and BaraBariBall, TENNNES is a minimalist sports game commissioned by the NYU Game Center's No Quarter exhibition. It features sound by Eirik Suhrke (of Spelunky and Super Crate Box fame). JW has graciously agreed to donate an exclusive copy of the game in support of our Kickstarter campaign.\nSure, there are already lots of tennis videogames out there, but none of them feel quite as good as TENNNES. JW, co-founder of Dutch game studio Vlambeer and one of the minds behind Super Crate Box, excels at designing game systems that feel \"juicy\" and are tweaked to perfection. TENNNES is no exception. Stripped down to the bare essentials, TENNNES captures the elegance of tennis, yet is fun even if you aren't a tennis fan.\n(Note: Windows only; requires Xbox 360 controllers)\nEARLY ALPHAS\nIn addition to everything above, EARLY ALPHAS backers will receive current alpha versions of the games. Start playing now, before we're even done! The alpha versions aren't thoroughly tested, but we've shown them at many events around the world, and they're already super fun. Here's some more info about each alpha:\nJohann Sebastian Joust alpha\n\u2022    Expected delivery date: mid December\n\u2022    Requirements: Mac only (OSX 10.5 or above), Bluetooth, two or more PS Move controllers\nHokra alpha\n\u2022    Expected delivery date: early December\n\u2022    Requirements: Windows only, two or more Xbox 360 controllers\nBaraBariBall alpha\n\u2022    Expected delivery date: January\n\u2022    Requirements: Windows only, two or more gamepads\nSUPER SPORTSFRIENDS\nUPDATE:\nAt this tier we're also throwing in five unreleased local multiplayer games (for PC/Mac), donated by some of our favorite indie designers.\nMore info here.\n---------------\nIn addition to everything above, backers at the SUPER SPORTSFRIENDS level will receive three additional unreleased games/prototypes:\nQWOPFRIENDS by Bennett Foddy - race your friends in a game of precision QWOP using dual analogue sticks. Hop, skip and jump your way to victory across three events. Based on the highly popular QWOP for iOS. Requirements: for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Requires Xbox 360 controllers.\nMiracle Adventures in 2113 by Noah Sasso -- an experimental action game with one foot in the bullet hell/shmup tradition. Players alter the trajectory of bullets using a mouse-controlled magnet, and attempt to dodge the inevitable chaos that ensues. Requirements: for Windows and Mac. Supports both Xbox 360 controller and mouse/keyboard.\nBoss Battle (working title) by Ramiro Corbetta - a local multiplayer shmup boss fight in which the boss is controlled by a human player. A game for 2 to 4 players. Requirements: for Windows only. Requires Xbox 360 controllers.\nBackers at this level will also receive access to an exclusive series of podcasts that we'll produce throughout the development process. The four of us will go in-depth on the design process, explaining how we balance the games and what new features we're playtesting.\nSPORTSFRIENDS FOREVER\nIn addition to everything above, backers at the SPORTSFRIENDS FOREVER level will receive a stylish t-shirt. Wear your Sportsfriendship proudly, for the whole world to see!\n(Update: we've posted the t-shirt designs here)\nBackers at this level will also get their name into the game credits. Show your support and become a part of Sportsfriends history!\n7-PLAYER J.S. JOUST KIT\nEverything above, PLUS we'll mail you seven brand new Move controllers, and you'll be able to put them to use with your early alpha build.\n(Photo via Wiley Wiggins)\nFor each controller, we'll also include a special controller \"charm\" - a decorative memento to clasp onto the wrist strap.\nUPDATE: More info here.\nMEGA-GIRP DELUXE\nEverything in the SPORTSFRIENDS FOREVER tier and above, PLUS we'll send you everything you need to run Bennett's and Doug's popular Mega-GIRP, a game installation exhibited at galleries and parties around the world and at venues like GDC's Experimental Gameplay Session.\nMega-GIRP is a game played on four modified dance pads. It takes Bennett's award-nominated web game, GIRP, and transforms it for public events and spectators, combining the game's cheeky physics system with physical, performative play. Read more about it here.\nThis package includes four Xbox 360 dance pads specially modified by us, a USB hub, and an exclusive full-screen build of GIRP.\n(Note: United States of America only)\n18-PLAYER J.S. JOUST KIT\nThe Bluetooth hardware spec only allows up to seven controllers. That's why the normal version of J.S. Joust supports 2 to 7 players.\nBut in early 2012, Doug, together with psmoveapi wizard Thomas Perl, prototyped a special 18+ player version of J.S. Joust by networking together three MacBook Pros. Doug also modified the design of the game to include a special \"traitor\" feature. It's kind of like J.S. Joust with a strong dose of the famous parlor game Mafia.\nDoug has since exhibited this special version of the game at several public events, including a raucous showing at PAX 2012. Ben Kuchera of Penny Arcade Report chronicled the event in this in-depth account. \nBackers at this tier will receive everything in the SPORTSFRIENDS FOREVER tier and above, PLUS we'll ship you 18 Move controllers, a full set of 18 controller charms (see above), three charging stations, a wireless router, and the specially prepared J.S.

Get On Top pits two players head-to-head in a contest to see who can dump their opponent's avatar on the ground. Thanks to a set of gyroscopes attached to the trampolines, you make your avatar jump by jumping on the trampoline yourself! Players also hold a Move controller, which they use to control their avatar's arms.\nWe recently exhibited the game in public at GameCity, at the Venus Patrol Training Facility. Suffice to say, it was a big success!\nWe'll ship you everything you need to run the game, including two specially prepared trampolines, the game controllers, and an exclusive build of Get On Top. A wildly fun installation for public events!\n(Note: ULTIMATE TRAMPOLINE PACKAGE United States of America only)\nDouglas Wilson is a Lead Game Designer and Partner at Die Gute Fabrik, a small games studio based in Copenhagen, Denmark and New York City.
