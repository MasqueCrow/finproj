[{"backer": "Thomas Luu", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Dearest Friends, \nI can\u2019t believe I am writing this letter. It\u2019s been a long time coming, and I am finally embarking on the journey of recording a full-length album! I have the songs, the stories, and the vision, and I\u2019m more than ready to create a cohesive project that I hope you will love. \nAll of my music projects so far have been self-funded (except for the single \u201cRestore,\u201d which was funded here on Kickstarter). I love songwriting so much, and have worked double-time to make it happen. In an ideal world, I would fund this record completely on my own as well, and would try to make the money back over time. Through my experiences over the past few years, I have learned that it is sometimes better to ask for help. A record label would usually give an artist a lot of funding to do a project like this. So, as a completely independent artist, I\u2019m here to ask if you all will be my record label to help get this music into the studio and into your ears! While I will still be investing my own finances into this project, I am more excited about the prospect of having you alongside me. By asking those of you who will enjoy and listen to this music to consider backing this project up front, I am able to break through barriers to make this record the best it can be. Plus, I can only imagine how much fun it will be to write you more letters while this album is coming to life.  \nThese past five years have been full of inspiration, which ironically seems to happen during times that are both challenging and full of growth. The songs I have written tell stories about life, love, faith, breakups, loss, making commitments, growing up, marriage, the list goes on. I have a title and a full vision that has been in process for months (watch the video above to hear more)! \nThe 10 new songs will be a combination of both the electropop and folk sides of my music, with some fresh inspiration too. Here is a quick snapshot of where the budget for this record will go: \nphoto by Erin Tetterton, hair/make-up by Rachel Lane\nAnything that we raise above the goal amount for this campaign will go directly to the making of this project!! (See below for info on the STRETCH GOAL!) \nThis is an all or nothing campaign, which means that if we do not raise at least $15,000 by Sunday, March 24 then no funds will be raised, and I\u2019ll have to cancel my studio time. If and when we do meet this goal, each backer will be charged only once for the amount that you pledge on the day that the campaign closes. My current goal is to finish recording the album this spring/summer and start releasing singles late summer 2019, with the full album releasing by the end of the year. There will be so many exciting steps in the process of creating this record, and I would love to be able to share this passion and dream of mine with you while it\u2019s happening! \nI have compiled some exciting incentives which are listed on the side bar next to a $ pledge amount. These include (but are not limited to) VINYL records, a gorgeous hand-lettered lyric poster, your name being included in the album liner-notes, a digital book of original poetry, handwritten lyrics and special backstories about the songs and creation of the album, a Rorie tote bag, personal Skype-hang outs and songwriting sessions, House Concerts, and even the actual clock used in the music video for my song \u201cClimate\u201d (see photo): \nphoto by Open Valve Studios\nSTRETCH GOAL: $20,000\nWhile the minimum goal is $15,000, raising $20,000 would be HUGE in helping to push this album to be the best it can be. Here\u2019s a quick snapshot of how the project will expand if we reach this Stretch Goal: \n-additional possibilities for Music Videos (I plan to film at least one, but this would help to solidify the budget for that video, as resources will be tight to make that happen)\n-Publicity for an album can be very expensive, and with some extra funding I will be able to promote the album in ways that will reach more listeners, which goes a long way toward making a musician\u2019s career more sustainable \n-opens up Touring possibilities once the record is released (!!!). I would absolutely love to get on the road and play these songs for you live!\n--\nSo, now is the time where I take a deep breath and launch this campaign, inviting you in to make this album a reality. Thank you thank you thank you in advance, from the bottom of my heart. Let\u2019s make a record together!!!!\nWith Love, \nP.S. \u2013 If you\u2019ve never heard my music before, here are a few links to check out: \nStoryteller Music Video (and lots more!) on YouTube\nListen to the Dawn EP (and more) on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am completely organized and ready to record and release this album. The main risk lies in the \u201call-or-nothing\u201d nature of the Kickstarter platform. If we do not reach the $15,000 goal in 30 Days, then no one\u2019s card will be charged, and no funds will be raised. \n\nThis urgency, however, provides the opportunity for something exciting to happen. No amount is too small. $10 is essentially \u201cpre-ordering\u201d the album. Thank you in advance for your support!!! \n\nI will thoroughly update backers about the status of the project along the way, so you\u2019ll know what to expect!

My name is Kitty. I'm 22 years old, I'm a singer/rapper/producer and I've always been really into doing things all by myself. \nI've accomplished a lot of crazy things this way, but this time I have a project so big that the time has come to ask for a little help getting started: my first full-length, self-released record- which will also be my first project to ever be released physically!!!\nWhen my first music video \"Okay Cupid\" went ~viral~ in 2012, I was living in Daytona Beach, Florida selling little girls' accessories at the mall to put myself through college. Thanks to the unexpected success of a bunch of songs I recorded in my closet, I was able to move to New York City and continue to pursue a music career I'd always dreamed of but never in a million years thought I would achieve. Since then, I've self-released four solo EPs, a bunch of music videos, some mixtapes, and more singles than I can even recall. I've had the opportunity to tour and collaborate with artists I've looked up to for years- Danny Brown, Riff Raff, The Ready Set, Anamanaguchi, Sufjan Stevens, Ryan Hemsworth, LE1F and more. All of these things have been made possible without a label, most of them without an artist manager, and a lot of them without knowing what the hell I'm doing at all, but I feel like the luckiest girl in the world. \nI know how rare these opportunities are, and I want to use them to make the world a little more glittery.\nHowever, there's always been that one little thing I haven't been able to do on my own, and it's the one thing I've truly been working for since the beginning; I want to finally create a REAL album. I want it to sound perfect. I want to record it in a studio. I want to listen to it on vinyl, and send CDs of it to my grandma to play in her zumba class. I want to be able to perfectly represent it artistically, with visuals that will bring to life the world I've imagined for all these years. I want to take it on tour and sing it for the world. I want to share it with everyone I possibly can, without a label or a company or a man at a desk telling me my ideas \"don't fit\" and giving me a sweetened-up lecture on why they can't take a chance on me unless I quit making the art I believe in and start being a little more \"marketable\". \nThis record has been in the works for a couple years and it tells a story of growing up in a tropical tourist trap and wandering around the country. I've written everything myself, and I'm collaborating with some of my favorite artists to create sounds that set my stories in the fun, beautiful world I've dreamed up around it. This funding will provide professional studio time, mixing and mastering, and a budget for visuals. It will also go towards production and distribution of CDs and 12\" vinyl records, and to finally support a member of Team Kitty who has worked tirelessly with me on every single project for absolutely no pay. I plan on releasing the record in January of 2016. \nNew rewards and more info about the record will be added to this page over the course of the fundraiser- I can't wait to share my art & ideas with you!!!!!!!! \u2570( \uff65 \u15dc \uff65 )\u256f\nI f**kng love every single person who has supported me and my music up until this point, and I hope you all believe in this project as much as I do. Here's a photo of my dog, Little Puff, who has heard every song thousands of times and promises they're all really good. \n\"It's a great record\"\n Header photograph by Shelby Sells\nGOAL 1: $25,000 - RECORD\n(WHICH WE DID IN THE FIRST 30 Hrs!!!!)\nGOAL 2: $50,000 - TOUR!!!!!\nSo if we reach this goal, I'll be able to pay for transportation, support, merch, stage setup, all that jazz- for my first REAL HEADLINING TOUR~\nThis has been another dream of mine since I started, but I didn't want to get ahead of myself with things. Now that I've seen what you guys can do and how much faith you have in me, I hope you're here for this!!!\nalso i'll be able to play a show in europe for the first time which is like....omfg afdls;kjas;dflkj", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince I've done all this stuff before on a smaller, no-budget scale, I've pretty much faced every challenge there is when it comes to making and releasing a record. The only setbacks I can imagine are delays in production of the record (not likely- I run a pretty tight ship when it comes to scheduling) and delays in production of videos. The good news is, I already have a solid plan for all this stuff, and since I'm already working on everything, I expect smooth sailing once this Kickstarter is off the ground.
