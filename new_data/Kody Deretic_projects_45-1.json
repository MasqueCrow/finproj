Yet how do we perceive them? Are we even conscious of it? For a type designer, letters are something they consider every day. Their relationship to letterforms is intimate and complex.\nKris Sowersby of Klim Type Foundry lives such a life. He is one of the world\u2019s most celebrated type designers.\nThe book Kris Sowersby: The Art of Letters examines Sowersby\u2019s letter drawing practice while considering the characters as independent works of art, exploring their interconnections of function and style. It celebrates the absurd beauty involved in creating multiple expressions of predetermined alphabets through nuance and theory. \nWhile a typeface is a well considered set of many elements, if one removes the context of language systems and alphabets, each character may be viewed as a singular abstract drawing. A type designer spends their days drawing these characters, one at a time, as black form on white ground. Through this practice they become immersed in the relationships of form and the minutiae involved in every drawing of every letter.\nAs Sowersby has expressed, \u201cThere is no definitive form of the alphabet. The alphabet is a concept made concrete through countless written and designed letterforms; the alphabet is not defined by a single typeface but expressed through all of them. There\u2019s sets of rules, largely unwritten rules, of how a typeface is put together, about relationships between letterforms and between styles. It\u2019s a balance between a hard system and flexibility.\u201d\nIf we look at letters individually, and repetitively, what do we see? Most people don\u2019t see a typeface when reading words, yet we learn early on what letters look like, and we can recognise them across multiple styles. When looking at the output of Kris Sowersby, different letterforms perfected day after day, the characters become art in their own right, allowing us to re-see, or to see for the first time, their individual form and beauty. \nThe Book\nKris Sowersby: The Art of Letters will feature 750 large character illustrations selected from Klim typefaces including Calibre, Domaine, Founders Grotesk, Heldane, National, Signifier, S\u00f6hne and Untitled. Printed one per page in powerful black on white, the drawings provide a visceral insight into the life of a type designer.\nThe book will be designed by Mark Gowing and published by Formist Editions. It will feature an introduction by Gowing and a critical essay by Paul McNeil, graphic designer, writer and educator. A detailed catalogue of Klim fonts will provide typographic context for the out of context letter illustrations. Sowersby and Gowing are collaborating on a custom typeface that will be used to typeset the book.\nAbout Kris Sowersby\nDirector of the Klim Type Foundry, Kris Sowersby is one of the world\u2019s most celebrated type designers.

Instead of adding to this stigma by focusing on big scary statisics and confronting stories, we are using smiles as our vehicle to shed light on this very important aspect of life.\n\nWe are doing this by using humour to break down barriers and inspiration to drive change.\n\nThe book consists of jokes, quotes, art and things to try all designed to make you smile, laugh, or feel just good. To make this book even more special, every joke and quote is accompanied by a custom artwork by a different artist.\n\nWHY THE BIG FUSS?\nThere is a serious need not only in Australia, but all around the world for improved awareness and education on mental health. \nHere is a snapshot of the impact that mental illness has in Australia:\nProvided by Black Dog Institute\n\nWHY SMILES?\nWe believe that a smile is the most simple and pure form of positive mental health.\nWhen we smile we bring ourselves into the present. We are appreciating the little moments of joy that we face in day to day life. \n\nIt is proven that when you smile (even a forced smile) it makes you feel happier, as well as being highly contagious. If you dont believe me try to watch this video without smiling!\nPLAY\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to believe that the more we can salute the little moments of joy in our lives with a smile, the happier we will be.\n\nTHE ORIGIN\nHi! My name is Hugh, how do you do?\nI am a 26 and I live in Torquay, Vic.\n\nPocket Smiles comes from a love of learning about mental health which can be traced back to one single event 5 years ago. I was coward punched in the head while at a friends party on the Gold Coast, I fell back and hit my head again on the concrete resulting in a brain injury.\n\nThe hit had many ongoing consequences. All of the scars have healed though it was my mental health that took the biggest hit in the form of depression and anxiety. I still frequently have to manage my anxiety, from severe panic attacks to everyday stressors.\n\nMy recovery took a lot longer than it should have which was all due to me not knowing enough about how to manage my mental health. Mental health was not a topic of conversation in my life and I knew very little about it. I decided to dedicate myself to learning, and applying my findings. \n\nThe idea of Pocket Smiles came from wanting to create something that welcomes people  to the topic of mental health.\n\nAddressing mental health can be very daunting because there is so much information out there, it is hard to know where to begin. We\u2019re hoping that this book will help people to learn, address, and discuss mental health in a fun way.\n\nWHERE WE ARE AT:\nThis project started early November 2018.

We talk about how certain memories remain in our brains forever, and how ultimately you have the ability to shape your home and create a place of belonging wherever you go.\nWe learn that home is much more than a physical structure. It\u2019s about comfort and safety, a place where your true self can shine. Houses can come and go, but your home moves with you.\n\ninterview with musician Sarah Pasillas of Antonioni\nwritten by Megan Sexton\nwritten by Artemie Li\nOUR JOURNEY\nIssue #1 was fully funded on Kickstarter and since releasing the issue in November 2018 we\u2019ve been blown away by the seemingly endless support and kind words from our growing audience. We are super proud of our first issue, which was originally a school project primarily aimed at learning more about typography and layout. However, we were clearly on to something and it caught on, becoming so much more than we ever could have imagined. It\u2019s now found all over the world.\nWith issue #2, we are hoping for an even larger reach. We\u2019ve tried out new things, met new people, and we\u2019re ready to share these new amazing pieces with you.\nSo why another campaign you ask? Because printing and shipping is expensive (70% of our budget!), and Kickstarter helps us secure funds in advance while we grow organically with your support. In addition to production costs, we\u2019ve also made a commitment to have the money necessary to pay our contributors for their time and talent. Because we are currently ad-free, we rely entirely on our readers\u2019 support, and we find kickstarter to be a fun and safe way to gather the necessary funds.\nBy supporting this Kickstarter, you\u2019ll be putting us in a better position to keep making and releasing issues, to keep growing our readership by printing more copies, and ultimately to make Dear Lois a sustainable project. The more issues we create and the more readers we gain, the more opportunities we have for grants and sponsorships in the future.\nillustrated by Blobs Feeling Things\nwritten by Josephine Edmondson and Lauren Gallow\nwritten by Olivia Driggs\nWHY PRINT\nThere is a lot of great work online, and we hope to add to that space sometime in the future. However, we strongly value the idea of sitting with the work within Dear Lois for as long as you need. You can take it with you wherever you go, or you can keep it on your bookshelf until you need to revisit it later on. While Dear Lois isn\u2019t considered a self-help publication, we understand certain articles will impact different people at different times. Consider it a friend you can call on when you need someone.\nwritten by Divya Das\nwritten and photographed by Jessica Bose\nwritten and illustrated by Olya Tsikhanchuk\nREWARDS\n$5 \u2014 thank you card\n$10 \u2014 4x6in postcard set\n$25 \u2014 copy of issue #2\n$33 \u2014 issue #2 + enamel pin\n$35 \u2014 issue #2 + postcard set\n$45 \u2014 BFF bundle \u2014 2 copies of issue #2\n$45 \u2014 issue #1 + #2 bundle\n$55 \u2014 issue #2 + screen print t-shirt\n$75 \u2014 everything bundle \u2014 issue #2, enamel pin, postcard set, screen print t-shirt\n$100 \u2014 bulk order for stockists and schools \u2014 10 copies of Issue #2\n$140 \u2014 BFF everything bundle\n$500 \u2014 the generous patron \u2014 issue 2, all rewards + name in printed magazine\n$1000 \u2014 the ultra generous patron \u2014 issue 2, all rewards + company name in printed magazine and online\n$3000 \u2014 Dear Lois partner \u2014 issue 2, all rewards + company feature in printed magazine and online\nissue #2 enamel pin\nissue #1 enamel pin\npostcard collection\nscreen printed t-shirt\nCREDITS + THANK YOUS\nAs always, projects like this take a village, and Dear Lois issue #2 is no exception. \nOur sincerest thank you to all our contributors:\nArtemie Li, Adrienne Oliver, Alejandra Macouzet, Amy Huber, Anna Nguyen, Bonnie Alderfer, Breeze Pollard, Dayna Behrens, Divya Das, Ella Lama, Ellen C.

Truly couldn\u2019t do any of this without you.\nAnd finally, our deepest thanks goes to our Grandmother Lois, the magazine's namesake. Dear Lois is our way of sharing our desire to connect all generations of women together and to pay tribute to one the strongest ladies who ever existed. She was also one of the most talented crafters we will ever meet, and we can't think of a better way to spend our creative energy than by producing this magazine for years to come.\n\nABOUT US\nDear Lois grew a little bigger this time around, and now it's 100% a sister dream team. Mariah Behrens is a graphic designer, illustrator, and toy maker, insistent on always finding ways to empower young people. Hannah Behrens joined the team and has been an incredible second eye throughout the process of building issue #2. Hannah is a fitness guru with all the knowledge on oils, acupuncture and self-care you could ever need. \nread more on our IG: @dearlois_mag", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is always a chance this could not succeed.

Not everything is about you.\n\nREAL FRIENDS EXPANSION\nFor those less concerned with boundaries.\nThe Real Friends Expansion is for those less concerned with boundaries and contains 50 cards that were deemed potentially too offensive or confronting for the first edition. To give you an idea, this is the sort of thing that you\u2019re in for:\nOUR STORY\nLook, we've got a bit of a story but it doesn\u2019t really matter, right? The whole point of this game is to tell your stories, not ours.\nHonestly, we\u2019ve found that the best part of this game is not the questions on the cards, it\u2019s the stories that come out when your friends respond. \nWe are all weird, now it\u2019s time to share.\n\nPROOF THAT IT's REAL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTwo little mice fell into a bucket of cream.

He's currently on the trail of a missing person, and is helping out Mouse, who has woken up in a bit of a bad way - bandaged, with a foggy memory and general feeling that stuff has gone pear shaped.\nThe creators\nPhantales is illustrated by Ry Wilkin and written by Stefan Delatovic. The characters have been rattling around in Ry's head for a decade. They've since set up shop in Stefan's as well.\nRy is an illustrator and animator of renown. Here's proof.\nStefan ... also exists.

So clear some space and put away the antiques, because you\u2019ve never played a card game quite like this before.\nSince we created Exploding Kittens four years ago, we've been making games that bring friends and family together around a table, away from their screens. We brought this game to Kickstarter because we believe that adding a bit of physicality to game night is what comes next.\nSo, if you're into the idea of party games and weaponized Mexican food, please help us make this game a reality.

Over the next eight months, we worked closely with Brian to tune the game, design the cards, and destroy most of the fragile items in our homes.\nThe game went through many versions.\nFirst, there was the \"Mangoes with Animal Heads Phase\":\nMango Pug\nThen came the flying animal ideas: \nThen fruit: \nThen so many Mexican food ideas:\nAfter finally choosing a name, Matt got to work on the cards: \nCharacter Exploration\nStyle Exploration\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community. We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo if a world full of weaponized Mexican food is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \nWith love and mad strafing skills,\n- The Exploding Kittens Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge for our team is building the throwables.

But throwables are a new challenge.

We are Echo Room, an art project and music label founded by the friends and family of Fergus Miller (aka Bored Nothing, Wedding Ring Bells, and one half of Revenge Surgery, Pansy). \nAs some may know, Fergus tragically lost his battle with depression in 2016. He left behind a huge and prolific back-catalogue of music. Some of it has already been released on vinyl (Bored Nothing - Bored Nothing and Some Songs), but the majority was only released digitally through Bandcamp, or not at all. One of the aims of our label is to immortalise Ferg's work in a format that people can treasure. Wedding Ring Bells is our favourite project of Ferg's outside of Bored Nothing, so we've chosen that as our first physical release, but we're hoping to release his full back catalogue slowly, over time. \nOur funding goal is based on a run of 150 records, pressed at Zenith in Melbourne, which will go into production once funding completes, in March. If demand exceeds this, we'll increase the run to compensate - so everyone who orders a record during the Kickstarter will get one in May. The limited edition pink swirl vinyl will be capped at 50 records (otherwise it wouldn't be limited!).\nWe also have Ferg's original artwork and CD-R covers from his Wedding Ring Bells period - we're turning these into stickers and high quality art prints. A very limited number of his CD-R covers is also available for those who are looking for a little something extra to remember Ferg by.\nAny money we make over our funding goal with go towards funding future releases of Ferg's music through Echo Room. 50% of this will go towards SupportAct, a charity dedicated to supporting arists with mental illness.\n\nback cover\nSticker pack", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk with pressing vinyl is issues in the initial acetate creation phase - this is when the initial \"master\" record is made, which all the other pressings will be copies of. If the test pressings come back with issues (clicks, pops, skips, distortion) the factory will need to cut a new acetate. This takes about a week per revision, and multiple revisions may be required until we get it just right. This means the pressing may be delayed by up to a month. \n\nWe'll be giving you regular updates on how it's all going, so you'll know straight away if we need to request a new test pressing, and how long it should take.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "A big thanks from Echo Room!", "descp": "No rewards at this level, but you will have our unending thanks.

A few months later I'm happy to say I've finished a 40-page full-colour book all about Finnish culture, food, romance, and Moomins!\nThe goal of this project is to fund the print costs to help bring this colourful book to life. I feel like this is my best piece of personal work to date. Every page has been traditionally inked and painted in watercolours (you can even get your hands on the originals as one of the rewards!) and I'm very happy with the book as a whole.\nHere are a few pages from the book about Finnish Sauna culture! \n I also found a new affinity for one of Finland's best known exports: Moomins and their creator Tove Jansson.\n But as well as culture, art, and food I also liked to write about the more quiet, human moments I had there.\n Rewards\nThe Back Catalogue! \nBackers of reward #4 will receive the three previous Modern Slorance books: Torts and Tinder, The Berlin Issue, and The Canada Issue.\nLimited Edition Signed Print \nBackers of rewards #3, #4, and #5 will receive this A5 limited edition signed print.\nOriginal Page \nBackers of reward #5 will receive an original page from the book! Original pages are drawn in ink and painted in watercolours on A4 watercolour paper.  \nStretch Goals!\nIf the project reaches \u00a32000 every physical backer will receive this postcard set! \nThanks for looking!

Your focus, accuracy, and patience will be put to the ultimate test as you cleanse the world from its curse. Defeat legions of foes with your spells, upgrade your skills, unlock new abilities to fit your playstyle and delve into the mysterious past of the island of Az'kalar.\nOnly light must prevail, will you stand up to the challenge?\nWhat can you expect?\nAn Immersive universe with meticulously hand-crafted 2D graphics and animations\nA well-optimized game running smoothly at 60 FPS\nDifferent difficulty settings allowing everyone to enjoy the game regardless of their skill or patience\n2D hand-painted cinematics \nAn original blend between genres!\nA spiritual sequel\nThe universe and concept of Inlight are based on \"Towaga\", a conceptual mobile game we released 2 years ago. Inlight could be seen as the spiritual successor of Towaga, but the games are way different in many aspects. In short, Towaga was the first sketch while Inlight is the final product.\nThe whole game is revolving around a wave-system progression and dynamic world shifting. You must resist, advance and slay the creatures on your path to journey through Metnal's nightmares and defeat him, thus revealing what happened to the island.\nIn order to achieve such task, you've been gifted three spells. Casting them will cost you mana, so make sure you don't abuse it. \nTHE BRIGHT BEAM: Your basic spell, cast it by moving the joystick to slay foes around you.\nTHE HALO BURST: Your last hope to save you from tight situations. Upgrade this spell and add various effects to it as you progress.\nTHE BRIGHT BLAST: The ultimate spell for crowd control. Upgrade and customize it as you see fit.\n(Note: playable with PS4, Xbox, Switch Controller or Mouse)\nWorld shifting\nYour journey will take you to ancient shrines and ruins via a dynamic world shifting system.\nInlight's story takes place on the island of Az'kalar, fallen prey to the scourge of the endless night. In the middle of the day the sky suddenly turned black, and creatures from the abyss poured into the realm of the living, wreaking havoc everywhere they set foot following the orders of their master, Metnal the Voidmonger.\nAz'kalar's inhabitants were no match for the swarming terror Metnal had unleashed, and soon only two survivors remained. Hidden beyond the Voidmonger's reach, Chim\u00f9 and his mentor Kurro devise a plan to stop the evil god's hordes and bring the light back on the island.\nContent (masks, Outfits, Items...)\nWe aim at creating a world filled with mysteries, ancient legends, and odd relics. A plethora of artifacts, outfits and codex entries are to be discovered throughout your adventure.\nOUTFITS & SPELLS:\nCODEX OF ITEMS:\n2D cinematics\nAnimated cutscenes give life to the island and reveal the nebulous past of Az'kalar (spoiler-free example below)\nMusic previews\nInlight's music combines orchestral and electronic influences, giving a fresh twist to old-school game audio while maintaining a deep, mysterious atmosphere. To match the action of the game, the music follows your actions, dynamically evolving throughout your run.\nWhy we need funding\nWith Inlight we will offer you the best game experience we can create. But working on it in our spare time, as we are now, is impending our capacity to bring the game to the next level and make it a truly great game.\nWith your support, we'll be able to speed up the development, hire a new programmer, and dramatically enhance the experience.\nMoney surely helps, but if you're interested to see Inlight brought to life and can't afford to contribute to this campaign don't hesitate to share, post, and speak to your friends about our game.

Thank you all so much for your support! :D\nIf you have missed the campaign, worry not! The game will come to Steam Early Access and itch.io next year. In order to keep track of the game, bookmark our homepage or follow us on Facebook, Discord or YouTube.\nIntro\nBuild, manage and grow a thriving colony, discover new lands, craft legendary weapons and defeat your enemies. Kubifaktorium will feature different biomes to explore, plenty of resources to exploit, complex machinery to build and interesting production chains to master!\nDemo\nYou can download a free demo including the first tutorial mission on itch.io. Note: The demo includes only the very first mission and does not include any of the advanced automation and transportation features, biomes, the world map etc. which the full game will include.\nKey Features\nColony Building and Management\nAt the heart of your colony are your loyal colonists who mine resources, farm crops and craft tools and weapons. Each colonist has a different set of skills which evolves over time. Managing your colonists' needs and abilities is vital to ensure your colony's survival and prosperity.\nPLAY\n\nIn the course of the campaign, you can grow your colony by recruiting or liberating castaway colonists. You can also tame and train some of the wild animals which can then perform simple tasks in exchange for a bit of food. :)   \nAutomation\nWhile your colonists are very hard-working, their time is sadly limited. Fortunately, your colonists know how to craft advanced machinery which allows you to automate more and more of your production.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nLogistics and Transportation\nAs your colony grows and your production hums along, transporting the resources you need becomes a bottleneck. Fortunately, Kubifaktorium features a number of different transportation systems.\nThe first transport system in Kubifaktorium is the zeppelin transport system. While zeppelins can only carry one good at a time, their low setup cost makes them an effective long-range method of transportation. Since they do not require a complex setup, they are the best choice when it comes to connecting distant areas like mining colonies.\nPLAY\n\nWhen a large quantity of goods needs to be transported over a long distance, trains are the way to go. Every train can carry multiple goods at a time, which is a great improvement over the zeppelin system.\nConveyor belts are used to connect depots, factories and refineries within a colony. They are easy to set up and can transport a high volume of goods. Overhead conveyors transport items above ground, which makes them a solid choice for dense late-game factory areas.\nPLAY\n\nAutomated depots, inserters and sorting machines are there to help you store and manage all of your goods.\nExplore different biomes\nIn the course of the campaign you explore and colonize multiple islands and encounter different biomes. Each biome features new enemies and challenges as well as new resources to discover, mine and process.\nPLAY\n\nThe first three biomes are the grassland, the desert and the ashen world. More biomes will be announced and added in the future. Each biome will feature dynamic weather and environment effects.\nPLAY\n\nWeapon Crafting, Enemies and Combat\nThe islands you settle on are inhabited and guarded by mighty enemies and you need mighty weaponry to defeat them. The game will feature multiple weapon types, multiple tiers for each weapon (wooden, iron, steel etc.) and random properties for each crafted weapon (common, good, legendary etc.).\nKubifaktorium is an economy/transport simulation game at heart. As such, your success in combat depends on how well you do at equipping and training your colonists.\nMod Support\nThe game is designed to be very mod friendly and will allow players to create anything from new goods and industries to total conversions with new terrains and scenery.\nThings you can add via modding include:\nNew items, weapons and other products.\nNew buildings.\nNew colonist models, animals and enemies.\nNew terrain types and biomes.\nNew map modifiers (e.g. terrain generation tweaks).\nNew dioramas (for the main menu).\nModifications of existing assets (e.g. balance changes).\nNew languages / localizations.\nPLAY\n\nWhen Kubifaktorium comes to Steam, you will be able to easily publish and manage your mods via the Steam Workshop.\nPLAY\n\nWindows, Mac and Linux support\nThe game will be released for Windows, Mac and Linux. The current build of the game has been tested on Linux and Windows and I will make sure to maintain compatibility throughout development. In fact, I am developing primarily under Linux, so I can pretty much guarantee that it will work. :)\nDevelopment Progress and Roadmap\nCurrent State\nKubifaktorium has been in development for approximately one year now. The following table shows an estimation of how much progress I've made so far. The base game, which consists of things like the world generation and the main gameplay (mining, building, crafting and managing) already works quite well. Several advanced mechanics like trains depots are also already implemented. On the other hand, balancing, testing and the creation of higher tier content are still far from being finished.\nCurrent State of Kubifaktorium.\nTl;dr: The first tier (colony building, basic production) is quite playable at this point. The rest (automation, transport systems, other biomes etc.) is buggy or unfinished and can currently only be accessed via the cheat menu.\nRoadmap\nThe roadmap for Kubifaktorium consists of four phases. The Pre-Alpha phase, which contained the development of the base game so far, will conclude soon.\nDevelopment Phases. Important: The dates in this table are estimates.\nAlpha phase: After this Kickstarter campaign ends, I will focus on three things: First, I will remove all the major bugs that surface. Second, I will improve the game's accessibility and UI based on the feedback I get from you. Finally, I will implement more game mechanics (like the world map/campaign) and add more content in general. This phase will conclude when all the major gameplay systems are implemented and sort of working.\nEarly Access / beta phase: In this phase I will implement the remaining planned content, work on features like modding support and polish the game in general. This phase will conclude when the game is ready to be published.\nRelease / post-release: After the game's release I will continue to support the game and add some smaller tweaks in bonus content patches, as I did in BossConstructor, my previous game.\nImportant: Please note that the dates in the table are estimates. I value quality over a fixed schedule. So when it turns out that I need more time to finish a phase or a feature I want to have in the game, I will take it. (Please also have a look at the risks section below.)\n\nDemo\nYou can download a free demo including the first tutorial mission here on itch.io: https://kubifaktorium.itch.io/kubifaktorium\nNote: The demo includes only the very first mission and does not include any of the advanced automation and transportation features, biomes, the world map etc. which the full game will include.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nMy intention for making a Kickstarter campaign for Kubifaktorium is twofold.\nFirst of all: The 12.500\u20ac goal of this campaign is obviously not enough to fund the development of Kubifaktorium. The game's development is primarily funded via the revenue from my previous game BossConstructor as well as the money and time I invest myself. Raising money allows me to invest more time in making the game, to pay freelancers and contractors as well as to pay license fees and other expenses.\nBudget Plan.\nMy second goal for this campaign is to build a great community for Kubifaktorium early on. I want to get players involved in Kubifaktorium and let them play and test the game as soon as possible. As an indie developer I do not have the testing and QA resources many larger studios have. Therefore player feedback is a very valuable resource for me to improve the game. With a bug reporting tool, discussion boards, surveys and regular updates I will provide multiple ways of making this process as engaging, frictionless and effective as possible.\nWhat you can expect during development\nA constant stream of regular game updates which fix bugs, add new features and polish the game. (BossConstructor got over 150 patches in the two years of its Early Access phase.)\nMonthly progress report videos in which I present, what I've been working on lately.\nDiscussion boards / forums in which you can discuss the game and share your ideas.\nAn in-game bug reporting tool which allows you to report errors with very little effort.\nSurveys in which you can vote on features, the development priorities and more.\nMy Background\nMirko Seithe\nI am a 36 year old indie game developer living in Bonn, Germany. I have a professional background in computer science and made a Dr. in economics. For the last ~10 years I've been developing indie games in my free time. My first published game was BossConstructor, a 2D simulation / action game in which you build your own spaceship and fly it through alien space. BossConstructor entered Early Access in 2014 and was successfully released in late 2016. Since then I've been working on Kubifaktorium.\nI have grown up playing and loving complex strategy and simulation games like Civilization, Battle Isle, The Settlers and Transport Tycoon. More recently I have enjoyed hundreds of hours of Factorio, Gnomoria, Prison Architect and Into the Breach. What these games have in common is that they enable their players to build and watch complex and interesting systems, which have always fascinated me. It's a human thing I guess. :)\nOther contributors\nWhenever possible and feasible I use freelancers to share the workload and improve the quality of the game. When developing BossConstructor, I've used freelancers to contribute graphics, writing, translation services, marketing and more. So even though I do most of the work, at the end of the day many people rightfully earn their place on the credits page.\nRewards\n5\u20ac or more: Name an animal or a monster in the game!\nName an animal or a monster in the game!\u00b9\nYou can choose the type of animal / monster you want to name. The name you choose will then be added to a pool of names for that animal / monster type.\nWhen an animal or monster is spawned in the game, its name is randomly drawn from this pool.\nThe name should fit the theme and style of the game as well as the animal / monster type you choose.\n\u00b9: Names will be reviewed before they are added to the game. I reserve the right to refuse name submissions which are offensive or otherwise inappropriate.\n\n15\u20ac or more: Get the game & your name in the credits!\nYou will receive a Steam code for the game when it enters Early Access on Steam. This includes all future updates / patches of the game.\nYou will receive a Steam code for Kubifaktorium after the campaign ends.\nThe code can be redeemed (i.e. added to your Steam account) immediately. You can play the game once it enters Early Access in early 2019. \nYou will automatically receive all future updates and patches for the game.\nThe game will be released for Windows, Mac and Linux.\nIf you happen to experience problems running the game on your system, I offer a money-back-guarantee.\nYour name will (optionally) appear in the thank you section of the game's credits screen.\nThis tier does not include access to the closed alpha stage.\n\n25\u20ac or more: Access to the closed alpha!\nIn addition to the Steam code, you get access to the closed alpha stage, which will begin shortly after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\nIn addition to the Steam key for the Early Access phase, you receive an itch.io key to play the game during the closed alpha stage.\nThe closed alpha stage will begin shortly after this campaign ends. \n60\u20ac or more: Receive an in-game pet!\nAs a bonus for your awesome contribution you receive an in-game miniature pet. You can choose one of several pets which will follow your settlers around.\nIn every game you can create one miniature pet of your choice.\nThe pet is a smaller version of an existing animal or monster. Or colonist, maybe. :)\nThe pet moves around and might, at a later point in development, interact with your colonists.\nIt does not have any tangible game-play effect and is purely aesthetic.\nVery cute. :)\n\n100\u20ac or more: Become a colonist!\nName and customize (color & style) a colonist in the game!\u00b9 The colonist you create will show up in other players' games.\nAlso, I will send you a signed Kubifaktorium postcard. :)\nYou can choose the style of the colonist from a set of presets and choose a name. The name/style combination you choose will then be added to the colonist pool.\nWhen a colonist is spawned in the game, his/her name/style combination is randomly drawn from this pool.\nThe name should fit the theme and style of the game. xxMonsterSlayer2000xx is not appropriate, for example. :)\n\u00b9: Names will be reviewed before they are added to the game.

Awesome! I can help you realise your game while you help me realise mine. :)\nI invite you (and optionally a friend) to visit for a three-day game jam weekend where we turn your idea into a small working prototype.\nBefore the weekend we 'meet' via video chat to discuss your game idea and decide on a date for the game jam weekend.\nIn the course of the game jam weekend we develop a small but working prototype based on your idea in Unity/C#. You might be surprised at what one can accomplish in 3 days! :)\nAll the rights to your idea and the prototype we develop belong to you. Feel free to continue working on or even publishing it at some point.\nYou will likely get the most value out of the weekend if you have some prior experience in working with Unity/C#.\nThe place for the game jam is in my office here in Bonn, Germany. Travel expenses and accommodation are not included.\n\nStretch Goals\nStretch goals are additional game features which will be added when the total funding amount crosses a threshold.\nTrade caravans will occasionally visit your island, allowing you to trade your surplus goods for something nice. \nI will add a few more weather effects like storms, droughts and snow to the different biomes.\nWhen the stretch goal of 25.000\u20ac is reached, I will add a 5th biome. This includes a new tileset and a few biome specific animals or enemies. \nMore stretch goals will be added as the campaign proceeds. There are many cool things on my list which I'll announce when the funding goal is reached.\n\n\nFrequent Asked Questions\nSo, is the game playable?\nThe colony building and basic production are quite playable at this point. Features like automation, transport systems, other biomes etc. are still in development and can currently only be accessed via the cheat menu. Until the closed alpha begins in September, I will focus on improving accessibility and making the closed alpha launch as smooth as possible.\nWhat can I expect during the closed alpha?\nI pride myself in being very consistent in my development process. In effect, you can expect about 2-3 game patches per week in the beginning (when there are a lot of issues to fix) and about 1-2 per week later on. I will produce progress report videos to showcase new features and keep you up-to-date on the game's progress. If you are interested, I also invite you to participate by report bugs, discussing the game or voting in polls.\nHow will I get the game?\nYou will get a Steam key to activate the game when it comes to Early Access. Steam can be downloaded for free and is available on all major operating systems. I use Steam because it is the most popular platform and allows me to manage and distribute new game patches with relatively little effort.\nWhy are you using itch.io for the closed alpha?\nValve/Steam are restrictive when it comes to delivering content before it is for sale on their store. Itch.io is more flexible in this regard.\nWill there be a DRM-free version?\nSteam by itself is just a distribution platform, not DRM. I'm not going to use DRM systems like Denuvo and such.\nWill there be an alternative to Steam?\nYes, as an alternative to Steam I will provide keys for itch.io. You will be able to choose at the end of the campaign.\nDo I need a powerful PC to play the game?\nCurrently the game runs at a solid 60fps on max settings/full HD on my mid-tier laptop. You will not need a very powerful machine to run the game and can fine tune the graphics if you need to speed it up.\nPLAY\n\nWhat engine / tools are you using?\nThe game is being developed in Unity, currently 2018.2.0.f1. The voxel models are made in MagicaVoxel. Most graphics are done in Krita. Git is used for version control and zim for documentation. I am primarily using Arch-Linux for developing the game.\nBut... isn't Unity laggy?\nIn my experience it is not. Unity is a very beginner-friendly environment and attracts many beginner-level developers, who make poorly optimized games. When used properly, Unity can be very fast. Games like Cities: Skylines are powered by Unity and hardly known to be laggy. In addition, the Entity Component System will be released soon, which might work really well for games with many distributed systems like Kubifaktorium.\nAre you sure it will run on Linux / MacOS?\nActually, I am developing largely on Linux, so yeah. :) I test on both on Linux and Windows regularly. MacOS should also work, as it is a standard build target for Unity, but I have no working Mac to test it at the moment.\nWill it be released for Android / IPhone / Consoles?\nTechnically it would probably not be very hard to do. However, making the game fun to play on phones or consoles would require a lot of redesign. Playing a game on a smartphone while waiting for a train is very different from chilling in front of a computer, so an experience which works in one scenario might not be so fun on the other. In summary, it is not planned at this point. If ports for other platforms come, they will happen at the end or after the development of the PC / Mac / Linux versions.\nWhy do you have expenses for programming etc. when you work on the game (mostly) by yourself?\nWhile many other project creators treat their time as if it were free, I value and include my own time as a cost factor. Doing so is a matter of taste but I think this is the more prudent way of accounting a project.\nAre you sure you can finish the game?\nThe current state is quite playable and everything you can see in the videos above is real gameplay footage. You can download and play a demo including the first tutorial mission on itch.io: https://kubifaktorium.itch.io/kubifaktorium\nI have a clear roadmap ahead of me and I've already implemented the most-likely-to-fail parts like cross-platform-compatibility, the job and AI systems, serialization and more. In addition, I'm a pretty simple guy. I just enjoy spending my time grinding away on the game and having a good time, which results in a very smooth, steady and drama-less stream of progress. :)\nHow can I learn more about Kubifaktorium?\nI post most of my content on Facebook (https://facebook.com/kubifaktorium) or my development blog (http://kubifaktorium.com). My videos are all on YouTube (http://youtube.com/bossconstructor).\nI am a journalist / streamer / YouTuber. Can I stream the game?\nYes, you can create content based on the itch.io demo. This includes monetized content. If you create something cool, I might feature or share it. :)\nHow expensive will the game be outside Kickstarter?\nAm I getting a good deal? The game will be around 25 USD or 25 EUR, depending on region and applicable VAT. So, for the base game tier you are getting the game for less money & you are getting your rightful place in the game's credits section. When backing at a higher level you get to play the game before it goes into Early Access, which is at least half a year later.\nShould I back the project?\nSure! Thanks for asking! :) If you are unsure, please consider pledging 1 Euro in order to keep track of the game and receive updates. Also, please have a look at the demo on itch.io.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1) The main risk for every game development project is that it cannot be completed on budget or on time. Technical problems, for example, are often hard to foresee and can easily delay development by a significant amount of time. Many development studios run out of money or energy at this point and everybody involved has a bad time.\n\nTo help you gauge this risk, please consider the following three points: First, the base game, from which all trailer footage is taken, is already working. While still being far from finished, I have already implemented the most tricky parts like the job system, navigation, the transportation system and serialization. Second, I have a successful track record of starting, making and finishing a video game with BossConstructor. I have experienced problems which surface when deploying and finishing a game and know how to solve them. Third, I have sufficient backup funding which allows me to finish the game even in the case of a significant delay. \n\n2) The game's design is not final in any shape or form. If a feature does not turn out to be fun, I will remove it. For me, creating a lean and fun game is more important than checking off a todo list. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that all of the roadmap features will be included in the final game. If a feature that is relevant for your decision to back the game does not make it into the game, I offer you a full money-back-guarantee. \n\n3) Finally, there are always accidents and life's unavoidable tragedies to keep in mind. I work on the game mostly by myself, which has pros and cons in this regard. While the risk of a development team falling apart is nonexistent, the game's development depends on me being able to work on it. \n\nIf I were to become unable to work on Kubifaktorium for some reason, I would do everything I can to either pass the project on to another development team or to ensure that you get your funding money back.\n\nThank you for reading and considering. :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Thank you for your support! :)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Prime Supporter!", "descp": "Name an animal or a monster in the game!\u00b9\nINCLUDES:\nName an animal/monster.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Get the Game + Your Name in the Credits!", "descp": "Choose between a Steam or itch.io key for the game when it enters Early Access in early 2019.

Work with Frank at the local construction shop to finish off the final touches and get your shop running.\nAid Frank and Mayor Wilson in building up the town. Collect resources and coin to commission new buildings, each bringing unique Upgrades, Shops, Quests and more!\nTo build up the town you need coins, what better way to earn those then by running a shop! Explore the islands and its caves to collect everything from flowers to poop to sell in your shop. \nNo matter who you are, a farmer, an explorer, a warrior, there is more to do on these islands than you'll have time for.\nRelax in this role-playing game that doesn't limit your play style. Create your perfect simulation, whether you want to spend your days farming, exploring, questing or fighting.\nLet us walk you through some of the many features you will find in this game.\nStart off at your grandparents farm, but don't stop there. There are many islands nearby for you to explore from the tops of waterfalls to the depths of caves.\n\nNot only that, take a boat to new islands, but be sure to have the right gear. Stay warm in the treacherous snowy peaks with earmuffs, or protect yourself from the desert sands with goggles.\nWith each area that you explore there are new items to find, collect, sell and even wear. Around every corner there is a chance to find hidden treasure, so you'll want to explore every chance you get.\nBut don't go too far, the townsfolk will need your help as they ask you to complete quests while aiding them on rebuilding their town, especially when a natural disaster strikes.\nOnce the mining camp is built, ask for the help of the miners to clear up the rubble and open new mining caves. Don't worry, there won't be any spirits here, only geodes and treasure.\nYou don't have to go alone on this new adventure, invite up to three friends to join. From shopkeeping to taming and exploring, everything is better with friends.\nAs the server host you can open your home to friends that will fully be able to interact in your world. Host a public or private server to play with old friends or make new ones.\n\nDon't want them to touch your stuff? Lock your chests and assign individual permissions as you (the host) see fit.\nFound a flower or rock you think your customers will love? Open your shop between 12:00 and 18:00 and watch the money roll in. \nUpgrade your shop from a small single table stand to a large extravagant showstopper. Personalize your shop with mannequins to show off your accessories and hats for sale. Or hang paintings on the walls to allure customers into paying more. \n\nRun your shop your way.\nThe land is not without its terrors. There is a local mine that has been boarded up since the townsfolk have heard tales of an evil necromancer raising the dead. With your help the townsfolk have a chance to put these once peaceful creatures back to their resting place.\nExplore dungeons that seem to change every time you visit with new corridors and rooms to explore. There are many levels to the dungeon and the deeper you go the more perilous your journey but the more rewards you can find.\nThese dungeons will be the only place to find ancient artifacts to sell in your shop for profit or donate to the museum for fame.\nTired of selling boring sticks and stones? Use your crafting skills to create works of art fit for a king. Make sure to upgrade your tools and equipment to unlock new recipes and blueprints.\n\nUse wood and stone to create anything from from boxes, tables and chairs to mannequins, walls, and boats. Unlock these expert level blueprints by improving your skill over time.\n\nThe crafting doesn't limit you there, craft 250+ items to either sell in your shop, use for quests or place around your home. \n\nThere are many crafting stations to work from including; a cooking station, carpenters table, alchemy station, and more. The more you use a station and enhance that skill the more you will unlock new recipes for your profession and earn more coin along the way.\nDig up your seeds with flowers and vegetables in the wild or talk to Sammy the Seed Seller to purchase new seeds. Use your hoe to till the soil so it's soft enough to plant a seed.\nOnce planted, make sure to water it every day until your plant is fully grown. After a couple of days, reap your rewards, and harvest the flowers and veggies to sell in your shop or craft into new items.\nThere is water everywhere! So it's no surprise that the villagers on these islands like to fish. Whether it's dawn or dusk there is a large variety of fish to catch off the shores or in the lakes. Use different bait to have a higher chance of catching rare fish.\nLearn how to catch your first fish from a local that gives you his trusty fishing rod. With your rod and bait in hand, relax and lose track of time while fishing on the coast of these beautiful islands.\n What farm is complete without animals? From Chicks to Pigs and Hippos there are many lovable creatures for you to befriend, tame and raise on your land.\nTalk to Frank about building your first Chicken Coop. Once it's built, with the help of the locals, learn how to raise Chicks to Chickens. \nFrom here use and expand your skills to tame any animal you see across the islands. Learn how to befriend the animals with their favorite foods, from a carrot to a horse and honey to a bear, there is a unique strategy to taming any creature.\nOnce an animal is your companion, explore the world together, some animals will even help you find treasure, carry items and some are even mountable. Reach new heights and explore new areas with your animal pals.\nChoose between a bear, bunny, fox or a cat, (with more characters to come), and personalize each one to fit your unique style through skins, accessories, unique gliders and more. Unlock new character items through questing, treasure hunting, dungeon diving and crafting.\nBeautify your farm and shop by placing decorations and furniture to show off to your friends. Keep on the lookout for items with magical properties that can enhance your strength, stamina and more.\nDue to popular demand, we've added add-ons! \nTo add the items listed above, simply pledge to the tier you would like and add the price to your pledge. You may purchase more than 1 additional copy, you may also mix and match.\nIf you have already pledged then click \"Manage Your Pledge\" (or here) and then in \"Change your pledge\" and add the corresponding amount to your pledge without changing your tier.\nWhen the Kickstarter is done, we will contact you and verify which copies you would like (Switch or Steam).\nBitten Toast Games is a game studio based in British Columbia, Canada. As a studio we've been making games for the past 3 years with titles like \"What The Box?\" released recently on the Xbox One and \"Rocket Fist\"  which was released last year on the Nintendo Switch.\nOur team members are:\nDaniel Snd: Lead Programmer / Technical Artist.\nKristina Vandale: Game and Level Developer.\nThiago Adamo: Music and Sound Design.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe game started as something my partner and I wanted to play, but it grew into so much more as we started to share it with other people.\nEven in its early stages without optimization it resonated really well with our friends. That's when we decided to focus on this game and open it up to a larger community.\nWe're hoping to have the support of a community of players to give feedback and help this game reach its full potential. While Kickstarter will help on the financial side, the community aspect is even more important to us.\nOur past games included the community but were limited by our reach, we only had a small social media platform stretching across twitter, twitch and facebook. With the help of kickstarter we hope to involve the community more in the development of garden paws.\nWe are maintaining a Discord server and love to hear any and all feedback from the community.\nCurrent State\nWe began developing this game mid-2018 and has been in a playable state for a little while now. (Some twitch and youtube videos are up with the help of our closed alpha testers.)\nWith our current build we are ready to receive more players for a closed alpha once Kickstarter concludes.\nThe game currently has 20+ hours of questing, but the gameplay itself is endless. We plan on adding many more quests in the future but this isn't the focus of the game.\nWe want to create a game that you can play with your friends and participate in mini-games or explore the world and fight PVE battles. While there will be an extensive quest-line in the final game. This is only one of our many features of Garden Paws.\nAbout the Developers  \nWe started the creation of Garden Paws because we love this genre and wanted to make something we could play together online. Combining multiple game elements we love, we came up with Garden Paws. A game where you run your shop, explore beautiful islands, dive into dungeons to fight evil spirits, and all of this will be multiplayer. \nWe really enjoy bringing Garden Paws and its world to life and definitely won't stop until it has every feature we want to play in the game. \nWe have decided to launch the game as an early access release that we can keep working on because there is so much that we want to add. It's current state has 20+ hours of questing and endless game play, but we plan on having even more quests and features. \nWith the help and support of the Kickstarter community we know we can make a great game together.\nBudget Breakdown", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're 100% focused on Garden Paws, we not only want to create this game for ourselves but for the community that has shown so much excitement about the project.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bittentoast/garden-paws-relaxing-multiplayer-rpg-simulation/edit?ref=pbuild_dashboard#the-story\n\nWhile this is our first Kickstarter we have absolutely no hesitations in releasing this game. We have released 5 games in the past and we have no doubt we will be able to release this game as well. While this is more than we usually take on we already have a full playable game with 20+ hours of content that we can send out but we want to make the game more complete before releasing.\n\nWith this being a game we have never created before, our biggest challenge is creating something that is tailored towards the community. While we have individually played hundreds of hours of this style of game it is always beneficial hearing what the players want.\n\nWe hope Kickstarter will open us up to this audience.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 2 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Every donation is appreciated!

Porting such a large \"heavy\" game to the Switch requires lots of optimization which we have been focusing on. We have gotten the game but it requires more as everything the player builds adds to the process and memory.

In issue #1, we saw him lost far from home. Armed with only his bravery and his cunning, he faced challenges familiar to anyone who has ever read through Homer\u2019s Odyssey.\n\nIn issue #2, Odie has been reunited with the family that he loves, and is embarking on their annual lake-side vacation. Unfortunately for Odie, that also means Kujo, his newly adopted brother, will be coming along for the ride. Odie will have to cope with his jealousy over being forced to share the family with another dog and work together with some strange new friends in order to track down a legendary prey.\nEssentially, Odie is a foil for re-imagining classic literature in a new and fun light! This first story of Issue #2 will deal with Odie's relationship to Kujo while mirroring the tale of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. As a bonus, there's a short story highlighting Odie's deteriorating mind while homaging Kafka's Metamorphosis.\nThe comic is twenty-four full color pages by our talented artists, and features a thank-you page for all of the Kickstarter contributors in the back.\nDigital and physical editions of Odie #1 and Odie #2 will be available as part of this campaign. These comics are staple-bound, and printed in a gorgeous, high-quality gloss by Ka-Blam.\nIn addition to the standard cover, this comic is also available in a limited edition variant cover printed on blue paper, with a foundation of white ink used to create a contrast between glossy and matte elements. This cover will be exclusive to the Kickstarter campaign, so don't miss your chance to snag one!\nJust like last time, Elli will be taking requests for the sketch cover edition of the comic! If you select this reward tier, be sure to let us know what sort of illustration you'd like. Here are a few of the covers that she did for Odie #1:\nIf you didn't have the chance to get one of our 5\" x7\" Odie sticker sheets in the last Kickstarter, they're back, featuring four glossy indoor stickers of everyone's favorite pup. In addition to that, we'll have four unique 1\" button designs available in a set!\nElli and Mikael have whipped up a fantastic 11\"x17\" art print of the entire cast of issue #2, decked out in some pirate garb.\nAnd last but not least, if you want to see yourself thrust into this world and drawn by our wonderful artists, you can make a cameo! You, or a character that you own, will be seen lounging on the shoreline in at least one panel. Of course, we do ask that you be reasonable with the appearance of yourself or your character, and we retain the right to refuse things that wouldn't fit within the setting. However, as long as you don't ask us to make you a Deceptacon, everything should be fine.\nEvery project needs stretch goals!

Nordstrom.\nLook closely at some of the world\u2019s most respected brands, and you\u2019ll see the hand and vision of Jennifer Morla, a multidisciplinary designer known for her ability to inform and surprise via extraordinary print, branding, packaging, web, and retail store design. An AIGA Medalist and recipient of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian National Design Award, Morla is internationally celebrated for solutions that are cerebral yet spirited, eclectic yet tight, and for a sharp approach to storytelling that results in narratives\u2014and designs\u2014with real staying power.\nFor its second publication, Letterform Archive is thrilled to present Morla : Design. A dynamic and essential monograph that spans Jennifer Morla's 40-year career, this book offers a glimpse into her creative process and personal design philosophy, and shares the backstory behind more than 150 worthy projects, including fine art as well as client work.\nGathered in an innovative print package that is nothing short of astounding\u2014featuring fluorescent and metallic inks throughout, a vegan leather case, two neon bookmark ribbons and colored page edging, two paper stocks (one matt art and one vellum with white ink), and a choice of an edition with a debossed cover or one with an embossed vacuum-form cover and a clamshell box\u2014Morla : Design is an art object in its own right. And with your backing, we can make it a reality.\nThe Book\nA tome of award-winning graphics, Morla : Design celebrates the design thinking of one of our brightest contemporary creatives. With a preface by Paula Scher and foreword by Erik Spiekermann, the book is a lively, cleverly paced collection of branding projects, stories, advice, and typographic wisdom, resulting in an inspirational reference guide that belongs in the personal collection of anyone who loves good design.\n158 projects in branding, print, animation, packaging, furniture, and retail store design\u2014plus examples of her fine art\u2014give a generous overview of Morla's career.\n16 Designisms printed in white ink on vellum punctuate the book, sharing Morla's guiding principles and providing teachable moments.\n20 personal stories reveal the experiences, artists, and design influencers that helped shape Morla's unique perspective, as well as her thoughts on the differences between design and fine art, the value of the quick sketch, how she learned to embrace happy accidents, the importance of diversity in advertising, and much more. (You'll also hear all about that one time she commissioned work from Andy Warhol.)\n26 features on type close the book, offering a graphic display of Morla\u2019s favorite typefaces\u2014and her thoughts on why they get it done every time.\nThe Cover\nBackers of Morla : Design have a choice between two distinct yet cleverly connected cover treatments: an embossed vacuum-form or a debossed vegan leather cover, both featuring the flip side of the same design. Titled \"Mitosis,\" the cover pattern emulates the biological division of a single egg into two daughter cells\u2014an homage to Morla's two daughters, to whom the book is dedicated.\nFor the deluxe edition, Morla experimented with this pattern in three dimensions using vacuum-formed polycarbonate, raising its system of interlocking dots to 2/5 inch in height to create a sophisticated yet otherworldly effect. \nTogether, the two covers present an optical treat, as their surfaces can trick the eye and appear to invert.\nSpecifications \nHardcover \n10 by 10 by 2 1/4 inches\nPrinted in 8 colors throughout: \nCMYK with stochastic screening + 3 fluorescent inks + 1 metallic ink\n432 total pages (400 matt art + 32 vellum)\n2 fluorescent bookmark ribbons \nFluorescent page edging\nThe regular edition features a debossed case wrapped in soft, sophisticated vegan leather. \nThe deluxe edition features an innovative vacuum-formed front cover fit over a vegan leather case, all protected by a debossed clamshell box. \nBackstory \nAs a nonprofit center for inspiration, education, and community, Letterform Archive is proud to announce the donation of more than 100 books, posters, and branding pieces designed by Jennifer Morla. Housed in our collection of 40,000+ graphic design and typography samples gathered across the history of written language, Morla\u2019s work makes for a wholly modern and exhilarating addition to our library.\nMorla : Design is a commemoration of this generous gift. It is the followup to our wildly successful first book, W. A. Dwiggins: A Life in Design, which contributions from our community brought to life in November 2017.\nImaged with raking light and a 100-megapixel Phase One camera in our on-site photography studio, the original artwork in Morla : Design is of the highest possible reproduction quality. Thanks to stochastic printing, the book's images will come across with near continuous tone and a greater range of color than that produced by conventional printing methods.\nWhile Jennifer Morla and Letterform Archive have already heavily invested in the development of Morla : Design, your support will help us cover printing and distribution costs. \nPraise \nFrom Paula Scher's preface: \u201cThere are designers who identify the culture of the period and adapt it to their own personal vision. They are the ones who transcend time but remain of the moment. There is no better example of this than Jennifer Morla, which this book clearly demonstrates.\u201d\nFrom Erik Spiekermann's foreword: \u201cGreat ideas beautifully visualized: that is Jennifer\u2019s work in a nutshell. Her work displays an intellectual curiosity expressed in sensual, exciting type and images.\u201d\nFrom Rob Forbes, founder of Design Within Reach: \"I surmise that most designer monographs end up as anonymous bookshelf space holders. Maybe the lucky ones become reference books in studios and libraries. But Jennifer Morla\u2019s book will also serve as a formidable coffee table book. It is artful, elegant, provocative, lively, smart: quintessentially modern. You can open it up randomly to any page and find some compelling visual narrative or message. Morla\u2019s work is impossible to reduce to a style or formula as it encompasses numerous media and industries. Both fashionable and classic, this book will have a great shelf life, wherever it ends up.\"\nFrom Tiffany Shlain, Emmy-nominated filmmaker and founder of the Webby Awards: \"Jennifer Morla's creativity is bold and brilliant. Seeing the body of her work (so far) presented in such a stunning book is truly a gift to the senses.\"\nAdditional Rewards\nA reusable tote lets you carry a bit of Morla : Design around wherever you go. This lightweight and ecofriendly bag from popular retailer Baggu features Morla\u2019s \u201cMitosis\u201d pattern in neon green and slate blue. It folds up from 25 1/2 by 15 1/2 inches at full size into a 5-by-5-inch pouch. It\u2019s durable, too, holding up to 50 pounds.\nA 100-percent silk scarf makes for a vivid yet delicate memento of this beautiful book. A 30-by-30-inch square with a rolled edge, it features a neon green and slate blue version of Morla\u2019s \u201cMitosis\u201d design.\nA pair of pick-your-own ABC posters will look lovely as a monogrammed set in any room. Each 24-by-16-inch gicl\u00e9e poster is printed on acid-free matt archival paper with archival inks and signed and numbered by the artist. See the full set here. (If you choose this premium, you'll receive a survey to confirm your poster selection at the close of the campaign.)\nYour choice of two posters: Morla's design for beloved San Francisco manufacturer Public Bikes, or her vivid yet sophisticated print for the Mexican Museum. Both 36-by-24-inch gicl\u00e9e posters are printed on acid-free matt archival paper with archival inks, and are signed and numbered by the artist.

In this book, girls are encouraged to view their body as an incredible instrument that allows them to do, see and feel. The concept of self-love is introduced and practical self-care tips are included to build resilience and emotional intelligence.\nThis book was written for every girl, regardless of whether or not they are exhibiting signs of negative body image. We are living in an incredibly visual world and unfortunately it\u2019s becoming increasingly hard for girls to escape internalising the pressure of perfection. Prevention is key: Every girl deserves to be taught about self-love and self-acceptance.\nLearning to Love Your Body encourages girls to do more and see more through empowering illustrations that show girls exploring, creating and embracing who they are.\nThe powerful illustrations by Carol Rossetti show truly diverse characters celebrating their different bodies. So-called \u2018imperfections\u2019 (such as stretch marks, pimples and cellulite) are shown in order to normalise characteristics which, though completely natural, are not usually portrayed in children\u2019s books or popular media.\n10 self-care suggestions that you can put up in your child's room to act as a visual reminder to practice self-care. Also looks cute in an adults room too!\n    \u201cNegative body image, in my opinion, is one of the greatest barriers preventing women and girls from fully engaging in life and reaching their full potential. Since discovering body positivity, I have regularly thought about what a difference it would have made if I had been exposed to these important concepts of self-love, self-care and self-acceptance as a young girl. I see Learning to Love Your Body as an exciting opportunity to deliver a valuable resource to empower girls.\u201d\nJessica Sanders - Author & Founder\nBody image is the perception that a person has of their physical self and the thoughts and feelings that result from that perception. Body image can have serious implications for people\u2019s emotional and physical well-being, and is a crucial part of adolescent development. Research links body dissatisfaction with critical mental health problems, including eating disorders, low self-esteem and depression.\nChildren, Teens, Media, and Body Image Report. Common Sense Media 2015\nBody positivity is accepting, respecting and loving your body as it is.\n In a recent study, 50% of five-year-old girls showed signs of aspiring to the \u2018thin ideal\u2019. It\u2019s most common for girls to develop eating disorders between the ages of eight and 13, when their bodies are growing and changing during adolescence. Learning to Love Your Body was designed to prepare girls for these external changes before they happen and to reassure them during the process.\nLearning to Love Your Body has been written so that children younger than eight should be able to navigate the book if assisted by a parent or teacher. Each of the characters in the book are shown before and after puberty. In this way a girl can see the physical changes on a range of diverse bodies and appreciate that these changes look different on everyone.\nParents should be aware of the subliminal messages reaching their children through movies, television shows and other forms media. A study of top children's movies reported that \"72% associated thinness with positive character traits such as kindness, and three out of four videos equated obesity with undesirable qualities\u201d*. Children are being sent the damaging message that thinness equals a good person and fatness a bad person. Exposure to more explicit representations of unattainable beauty will dramatically increase when a girl becomes active on social media. Girls spend on average six hours per day on social media. Girls who spend the most time on social media are five times more likely to say they feel sad or depressed almost everyday.\n*Children, Teens, Media, and Body Image Report. Common Sense Media 2015\nEating disorders are serious mental illnesses; they are not a lifestyle choice or a diet gone \u2018too far\u2019. Eating disorders are estimated to affect approximately 9% of the Australian population and the rate is increasing. In the United States it is estimated that almost 1.3 million adolescent girls have anorexia, a disorder that has one of the highest suicide rates of any psychiatric condition. \nResearch has shown that when a girl views her body as an instrument that performs important functions she is more likely to accept and appreciate her body. In a recent study, a direct correlation was found between women who appreciated the functionality of their bodies and positive experiences such as intuitive eating, self-compassion and believing in a broad conceptualisation of beauty, resulting in a higher overall life satisfaction.\nIn pursuing this project I have sought to be as resourceful as possible. I have loaned equipment and studios from my university, employed students to assist with the filming and editing, and designed the Kickstarter, website, and social media presence myself. In areas that I am not skilled however \u2013 such as book design and Illustration \u2013 I have had to employ professionals, for the quality of the design and illustrations is critical to the book\u2019s message. The vast majority of the money raised in the Kickstarter campaign will go towards paying for this resource.\u201d\n'Re-shape\u2019 is a social enterprise dedicated to empowering girls to love their body and themselves. When a girl feels more confident in her body she will be more assertive, perform better physically and academically, and she will say \u2018yes\u2019 to more opportunities. We intend to approach our goal through the use of a holistic approach. Our very first project, Learning to Love Your Body utilises the power of preventative education. The profits from this project will fund \u2018re-shape\u2019s\u2019 future endeavours.\nAustralia \nSupport for eating disorders and body image concerns.\n1800 33 4673 8am-12am AEST, 7 days a week (except national public holidays)\nwww.thebutterflyfoundation.org.au\nUnited States \nThe National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA)\nHelpline (800) 931-2237 Monday-Thursday from 9AM to 9PM ET, and Friday from 9AM to 5PM ET.\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline\nUnited Kingdom \nBeat Eating Disorder\nAdult Helpline: 0808 801 0677 Studentline: 0808 801 0811 Youthline: 0808 801 0711 Every day of the year 3pm-10pm.\nhttps://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/support-services/helplines/one-to-one\nCanada \nNEDIC\nHelpline: Toll FREE 1-866-633-4220 Toronto 416-340-4156 opens Mon 9am EST\nhttp://nedic.ca/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk is low as my parents run a publishing company called Educate2Empower, and so consequently I have access to the resources and expertise to get this book Published.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "THE SELF-CARE POSTER", "descp": "Receive the self-care poster!

Wanderer Level for $250 or more. Ponderer Level for $60 or more. Wonderer Level for $25 or more. For privacy reasons, everyone will be consulted whether they want to be listed or not.\nUPDATE #1: The first 50 backers of the Further Over Yawnder campaign will be entered in a draw to win a limited edition print of Ever Wondered (Where Yawns Go)? This print is exclusively available through this campaign only.\nWelcome to the campaign! This is your chance to get yourself a limited 1st edition copy of the Where Yawns Go II: Further Over Yawnder picture book featuring the work of artist, Jay Dart. \nThe second book in the Where Yawns Go series, Further Over Yawnder, is set to be released. This is the follow up to the acclaimed first book, Wanderer of Yawnder, self-published in 2013. The books introduce younger audiences to concepts surrounding what it\u2019s like to be an artist, or a creator of any kind. Where do ideas come from? How does one find their own unique voice? What is it like to share your creations with the world? While the subject matter is enlightening for even the youngest of readers, there are plenty of conundrums for older audiences to ponder as well.\nEach of the 300 copies in this 1st edition of Further Over Yawnder (FoY) will be signed, doodled on and numbered by the artist. There are also lots of beauty rewards to be had in this campaign including the Field Guide to Yawnder, a 2nd edition copy of Wanderer of Yawnder (the first book in the series), exclusive prints, custom commissions, original drawings, bookmarks, postcards and eBooks!\nFurther Over Yawnder is the follow up to part I, Wanderer of Yawnder (WoY), which I self-published in 2013 with the support of a successful online fundraising campaign. Since the limited edition of WoY sold out awhile ago, funds from this campaign will also go towards beginning to print a 2nd edition of that book here too. This series is suitable for audiences of all ages. Lots of magical, mystical fun and conundrums! \nFurther Over Yawnder \u2013 cover concept (work in progress)\nABOUT THE NEW BOOK\nFurther Over Yawnder will be 8.25\" x 8.25\", full-colour, hardcover book with 32 beauty pages featuring 20 high quality reproductions of my original watercolour and graphite drawings, and a story by Jiggs, my alter ego (more on him later). The cover will be case bound on 140 gsm FSC stock and the inside pages will be printed on 115 gsm FSC paper (the sustainable stuff). The 1st edition of Further Over Yawnder will be limited to 300 copies.\nThis part of the saga continues to follow Jiggs as he seeks to find the mystical nature of inspiration, innovative creation, and meaningful communication. As he continues to grow his Geistwood trees to epic proportions, he seeks the help of some fellers in order to get these creations out there. Along the way, Jiggs attempts to get the attention of the giant Foremoms who have the power to take things farther and wider than he could even imagine. But when he runs into his old pal, Barry the Mannalo (who is half man, half buffalo, of course), who warns Jiggs about the arrival of Dynamite Doug, Jiggs ventures further over Yawnder and what he discovers next will blow yer mind! \nSTRETCH GOALS\nIf I manage to raise more funds, then I will be able to include some fancy designer end pages on the inside front and inside back covers. If I really go over my goal, and the reward levels start to sell out, then I will start printing some of the 2nd edition copies of Further Over Yawnder, and make those available in this campaign \u2014 however, they won't be fancy and exclusive like the limited 1st edition.\nJay Dart at Art Toronto 2018 (photo by John Armstrong)\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nI'm a drawist/author/designer from a small hamlet in the north part of Whitby, about an hour outside of Toronto, Canada. Over the past decade, I have been exhibiting locally and internationally in commercial and public art venues, with recent stops at international art fairs including Art Toronto, Papier (Montreal) and Drawing Now (Paris). While my focus is on presenting graphite, watercolour and pastel works on paper from his Yawnder series, I also create interactive, installation pieces that bring elements of my two-dimensional narrative works to the real world, like the Geistwood Stools which you can even get via this campaign (see Rewards breakdown below). This series references images of settlers forging their way on the frontiers of the wilderness, and rearranges them into a conceptually layered world that examines the nature of the creative process and its relationship with modern technologies. Bookworks allow me to present the story that has evolved throughout this body of work \u2013 each piece adds to a narrative labyrinth that I continue to travel within. \nJiggs and Floyd \u2013 from the Field Guide to Yawnder\nABOUT JIGGS\nJiggs is my alter ego and the main character of the Where Yawns Go series. He's also the one who wrote the story for both Wanderer of Yawnder and now Further Over Yawnder \u2014 makes sense, right? All that you need to know about him can be found in these books but he also has his own website featuring some strange drawings. This past winter, director March Mercanti made a profile video on my art practice for the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) that goes further into the relationship between Jiggs and I (see video at the top of this page).\nABOUT THE REWARDS\nUpon first glance, it may seem kinda complicated but the perks are simple.... everyone who contributes $25 or more gets a copy of Further Over Yawnder, bookmarks, eBooks and a special thank you postcard. \nThen, there are a few other special things that you can get, if you'd like:\n- Copy of the Field Guide to Yawnder\n- Copy of the second edition of Wanderer of Yawnder\n- New limited edition print (exclusive to the Kickstarter campaign)\n- Special deal on the Some Fellers limited edition print\n- Exclusive custom commissions and original artwork (drawing or Geistwood Stool)\nBookmarks(Available to all backers who contribute $25 and up)Collect em' all!\nPostcards\n(Available to all backers who contribute $25 and up)\nA special thank you postcard featuring a Jay Dart art TBD.\neBooks\n(Available in all rewards)\nGet yerself copies of the eBook versions of both Wanderer of Yawnder and Further Over Yawnder!\nSample page from Further Over Yawnder\nFurther Over Yawnder (the new book)\n(Available to all backers who contribute $25 and up)\nThis is what the campaign is all about.

It is a construction game, both physical and psychological, which reveals the creativity within every player, young and old.\nThis educative game is an entertaining introduction to the basic laws of physics, it champions focus, precision, motor skills. It is about imagining, trying, understanding, learning, and having fun!\nPLAY\n\n Create a community, launch production.\nOur first goal is to create a community.

Liquid silicone rubber parts are also chemically inert, hypoallergenic and resistant to bacteria growth.

Thanks to both its materials and intuitive user-centred design, Swig is able to carry even the hottest of hot chocolates without breaking a sweat.\nWe understand that everything looks better when it comes in a box, even Swig. This is why each and every Swig and Swig Mini comes gift boxed ready for retail shelves. As all rewards will be delivered gift boxed, Swig makes for an ideal gift for those hard to buy for coffee lovers.\nEveryone has different tastes \u2013 in both coffee and colours.

The feedback proved to be extremely encouraging and was an excellent result for our first Kickstarter project.\n\nWith this said, there are inherent risks with producing any new product. As a practicing product designer, I understand this first hand. To help negate some of the issues that commonly occur with any new product, every stage has been carefully considered. As the tooling has already been produced, the largest cost has already been met. We have spent the past few months going back and forth with our trusted manufacturer, allowing us crucial development time to test the design and ensure that the final product is as we envisioned from the start. \n\nFrom tooling through to shipping, each stage of the manufacturing process has been factored into the project's budget and timeline . A detailed plan has also been created to outline all costs involved in the execution of the project.\n\nAs a fully qualified and currently practising product designer, I base my reputation on my proven ability to provide a quality product in a given timeframe.

What started out as a bunch of crazy ideas has now come to fruition in the form of an amazing outdoor experience. Let us SWAYY you to go anywhere and do anything, outside.\nThe Problem\nWhen you put a sleeping bag in the hammock with you, the insulation compresses on your backside and you get cold.\nCBS - Cold Butt Syndrome\n You don't hammock camp? Let us ask a question:\nThe Solution\nWe use \"Loft\" technology to hang insulation lower than your bum... No more CBS (Cold Butt Syndrome). \nLoft is the ability of insulation to trap air between the fibers (synthetic insulation) or feather dander (down). Loft allows for the trapped air pockets to be warmed up. For our synthetic insulation, this is achieved by allowing the insulation to Loft without any compression below your backside. The down insulation follows the same model, it just uses a different material.\nThe SWAYY Premus\u2122 and Eira\u2122 work using 3 main layers of material. \nThe 1st holds your weight. (Up to 400lbs!)\nThe 2nd insulates you using \"loft\" so that it does not compress against your backside, in essence, the insulation drapes a little lower than the hammock-body fabric (load-bearing layer). \nThe 3rd layer is a shell that breaks the wind.\nThus we give you: \nThe Premus\u2122 is constructed using four parts.\nThe first is the weight bearing layer, or hammock body, is constructed using a 1.6oz per square yard, 40 Denier, nylon fabric with a 6-way ripstop to increase strength and durability. \n The second is the insulation layer. This layer consists of two layers of Primaloft Silver 3.0oz insulation to keep opulent warmth. Each insulation layer is cut, sewn, darted and pleated in a specific way to create three specific air gaps under your backside that won't compress.\nThe third is the shell layer. This wind breaking layer is made of a .9oz per square yard, 15 Denier, nylon fabric that is designed to be lightweight and breathable enough to prevent moisture build-up.\nThe fourth and final piece is the full-length zipper. When zipped up, this allows for total warmth for the chilly nice. When unzipped, this allows for a steady warmth under your bum but keeps it cool enough for summer camping. The zipper is a #8 zipper that is strong, durable, and lightweight.\nU.S. Provisional Patent App. No. 62/595,254\nSWAYY Premus\u2122\nSWAYY Premus\u2122\nSWAYY Premus\u2122\nSWAYY Premus\u2122\nSWAYY Premus\u2122\nSWAYY Premus\u2122\nSWAYY Premus\u2122\nSWAYY Premus\u2122\nPremus\u2122 Suspension\nThe Premus\u2122 Suspension is constructed using 3 main parts: The carabiners, CD101 aluminum alloy cinch buckles, and Poly/Dyneema webbing. \nThe carabiners are made of high grade A6061 cold-forged aluminum alloy. Each biner weights 25.7g. The closed gate strength is 10kN and the open strength is 3kN.\nThe CD101 cinch buckles are crafted for easy tensile adjustability of the hammock and are made using an aluminum alloy for the perfect balance of strength and weight.\nThe high-tensile strength webbing is made from a polyester and Dyneema blend. This keeps the weight and wearability low and the strength high. Our webbing is 1\" wide and is 4.9g per foot.\n Entire System Tech Specs:\nWeight Maximum: 400 lbs / 182 kg\nLength: 10 ft (11ft for long option)\nStuff-Sack Dimensions: 19\" x 8\" x 16\"\nTemperature Rating: Spring-Fall (35-70\u00b0F / 1.6 - 21\u00b0C)\nSystem Weight: 5.1 lbs \nWeight Bearing Fabric: Hexon\u2122 1.6 oz \nShell Fabric: Argon\u2122 .9 oz\nHeat Reflection: All Sides\nFill: Primaloft\u00ae Silver Insulation 3.0 oz\nSuspension Material: 1\" Poly/Dyneema Webbing\nCarabiners: 25.7g A6061 Cold-Forged Aluminum Alloy. 10kN Closed. \n The Eira\u2122 is constructed using four parts. \nThe first is the weight bearing layer, or hammock body, is constructed using a 1.6oz per square yard, 40 Denier, nylon fabric with a 6-way ripstop to increase strength and durability. (Up to 400lbs!)\nThe second is the insulation layer. This layer consists of 20 tubular baffles that hold 800FP DownTek storm treated goose down. Each baffle is filled with precisely 1.25oz of down.\nThe third is the shell layer. This wind breaking layer is made of a .9oz per square yard, 15 Denier, nylon fabric that is designed to be lightweight and breathable enough to prevent moisture build-up. \nThe fourth and final piece is the full-length zipper.

Inside each of the four corner hems of the rain-fly, you will find a nail stake connected to the rain-fly by shock cord.\nAt 2.8 grams per foot, the ridgeline is made of 1/2\" high-tensile strength polyester that yields low stretch and 500lbs of breaking strength.\nThe rain-fly is made of 2.7oz Wide Sil Nylon. It is a low stretch fabric with a ripstop grid. It has at least 1500 mm of head pressure. This fabric is a lightweight and waterproof.\nThe quick deploy sock cover is made of a 1.6oz 6-way ripstop nylon designed for ease of access to shelter when the storms come rolling in. When the sun comes out, simply place the four titanium nail stakes in their respective channels and pull the sock back to encase your shelter.\nThe 6\" and 2.8g ultralight titanium nail stakes can be driven into hard soil without getting bent or damaged.\nEira\u2122 Suspension\nThe Eira\u2122 Suspension is constructed using 3 main parts: The carabiners, the titanium cinch buckles, and the Poly/Dyneema webbing.  Each component is constructed and engineered for the extraordinary adventurer and has our guarantee.\nThe carabiners are made of high grade A6061 cold-forged aluminum alloy. Each biner weights 25.7g.

When tackling anything new, we expect there may be challenges and setbacks, but rest assured we will never stop until you the job is completed! We will work around the clock to make sure we deliver, the whole 9 yards, and then some.\n\n1) Generally, fabrics are the longest lead item in our supply chain and if the produced fabric does not meet our high-quality control specifications it will have to be redone. This could cause an unforeseen delay. \n\n2) While we do expect to have your products to you as quickly as possible, there is always a possibility that we could run into unexpected delays. If this were to happen, and it probably will no, we will keep you updated as quickly and as often as possible. \n\n3) If by chance we amass an unprecedented number of backers, we could experience a slight delay. However, we are confident that we can deliver! \n\nWith partners such as Primaloft\u00ae and DownTek\u00ae, we expect to carry forward in providing you with the highest of quality camping gear. \n\nWe are dependent on several other companies staying in business and doing their job well - so with the launch of new products, we sure do appreciate your patience and support!

We based ELIA Frames on the standard Roman alphabet, since roughly 70% of the world\u2019s population uses it to read and write.\nEach ELIA Frame features an outer frame (circle, square, house) and interior elements that combine to form the main characteristics of standard alphabet letters. \nMost of you looking at this page likely aren't visually impaired\u2014but maybe you know someone who is. Or, perhaps you're a designer who believes in the mission and would like to support the campaign by taking home a poster. Either way, we need your help and support to share our message.\nSource: Braille Reading Rates: \"Reading By Touch\", By Susanna Millar, Routledge Press, 1997\nBraille: the current system\nBraille has been described by Fred Schroeder as \u201cliberating a whole class of people from a condition of illiteracy and dependency, and giving them the means for self-fulfillment and enrichment.\u201d We couldn\u2019t agree more\u2014it is extremely important for those who can read it. However, braille has considerable shortcomings in the 21st century:\nLess than 1% of those who have a visual impairment can read braille.\nOf those who lose their vision as adults (roughly 98% of the population), very few learn braille\u2014so it is not a viable resource for the vast majority of those who have lost their vision.\nBraille requires exceptional finger sensitivity and intellect, along with a lot of determination and time\u2014it can take up to 10 months just to learn the alphabet.\nELIA: our modernized system\nAbout 200 million people with a visual impairment could benefit from ELIA in its current design, and another 85 million could benefit from it if customized to their standard scripts.\nCurrently, the employment rate among individuals with visual impairment is at an estimated 43%. For those who read braille, that rate soars to 85%. ELIA can have the same benefit for the 99% who can't read braille.\nELIA Frames can be learned tactilely in as little as 3 hours\u2014and visually in a few minutes\u2014since the font leverages a previously established alphabet.\nHow to read ELIA\nELIA, Roman, and braille alphabets.\nWith this campaign, ELIA can enable people to gain increased independence and literacy.\nELIA Frames are scalable and beautiful!\nTestimonials \nCheck out this sound clip from BBC Radio 4's In Touch Podcast with Peter White!\nPLAY\n\nI\u2019m a writer and so I work a lot with words and I\u2019m quite interested in anything that\u2019s going to help me read faster or read better. You mentioned when people later in life lose their sight and they lose the ability to drive or read a book, I think it will be enormously helpful for people who are older to be able to sit down and quickly begin to get information from a tactile system again...I had vision up until about the age of 12 or 13, so when I look at the O and the E and the T and the N, they\u2019re quite recognizable. My wife is sighted and I showed it to her and within five minutes she could recognize words. \n- Adam Linn, Writer, taken from Interview with BBC Radio 4\nAs someone who experienced vision loss as an adult, I immediately recognized Elia as a potential tool for those in need of accessing printed information. This led me to feature their story on my podcast. Learning to tactilely recognize the alphabet in less than an hour, along with the availability of multiple font sizes, I knew this system could be especially helpful to seniors in need of labeling household items. As an advocate for people with vision loss I am all for providing people with options that best suit their individual needs. ELIA Technologies is another tool to assist people with vision loss.\n\u2014Thomas Reid, Reid My Mind Radio\nI tried to learn braille three times in my life. I learned the letters easily, but words were difficult for me and sentences really slowed me down. Learning the ELIA system took me only an afternoon. It\u2019s an easier system than braille because it uses actual fragments of the letters of the alphabet that are placed in their own individual frames. I strongly believe that it could be helpful for people who can\u2019t read braille.\n\u2014Karen Kacen\nDon\u2019t ever quit Andrew. This alphabet is important to people who have lost their vision. It can help people remain independent. We fight to remain independent. Because if you lose your independence, then your privacy is threatened. If you lose your privacy, then your dignity is threatened.\n\u2014Elia Vallone (Andrew\u2019s Grandmother, who inspired the creation of ELIA)\nWe tested ELIA with over 300 participants, and analyzed over 175,000 responses.\nELIA keyboards can revolutionize the work of the blind and the sighted, helping them type faster and more accurately.\nDown the line: developing ELIA for ATMs, phones, and more.\nOur design process\nTo design the system, we created and tested hundreds of letter shapes and combinations of letter features. We prioritized the most easy-to-feel features, incorporated them in the most frequently used letters (e.g. the letter \u201cE\u201d is easier to feel than the letter \u201cK\u201d), and then tested those letter shapes to study which were most commonly confused with others.\nWorking \"B\" Frames.\nThe ELIA Frames letters are designed to be understood by touch for those who have a severe visual impairment, to be read by touch and sight for those who have modest visual impairment, and to be read visually by those who have full sight.\nOur process sketches creating ELIA.\nThe printer we hacked to create ELIA.\nPrinting ELIA Frames.\nOur design partners\nThe original design for ELIA was created by our founder Andrew Chepaitis' mother. From there, Andrew, with help from graphic designer Ze Frank, developed the first frames font, and we then finalized the design of ELIA with our industrial designer, Reed DeWinter of Humanfactors Design Works.\nThanks to a collaboration with Order, we've been able to make ELIA as effective and beautiful as possible. Order is a design studio founded by Hamish Smyth and Jesse Reed, who has previously worked on communication design projects like the WalkNYC pedestrian wayfinding system, and Kickstarter\u2019s redesign. Their team built upon our design work to leverage the essential parts with new tools, to help communicate our project in a clear, memorable, and unique way. \nOrder created the Roman alphabet ELIA font using the established ELIA Frames matrix for a cohesive, effective, gorgeous new identity.\nThe ELIA Display font, developed by Order.\nCreating the ELIA font from the ELIA Frames matrix.\nTimeline\nRewards\nDeclaration of Independence poster\u2014in roman alphabet and ELIA Frames, designed by Order.\nDetail shot of the Declaration of Independence poster from Order.\nA mock-up of the ELIA Starter Kit.\nThe ELIA tactile keyboard cover, so you can easily learn the system and type faster.\nOur story \nOur founder Andrew was inspired to introduce ELIA after his grandmother started losing her sight from macular degeneration. A woman who could once finish the New York Times crossword puzzle, she found it difficult to learn braille\u2014it was based on an entirely new system that she had no reference to.\nThat's when Andrew and his mother started thinking of a solution that built on his grandmother's skills, since her case wasn't unique\u2014just 1% of the blind/Visually Impaired (VI) population is born without sight, with the rest losing sight later on in life. Andrew continued his mother's work through the next decade. Thirteen years later, he founded ELIA Life Technology.\nOur team has since received support from the National Institute on Aging, the National Eye Institute (divisions of the National Institutes of Health), the National Institute for Standards and Technology, and NYSTAR. We've collaborated with Lighthouse Guild for the Blind in New York City and have a printing partnership with HP. We've tested our system with over 300 participants, running controlled studies comparing learning ELIA to learning braille or the raised Roman alphabet. We analyzed over 175,000 of the responses from research participants. \nNow, we want to establish ELIA as a mainstream system that will connect people who have lost vision with the rest of society like never before. With this Kickstarter, we will update, streamline, and mass produce our printing technology. \nAndrew and his mom, Elia V. Chepaitis, Ph.D.\nELIA is especially useful for labeling, e.g. for those who take medication for a visual condition.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nKickstarter is a great place to introduce a product, because it's a community of early adopters, innovators and creative thinkers. We're hoping this community will support our project by sharing it with those who actually need it most, and may not have access to this platform.\nThis Kickstarter will serve the most critical needs of people who have a visual impairment\u2014enabling them to retain their literacy, live independently through labeling household items, and learn the skills needed for employment and workplace independence.\nAgain, your funding support will help us streamline and mass produce our printing technology. From there, we'll begin printing books in the ELIA Frames font, to be distributed to libraries and institutions across the US where readers will be able to read the texts and share them with their community. This will be the first step to establishing ELIA as a system across the country, and around the world.\nOur team\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith creating our product, there can always be unforeseen delays in the printing.

Whenever he went, he always felt like the odd one out, which made him lonely and sad.\nWill Aggy & friends be able to help Bucky with his differences?\nFind out what happens next when you purchase the book!\nBehind the Story\nThe very first step I took before I created the storyline, was to do research on the current children's books in the market, as well as ask parents what kind of books they are more inclined to buy. Most said that they enjoy books that have a meaningful moral, and attractive illustrations. As young children are not able to read on their own, they take significant notice to the illustration details on the page while someone else reads to them. For example, the character's facial expression, their body gestures and their characteristic traits.\nThrough research, I learned that by the age of 3 a child would already understand the basic building blocks of relationships: Love and trust; And this is when children start entering pre-school and making friends. If a child encounters a social situation where he/she feels left out that can significantly affect him/her emotionally and psychologically. As I went around interviewing parents, a mother told me that her daughter who had just entered pre-school had been facing some mood swings. Some days, she would come back elated, because she made a new friend; and on other days, she could be extremely quiet and sad. She even said that once, someone teased her daughter because she wore glasses, and it made her daughter not want to go to school the next day. Upon hearing this story, it inspired me to write a story for kids, about loving themselves for who they are.\nIn the book, Bucky's differences like his buck teeth and big size made him feel left out. However, his friends prove to him that being different is what makes them unique. I believe that through the story of Bucky The Dino, children would understand that being different is what makes us special.\nPlease note that these prices do not include the shipping fee.\nThe Author and The Character\nWilshia\nEver since I was a little girl, I always loved to draw. I wanted to pursue art in college, but I was convinced not to because many said it was not \"practical\". However, my passion and love for art did not cease. I knew wanted to be a children's book author/illustrator when I rediscovered my love for children's books after reading Dallas Clayton's books. I feel that even as an adult, a children's book still never fails to make me smile. In my heart, I knew I wanted to create children's books that can influence people the way children's book had impacted me, and I worked towards it.\nI took up a design minor in college, and external art classes to improve my skills. I also joined the Band of Doodlers in Singapore and started doing murals and drawing gigs. Over the past year, I created the storyline for the book and the full-color illustrations. It took a lot of dedication and hard work, but I did not give up on and continued to push myself to do what I love.\nMe drawing a mural with the Band of Doodlers. Spot bucky on the far right :)\nBucky The Dino \nThe first drawing I did of Bucky was in the year 2011. He was just a simple doodle on my notebook, but because my friends pointed out how cute he was, I continued drawing him everywhere. In 2015, I knew she wanted the rest of the world to know Bucky, and I wanted to use him to create a positive impact in the world. Hence, I started an Instagram that shared positive quotes with Bucky as the star character. \nIn 2016, I had the opportunity to join an art exhibit called the \"Seven Deadly Sins\" with the Band of Doodlers in Singapore. The artists were placed under each of the seven sins,  and created an artwork surrounding their theme. I created a piece called, Oops, I did it again, under the Gluttony category.\nWilshia and Peter Draw at the \"Seven Deadly Sins Exhibit\"\nAs I continue my art journey, I hope to find more ways to help bring awareness to important issues that children face through books. I hope that Bucky can become an icon of positivity to everyone in the world. With your help, we can make this book happen and share this fantastic story so that many kids will not only enjoy reading it, but also understand the importance of loving themselves for who they are. \nMy dream is to be a published author-illustrator, and I believe that this will be one of many books to come.\nThe Support\nI want to thank my dad, my mum, my brother and my friends and family who have always supported me in pursuing my dreams.\nEspecially my high school friends who were my first Bucky supporters; My best friend Jun, who always pushed me to do what I love; Prof Jason for giving me the opportunity to work on this project for this class.\nSPREAD THE WORD\n  Any questions about Bucky The Dino?

Believe it or not, all the words in this book are real words. None of them are made up.\nThis book is meant to be read by parents to their children. Yes, these words are unusally BIG. They are also fun, wacky, & weird. This book will help put parents & children on an even playing field because the parent will have just as much amusement trying to pronounce these words as their kids will. The comical cartoons illustrating every word will appeal to the child in all of us. When parents show their children that there are so many interesting new things to learn - even when you are an adult - it will influence kids to stay curious and to never stop learning.\nI know some of the parents reading this will find these words daunting, even intimidating. But don't worry - I've included a pronunciation guide in the back to help you out.\nDoes Dad have giant, scary eyebrows? Don't worry - it's only hypertrichophrydia!\n Once printed, this will be a sixty-page, hardcover book. Big words deserve a big book, so the final printed size will be a whopping 11\" x 14\"! Each letter of the alphabet gets its own spread. Once you see some of these gigantic words, you'll understand why. How could I squeeze a word like \"eelogofusciohipoppokunurious\" onto only one page? (And if you want to know what that word means, you'll have to buy the book!)\n Rewards\nThere are several award levels for you to choose from. Choose any of these super-fun things to take home:\nDigital Wallpaper - This will come in a variety of sizes to fit almost any device.\nDie Cut Sticker - Roughly 4\" wide. Stick it on anything!\n1.25\" Round Button - It's a button! And it's round! Wow!\n12\" x 18\" Poster - Printed on paper. YES! Paper!\nBackpack - Get this cool backpack full of goodies! Includes a book, poster, button & sticker!\nAnd of course, the book. Neat-o!\nOriginal Artwork - Get an original page from the book. One-of-a-kind, ink on paper drawings, suitable for framing!\nI'm also offering sketches, finished drawings, & even original artwork from the book. All drawings will be done in ink on archival paper. The original art of the book is black & white, done in ink on Bristol board. They are not in color, because I colored the book on the computer. Originals are 28\" x 11\". All sketches will be in pencil on the inside cover or first page of the book.\nNote: All images above (with the exception of the original art) are mockups of the book & reward items. The actual items will look very similar to the above.\nA Special Reward Just for Donating!\n I used to make these little figures called doinks. There are each hand-painted & one-of-a-kind. I'm going to give away 5 doinks to people who donate to the Kickstarter campaign. \nHere's how it will work: anyone who donates $10 or more will be entered into the drawing. You get one entry for every $10 you donate. So if you donate $20, you get two chances to win; $100 gets you 10 chances! The more you donate, the better your chance of winning! Everyone who donates will automatically be entered into the drawing, so all you have to do is donate. \nAfter the Kickstarter campaign is over, I will have a drawing, & 5 people will each win a different doink! You can only win once, sorry. I'll do the drawing via Facebook Live, & I'll announce when the drawing will be a few days before it happens. So if you want one of these, please donate!\nAny questions? Please ask. Good luck!\nStretch Goal\nSince we've met our goal early, I'll be trying to add some stretch goals to make this project even better. Our first stretch goal is this: if we get to $13,000, everyone who has backed this project at the $10 reward level or more will receive a Hippopotomonstrosesquipedalian coloring book! While you are busy trying to figure out how to pronounce the words in the book, your kids can be coloring some of the artwork from the book. Everybody wins! I'll be coming up with some more stretch goals as we move forward, but, as usual, please send me any ideas you have!\nNew Reward Level\nI've also added a new reward level: the Librarian's Best Friend reward. For $125 (plus a discounted shipping amount) I will donate 3 books to the library of your choice. You will also receive your own copy of the book, along with a poster, a button, & a sticker, just for being a great person! I will ship your goodies to you, & the donated books will be sent directly to the library of your choice. I will include a letter from both of us to each library crediting you or in honor of a person of your choice.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I stated above, this is a LARGE book. After calling several printers who told me they didn't have adequate equipment to print a book this size, I thought I'd have to shrink it down - which I REALLY didn't want to do. But I finally found a printer that could do the job for a decent price. The only caveat is that they are located in China. Since the book is being printed in China, some delays could inevitably occur. I'm unable to travel overseas for press checks, so they will have to ship me printed samples, which will take some time. Shipping of the final books may also take some time. Rest assured, though, that I'll do everything I can to keep all backers aware of any delays that may occur. I do not anticipate any problems, but if anything arises, I'll be sure to let all backers know in a timely manner.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "DIGITAL WALLPAPER", "descp": "A high-resolution wallpaper of the cover of the book.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "STICKER", "descp": "A 4\" die-cut vinyl sticker, plus the digital wallpaper.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Wallpaper\nSticker", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "BUTTON", "descp": "A 1.25\" round button, plus the sticker & digital wallpaper.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Wallpaper\nSticker\nButton", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "POSTER", "descp": "A 12\" x 18\" poster, plus the button, sticker, & digital wallpaper.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Wallpaper\nSticker\nButton\nPoster", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "BOOK", "descp": "One signed copy of the book, plus a sticker & the digital wallpaper.\nTo order additional copies of the book, add $25 for each additional copy.

You can find more info here!\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1551918612/faeland/posts/2171728\nNote on Stretch Goals: We have planned many extra features and ways to add depth, richness and longevity to the gameplay. Having reached a particular stretch goal ensures it will be in the final copy. However, for the ones we don't reach, we will still do everything in our power to include them as we would love to implement every single one of them as they have been conceived.\nNote on Console Porting: We very much value that you place your trust in us, backing us at this early stage. Hence, it is very important for us to create a reward based on your preferred console, specially for those of you who are getting more than 1 copy of the game. Even if we don't reach this stretch goal through this campaign we will continue to do everything in our power to get the funds needed in order to make it happen. Therefore, we will gather information about everyone's preferred console towards the end of the campaign for pledges of $15 +. We are committed to bring Faeland to consoles, and we look forward to making it happen.\nIn Faeland as the player, you can freely explore the open world, traveling from one town to another, talk to friendly NPCs, learn about the game\u2019s lore and get useful tips, commerce valuable items to improve your economics, buy new equipment and consumables and do quests to acquire useful loot while progressing in the main story. Some of the areas you need to traverse are challenging forests, caves, dungeons, castles and more. You also have to acquire new abilities and special items to gain access to previously inaccessible areas and paths. The combat style is customized through your equipped weapons, choose from knives, daggers, swords, axes, spears and bows, all with different attack animations, speeds, strengths and effects.\nCombat in The Castle Ruins\n\nIn a fantasy world, humans have established their kingdom through centuries of peace efforts to keep a safe margin with the dark forces of magic and monstrous beasts that lurk away from civilization. Sam, our protagonist, is a skilled hunter living in a secluded cottage in the forest until one day his home gets raided by a horde of orcs and trolls.\nEscaping the attack, with little left but his life, he will begin a new adventure and forge allegiances throughout his travels. Unbeknownst to him, a larger threat looms in the background and the entire realm\u2019s survival will rest upon him becoming the hero he was born to be.\nDetailed hand crafted pixel-art graphics.\nOpen world / metroidvania exploration style.\nChange your equipped weapons to match your preferred combat style.\nEnhance and replace your armor while enjoying the new looks on your character.\nPuzzles and riddles solving.\nLearn new skills.\nExplore large dungeons with challenging boss battles.\n\"Valia Town\"\nEquipment, Outfit and Armor Selection\nHere's a glimpse of the enemies you will encounter in Faeland. They all have been designed thoroughly, showing an art style that goes with the general game design, environments and player. They are mostly challenging for first timers, expect to fail a few times when you confront them until you understand well their behaviors! Don't underestimate them! A lot more of these are planned to be developed following the campaign!\nAction in The Underground Tunnels, featuring \"The Slime\", and \"The Creep,\" both enemies combined, with the environment's design, may make you run out of patience a little!\nThis will likely be \"the most difficult action scene\" found in the \"Prototype Build\" delivered to you as a backer on this campaign. \"The Goblin Archers\" and \"The Ravens\" combined will be a difficult challenge to master, but a very rewarding one, once achieved!\nWe have been designing and implementing the AI of our latest enemy, \"The Spectre.\" Even though he looks tall and scary, he is a regular enemy you will find in \"The Magic Tower.\" He levitates, which adds a new flavor to the combat. He teleports when you get too close and fires magic missiles towards your direction. In all, he is a pain specially when he is not alone.\nIn Faeland, you will encounter massive and challenging bosses who can be found in dungeons, and also freely roaming certain areas. See below some of the Bosses\u2019 Design Concepts!\nDragon and Ogre Chief sketches\nThe Kraken: A Teaser of Faeland's First Boss!!!\nFaeland's artwork is built up on detailed and handmade pixel art animations and graphics in an \"enhanced 16-Bit\" that exposes wide color palettes, widescreen resolutions, and fluid animations resulting in a contemporary, original and appealing art style.\nWe have used traditional hand-drawing techniques to sketch the game\u2019s concept and designs.

Therefore, we now need to focus on development and most importantly, make Faeland our full time job, so we can release it in the least amount of time possible and take it to its full potential.\nThis quest towards making Faeland a challenging and inspiring video-game project will only be possible with your support, let's make this campaign count. Faeland's future is now in your hands.\nWebsite: www.talegames.com\nGet in touch through our social media channels and help us spread the word!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Talegamesnews\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHS_LLI8GwoKaIPbVF4DoUA\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TaleGames\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/talegamesnews", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFaeland is a project by a small dynamic team.

You have been helping the Town Guardian prepare for their journey into the daunting Deep Woods so that they can try secure food for the upcoming winter. In their absence you're tasked with making sure that the townsfolk don't get up to too much mischief, at least until the Town Guardian gets back. But the Baker is going to want fruit for her pies, the Sproutlings are full of energy, they're bound to get into trouble (they always do!), and who knows what the Inventor is up to... \nWhen the Town Guardian's companion comes flying back into town early, you know that something has gone wrong. The Town Guardian is stranded in the Deep Woods. The Inventor's dingy old plane is in disrepair, but with the help of the townsfolk you should be able to fix up the plane so you can quickly fly out and help the Town Guardian get back home before the winter hits. \nOne of the many puzzle screens\nThought Bubble Based Dialog System\nTala is a wordless experience, but it still has a fully featured dialog system. But instead of words it uses thought bubbles and animations! Chatting to the townsfolk bring up dialogue trees and little dialogue puzzles that you're used to from point and click adventure games. This means that people can enjoy the world of Tala without having to be fluent in English. \nPLAY\n\nThe thought bubble dialog system in action. \n\nOf course, this means that there's a wide cast of characters to interact with. From the friendly townsfolk like the Baker & the Gardener, to those who live on the outskirts of town like the Inventor, or even some of the folk who live in the wilds of the Deep Woods, and beyond.\nInteractive Environment\nThe world of Tala is full of play. To help keep the world feel lively a lot of the background elements are intractable. Signs will blow in the wind, chimneys will bellow out smoke, windows will open and close. Some of these elements will be part of puzzles, so make sure that you play around with the environments! To help facilitate that, Tala uses a contextually aware cursor so you know what to expect when interacting with things. \nThe Context-Aware Cursor in Action\nSpeaking of puzzles, to go with the environmental puzzles there'll also be traditional point and click style puzzles where you're collecting items and using them on other things, and distinct puzzle screens filled with puzzles for you to solve. You'll be doing things like figuring out a way to get a lit match through a gushing waterfall, distracting a bird so you can make your way past it,create a path of stepping stones across a river so you can pass it, and much more.\nAbout that art.All of the photography for Tala has been taken with my phone & an old point and click digital camera. From national parks across the state like Wilson's Prom, The Dandenong Range & the Grampians, to small parks in Melbourne's suburbs. There's potential for game locations anywhere.\nSherbrooke Forest in the Dandenong Ranges\nThe animation is done digitally, but still uses traditional animation techniques. First I'll do a rough version with a pencil brush and then I'll go over it with a custom brush that I use for all of Tala's linework and colour it in. A simple animation can take hours, but the end result is always worth it.\nEarly animation test.\nI've always envisioned the music for Tala to be low key fingerstyle guitar, and I was humbled that the wonderful Canadian fingerstyle guitarist Cody Rueger let me use some of his existing tracks in the game. Getting funding means that I'll be able to commission original music for the game.\nNocturnal Toads \nCrater Lake\n If you enjoy these tracks, check out the rest of his music on his Bandcamp page. \n As long as you're backing at Eucalyptus or higher you can add additional money to your pledge and get some cool rewards! Surveys will be sent out after the campaign so I know exactly what you want to get. These add-ons are\nStickers [+10AUD]\nExtra Copy of Tala [+10AUD]\nA4 Print [+25AUD]\nPin [+35AUD]\n\nFor example: If you're backing at the Banksia level for $25AUD, and wanted a sticker sheet and a pin, the total would be $70AUD  \nOr if you're backing at Eucalyptus for $15AUD and you wanted 2 sticker sheets and an A4 print, your total would be $60AUD \n!!IF YOU BACKED AT A HIGHER LEVEL, FEEL FREE TO DROP DOWN TO A LOWER PLEDGE!! If you end up staying with the higher pledge, I'll throw in extra stuff to make up the difference, because I don't want you to feel like you're being ripped off!  \n\nHow it Works\n* Click the \"manage your pledge\" button on the top of this page. \n* Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on(s).\n* Save your pledge. Don't change the tier that you originally pledged at.\n* After the campaign we will send out a survey asking what add-ons you want.\nBonus Tiers:\nGumnut: Postcards\n\nGet a set of 3 postcards, as well as the game, OST, and in-game credit.

I've done work on games like Mallow Drops, Future Proof, and Beard. Branding work for Queerly Represent Me, and I've also released a couple of tiny little interactive game art tests on my itch.io page.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI founded The Garden Well in late 2017 as a commitment to making Tala a reality. It has existed in a prototype stage since 2015, but work on it promptly stopped mid-2016 for personal reasons. But building the world of Tala never left me, so I've spent the last few months finishing up the teaser game & putting together this Kickstarter with the hope to let you folks explore this tiny world of mine. This Kickstarter succeeding will allow me to put in focused time into making Tala rather than slowly hacking at it whenever I have the spare time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTala is my first actual game project, so there's a whole lot of unknown things that could go wrong in development.

But, I\u2019ve always felt there was a need for a different type of business book. One that is smart and insightful, yet designed well and fun to read. One that includes a larger perspective from an industry expert (not just from one firm\u2019s perspective). One that dives deep into a topic, but gets straight-to-the-point with lots of actionable and easy-to-digest insights, tips, and checklists.\nIt also includes a collection of real-world, insightful, and honest case studies that provide a rare behind-the-scenes look at a variety of tested, effective, and often times unique business strategies from your colleagues and peers: 2communiqu\u00e9 \u2022 Barrel \u2022 Hagopian Ink \u2022 Hunt Design \u2022 ink + mortar \u2022 Intend Creative \u2022 Kiss Me I\u2019m Polish \u2022 Knox Design Strategy \u2022 Local Wisdom \u2022 Louise Fili LTD \u2022 Matchstic \u2022 MCKL \u2022 MSLK \u2022 Suburbia Studios + FunctionFox \u2022 Visual Dialogue \u2022 Worstofall Design \u2022 We Are How\nA teaser of what's inside!

So no cover lasts forever and the line of sight changes constantly.\nA mature story told from the perspective of the three different factions. Each faction has three playable hero characters that offer additional options in combat and reconnaissance.\nLead dozens of different unit types into battle. Soldiers can equip weapons on the battlefield to gain special abilities and more firepower.\nBuild your base and add fortification to protect your unit production and research.\nAs a Kickstarter backer, you have the opportunity to get all of this in our Exclusive Kickstarter Edition:\nIron Harvest takes place in the World of 1920+. It is an alternate version of our own world created by Polish artist Jakub R\u00f3\u017calski. In the early 20th century, tradition clashes with progress, and the world is still full of mysteries and secrets.\nHumankind, fascinated by technology, iron, and engines, invented powerful walking machines, that proved to be mighty weapons on the battlefields of the Great War and are now part of everyday life.\nNow, a few years after the Great War, secret forces are working towards the destabilization of Europe, determined to set the world on fire and seize control.\n\nFactions\nThere are three playable factions in the game, each with over a dozen individual units and three playable heroes.\nThe Saxony Empire is one of the most influential countries in Europe, with powerful industry, developed cities, modern factories and a strong military tradition. After the unfavorable conditions of surrender in the Great War, the current mood in the Empire is bad, and proud elites and humiliated aristocrats secretly oppose the Emperor\u2019s appeasement policies.\nThe Polania Republic is a large agricultural country with a long history. It is trying to maintain its status and territory, struggling with its aggressive neighbors: The Saxony Empire in the west and Rusviet in the east. Polania initiated a program to modernize its army while a large part of the country is still occupied by Rusviet forces.\nRusviet is huge, powerful, and has unmatched industrial and population potential. However, the country is tired and worn out by the long war. People are frustrated, and the power of Tsar Nikolaj weakens. Mysterious Grigori Rasputin has become an extraordinarily powerful man and revolution is in the air...\n\nHeroes & Units\nIron Harvest features three singleplayer campaigns with one over-arching story. In the story, you switch sides from Polania to Rusviet to Saxony.\nIn each campaign, you follow the story of one main character, who is joined by two other heroes. Heroes in Iron Harvest are not unstoppable \u201csuper units\u201d, but units with special abilities, that give you additional options in combat. You can play all nine heroes in multiplayer and skirmish matches as well.\nHere are the first three heroes (from left to right). Anna, a Polania girl, who becomes a capable sniper and a symbol of the resistance, Gunter, an experienced warrior and legendary commander, and Olga, a Rusviet spy who operates in the shadows and is close to the Tzar.\nSome heroes have pets they can control in battle, like Anna\u2019s bear Wojtek, Gunter\u2019s dire wolves Tag and Nacht or Olga\u2019s tiger Changa. Others have unique mechs or weapons to their disposal.\nInfantry units are the most versatile units in the game. They can equip different weapons and tools to get new abilities or to change the type of damage they deal. A standard infantry with a rifle cannot harm a mech, but the very same infantry squad could find grenades, mines or a hand cannons on the battlefield to change that...\nInfantry units can also man weapon systems like heavy MGs, cannons and mortars.\n \n\nRelationship to the board game \"Scythe\"\n\"Scythe\" is an awesome board game by Stonemaier Games, taking place in the same world. The gameplay is totally different. Iron Harvest is not a digital version of Scythe or anything like that, they are two different games by different companies, taking place in the same world, based on the artworks by Jakub R\u00f3\u017calski.\nUp to this point we paid for the Iron Harvest development with money we made with our previous games. But we need your help to stay independent and make the game as good and as big as we all want it to be. These are our funding goals for the Iron Harvest Kickstarter campaign and the goal is to reach all of them.\n(Including PayPal Payments)\nThis is the base game with all the units, features and tech described above, including the full ~20 hours singleplayer campaign, the base-building, the destructable environments, the heroes and so on.\n$500,000 - New Game Plus - After you finished the campaign, \u201cNew Game Plus\u201d gives you the opportunity to play it again with new challenges and rewards, increasing the total play time significantly.\n$600,000 - Cinematic Cutscenes - We put a lot of effort into the quality of the campaign story and we want to present it in the best way possible, which is in-game cinematics between missions.\n$750,000 - Single Player Challenge Maps - A collection of maps for experienced commanders with specific tasks to solve. Each map has its own \u201chook\u201d and the goal is to master each one of them.\n$850,000 - Skirmish Mode - A single player mode that lets you fight against the AI. Since you make the rules and there are almost infinite ways to play, this is the mode you can play forever.\nAt this stage, the game will feature competitive multiplayer maps you can play against other players all over the world.\n$1,100,000 - Co-op Campaign - You can play the whole singleplayer campaign with a friend, controlling the same units. So you can divide your units into two combat groups or one player plays the offense while the other manages defense and production.\n$1,150,000 - Co-op Challenges - A couple of challenge maps especially designed for co-op. Think coordinated attacks on enemy bases or \u201cstay alive until your co-op partner reaches you.\u201d\n$1,200,000 - Ladder & Seasons - We will have ranked multiplayer  and seasons. You can unlock skins, gain medals and fight for the top position in your region.\nWe won\u2019t add new features to the base game, even if the Kickstarter is very successful. It is very dangerous to make a game bigger and bigger, just because you can. Instead, we\u2019ll release the base game as planned and add a free mini DLC campaign later on. Think \u201cCompany of Heroes - Tiger Ace\u201d.\n\nTimeline  \nWe will keep all backers up to date about development progress via a development blog and regular updates here on Kickstarter. Our goal is to get work-in-progress versions of the game into your hands as soon as possible to get your feedback. Here is the plan:\nThis means, if the Alpha-Version is part of your reward, you will be able to play for the first time in a couple of months. Most likely, the Alpha- and Beta-Versions will get some updates, so there will be new content between the big updates.\nAlpha1 is going to be a very early singleplayer test version that\u2018s all about the basics: Controls, UI, basic gameplay, main units, performance/compatibility and so on.\nAlpha2 will focus on multiplayer (if we reach the stretch-goal) and enables you to play against other backers for the first time.\nBeta: First look at all the game modes, including first single player campaign missions.\nThis is our fourth Kickstarter, and hopefully the fourth successful one. We got infected with the crowdfunding bug in 2014, when a dedicated community of gamers enabled us to make Battle Worlds: Kronos, a turn-based strategy game.\nOur next two crowdfunded productions, the point-and-click adventure The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 and the RPG/RTS mix The Dwarves have been great experiences as well.\nWe believe one of our biggest strengths is that the team worked together for years on multiple games. We will make Iron Harvest the RTS we\u2019re all waiting for.\nWe are a very international team. Our office is in Bremen, Germany. Jakub works from his home in southern Poland, our external artists live all over the world - as does our community.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want our games to be LOVED by our fans. So we ask you guys what you actually want from a modern RTS and, unsurprisingly, many of the over 15,000 gamers that took part in our great RTS survey want something different from what the big mainstream publishers offer.\nHere are the results of our survey: www.kingart-games.com/rts_survey\nWe want to work with our community and get as much feedback as early as possible to make the RTS that fans actually want. We need to keep full creative control over Iron Harvest to do that. Your support here on Kickstarter enables us either to finance the full development by ourselves or to negotiate a publisher deal on our terms. In both cases we can make the RTS of our dreams.\n\nBudget\nThe development of an ambitious game like Iron Harvest takes a lot of time and is expensive. On average, there will be around 25 people working on the game. The total development costs will be over $5,2 million.\nWe already invested over $1 million up to this point. We hope to make enough money with this Kickstarter to be able to find publishing- and distribution partners on our terms and conditions. Or \u2013 in the best case \u2013 to crowdfund the whole project.\n\nPlatforms\nWe are developing Iron Harvest for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\nPlease note: The Kickstarter Alpha & Beta versions will ONLY be available for Windows via Steam. We cannot just upload work-in-progress versions to Sony or Microsoft servers.\nIf you back a console version, you\u2019ll get a PC key for the Alpha and Beta versions and a console key at release.\nWindows version means Windows version; console versions mean console versions - There are concerns in the community, developing console versions in parallel might lead to compromises for the Windows version. We understand where these concerns are coming from. But in case of Iron Harvest, they are not warranted.\nBoth versions of the game will get a totally independent control scheme and user interface. So no decision made on the console side has an influence on the Windows controls or UI.\nWe already did tests regarding controller inputs and we think we found a solution that\u2019s better than anything out there. This control-scheme works just fine with the gameplay we've designed for PC.\nAnd even if we'd have to change something for consoles, we'd not be looking for the smallest common denominator. Instead we would adjust gameplay for consoles without changing it for Windows.\nThe console version is very important for us. We believe there is a hunger for great RTS games on consoles since there are so few. Moreover, making the game multi-platform leads to more interest in the game when it comes to the media and publishers, which helps everybody.\nWhat about Nintendo Switch? \u2013 There are huge Switch-fans in the company but the probability of Iron Harvest coming to the Switch is slim due to technical limitations.\nAnd what about Linux and Mac versions? \u2013 We released most of our games for Linux and Mac. Nevertheless, at this point, we do not want to promise something we might not be able to deliver. On the technology side, Iron Harvest is much more complex than our other games, for example because of the multiplayer features. Therefore, we are going to evaluate Linux/Mac versions at a later point in time.\nOne of the best things about Kickstarter is giving you guys the opportunity to get supercool editions of the game that wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team has been successfully developing and releasing video games for years, so we expect to be able to complete a Kickstarter project again!

Our proprietary design makes coffee clean-up easy with a simple twist-off bottom. The stainless steel filter forces all the grounds into our patented removable bottom chamber, which twists off for easy cleaning.\nRite Press takes coffee making to the next level with a built-in thermometer, integrated hourglass timer and a removable bottom.\nWe\u2019ve removed the guesswork from the perfect cup by adding the key features needed to deliver great tasting coffee consistently.\nBurnt coffee is bad, having to read tiny numbers before you\u2019ve had your first cup... also bad. \nOur custom designed and manufactured thermometer has a simple Blue, Green, Red scale. Blue is too cold and Red is too hot. The Green zone is centered at 198 degrees, which is the optimal temperature for a great cup of coffee.The Rite thermometer lives in the shaft of the filter so it\u2019s easy to use and is always on hand.\nTiming is everything, especially in a coffee press. Both under- and over-brewing lead to bad-tasting coffee. Our built-in and simple to use hourglass is set for precisely 3 min and 30 seconds. When the sand is done flowing, it\u2019s time to press down the plunger and enjoy an amazing cup. The Rite timer is magnetically attached to the Rite Press.\nFrench press cleanup is notoriously annoying. We\u2019ve solved that issue with our patented removable bottom, allowing you to conserve energy, water, and time.\nThis solves the biggest French press issue\u2014cleanup! The bottom unscrews so you can easily dump the grounds and rinse with minimal effort. The precisely manufactured bottom is designed with two start positions allowing you to easily tighten the bottom with only one full turn. The Rite press also features a medical grade silicon seal to ensure the coffee or grounds don\u2019t drip while in use.\nThe Rite Press delivers full-bodied coffee with rich flavor and keeps it hot for hours.\nThe double wall construction keeps your coffee hot for up to two hours. Hang out with loved ones and enjoy hot coffee for much longer than a standard glass French Press.\nThe micro mesh filter allows for your coffee to be a full bodied brew while keeping the coffee grounds pushed into the removable bottom.\nThe Rite Press is even great for loose leaf tea! Steep the tea in hot water and use the filter to push the tea leaves into the removable bottom for easy cleanup.\nThe Tea Kit features three sand timers set for the approximate times each type of tea should steep for. The sand is colored to keep selection of the Rite timer simple.\nGreen Sand: Green Teas.\nBlack Sand: Black and Red Teas\nWhite Sand: White, Flower and Oolong Teas\nThe Thermometer highlights the different temperature ranges for each tea and will fit in into the press in the place of the Coffee Thermometer.\nThe Tea Kit will work for all Rite Presses in this campaign.\nThe Tea kit is an ADD ON ONLY for $10.00 (Canada $3 for shipping and International + $5 for shipping). If ordered you will still receive the coffee thermometer and hourglass. We lowered the shipping prices after the update. These are the official prices of the Tea Kit.\nIf you add on the tea kit your entire order will ship in late JUNE 2018.\nWe selected our factory partners with great care. Each factory we use is inspected by the Rite team to ensure safe, responsible working conditions. Our factories meet and exceed all environmental production standards.\nThe Ceramic Rite Press is designed to enhance the beauty of your brewing ritual at every level. From the moment you open the box to reveal its classic lines... To the smooth feel of timeless ceramic under your hands... To the thousandth time you lift its elegantly balanced weight to pour your perfect cup... this Rite Press is a work of art in ceramics.\nWe wanted to give our fans on Kickstarter a chance to get their hands on the Ceramic Rite Press before they hit the shelves. Get them now before prices go up.\nTo add a Rite Press to your order, add the price of the Rite Press and any additional shipping fees.\n                                                                                                      Sargam is an engineer and visionary.

Then whenever you hit a creative roadblock, you turn to those tools to look for a way through your creative brief.   \nThe problem with that however is that using another person's designs as inspiration often leads you to a result that might be a little too similar to theirs and not very YOU. \n I made The Game Of Creativity as a way to be more inspired by my own thoughts. I like to think of creativity as one's ability to make connections between 2 or more things. And The Game Of Creativity is a fun way to help you do just that very quick and easy\nHow To Play\nSo, there\u2019s a lot of different ways you can use The Game Of Creativity, but the main way is as a thought connection tool.  \nAny time you\u2019re stuck on a project, simply flip 2 cards over and write out your thoughts of how your problem could be solved with a combination of the cards. Go a step further here by using a timer to get out as many ideas as quickly as you can. Or go another step and flip over a 3rd card.\nFlip 1 card and there\u2019s 56 possibilities, Flip 2 cards and there\u2019s 1540 possible combinations. Flip 3 and you\u2019ll have over 27,720 possible ideas. And that\u2019s not including the information you bring to the cards.\nIf you're like me and science makes more sense than art, here's what that formula would look like: \nAs a practical example, I recently sat down with the cards to make something as part of my morning creating routine. I flipped over BASIC SHAPES and LIGHT.\nImmediately, I thought about creating something using a 3D software, but my mind really kept thinking about light projection. More specifically I was thinking about those perspective paintings that people do that only make sense in a single angle. I was wondering though, what if light cast things in a different dimension, like an xray machine sort of. So off I went and this is what I made.\nNow, I'm not saying my process made perfect sense, but that's the idea. My process is my process and The Game Of Creativity will help you create your own.\nStretch Goals\n$12k - Upgrade to USPCC (The company that makes Bicycle playing cards) stock, printing, seal and wrapping.

Our clubs have had a look and strong identity from the days of one-off nights in seedy Soho basements through to the rigorously branded nightclubs of today. The right shoes for the right dancefloor, the correct clothes for dancing and how we present our club nights. The look is as important as the sound. It\u2019s imprinted in our clubbing DNA.\nThe UK has given birth to some of the world's most iconic nightclub and electronic music brands. Each club is so distinct, its unique identity, sound and community of music lovers stretches far beyond the UK.\nClubbed celebrates the best graphic design in UK clubs. The book will feature logos, posters, photography, tickets, menus, cover art, signage, lanyards, fonts and, yes, flyers from the last 35 years. The deluxe hardback will feature a dazzling collection of never-before-published materials and a specially commissioned editorial from Bill Brewster.\nWriter & DJ Bill Brewster\nThe book\nThis beautifully conceived graphic design reference book is separated into chapters celebrating the UK\u2019s most famous clubs and legendary nights. We will celebrate the past, but also journey to the present, focusing on the most forward-thinking graphic designers working in clubs today. We start the journey in the 1980s with the Ha\u00e7ienda, then head off into a dizzying road journey via Mansfield, Liverpool and several points in between before alighting at the Printworks in London with some of the modern era\u2019s best graphic design work.\nMany of the graphics in the book are pre-digital and internet so a lot of time has been spent scanning old transparencies, bromides and retouching physical hard copies. In some cases the graphics have been recreated from scratch down to every minute detail. The highly-produced cover features diamond dust mimicking a dark and ethereal club environment.\nHa\u00e7ienda \u2014 Peter Saville\nCream \u2014 Farrow\nRenaissance \u2014 Dolphin (Phil Sims)\nGatecrasher \u2014 The Designers Republic\nMinistry of Sound \u2014 Spin\nSlinky \u2014 Jon Jeffrey (Biblioth\u00e8que)\nPlastic People \u2014 Ali Augur\nBedrock \u2014 David Malone\nBugged Out! \u2014 Rich Robinson\nNY Sushi \u2014 The Designers Republic\nfabric \u2014 INTRO, Jonathan Cooke & Roberto Rosolin\nMatter \u2014 Pentagram (Angus Hyland)\nFWD>> \u2014 Give Up Art\nBoiler Room \u2014 Various\nResident Advisor \u2014 Various\nThe Social \u2014 Anthony Burrill\nNumbers \u2014 Non-porous\nPrintworks \u2014 Only Studio\n\nSpecification\n\u2014 Diamond dust fabric hard cover with foil\n\u2014 360 pages approx\n\u2014 150 x 215 mm (A5)\n\u2014 CMYK litho\nTexture sample of the cover\nContributors\nThe book features some of the best designers and studios in the world:\nPeter Saville, Ben Kelly, 8vo, Spin, The Designers Republic, Mark Farrow, Jon Jeffrey (Biblioth\u00e8que), Central Station Art, Anthony Burrill, INTRO (Mat Cook), Trevor Johnson, Pentagram (Angus Hyland), Julian Morey, Tom Hingston, Trevor Jackson, Rich Robinson, Zip Design, David Malone, Neighbour (Phil Sims), Scott Parker, Baby (Simon Moore), Studio Output, Adam Tickle, Our Place, Jonathan Cooke, Roberto Rosolin, Only Studio, Nick Cobby, Give Up Art (Stuart Hammersley), John Macklin, Graham Newman, Ali Augur, Pin Studio, Dolphin, Samuel Muir, cm-pm, Martin Fewell, Unfun, Non-Porous, Thomas McCallion, Made North, Jack Featherstone, Dave Little, George Georgiou, International Magic (Adam Rodgers) & HYT Studio.\n\nClubs\nHa\u00e7ienda, fabric, Blue Note, Ministry of Sound, Cream, Home, Bedrock, Renaissance, Gatecrasher, Bed, NY Sushi, Matter, Golden, Ark, Plastic People, Sankeys, Bugged Out!, Defected, Boiler Room, Oval Space, Warm, Left Alone, Go!Zilla, Slinky, The Printworks, Dance Tunnel, Warehouse Project, Resident Advisor, FWD>>, The Social, Numbers, Left Alone, Secretsundaze.\nQuotes\n\u201cI have been very lucky to have played or been involved with many of the clubs in this book which not only forms part of my history but hundreds of thousands of clubbers over the last few decades. I am sure this book will serve as a trip down memory lane for many dedicated clubbers.\u201d\nJohn Digweed\n\"I'm a sucker for books on clubs. They were so important to me and judging by The Warehouse Project on December the 30th....still important to a lot of people.\"\nPeter Hook, Fac51 The Hacienda\n\"Great graphic design has always been intrinsically linked with our favourite record labels and I\u2019m proud to say we managed to do the same with Numbers. It\u2019s an honour to be included in this book alongside so many designers, labels and artists we admire.\"\nJackmaster\n\"Working with clubs was a lifesource for TDR\u2122. It provided regular creative outlets for 24-hour designer people with low boredom thresholds to play and experiment with new ideas and new ways to look at old ideas every month and sometimes every week. We were our own target market playing fast and loose with the visual language of a generation in desperate need of one.\"\nIan Anderson, The Designers Republic\n\"The UK's electronic music community has long been a driving force behind the advancement of club culture at a global level. This book is a well-curated graphic record capturing four decades of dance music, shining light on dedicated promoters and the designers who helped visualise their ideas.\"\nPaul Clement, Co-Founder, Resident Advisor\n\"Club culture has always been on the cutting edge of graphic design; just ask the many Mixmag readers who enjoy the adverts as much as the editorial! Even looking at some of the sample images unleashes a tsunami of nostalgia. This is a really great idea, and, as ever, Bill Brewster's involvement is the seal of quality. Very happy to support this project, and hope it is a huge success.\"\nDuncan Dick, Editor, Mixmag\n\"The graphics and visual language of club culture are so evocative. They help to define us as a generation, and stand as an emblem for what we experienced in clubs like Ha\u00e7ienda, which for me personally, would create a gateway to a new universe and inspire a lifetime of electronic music exploration.\u201d\nMary Anne Hobbs, BBC 6 Music\n\"An amazing, colourful, memory tinged reminder that club culture has spurned some amazing flyers and graphics alongside some life changing tunes.\"\nJudge Jules\nThe Author\nIn a former life, Bill Brewster was a punk rocker, a chef and also the co-editor of football magazine When Saturday Comes but has been a record nerd all of his life. He began DJing in the 1980s, but came into his own in the early 1990s, particularly during a two-year stint in New York running DMC\u2019s office, where nights at the Sound Factory and hanging out with Danny Tenaglia gave him the musical grounding you can still hear in his music today. Bill was also one of the founding residents at Fabric in London, a position he held for five years. There are few still playing regularly today that have his dedication, eclecticism and encyclopedic knowledge of music.\n\nHis parallel life is as a writer and with his long-term partner-in-crime Frank Broughton they have written four books together, including the acclaimed Last Night A DJ Saved My Life, How To DJ (Properly) and their most recent, The Record Players. The pair were also behind the legendary money-drain DJhistory.com and their party Low Life which ran for 20 years from 1995. They now spend most of their time on a yacht moored in the Manchester Shipping Canal.\n\nThe publisher\nFace37 Ltd was founded as a design studio in 2011 by Rick Banks.

Unspeakable things occurred and a drink-fused seed was planted...\nThe Basement, Amsterdam - Where it all started\nThroughout his teen years, the basement was a place of refuge for young Felix. Picture a That 70\u2019s Show-esque basement, haphazardly furnished with street-found sofas, decorated with average graffiti, and a recurring cast of friends - including our very own game illustrator, Kim, who dwelled there for many moons! (about 6 months)  \nThe basement was eventually sold and tears were shed, but the memories of that great place remained (some memories more hazy than others). The late nights and drinking games that we made up for our own amusement were at the heart of our time in the basement, and that spirit was something that Felix wanted to capture (in a small and affordable format) and bring to others.  \nHe started out by drawing over 300 cards by pencil on small blank business cards, ending up with\u2026 somewhat varied results! After figuring out the different mechanisms of the game (and an initial test run that proved to be \u201ctoo successful\u201d), Drink Drank Drunk was born! Kind of. Almost. Soon.\nWorking on a Berlin rooftop in the summer sun\nWhile working on the card details with the help of his lovely girlfriend Ylenia, Felix got back in touch with Kim. \n\u201cKim, I need your masterful hands\u201d, he said, \u201chelp me make an awesome game more awesome with your illustrations\u201d.\n\u201cYeah, ok\u201d, said Kim. \nFelix and Ylenia moved to Berlin last August in order to be closer to Kim and Maria (another basement dweller and card copywriter) in order to combine forces and get everything done. One night in August we found Masha as a unicorn raving in a Berlin forest and she quickly joined the crew, too!\nWith Kim\u2019s help the cards went from this\u2026\nThe old cards\nTo this!\nAnd now you can help us take us further and be a part of the journey that is Drink Drank Drunk the game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe production of the game is simple: \u201cit\u2019s just pieces of paper\u201d as Felix\u2019s brother put it.

I wrote it to address a major gap in creative education. I went to design school. I worked as a strategist for big agencies. I learned a lot about making creative work and handling clients. I also happened to learn next to nothing about how to actually run a business. These discussions were either happening behind closed doors or, surprisingly, not happening at all.\nSo when I had an opportunity to grow into a leadership role at A Hundred Monkeys, I was obsessed with what I didn't know\u2013mainly, how to actually run a company. So to soothe my obsession, I immersed myself in every decent management book, podcast, and case study I could find. I was surprised to find that there really wasn't anything out there that focused on creative businesses so I ended up taking a lot of ideas and practices from other fields and seeing what made sense for my studio.\nWhat started as a deep dive turned into an ongoing practice. Every new resource gave me something valuable I could implement or experiment with. I learned that a small creative studio is the ideal test bed for developing a business. When you're small and open to change, you can make changes in a day that would take a larger organization a year. So after years of learning, experimenting, and developing processes that have steadily grown A Hundred Monkeys, I wanted to share everything I have learned in order to help creative leaders stabilize and grow their businesses. As they say, it's always better to learn from other people's mistakes.\nRun Studio Run is a step-by-step guide that helps you look at your studio critically\u2014as a business as opposed to an artistic endeavor. You will establish goals and paths for reaching them. You will see that the more of your business you can commit to process, the more you will free yourself up to do the work you really love.\nWe're going to work on:\nYour offering\nStudio processes\nGoal setting\nResponsibilities and delegation\nMeasuring success\nFinding new work\nThe competition\nNegotiation and agreements\nBookkeeping and accounting\nMeetings\nStudio culture\nAnd a lot more\nThe book and other rewards are being designed by the lovely team at Moniker in San Francisco. Printing/sourcing/materials are being handled by Extracurricular Press.\nBecause I'm sure the way we do it at A Hundred Monkeys isn't the only way to do it, Run Studio Run is filled with insights and tips from the leaders of a diverse range of studios including: Commercial Type, Draplin Design Co., Hey Studio, High Pressure Zone, Kate Bingaman-Burt, Manual, Moniker, Mikey Burton, OCD, Perky Bros., Stansion, Tung, Under Consideration, and The Weekend Press.\nAbout the author: Eli Altman is creative director at A Hundred Monkeys, the Berkeley-based naming and branding studio. He has led projects for clients including Google, Samsung, and Target\u2013as well as a wide variety of bars, restaurants and startups. Before joining A Hundred Monkeys in 2009 Eli worked as a strategist at MetaDesign and Factor Design in San Francisco. He has been interviewed on naming and branding with The New York Times, NPR, The Guardian, Inc., and 99% Invisible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile making a book presents plenty of challenges, this is not our first rodeo. The book is already written and in the process of being edited. This is the third book being produced by the team behind Run Studio Run. We learned a lot producing two editions of Don't Call It That and are working with the same editor, copy editor, print broker and printer. Since the books are being printed in Hong Kong, clearing Customs introduces some variability but in the past we haven't run into any hitches.\n\nThe main reason we're doing this as a Kickstarter is that we couldn't accurately estimate the demand for the book. Don't Call It That was very niche and this is a lot more broadly applicable so we didn't want to gamble by producing way too many or too few books.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital copy of Run Studio Run", "descp": "A digital copy of Run Studio Run in epub and mobi formats (kindle+most e-readers).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["271 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Hard copy of the book + 3 art prints", "descp": "Your very own first edition, hardcover copy of Run Studio Run.

Only 50 sets were made and they are now so rare that it is impossible to buy an original one. Read more about the history of the Dubrovnik set here.\nRedesigned for 3D Printing\nThis new set is inspired by the original Dubrovnik design, but updated and improved for 3D printing. Overhangs on the collars have been replaced with elegant curves that allow the pieces to be printed without supports. Only the knight requires some small supports under the mouth. The bases are hollow to decrease print-time and also to allow weights to be added. \nTournament size\nWhen printed at 100% your pieces are ideal for tournament size chess boards with squares of 5cm or larger but the set can easily be re-scaled to fit any chess board. \nA distinctive feature of the Dubrovnik design is the opposite colored finials on the bishops. In an attempt to modernize the appearance of the chess pieces, religious symbols were removed - the king has a sphere on his crown instead of a cross, and the bishops do not have the traditional split mitre hats. The colored finials make the bishops easier to distinguish. The bishops in this set are provided in two versions - one complete bishop allowing you to paint or stain the color by hand, and a version where the finials can be printed separately in a different material and glued in place.\nTest it on your printer now!\nBackers will also receive a detailed printing and assembly guide PDF with tips on print settings, optimizing supports for the knight, post-printing treatment such as staining woodfil pieces and weighting and felting the bases. The first few pages of the assembly guide containing the print settings are available here for free so you can try printing the king and pawn right away. Download the king and pawn STL files here.\nCustom Rooks\nWant a personalized set but don't know any CAD software? Purchase the custom rooks tier and you can request any character from a true-type font embossed in your rooks. You can even select characters from the Symbol or Wingdings fonts (shown below is the Leo astrological sign from Wingdings). A customized chess set makes a great gift.\nNo printer?\nBackers receive DRM-free STL files that will work on any 3D printer. You can send the files to a friend with a 3D printer to make them for you, or upload them to any online 3D-printing service and have them printed in the material of your choice.\nFirst stretch goal - $500\nFor those of you who like the classic bishop design with the split mitre hat, I've added a stretch goat with this piece. All backers will receive the new bishop model if this goal is reached.\nSecond stretch goal - $700\nStretch goal 2 features more design variations requested by members of the chess.com forums.\nDubrovnik I style bishop. The original bishop design in included in this set is similar to the 1970 Dubrovnik II bishop with the flatter top to the hat. This stretch goal redesign is based on the 1950 Dubrovnik I bishop with the elliptical hat. The model is provided in one piece for painting the opposite colored finial, or in two pieces for printing in two materials.\nThe Zagreb set is a newer design with many similarities to the Dubrovnik set, but it features opposite colored finials on the queen and king as well as the bishop. The king also has a more traditional cross-shaped finial. The king's cross is designed to be printed lying flat and then glued into place in a slot in the head.\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 15 or more", "title": "STL files and instructions", "descp": "STL files for the entire chess set, ready to 3D print.\nFull color 15-page PDF printing and assembly guide.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["61 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 25 or more", "title": "Customized rook", "descp": "In addition to the standard reward of the STL files and printing and assembly guide PDF, this tier includes the option to customize your rook with an initial or symbol.

This lucky duck will get:\nAn entirely customized Itchy Feet card game: I'll make an Itchy Feetized character in your likeness, then replace every instance of the Itchy Feet guy on the cards with your cartoony doppelg\u00e4nger. The ultimate, one-of-a-kind, personalized deck from yours truly, with 1,000 thanks!\nFree worldwide shipping, because duh\nI'm Malachi Ray Rempen (above right), the creator of Itchy Feet: the Travel and Language Comic (new one every Sunday!), and I've hand drawn all 90 cards in the deck in the Itchy Feet style (AKA bulgy-eyed potato people with stick figure limbs). Most cards also feature:\nHumorous made-up quotes\nSilly objects\nVisual puns\nIf you're opposed to these things you will NOT like this game.\nWhen someone suggested I make an Itchy Feet-themed card game, I loved the idea but had no idea where to begin. Lucky for me, Canadian game designer, polyglot, traveler and all-around lovely human being Maxime Rioux (above left) volunteered his services. \nFor more than a year and a half we've been brainstorming, designing, scrapping, re-designing, experimenting, tinkering and testing, testing, testing.\nWe started long distance (I live in Germany, Maxime in Quebec), using a half-defunct web-based software called Tabloro to fiddle and test, including many very fun sessions with Itchy Feet fans over Skype (thank you, friends!).\nThen we played with handwritten flash cards, refining and re-jiggering and trying new ideas. We've been absolutely ruthless with it, only hanging on to the very best parts and cutting away any and all fat. \nWe wanted to create a game that was: \nSimple to learn\nInteractive\nFun to replay again and again\nNeither of us are huge gamers, so this was a high bar. It had to be something that we would love. With Itchy Feet: the Travel Game, we really believe we've succeeded. Our testers have been knocking our door down, wanting to keep playing. Everyone who's played it has been bowled over by its charm, simplicity, and good fun.\nWe really think you're going to enjoy it, too.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game is finished and ready to go, so I'm confident we can make this happen.

Maybe some of you have even played a \"round\" of it recently. We've taken this old classic and put it through the apocalyptic ringer.\nThe lowest score still wins, but now you can use attack cards like Zombie Gophers to slow your opponents down or defense cards like Zombie Urine to prevent others from ruining your grid. The game is played with 2-6 players. It's fast, full of strategy, and turns everyone into closest allies or worst enemies. Sadly, only one of you will make it out alive - but look on the bright side; if you die, you're undead.\nAfter one hundred hours of gameplay testing, with layer after layer of refining and fine tuning, we've chosen a few of our favorite remarks from participants.\nPLAY\n\n\"I can confidently say that this is better than The Cones of Dunshire.\"\n- Alex, 23\nPLAY\n\nSetup\n1) Shuffle the deck of Stroke cards and deal nine facedown to each player. Each player should then arrange the Stroke cards into a 3 x 3 (or 2 x 3) grid without looking at them.\n2) Shuffle the Action cards and deal three to each player. Each player should look at their Action cards without showing them to their opponents.\n3) Put each deck in the center of the table, creating two separate draw piles. Flip over one card from each to start discard piles.\nScoring\n1) Over the course of the game, players try to get the lowest score possible by flipping over facedown cards and replacing higher-stroke cards with lower-stroke cards.\n2) Each player sums the total number of strokes in his or her grid. Each card is worth its stroke count, with these exceptions:\na. If a player gets three-in-a-row of the same Stroke card (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they cancel each other out and are worth zero.\nb. Wild cards are worth zero points, unless they are used to get a three-in-a-row, in which case they are worth the same stroke count as the other cards in their row. \n3) At the end of the game, the player with the lowest score wins.\nRules\n1) The player to the left of the dealer goes first and the game moves in a clockwise direction.\n2) No rearranging cards within your grid without using the right Action card.\n3) Each turn consists of a Stroke Phase and an Action Phase.\n4) During the Stroke Phase of a player\u2019s turn, the player must do one of the following:\na. Flip over one of the facedown Stroke cards in his or her 3 x 3 grid. \nb. Draw the top card from the Stroke card draw pile and either replace one of the cards in his or her grid with it (face-up or facedown) or discard it by placing it on top of the discard pile. \n     or\nc. Select the top card of the Stroke card discard pile and replace one of the cards in his or her grid with it (face-up or facedown). \n5) During the Action Phase of a player\u2019s turn, the player may play one Action card by placing it on top of the Action card discard pile. \n6) If several players play the Sacrificial Caddy (see below) in one turn, they must wait until the end of the turn to replenish their hand to three Action cards.\nEnding The Game\n1) Play 2 rounds (9 cards x 2 rounds=18 holes). The player with the lowest cumulative score wins.\n2) Once a player has all 9 of their Stroke cards face-up, the remaining players have one final turn before the round ends.\n3) If a player flips over all 9 Stroke cards in their final turn, he or she is immune from attacks for the rest of the final turn.\n4) Once the final turn ends, all players turn over any remaining facedown Stroke cards and count their scores.\nIt's complicated enough trying to stay alive while playing a round of apocalyptic golf, so we kept the rewards simple.

We get community screening requests every week and have been thrilled by the overwhelmingly positive audience response to the film. Here\u2019s what some reviewers have said about the film:\n\"Unimaginably intimate.\u201d - The New Yorker\n\"Powerful. Fascinating.\" - Indiewire\n\"Touching, funny and strangely existential.\" - The Hollywood Reporter\n\u201cA beautiful, tragic attempt to press pause\u2026 the most memorable documentary about video game production ever made.\u201d - Ars Technica\nWhether it\u2019s gamers/developers, doctors, nurses, art therapists, or parents, it has become clear that there is a wide and receptive audience and people who want to share this film with their communities. Our goals with this Kickstarter campaign are: 1) to bring the film to a wide audience in theaters in the US/Canada, and 2) to connect directly with various communities worldwide to allow them to host their own screenings, whether its for indie game developers, hospital staff, students, social workers, and more.\nWhy theaters and community screenings? Although the film deals with a challenging topic, Thank You For Playing is an inspiring and powerful personal story that really comes alive on the big screen with an audience. What\u2019s more, the film documents the creation of the critically-acclaimed, recently-released video game, That Dragon, Cancer. We plan to use these screenings to bring both the film and the game to gaming and non-gaming audiences alike, and start unique conversations around video games, art, technology, and bereavement. Imagine being able to watch the film in a packed theater, then play the game on consoles in the lobby, and then talk with the game team and your fellow moviegoers about the experience all in one evening! We've done this at a few film festivals already and seen what a great impact this unique combination can have. Now we can make it happen across North America, and even further afield!\nSo, please watch our video and read below to learn more about what we\u2019re doing and how you can help. Then reserve your personal copy of the film, or book a public screening copy for your school, community, or company, and take a look at the other rewards for backers who join us!\nWHAT IS THE FILM ABOUT?\nThank You For Playing follows indie video game developers Ryan and Amy Green over 18 months as they build an unusual and poetic video game about their emotional journey raising Joel, their young son who was diagnosed with brain cancer.\nThroughout their creative process, Ryan and Amy must decide where to draw the line in sharing their family\u2019s experiences of raising a dying child. From having their sons reenact difficult conversations, to recording Joel\u2019s giggle, to painstakingly photographing every detail of the hospital, their lives become consumed by the complicated process of creating a digital world that mirrors their own, even as they continue to love and care for their son.\nThe result is a game called \"That Dragon, Cancer\" - an astoundingly honest and innovative work of art about the universal complexity of grief. Our documentary, Thank You For Playing combines footage from Ryan and Amy's real and animated worlds to offer an intimate and thought-provoking glimpse into how the fusion of art and technology - in this case, a video game - can be used to document profound human experiences in the modern age.\nThis film was made independently of the game and its creators, by a completely separate creative team. However, throughout the process, we've had the pleasure of getting to know Ryan and Amy, and their developer partner Josh Larson extremely well. We have been inspired by their story, and we hope you will be too.\nWHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS MOVIE?\nVideo games and interactive media are emerging as a wildly innovative art form. At the same time, society is questioning our dependence on technology more than ever: It seems to be bringing us closer together and yet farther apart. We are fascinated by this tension, which is why we set out to make Thank You for Playing.\nFrom the moment we first heard about Ryan and Amy Green\u2019s video game, \u201cThat Dragon, Cancer,\u201d we wanted to know more about why the couple had chosen a medium so often associated with explosions and violence to convey one of the most emotional and spiritually challenging experiences a family can face: raising a young child with a terrible disease. Once we saw for ourselves how many people were profoundly moved by the game, and how playing it often facilitated more, rather than less, social interaction, we were hooked and knew we had to keep following this story. The fact that a video game was capable of awakening this sort of empathy astounded us, and we soon realized that Ryan isn\u2019t only a video game developer, he\u2019s also an artist\u2014and programming is his paintbrush.\nThank You for Playing explores the very personal experiences of a family battling cancer and the beauty and hope that can be found in the artistic process, while also examining the age-old question of where the boundaries lie in representing difficult emotional experiences in art.\nThe response to the film has been wonderful, with press coverage from:\nREWARDS PRIMER:\nThere's a full list of rewards on the right, and here's a basic highlight of some popular ones:\n$150 - Your own personal Q&A with us and/or the game team/stars of the documentary - ask anything!\n$190 - Be our special guests at the NYC Premiere!\n+ TONS more options, including hosting a screening, education copies, personal q&as, posters, and more!\nCAN I HOST A SCREENING AT MY SCHOOL, GAMER GROUP, HOSPITAL, CHURCH, COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION? AND HOW DO I DO IT?\nYes you can! Among our rewards on the right is the opportunity to book the film for a screening for your community. Typically, if you're screening a film to a club or organization, you need what's called a public performance license (read more about that here). During the time of our Kickstarter campaign, we're offering a unique discounted deal: 1 screening with a public performance license and a filmmaker Skype Q&A for $195 for non profits, and $295 for other organizations. Or an educational copy of the film - yours to keep and screen as often as you like, for $350. All three of these will allow you to use a screening of the film in any way you choose - as a fundraiser, a community event, etc. This is significantly cheaper than standard rates, and available only during our Kickstarter campaign, so worth snapping up now! And of course, if you have any questions about any of this, feel free to email us: info@thankyouforplayingfilm.com.\nWHERE YOUR MONEY GOES:\nReleasing a film is expensive, and $35,000 is the minimum amount we need to raise to make it happen. If we manage to raise more than that, we\u2019ll be able to bring the film to even more locations. We\u2019re working with indie film distributor FilmBuff to book theaters, and manage the digital release of the film. And we\u2019re excited to be launching a grassroots screening tour (often free to the public) in community centers, churches and campuses around the world.\nWe're also inviting community organizations, game development groups, universities and others to book their own screenings through this Kickstarter. If you represent one of these groups, you can do a screening as an educational or fundraising tool, and simultaneously help bring this remarkable story to wider audiences through the theatrical release.\nKickstarter is an all-or-nothing platform, so if we don\u2019t raise our full goal within 30 days, none of the pledges will be charged and we\u2019ll end up with nothing\u2014and we\u2019ll have to cancel the theatrical release. So please give what you can\u2014and then help us spread the word!\nI CAN\u2019T AFFORD TO DONATE, CAN I HELP SOME OTHER WAY?\nYES! While even just a small donation would be tremendously helpful (every penny counts!), you can also SHARE this page on your Facebook or Twitter feed, or SIGN UP for our mailing list to stay in touch with the film. And you can follow the film on Facebook and Twitter for updates.\nAND DON\u2019T FORGET TO CHECK OUT THE GAME!\nThe video game that Ryan, Amy and Josh created was released in January.

He's a struggling comedian and hypochondriac convinced that he\u2019s dying from a bizarre array of symptoms. Out of options and armed with a binder full of WebMD printouts, he flies cross-country to his quaint hometown in upstate New York to consult with his five childhood doctors in a single day, planning to take the red-eye back to L.A. that night without seeing any of his friends or family. The only exception is Jay- the sweet, emotionally repressed townie Spencer convinces to chauffeur him around.\nTHE FILM IS COMPLETE. NOW, WE NEED HELP GETTING IT OVER THE FINISH LINE.  \nWe shot this film in March/April of last year, and after months of editing, the film is picture locked and we are feeling great about how it's coming together. In addition to starring Matt and Max, the film features Bobby Moynihan, Eddie Pepitone, Adam Dannheisser, Jeremy Shamos, Emily Walton, Peter Friedman, Jenn Harris, Joe Pera, and many other incredible performers.\nWe've been really lucky that we've been able to pull together the budget necessary to get the film this far. And now, we are beginning our final push to actually finish it!\nEmily Walton as \"Lisa\"\nWHERE WILL THE MONEY WILL GO?\nThe final steps are simple, but they are expensive. Color correction, score composition, recording, mixing, licensing existing music, as well as a handful of distribution and festival-related expenses that will start popping up very soon. This includes creating a DCP of the film to screen in theaters, as well as paying for festival submissions, travel, and the designing and production of promotional materials.\nEddie Pepitone as \"Boris\"\nFROM THE FILMMAKERS\nThis project was born during a three-hour slog through morning traffic on the Hutchinson parkway\u2014 New York City headed upstate. It\u2019s a pilgrimage that the three of us, small-town guys living in the city, know intimately. The trip generally happens after a year or more of absence from said hometown, when messages from old classmates pile up and calls from parents have reached a high Jewish fever pitch. Going home isn\u2019t easy for anyone. It\u2019s even harder when you\u2019re young, in flux, just starting to build a \u201chome\u201d somewhere else. So: why go? More often than not, it\u2019s because you have an irregular mole and Dr. Zackler is your go-to guy for moles.\nWhen we started writing \u201c5 DOCTORS,\u201d we wanted to look at why a person might carry so much anxiety about seeing their family and friends, avoiding their hometown like the plague but still desperate to suck every ounce of comfort and reassurance possible out of being there. The only way we knew how to make this movie was by keeping it honest and uncomfortably personal from soup to nuts. We wrote the characters of Jay and Spencer specifically for Max and Matt, and their rapport is the beating heart of our movie. We filmed in Hastings-on- Hudson, NY, where Max and Phil grew up and Matt would come through most weekends to attend house parties and briefly kiss girls. Every piece of our film- from camera to production design to performance- reflects that familiarity. This is a movie about nostalgia and panic happening at the same time, and you can see them duking it out in just about every frame.\nWhen we began this process more than two years ago, we wanted to make \u201c5 DOCTORS\u201d because we knew that our story was personal enough, funny enough, tender enough, uncomfortable enough- we wanted it to represent us and our approach to making movies to the entire world. In pre-production, we asked ourselves the same question that keeps every filmmaker up the night before they first go to set: would we wind up with that movie?\nAfter we charged through the whirlwind of production, had the honor of collaborating with our amazing crew and acting alongside some of our personal heroes, the dust settled and we realized that we actually wound up with something better. We could more than fill this paragraph with poetic examples, but we\u2019re happy to say that the strongest endorsement we can give is: watch the trailer for our film below. We hope you\u2019ll want to be a part of it.\nBest, \nPhil, Matt and Max\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \nExtra special thanks to Jacob Blumberg, who shot our Kickstarter video.

It worked really, really well (with a few tweaks).\nAnd now we think our game, Joking Hazard, is ready to bring to the world.

NO PROBLEM PLEDGING FROM OUTSIDE THE UK!  KICKSTARTER ACCEPTS ALL CURRENCIES!! \nOFFICIAL DHMIS T SHIRT DESIGN  #1 REVEALED!!!\n(For more info on the other 2 DHMIS t-shirts check the latest update in the update section above)\n******NEW REWARD*******\n\u00a315! Digital Downloads of all episodes, the DHMIS album, in the Fanclub PLUS you get the Official A2 poster-and if you like we'll sign it!!\nWHY BOTHER?\nImagine a show that can teach you ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING in short musical installments. That show is Don't Hug Me I'm Scared.\nSo far we have covered two of life's most important lessons in these videos, but surely this can't be the end for the puppets? Can it? CAN IT?\nWe've been blown away by the response to the first 2 episodes, not just the amount of views that the videos have had or the festivals they have played at around the world, but also the amount of fans that DHMIS has accumulated. \nIt's totally spurred us on to make this show into a full series and we think doing it independently through Kickstarter, funded by the fans, is the way to go. \nRight now we are both very excited about the new ideas we have for more episodes, made directly for the WIDE WEB, and continuing to teach all the answers to life's most puzzling questions\u2026.\nWhere do dogs live? \nWhy are we here, and what is the purpose of Life?\nWhy do I constantly hear the sound of crabs screaming in my head?\nWhy is this pillowcase full of ham?\nDON'T WORRY!!! All questions will be answered in Time.\n4 NEW EPISODES!\nLike Creativity and Time, in the following 4 episodes we want to introduce 4 NEW characters that will guide the friends through 4 new important subjects. \nAlthough we can't reveal what the topics will be right now, we can say that eventually the puppets will understand everything and all will be revealed\u2026\u2026\nBUT WHY KICKSTARTER??????????????\nThe first two episodes were essentially self-funded projects, made with the help of lots of talented people who worked for free and something we were only able to work on between other jobs \u2013 hence why it takes years between each episode.\nContinuing to make the show this way without a proper budget means it could take many years to complete and we'll all be dead by the time episode 3 comes out. \nIS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? FOR US TO DIE?? MAKING A PUPPET SHOW???\nBUT, if successful, not only will we be able to commit to DHMIS full time but we will be able to really push each episode, making the show a BIGGER and more in-depth journey into the world of DHMIS!\nAnd the best thing is we won't have to compromise or change our ideas, we can keep in all the rotten pig heart cakes and dead fish because we want to have rotten pig heart cakes and dead fish!\n  \u00a324,000 per episode seems like a lot of money, but making a show that mixes live action, stop motion, 2d animation and puppetry tends to be a bit pricey. However, we believe that the final outcome is well worth it. \nHere's a very brief summary of where the money will go on each episode.\nPre-production: Writing, storyboarding, creating an animatic, characters and concept designs.\nAudio: writing and recording the music, all the voices and sound design.\nProduction: Building all the sets, puppets, props, models and the cost of all materials.\nShooting: Studio time, location costs, crew, lights, camera and lots and lots of stress.\nPost production: editing, compositing, adding 2d or CG animation and lots more dull digital work.\nTHE REWARDS\nMaking this show is something we have been excited about for a long time, so if we are fortunate enough to reach our goal, we want to say thanks with some special DHMIS rewards.\n( PLEASE NOTE: PLEDGING FROM THE USA, OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL PLACES IS NOT A PROBLEM AND WILL BE CONVERTED TO BRITISH POUNDS )\nFor just \u00a35 you will be able to download each episode as soon as they come out, DRM-Free!\n\u00a38 will get you downloads to all episodes as they come out, plus the DHMIS album with all songs, karaoke versions and a few extra tracks.\n\u00a315: You'll get the downloads to all episodes and the DHMIS album plus become part of the OFFICIAL DHMIS FANDOM.

Not able to find a wallet that lets us carry the \u2018in-between\u2019 coins, we decided to make Poquito. A front-pocket wallet that carries your essential: cash, cards, and even coins. A little more than most, yet just enough to maintain a slim profile.\nIt is precision machined from one solid piece of wood - with a custom molded elastomer strap that securely holds everything in place. Each and every Poquito wallet is hand polished, making it a pleasure to handle all-day everyday.\nWood Selection\nBlack Walnut\nGrains are usually straight but patterns such as curl, crotch, and burl can also sometimes be seen. With a moderate natural lustre that will develop patina shine with use. Colour can sometimes have a grey, purple, or reddish cast. Black Walnut is rated highly in terms of durability and decay resistance. Sustainably harvested in Ohio, Midwest US.\nWhite Oak\nColour can vary from nearly white to light brown. Olive cast is often seen with prominent ray fleck pattern. Grain is coarse with larger pores - a prominent feature on Oak. White Oak is very durable, and is often used in boatbuilding. It also has a mellow odour common in Oak, that most people find appealing. Sustainably harvested in New York state, US.\nBlack Cherry (Subject to Stretch Goal)\nClose grain and smooth fine texture. Mostly straight but curly grain patterns are not uncommon. Over time and with exposure to light, the wood will darken into deep golden brown. Black Cherry is well known for being an all-around wood in terms of durability and workability. With high resistance to decay. Sustainably harvested in Ontario, Canada.\nPoquito's quick access groove lets you get to a frequently used card with ease.\nWhite Oak & Black Walnut\nMolded elastomer strap to securely hold up to 6 cards and some cash (Inside and outside)\nPledging for Additional Strap\nEach wallet comes with one strap as a standard (unless we get to our 1000 backers stretch goal). If you'd like to get an additional strap/s please follow the guide to pledge the correct amount:\nCoins are inevitable. We made a little compartment for it - just in case\nPrecision machined wood interior\nThe Madera logo is debossed on the strap and laser-etched on the wood.\nOur Story\nA Modern Wallet\nFor us the ideal wallet is a wallet that we enjoy having in our pocket, feel in our hands, and that simply works. We want something to help us carry 'enough' of the essentials without bulking up our pocket. Poquito is the result of a year designing, prototyping, and refining every details. Making it something we truly enjoy using - everyday.\nBy backing this project you will help us to make our first order and pay for the tooling with an experienced manufacturer. Ensuring the highest of quality and control in production.\nWood & Sustainability\nWood apart from being one of the oldest material known to man, also leave behind smaller carbon footprint and in some cases negative footprint (trees use and store carbon to grow). Requiring less to process in comparison with leather or metal - and continues to store carbon until it is released by burning it.\nEvery Poquito wallet is heat treated, precision cut, hand polished and sealed - to ensure a wallet that will compliment you for years to come.\nMadera = Wood\nOur passion for wood drives us to challenge the convention of what is possible with wood products. We believe in simple and honest design that works to improve our everyday life. We want to make products that create lasting relationship with the users. Wood objects that are made to be loved and to last.\nProcess & Materials\nWe set out to create an open-back shell and rubber strap wallet with ultra simple construction that eliminates unnecessary dividers. With this we wanted to make sure that the cards will still be highly accessible. We prototyped countless straps to ensure the balance between elasticity and reliability. Opting to use molded rubber straps instead of woven elastics for better control in production.\nWalnut, Oak, and Cherry are well known for their workability and resistance to decay. An important factor for us to consider - as the wallet will be exposed to humidity, contact, and everyday wear.\nAn early aluminium sheet mock-up\nProduction Schedule\nAfter a few months of intensive prototyping, we have arrived at a finalised form/function that we are satisfied with. With a successful project at Kickstarter, we will rapidly move to manufacturing and delivery.\nDecember: Final product refinements. \nJanuary: Finalise manufacturing requirements & place order. \nFebruary: Quality control procedure. \nMarch: Final QC checks and delivery.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have dedicated countless of hours working together with an experienced manufacturer - trying to mitigate as much risks in all aspects of the product.

THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nTHANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HAS HELPED MAKE GEARED A REALITY! IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU AND YOU'LL ALL FOREVER BE A PART OF GEARED! THANK YOU!\nGeared is a 2-4 player bike building card game where players must race against each other to put together as many bikes as they can and be the first one to earn 1000 points. However, watch out for other players who may try to sabotage your bike builds by removing, stealing, or swapping your parts.\nWhether or not the parts are all the same level determines how much a build is worth. The higher the level of parts, the more points you could earn. You can focus on playing one Parts Card at a time, or you could build a matching bike in your hand and play a build combo to lay it all down at once.\nOnce a build is complete, its Parts Cards can not be used again. This makes it important to complete a bike only when you know its Parts couldn't be used for a better build. In order to build the best bikes and earn the most points, you must be smart about when and how you lay parts down.\nGeared is designed for ages 12 and up and a typical game takes 20-30 minutes.\nGeared comes with 96 cards (5 different levels of Parts Cards, 3 types of Action Cards, 3 Wild Cards) and a folded set of instructions.\nBelow is a growing list of articles, interviews, and press releases featuring Geared. If you're interested in featuring Geared on your blog or website, get in touch with me at gearedcardgame@gmail.com.\n\u201c\u2026players will quite literally (as literal as tabletop gaming can get) be in for the rides of their lives.\u201d \u2013 Vince, DadsGamingAddiction.com\n(See the full press release at http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/press-release-geared-seeking-support-on-kickstarter/)\n\u201cI always loved finishing an 80-100 mile day of riding by relaxing and working on my bike.

You get Geared...\" - Article on Gameskinny\n(Read the full article at http://www.gameskinny.com/53cg2/geared-new-card-game-challenges-players-to-build-bikes)\nStarting the Game\nPlayers start off by choosing a dealer and having them shuffle the cards.\nThe dealer then gives each player 5 cards.\nThe person to the left of the dealer is the one who begins play.\nDuring Your Turn\nYou can play a Parts Card to start or continue building a bike or you can play an Action Card to Remove, Steal, or Swap a Parts Card that another player has already played.\nYou can only play one card per turn. However, a player may play up to three Parts Cards in one turn only if all three cards being played are of the same level.\nYou may freely move Parts Cards between your incomplete builds.\nAt the end of your turn, you must draw the exact number of cards played during your turn.\nBuilding a Bike\nTo build a bike, you must combine a Frame Card, Handlebars Card, and Wheels Card in the playing area in front of you. \nThe Part Levels do not have to match for a build to complete. \nYou can earn more points by completing a Set Build where all three Parts in the build of the same level.\nScoring and Winning\nTo win, a player must be the first one to earn 1000 points by building complete bikes.\nPlayers earn a total amount of Set Points for a build when all three parts within the build are of the same level.\nPlayers add up the individual Part Points for a build when all three parts are not the same level.\nSo we can just get it out of the way, I love bikes! After I rode 4,000 miles for M.S. across the United States in 2012, I immediately became hooked. There's something about being on a bike that is unlike anything else. A bike can help you commute, exercise, or just have a good time.\nFor a long time, I wanted to play a game that involved bikes. However, there weren't too many of them that I could find that were easy to understand and a lot of fun to play. That's when I decided to come up with my own. Not only do I love bikes, but I love seeing others get involved with bikes and experience the open road like I was fortunate enough to do.\nI knew that I wanted to create a game that had to do with bikes, was easy to learn, simple to play, and could still keep you entertained, game after game. After a lot of brainstorming, trial and error, play testing, and design, Geared was born. \nMe at the starting point in Yorktown, Virginia\nOver the past several months, I have spent hundreds of hours developing the game, refining the mechanics, designing all of the artwork and packaging, developing and designing the website, shooting and editing the video, and much, much more. Fortunately, because of my experience in design, I was able to do much of this myself and save a lot of money in doing so. However, I have taken the game as far as I can on my own. This is where you come in. \nAll of the artwork and graphics are 100% complete, the game play is finalized, the rules are finished, and I am so close to being able to hit the green light and go into production. There is only one thing that Geared lacks, funding. With the support of backers, I'll be able to manufacture and ship the game.\nThe whole process of creating Geared has been an amazing experience and I have learned more than I ever would have imagined. To see Geared make it this far puts a big smile on my face. I am so close to seeing Geared become a reality and the only way that I can get there is with your help. The best part is, by helping fund Geared, you get to be a part of it's creation. You can also help by spreading the word about Geared. Share the project page, tell a friend, or feature Geared in your blog.\nTo everyone who has helped Geared get this far, spread the word, or just checked out the project, THANK YOU! Your support is what drives me to move forward with Geared and I could not do this without you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a graphic designer, I know the importance of a deadline and delivering on time. The cards, the rules, the box, everything that needs to be designed for the game is 100% complete. I have spoken with manufacturers and distributors to get you the game as quickly as possible. However, as with any large print run there is always a chance that something could go wrong but I have been working hard to reduce all risks as much as possible. I know how important communication is with projects like these, if there is a delay for whatever reason, I promise to keep everyone updated.\n\nIf anyone does pledge to get their own personal bikes within the game, there is the risk that it could take longer than anticipated to receive the picture of their bikes. Ideally, I would like to receive these the day after the project ends, but there is still the chance of delay. However, because I will be doing the designs of the bikes myself, it saves a lot of time that would be spent dealing with an outside designer's schedule. This will allow me to get you the game as quickly as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "The (Almost) Final Update", "update_content": "Wow, what an amazing journey this has been.\nToday marks four months since Geared was launched on Kickstarter.

For the past seven years, I've had the pleasure of touring around the country in a band with my husband, Drew Holcomb. I have always loved writing and playing with our band, but in 2011, Drew encouraged me to record a handful of my own songs. What started as a little side project of recording songs that I'd written based out of the Psalms has turned into something that I can't help but doing! Last year, in the middle of a crazy touring schedule with our band and over the course of 9 months of being pregnant, I wrote every chance I got. I would sit in God's word, and just let music come out. I wrote songs in the van, in venues across the country, and with a handful of other writers on days off in Nashville. By the time we welcomed our little girl into the world, I had a precious baby to hold and 45 new songs to sing. We released a few of them this past August on an EP called With You Now, but we're now in the process of making my very first full length, record!!\nAs Sure As The Sun will have 10 brand new songs, all with scripture woven into the lyrics. My heart with this music is to sing truth into the darkness. I know that the world can get pretty dark some days, and I'd love to be sending out songs like little campfires to light up the night. When I write, I am usually just trying to remind myself of what is true, and my highest hope is that these songs will be reminders of truth to those who listen, that they will refresh, encourage, and bless.\nBut here's the thing, I need your help to do this! We have already made the record, but we haven't paid for it yet and we would love for as many people to hear these songs as possible. That requires a marketing and distribution budget that we don't have either. It feels crazy to branch out on my own, apart from our band, to make this music, but I really do believe in these songs. And I would just love for YOU to be the reason we are able to share them with a LOT of other people. Get this, the more support we gain through Kickstarter, the better we'll be able to promote and share and market this record.\nWhy $40,000? First and foremost, we need to pay the people that helped make this music! There are studio costs, musicians that played on the album, engineers, photography, & graphic design - essentially 15 amazing people that helped turn these thoughts and sounds into something I can't wait to share! Additionally, we are hoping to raise MORE money so that we can afford to properly SHARE this music with the world. We want the most people possible to hear it and hopefully be impacted & blessed by these songs. The team we'd like to build would consist of a publicist to try and garner reviews, several radio reps to attempt to get this music on radio stations (EEEK!), distributors to push this music into stores (WHAT?!), and several other team players. To give this album the chance we all think it deserves, it will cost closer to $80,000. For $40,000, we can give it an honest shot - but much more will end up being spent trying to ensure it's success. So, if we are fortunate enough to reach our goal - please keep spreading the word!\nI am so honored that you would even consider taking this journey with me, that you\u2019d want to help me make and share this music. I seriously could not do this without you. Here\u2019s to hoping that these songs will be a blessing in your life and in the lives of many.\nGrateful. Humbled.
