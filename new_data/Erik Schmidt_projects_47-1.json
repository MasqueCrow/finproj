[{"backer": "Erik Schmidt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The RPGSEA spaces are some of the most exciting and innovative collections of voices in the tabletop games scene at the moment. Pairing sharp mechanics with unique, breathtaking settings, creators from all across South East Asia are putting out games that challenge the way we think about tabletop gaming and rapidly building a legacy that will undoubtedly change the face of tabletop RPGs forever.\nNow, in collaboration with Sandy Pug Games, four of the biggest names in this community are combining their powers to create a compilation of three amazing games showcasing exactly why RPGSEA is the community to watch right now.\nEvery backer at the core level and above will get digital copies of all three games, and potentially much, much more! See our stretch goals for more details, but for now, let's say hello to the squad, and their games!\nNote: Due to difficulties in working across borders, this project is digital PDF only.\nCheck out the launch party with an extensive interview with the team right here!\nSinta Posadas is a game designer, illustrator and layout artist from the Philippines. They make games about sentient plants, love, revolution and the Apocalypse. They enjoy making games that are often built with themes that explore human connections through sometimes non human lens.\nPam Punzalan is a game designer, writer, editor, sensitivity & cultural consultant, and community organizer from the Philippines. Her games are explorations on the fringe, reclamations of topics and themes that are often barred to her and her own, adaptations of popular tropes and archetypes, and a good mix of sweetness and light that dances on the darker edges of human experiences.\nNavathem's End is a clever kitbash of concepts and mechanics from Powered By The Apocalypse and Forged In the Dark, where you play as Agents of a Tower trying to stop the Apocalypse. Play in a dazzling, chaotic, broken world where you're the last line of defense versus all mayhem breaking loose.\nThe game is grounded by three main attributes: Blood, Crown, and Will. Each attribute then feeds into a dynamic dice pool that players can optimize through their playbook skills to see if they succeed. Following the principles of PBtA, Navathem's End provides players with a roster of moves that can be seamlessly used throughout all phases of the game, ala FItD's game phases. Will you be able to Stay True To Your Name when trouble arises, Agent?\nNavathem's End comes optimized for long campaign play, with smooth character creation options, seven core but customizable playbooks, five optional playbooks for magic users, and a roster of options for expanded play. Levelling up is easy and encourages PC to PC and PC to NPC interactions, rewarding significant connections and discoveries made throughout the game. Fight, fall in love, and make the hero's choice in Navathem's End.\nCheck out Navathem's End's free preview pack, right here!\nSamuel Mui Shen Ern is a game designer, writer, editor, musician, and visual artist from Malaysia. Their works explore real-world topics like death, relationships, and emotional brokenness with an unwaveringly brutal honesty and a sense of fun(?)! When she\u2019s not working on hir next big thing, he\u2019s probably zoning out to k-pop, experimenting in the kitchen, or reading autobiographical comics.\nCapitalites is a slice-of-life, coming-of-age tabletop roleplaying game about young adults living in the big city as they try to find out who they are and get their shit together. Explore real-world themes like ambition, sex, family, and friendships and the sacrifices you make in order to grow up as you navigate an excitingly mundane world of gentrified hipster cafes, skyscraper office blocks, penthouse parties, and late-night drinks at the local bar-and-bistro.  \nCapitalites uses an easy to learn, \"writers-room-esque\", GM-less system (inspired by Good Society, Fiasco, and the Belonging-Outside-Belonging family of games) which focuses on listening, discussing, and asking questions to one another to drive the game forward. It uses no cards, no dice, and no tokens! Instead, everyone takes on equal responsibilities as storytellers to collaborate and resolve the very own conflicts and disasters they themselves create! Draw from your own lived experiences to craft a dramatic, hilarious, and sometimes deeply sad tale that's both funny and painful because it's true.\nThe base game contains 14 playbooks; each with their own sets of labels, careers, and insecurities... such as: \nThe Hot Chick, the woman all the guys wanna fuck and all the girls wanna be.\nThe Zha Boh, the typical Asian girl who doesn't know who she is or what she wants \n The Sensitive Man, the man who's \"not like other men\".\nThe Player, that hot, charismatic dude with washboard abs that's gonna use you and lose you.\nThe Hypocrite, a heavily religious person who lives by totally contradictory standards.\nThe Crazy Rich Kid, a person from a rich family who struggles with having everything in life...and more!  \nEach playbook is directly inspired by real-life people (and friends), looking beyond and beneath the stereotypes they might seem to represent. Sure, some (or most) of them are really flawed and broken people... but that's all part of the fun! Play Capitalites because gaming doesn't get more authentic than playing... well, yourselves.\nJoaquin Kyle Vincent \u201cWaks\u201d Saavedra is a Filipino writer, novelist, serialist, and game designer from the Philippines.

He's obsessed with all things mechanical, military history, and exploring the Filipino and Filipino diasporic culture through art. You can usually catch him wearing some techwear looking like a real Maharlika ready to pilot a Meka.\nMaharlika is a technomystic Science Fantasy mecha RPG inspired by Filipino Mythology, centered around Mekanized Weapons or Meka, and their pilots: the eponymous Maharlika.\nYou will play as these titular spirit-warriors, mavericks, aces, and knights that all swear loyalty to a Datu, one of the CEOs of the Megacorporations, so that you can protect the technospiritual galaxy of Arkipelago. Sometimes, you\u2019re the archetypical noble Maharlika, sworn follower of your Datu and kneeling before their feet. Other times, you\u2019re just an exceptionally skilled person trying to make ends meet, and \u2018loyalty\u2019 is just another word for \u201cwhatever makes the most money.\u201d You are a free person after all.\nAs a Maharlika, you venture out into space where you will take on  dangerous missions, fight for your ideals, hack the spiritual internet that is the Lambat, repel Xenobeings, trade love and resources, and participate in fiestas to survive, thrive, and protect what is yours in the dangerous Starsea.\nIn Maharlika, you will find rules for Narrative Maharlika play and Tactical Meka Combat, fast-paced and heavy metal. Build a Meka by choosing one from 20 \"Baluti\" frames, 4 for each of the 5 Megacorporations, and then customizing that even more with over 160 AGIMAT weapons, systems, modules, protocols, and parts.\nAll of this is set in a dangerous and diverse galaxy known as Arkipelago, inspired by Filipino History, Mythology, Culture, and Folklore. Find the Diwa, the spiritual reality that is actually the smallest part of reality that exists within everything. Interface with powerful fey god-beings known as Diwata, the personified god-spirits of the Universe. Hack and interface with the Lambat, the internet of things that takes advantage of the Diwa. Be caught in the politics of the four Megacorporations, for the actual government is hopelessly incompetent. Upheave the feudal capitalist system of the Lakanate. Travel to the Land of God, in the middle of the Galaxy, where the IMPINITO DIYOS resides, and be the powerful spirit-warriors that pilot the walking giant saint-suits that are the Meka.\nMaharlika is written for both long term play and one-shots, both being enjoyable in their own right. There are five main Megacorporations, each one having five Baluti, Mech Frames, on their own. The Core Rulebook will have everything you need to play, alongside some d20s and d10s, and filled with art from Gio and other Filipino artists! \nCheck out the full beta manuscript for Maharlika below!\nhttps://tadhana.itch.io/maharlika-revised-beta-english-version\nAs well as pulling together some incredible games by incredible creators, the purpose of the Our Shores collection is to help fund the further creation and survival of not only the creators showcased above, but the community at large. South East Asian editors, writers, graphic designers, layout experts, artists, and more, will be commissioned in each project, and additional funds raised will go directly into the pockets of the creators, to fund further work and development within the community.\nGoal - $30,000\nOur first stretch goal will expand Our Shores to include an additional digital zine, compiling a further 9 RPGSEA designer\u2019s smaller works.

Every level increases the personal pay of the creators, allows each game to include significantly more art and content, and more. We've listed some highlights below!\nLevel One\nGoal - $35,000\nAt this level, Capitalites will add an additional 5 playbooks, and Maharlika will include an online play kit, including digital tokens and battle maps. Navathem will include portraits for all core heroes!\nLevel Two\nGoal - $41,025\nAt level two, both Navathem and Capitalites will double their pay to various members of their teams, and Maharlika include one new Baluti for each megacorp, with art to match!\nLevel Three\nGoal - $48,250\nCapitalites doubles funding for its creator, layout designer, and collaborators, Navathem will pay for a full, professional grade editor, and Maharlika's creator will receive an investment toward future print runs of the game!\nLevel Four\nGoal - $51,250\nAt this final level, Capitalites will expand to include a novella set in the game's universe a.k.a our real world, and Maharika will include a short graphic novel. Both will be included in all reward tiers! Additionally, Navathem's artists and editor will receive a 100% paybump. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSandy Pug Games is publishing this collection, and their head, Liam Ginty, is producing this collection. Liam is an industry vet with tons of large scale, long term projects under their belt. With a digital only release schedule, the only risks stem from the creation of the projects themselves. Most of the games included in the project are nearly text-complete already, and only require art and layout to be released.\n\nThe largest issue that could arise is a problem with the artists or contributors failing to meet deadlines or becoming unable to deliver. In that instance, Sandy Pug Games has a big address book full of incredibly talented artists they could pivot to.\n\nSome risks in international projects are complicated tax processes and lining up schedules. To avoid these, Sandy Pug Games will employ an accountant, and utilize advanced agile project management skills to make sure there's as little impact in the work as possible from the clashing time zones.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nYou can't get cleaner than digital!

But we didn't make any extra copies, so it's been out of print since then, despite lots of people wanting a physical edition. This project is a way to gather the funds we need to do a second print run.\nWe've worked with Mina McJanda to redesign the book down to a more portable A5 format (she did the layout on Heart, Lancer and Voidheart Symphony, so you know she's good). We're having the book litho-printed, rather than digitally printed on demand like the previous run, which allows us far more control over the quality of the paper and binding and lets us make a book that will last for years to come.\nWe've been through the text, removed errors, corrected spelling mistakes, tightened up some wording and generally made the entire thing easier to read and play. We're using the same brilliant art by Adrian Stone as the original print, because look at it.\nWe\u2019ve also included the two themed supplements written as part of the original Kickstarter - Cyberpunk and Urban Horror - into the core book as appendices. These each come with a new core, two new traits, and a new hierarchy of adversaries.\nEverything's ready to go. You'll get your PDF as soon as the money comes through to us, and we'll go to print as soon after that as possible. We're aiming to get the books to you before Christmas.\nIf you already own a copy of Unbound (digital or physical), you can have a free copy of the redesigned PDF as soon as it's released. We'll update the PDF to the new version everywhere we sell it, and if you got it via our previous Kickstarter, we'll be distributing the new version via the original Backerkit to the email address you used then. If you don't have access to that any more, drop us a line at admin@rowanrookanddecard.com and we'll sort you out.  \nIS IT ANY GOOD?\nYes! But don't just take our word for it:\n\"There are so many things that grab you about Unbound: fantastic world-building tools, super clever way the cards are used.  But honestly the stand out is how you make a party that is bound together but allows the characters to spin off into their own special thing.  Just magical!\" - Becky Annison, author of Lovecraftesque and Bite Marks \n\"Unbound is everything we\u2019ve come to expect from the team at Rowan, Rook and Decard - a blend of outrageous creativity and innovative but intuitive mechanics presented with style and polish. Bursting with ideas and advice for worlds, stories and gameplay, Unbound really is the RPG that can claim the only limit is your imagination.\" - Gav Thorpe, Games Workshop luminary\n\"Unbound has a great combination of action and drama - it's tactical enough to get your teeth into, but cinematic enough that you don't get bogged down in the mechanics and always have a chance to do something cool.\" - Joanna Piancastelli,  Golden Cobra live games award winner\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nUnbound is designed to give you and your group the agency, inspiration and encouragement to build your own world and fill it with exciting stories. As the players make characters, they and the GM will answer questions relating to their chosen abilities that sketch out the rest of the world, the heroes' goals, the opposition in their path, and what stands to happen if they fail.\nFirst, the group picks a CORE - an overall identity for the party - such as Warrior, Devout, Outlaw, or Wild. The core dictates the overall campaign arc (i.e. who the player characters are and what they're doing) as well as giving players a shared ability - the way in which they recover health in combat.\nThe Pactbound core lets the players tell stories about characters who draw power from otherworldly sources\nEach player then picks a ROLE. Anyone familiar with roleplaying games, either traditional or digital, will be familiar with these - the long-ranged Deadeye, the tough and dependable Warden, the supportive Protector, and so on. The role comes with a set of capabilities and a choice of abilities that give the character a niche within the party when it comes to combat.\nThe Striker is dangerous, but fragile\nFinally, each player chooses a  TRAIT. This is a specialty that sets them apart from others of their role, and they're things like Shadows, Spirit, Transform, Dirty Fighting, and so on. As well as giving them a useful ability in a fight, they'll help populate the world around the player characters with friends, enemies, locations and events that lend weight to the campaign by answering questions attached to the choices they\u2019ve made.\nThe Companion trait lets you bring a loyal ally into battle\nThe questions in the CORE, ROLE and TRAIT tie together with touchstones - key concepts that the players select and then collaboratively build into the bare bones of a setting - to ensure that every game of Unbound has, by default, a set of unique characters in a fascinating world full of adventure hooks.\nAll told, this makes for the best session zero you'll ever have. Each campaign of Unbound begins with the players ready and raring to go, eager to explore (and possibly destroy) the world they've just imagined - and with our unique advancement system that rewards players for completing scenes and objectives of their own creation, the GM doesn't have to do any prep to make it happen.\nWHAT ARE THE RULES?\nUnbound uses one set of standard playing cards per player - at the core of it, each party involved in a challenge draws a card and whoever draws highest wins, but there's a bit more to it in practice.\nAs you play, you'll personalise your character deck so it reflects where your character's been and what they've done by writing down important events and damaging scars on the cards themselves. Your deck is as important as your character sheet when it comes to describing your character.\nMina has created useful diagrams that explain the game's mechanics\nThe combat system is designed to provide a mix of abstraction - letting players get creative and exciting with their descriptions - with tactical action. Player characters and adversaries occupy AREAS that are, in essence, individual locations that it's interesting to have a fight in. Moving between these areas, pushing and pulling enemies, and setting up interesting combinations of abilities forms the crux of combat in Unbound.\nMaps are made up of areas and connections to keep combat flowing smoothly\nWe've also created more than fifty adversaries for your players to take down, and every single one of them has an interesting ability or quirk that marks them out from others of their kind. There are big bruisers who storm around the battlefield smashing apart obstacles in their path; there are grim killers who disguise themselves as their minions; there are critters that grab on to your leg teeth-first and refuse to let go until you shake them off. What's more, almost all adversary abilities are triggered by a series of memorable player actions, so the GM doesn't have to memorise each one to run them in a fight.\n CAN I LISTEN TO AN ACTUAL PLAY OF IT? \nYou can! We got together with our friends Becky Annison, Kieron Gillen and Sharang Biswas to play through the character creation and world building for a brand new campaign. You can listen to STONEGRAVE here.\n WHAT SORT OF CHARACTERS CAN WE BE?\nUnbound not only allows, but encourages, wild creativity on the part of players. Sure, you can play a dude with a sword if you'd like - and you'll probably have fun doing so.  But working from the basic ideas laid out in character creation and using the abstraction that Unbound affords, we've had some truly unusual characters.\nWant to play five wolves? You can do that. Want your special weapon to be a truck that screeches in and runs over your enemies? Sure! Want to never lift a finger but be defended by a cadre of armoured battle nuns? Go for it! These are all player characters we've had in sessions of Unbound, and that's just the games that we've run ourselves. If your players are chafing against restrictions in other roleplaying games, Unbound might just be the RPG for them.\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?\nUnbound is a game about big, bold short-burn stories that don't outstay their welcome - the standard campaign length is around five to six games of a few hours each, and groups are encouraged to explore the same world from different angles with multiple arcs that use entirely new characters. (For example: we ran a Cyberpunk game where the players failed to overthrow the evil corporation in the final scene, so the following campaign took place 10 years afterwards as the characters' children dealt with the war that the corporation brought to their homeland.) Ultimately, it's up to you and your group, but we've found that shorter story arcs are much easier to plan around and execute - so we've written a system that supports them.\nWHAT CAN I GET?\nThis is a no-frills Kickstarter designed to gather funds to allow us to print a product that's all ready to go. You can get a PDF of the updated design of Unbound, or you can get a softcover edition with a PDF included for free. \nThis campaign is an experiment to see if we can justify the cost of doing a print run and redesign on the games that we developed before Spire - the title we're best known for. We've set the funding goal for two weeks because we don't intend to have this become a huge project, but instead to get physical books into the hands of people that want them.\nWHO ARE YOU?\nFrom left to right: Decard, Rowan, Rook\nWe're Rowan, Rook and Decard. (Or: Mary Hamilton, Grant Howitt, and Chris Taylor.) We're a UK roleplaying design studio based in London and Sheffield, and we make some of the best games on the market because we care about good writing, strong mechanics, excellent art, books built to last and paying everyone involved a fair wage. (We are a Living Wage Employer and we say so with pride.)\nWe've published more than a dozen roleplaying corebooks and supplements in the past, including short ones like Honey Heist, Crash Pandas and the Witch Is Dead and long ones like Spire, Heart and Royal Blood. We really care about what we do, and we're really good at it too. You can take a look at our other games on our website.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve already printed Unbound successfully once, and we have three extra years of experience under our belts now.

The new retro-apocalypotic edition of Twilight: 2000, published in partnership with Game Designers' Workshop, goes back to the roots of the franchise with a boxed set for sandbox roleplaying in the devastation of World War III. The new edition will be the fourth in the series, the first being released by GDW in 1984. Just like the original version, the new edition is set in a year 2000 devastated by war \u2013 now in an alternate timeline where the Moscow Coup of 1991 succeeded and the Soviet Union never collapsed.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\n\"The first edition of Twilight: 2000 was an iconic game for me back in the '80s, and we are humbled and honored to work with Marc Miller and Game Designers' Workshop to bring a new edition to life. The original game was really ahead of its time. Our goal is to build on the amazing sandbox survival gameplay and develop it further, making it more accessible using the tools of modern game design,\" says lead game designer Tomas H\u00e4renstam.\n\"When I saw this proposal to revisit the Twilight universe, I signed on immediately. As I have seen the work proceed, I have not been disappointed, and I look forward to seeing this project become reality,\" says Marc Miller of Far Future Enterprises and co-founder of Game Designers' Workshop.\nSample Layout Spread \u2013 Texts Are Placeholder Only\nSample Layout Spread \u2013 Texts Are Placeholder Only\nAlso part of the project are Amargosa Press (who have recently announced the new Dark Conspiracy 4th Edition RPG), Polish RPG publisher Black Monk Games (who will act as a consultant on the Poland in 2000 AD game setting as well as publish a Polish edition of the game later on), and Far Future Enterprises (who publishes the fifth edition of the Traveller science-fiction roleplaying game). \nThe Twilight: 2000 Boxed Set\nMaking RPGs in boxed sets is expensive, but we really feel it's right way to go for Twilight: 2000, bringing back the feel of the first edition of the game with that iconic Poland map.\nIf we reach our base funding goal, the boxed set will at the very least include two beautifully illustrated full color books \u2013 a Players' Manual and a Referee's Manual, each of about 100 pages detailing rules, setting, gear and scenarios \u2013 as well as several empty character sheets and a huge, full color travel map (format 864x558mm) of central Poland on one side and southern Sweden on the other.\nIf we exceed our base goal, we will add more content to the boxed set as stretch goals. These include combat maps and tokens, cards for initiative and encounters, custom dice, additional content in the books, and more. Read more under Stretch Goals, below.\nLIMITED EDITION METAL BOX: As a exclusive to this Kickstarter, you can even get your copy of Twilight: 2000 in a limited edition metal box. The inside of the box will have a plastic insert (not seen on the mockup image below) to keep all of the game components in place and make sure they are kept in pristine condition. This deluxe edition of the game will only be available via this Kickstarter and will not be produced again. To get your game in the metal box, choose the LIMITED EDITION reward. All backers of the limited edition will also get an honorable mention in the rulebook.\nMetal Box Design (Work in Progress)\nA Referee's Screen will not be included in the boxed set, but can be added to your pledge \u2013 see the Addons section below.\nReferee's Screen \u2013 Work in Progress\nSome say it didn\u2019t have to be this way. Some say history could have taken a different turn. If the Soviet Union had collapsed back in \u201891 when it was on the ropes. If the Gang of Eight military coup against Gorbachev had failed, the world would have looked very different today. Some say. I think it\u2019s bullshit. This storm was always coming, sooner or later.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore, anyway. Now, all that matters is to survive each day.\nIt\u2019s all up to us now. Our squad. Jonesy. Diaz, manning the M113. That Polish girl Kasia. The men and women around me. No one else will come to our rescue. The final words from division HQ, before they signed off for good, left little doubt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re on your own now.\u201d\nJust like the original game, the new edition of Twilight: 2000 is set in Poland, but the game also offers an alternative Swedish setting, as well as advice on how to place the game anywhere in the world. In the game, players take roles of survivors in the aftermath of World War III \u2013 soldiers or civilians. Their goal, beyond surviving for another day, can be to find a way back home, to carve out their own fiefdom where they are, to find out more about the mysterious Operation Reset, and maybe, just maybe, make the world a little bit better again.\nThe core gameplay builds on the hexcrawling system established in Mutant: Year Zero and Forbidden Lands RPGs (both Silver ENnie winners for Best Rules, in 2015 and 2019), developing it further to fit the gritty world of Twilight: 2000. The characters explore the devastated lands using a large hexagon map of Poland or Sweden \u2013 or wherever in the world you wish to place your campaign.\nPoland Map by Tobias Tranell \u2013 Work in Progress\nSweden Map by Tobias Tranell \u2013 Work in Progress\nMap Detail \u2013 Work in Progress\nRonson carries the SAW. Diaz is like the Professor on Gilligan\u2019s Island, he can build a new carburetor out of a pair of coconuts and some dental floss. Kasia, all of 17, is the closest thing we have to a medic since we lost Doc. Jonesy is a ginger who Diaz says looks like the cat in Aliens which is how a German intel officer got a name like Jonesy. Top\u2019s been in the Marines long enough to have fought in the Tet Offensive\u2026 and me? I\u2019m just a grunt. We\u2019re all trying to get by. Top once called us \u201cthe last family.\u201d He might be right. Kasia made a gagging gesture when he did. But none of us expect to see our actual families again.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nThe core rules of the game build on the Year Zero Engine (used in award-winning RPGs such as ALIEN, Tales From the Loop, Forbidden Lands and Mutant: Year Zero), but heavily adapted to fit Twilight: 2000 and its focus on gear and gritty realism.\nTwilight: 2000 will be crunchier and have less random elements than other YZE games. Twilight: 2000 will get a solid ruleset that captures the gritty, realistic feel of the original, but in a more accessible way and that fully realizes the potential for sandbox gameplay. We aim for a system that retains depth and complexity, but that is less granular and easier to use.\nInstead of a dice pool as in other YZE games, Twilight: 2000 uses a two-dice system. You'll roll one base die for your skill and one base die for the attribute connected to that skill. Base dice range from D6s to D12s. Skills and attributes are rated from A to D, with a better score giving you a better die to roll. Attributes and skills are fairly broad, with specialties used to fine-tune your character. Combat uses battlemaps with 10-meter hexes to regulate movement and ranged attacks. Extensive systems for critical injuries as well as component damage to vehicles give crunch to the system, while keeping it fast and playable.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nTwilight: 2000 is a game with a large and proud community. We want to extend a big thank you to everyone, for your warm welcome to us and the upcoming game since the project was announce a few months back.\nBeside the comments field here on the Kickstarter, we have opened a section dedicated to Twilight: 2000 at our forums, and you're very welcome to join the discussions there. Also, of course you have the pre-existing Twilight: 2000 Facebook group which is an amazing resource and community hub, and the new Facebook group Twilight: 2000 by Free League, created specifically for the new edition.\nWe are very eager to hear your questions, thoughts and requests for the new edition. Even if we might not be able to fulfill every wish, we certainly want to listen to your advice and feedback.\nAfter the Kickstarter concludes, later in the fall, we will share a full Alpha PDF of the game to all backers, so you will be able to playtest the game and  give your feedback on it before it goes to print.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nWe love friendly local gaming stores all over the world and want to forge an even closer relationship with you. We offer a retailer pledge, including five copies of the Twilight: 2000 boxed set (including printed stretch goals), at a heavily discounted retailer price.\nBy taking part in this Kickstarter as a retailer, you make sure you get the games on time for the official release next year, and you get them at a lower cost than through normal distribution channels. As an added bonus, your pledges will contribute to unlocking stretch goals, and you get access to all updates and sneak peeks of Twilight: 2000 here on the Kickstarter.\nFor more information about how we work with retailers, and to get early information about our upcoming releases, sign up to our monthly retailer newsletter!\nPlease note that retailer pledges are only available to actual retailers.

A complete PDF is included.\nRETAILER ADDON: 5 x TWILIGHT: 2000 CORE SETS - 1,200 SEK\nFive additional copies of the Twilight: 2000 core boxed set, including all unlocked stretch goals. FOR RETAILERS ONLY!\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship your particular pledge and choice of addons. We will collect this via our Pledge Manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all. Here is a list of rough shipping estimates: \nUnited Kingdom: $8\u201310\nEU: $12\u201316\nUSA: $14\u201318\nCanada: $16\u201320\nAustralia: $16\u201320\nRest of World: $20\u201330\nUnfortunately, import laws and customs in some specific countries have made it impossible for us to ship to them. We do not ship to: Belarus, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nThe design team is led by Tomas H\u00e4renstam (ALIEN RPG, Forbidden Lands, Mutant: Year Zero), with setting and scenario writing by Chris Lites (Conan, Over the Edge), editing by Angus Abranson (Doctor Who, The One Ring), interior art by Niklas Brant (Forbidden Lands), cover art by Martin Grip (ALIEN RPG, Symbaroum), and maps by Tobias Tranell (Forbidden Lands). Several active and retired servicemen from the U.S. military are assigned to the project as consultants.\nTomas H\u00e4renstam has been a roleplayer since his 11th birthday way back in 1985. The first edition of Twilight: 2000 was one of the first RPGs he played and it has stayed with him ever since. In the mid '90s, Tomas spent his one-year mandatory military service as an intelligence officer in the Swedish army. Later, he pursued a career in journalism and worked for over a decade as a foreign news reporter and Middle East correspondent, reporting from places like Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.\nChris Lites first encountered Twilight: 2000 in a bookstore, prior to having ever played an RPG. A Cold War kid, he was obsessed with all things military and, in particular, WW III. Within the year, he\u2019d played D&D for the first time and soon bought Twilight: 2000 at his local game store. There started a fascination with this game that\u2019s lasted his whole life. Twilight: 2000 is, to Chris, as relevant as ever. Because any way you slice it, the world painted by GDW back in 1984 doesn\u2019t look all that different from what might lay ahead of us in a worst-case scenario. The old is new again.\nAngus Abranson spent many a school lunch hour, back in the '80s, traversing the ruins of Europe trying to make it home.  Since then he has battled dragons, flown battleships, lived, loved and died in countless realities and realms \u2013 only to land back in a wartorn Europe looking, once again, for a way home. The circle continues\u2026\nMarc Miller was there when the original Twilight: 2000 was created, and he continues to give his advice on making Twilight the best project it can possibly be.\nSeveral active and retired service members from the U.S. military are assigned to the project as consultants.\nFree League Publishing is the international name of Swedish game and book publisher Fria Ligan AB. Since 2011 we have produced a range of pen and paper RPG's, and have won several awards in the process.\nOur first international game, Mutant: Year Zero was awarded a Silver ENNIE for Best Rules in 2015. In 2017, Tales from the Loop won five Gold ENNIEs (including Best Game and Product of the Year) as well as three Golden Geek awards. We have also created and published the dark fantasy RPG Symbaroum, Coriolis - The Third Horizon (Judges\u2019 Spotlight Award at the ENNIEs 2017), Forbidden Lands (winner of four ENNIE Wards 2019), the official ALIEN RPG (winner of the Best Game ENNIE Award 2020), and most recently Vaesen \u2013 Nordic Horror Roleplaying.\nOur Kickstarter fulfillment and shipping is handled by GamesQuest in the UK and Flat River Group in the US.\nJoin us on Facebook at facebook.com/frialigan!\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have done many successful kickstarters and have solid experience in the field.

The book includes 10 technological levels and 20 thematic modules that can be combined in many unique ways, with each combination creating a different ruleset. This allows the rules to be tailored to the world in which the players want to immerse themselves.\nFrom cowboys to spies, Roman gladiators to mecha pilots, elven knights to vampires, private investigators to galactic rulers, the book provides everything needed for your game. It allows you to play in any historical era or the worlds of your favorite books, movies, series, or video games. It can also easily be customized for use with any \"system-agnostic\" settings you own.\nPLAY\n\nThe BYTE Roleplaying Game is a passion project that has been in the making for the past 8 years, with many tweaks and revisions during that time. It is a wide-ranging book that takes inspiration from all sorts of entertainment media to offer a comprehensive resource to players. It has been playtested extensively by veteran players with over 25 years in the hobby.\nYeraksys: Dying World\u2014one of the original BYTE RPG settings\nBesides the ruleset itself, the BYTE Roleplaying Game also involves the development of 7 original settings. One of these\u2014No Coin for Charon, an open world, \"hex crawl\", sandbox style, modern zombie apocalypse mini-setting\u2014will be included as an appendix in the rulebook. The other 6 settings are planned for release in the coming years.\nNo Coin for Charon\u2014a mini-setting included with the BYTE RPG Rulebook\nEach rule and item within the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook was designed and written in such a way to allow players to assess instantly which technological level, and which of the 7 original settings, it is applicable to. Each section of the book will be color-coded, and icons will be assigned to each chapter and element which link them to the pertinent worlds and eras.\nAs all the necessary rules will be compiled in the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook, the setting books will focus solely on the lore (history, geography, cultures, factions, people, artifacts, etc.) and practical tables to generate thematic events and elements on the fly, assisting players to tell unique and evolving stories customized to each world.\nAshes of the Heavens\u2014one of the two settings that may be unlocked as Stretch Goal rewards\nTo tie it all together, the BYTE Roleplaying Game uses an easy to grasp action resolution mechanism. Each character has attributes (such as Dexterity or Presence, with values ranging from 1 to 5) and skills (such as Piloting or Leadership, with values from 0 to 5). When a test is required, the player rolls a number of eight-sided dice equal to the relevant attribute and compares the number on each die to the pertinent skill, aiming to roll lower than or equal to that skill's value. Rolled eights count as zeros and thus are always considered successes, but each seven cancels out a success. If at least one roll remains successful, the character achieves a favorable outcome for the attempted action. \nNo other kind of dice besides eight-sided ones are used in the game and there are many design decisions in place to make the game fast and exciting, from trying to pilot a starfighter to ruling a kingdom.\nDo you want to know a bit more about the campaign settings with the BYTE Roleplaying Game? Want to discover what its innovative Token rule does to support good roleplaying? Want to have an idea on how the rules' modularity works? Want to understand how to customize your character's skills with more than 280 different abilities, making them unlike any other character in their world?\nDownload the free Quickstart Rules Beta Version HERE.\nGhosts of T'Kelti\u2014a dark space opera where technology is molded by the supernatural\n What you get by backing now \nAll reward tiers for this campaign give backers the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook PDF. From the second tier onwards, reward tiers also come with options for printed copies of the book through at-cost, print-on-demand vouchers from DriveThruRPG. In those tiers, you will be able to choose the full-color Hardcover version (letter-sized, 400+ pages) or its Limited Edition one (with premium-quality print and a Kickstarter-exclusive cover art by the talented Zahir Aghakhani).\nPrices in US Dollars are estimates based on the exchange rate to the Euro on June 14th, 2020\nAfter the campaign ends and is fulfilled, the standalone BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook PDF (with no voucher for a print copy) will be priced at US$ 25. Any unlocked Stretch Goals which are available after the campaign will be sold separately and not included in this price.\nMoreover, once the funds are made available to the creators, backers will gain exclusive access to the full \"Beta Version\" rules document immediately\u2014four months before the book's launch\u2014allowing them to start playing right away. They will also be able to collaborate more closely on the project by having the opportunity to join the private BYTE Roleplaying Game Discord Server\u2014before it opens to the general public in December 2020\u2014and exchange ideas with other players and the author, giving valuable feedback directly to him.\nFurthermore, backing now means helping the creators fully realize their vision for this independent project and give the book a complete art treatment.\nThe City and the Numina\u2014a magic realist world where corporations mingle with the occult\n Stretch Goal Rewards \nThe BYTE Roleplaying Game is a project larger than its rulebook. Besides the mini-setting included in this book, No Coin for Charon, six others are planned for future release as fully-fledged settings, each as a separate book.\nTwo of those settings\u2014Ashes of the Heavens and Yeraksys: Dying World\u2014are already in late stages of writing and are being offered for free as PDFs to backers as part of the following rewards, should this Kickstarter campaign be successful enough to hit their corresponding Stretch Goals.\nAshes of the Heavens and Yeraksys: Dying World PDFs\u2014two Stretch Goal rewards\n UNLOCKED! - Interactive BYTE RPG Character Sheet PDF by the talented Christian L.

Nevertheless, as first-time creators, we took great care in choosing to launch the campaign only when we were absolutely sure we could deliver it. We are very close to the finishing line. The text is already in place, fully written and edited. Layout is already paid for, and most of the art is already done. Funds are needed only for a final proofreading pass and additional art. Physical copies of the book will be printed and delivered directly to backers by DriveThruRPG, a leading company in the market with more than 15 years of experience. As we, the creators, won't have to deal with printers, warehouses and shipping partners, and considering that the book is practically done, risks of this project are minimal. The main challenge is having the remaining art, layout and proofreading done in time.

Whether you\u2019re an avid tabletop RPG player, creator, streamer, or curious newcomer \u2013 we want to share in your passion and help it grow.\nWe believe in the power of authentic narrative play. With Role, we're bringing that power to a new generation of online creators & communities. With all the world\u2019s advances in technology & entertainment, there is still nothing quite like a great RPG. So we set out to build the ultimate collection of high-quality social, marketplace, and online play tools for veteran players and newcomers alike.\nCheck out our live gameplay demos!\nPLAY\n\nCharacter Sheets, Dice, Assets, & Video!\nPLAY\n\nTokens & Whiteboarding!\nToday\u2019s role playing community is larger and more vibrant than ever. Diverse voices from around the globe are creating new games every day. We want to be the place where everyone can play, meet new people, and get their games into more players\u2019 hands. In simplest terms, we really just want to answer one question for every person in our community: What\u2019s missing from your table today?\nWe try to answer that question in 3 major ways: intuitive & seamless online video play, a creator-driven marketplace, and robust player matching services.\nOur online play interface is called \"The Table\", and is meant to recreate that intimate feeling of playing face-to-face with a tight group of players. \nCrisp high quality video chat puts the best part of the game front-and-center: the people. Show critical information through screen sharing. Upload visual aids to enhance your game via your Asset Tray. Text chat as a group or privately, allowing you to communicate however is most effective for your game.\nRoll any combination of dice by selecting them quickly from your Dice Tray. Add stat modifiers from your character sheet, track critical successes & failures, and add up your totals automatically. Draw cards from any deck of your choosing, including standard 52 card decks, tarot, and custom decks from your favorite games. Show your results live to the entire Table, or set them to Private for discreet gameplay.\nFully modular character sheet tools ensure you have what you need to play any game, even homebrew content or custom systems. We've designed our character sheet system from a standardized set of form fields, stat trackers, pools, tokens, note sections, and more - everything you need to play any RPG system. Character sheets are automatically indexed, with a Table of Contents generated for easy navigation. Everything is drag-and-drop - no code required! \nMatch with players who share your interests, based on information listed in your Profile. Use advanced filters to find exactly who you need based on desired complexity level, specific game experience, and location. You can even use Role to find experienced Game Masters to run your Table! \nRole is a people-first role playing community, and that means you\u2019ll always have tools to meet new players that align with your interests. Browse until you find someone you want to match with. If they match back, you\u2019ll be able to chat and set up your next game together!\nReal names & location data are always optional \u2013 you only have to share what you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nWe\u2019re designing a premium marketplace that puts creators first, making it easier for players to discover, learn, and purchase new games from diverse voices in the role playing community. Basic game info such as complexity, player count, and time commitment is always easy to find & search by. Creators can upload a free teaser of their game to help players quickly understand the basics, sample the world, and get excited to play more.\nSay goodbye to review bombs & trolling. Instead of a traditional review score system, Role uses a recommendation engine. Players recommend what they love, not trash what they hate.\nPlayers never have to worry about buying new games without people to enjoy them with. Every game is directly linked to our Player Matching tools, ensuring that every new player can find people and play together.\nBackers of this campaign will be the first to join the Role private Early Access program, where they can play with each other and help shape our tools before we launch to the rest of the world! In addition, we're offering a slate of rewards that include premium features, game supplements, and exclusive items only available via this campaign.\nAll of our backers will be able to play in our Early Access program, and will receive a shout-out on our \"Thank You\" page! Additional rewards are available as follows:\nWe're FUNDED! Every dollar raised from here goes towards unlocking our STRETCH GOALS:\nOur first Stretch Goal has been unlocked! \nRole will launch as a free platform for everyone, with an open marketplace & play tools to support any game. For those that want to take their adventures further, we're offering a subscription tier called Role Master Edition. This subscription includes everything from the basic tier, plus extras that ensure players, creators, and game masters alike have all the tools they need to run the very best game sessions.\nBeyond our default look & feel, the Table interface will support a growing library of custom skins inspired by various popular fiction genres. Maximize your group's immersion in the story by wrapping your experience in a skin that's right for you. \nBackers of this campaign will receive 3 Kickstarter-exclusive skins that will never be available again: our first Fantasy skin, a retro Arcade skin, and our Cyberpunk skin. \nOf course, the heart of the Role platform is great games. Backers of this campaign will be able to receive one or more of our 6 Creators Program supplements as they release over the course of our first year.\nPLAY\n\nWe believe in supporting the RPG creator community on Day 1, and that's why we've launched the Role Creators Program - a funding initiative to help independent designers and publishers get more of their work out into the world. As part of this Kickstarter campaign, we're funding a fresh batch of RPG game supplements from 6 different creators. These digital supplements will be exclusive to the Role platform, and available first to backers of this campaign!\nFirst, we're extremely excited to reveal Lancer: Battlegroup, the official expansion from Massif Press!\nLancer: Battlegroup is a new, standalone rules system for the Lancer setting, designed for use at your tabletop and in digital, grid-free play. Blending Lancer\u2019s deep unit customization and imbued story with tactical-narrative action, Battlegroup casts the players as pilots and officers in a battlegroup deployed to the front line; as the first tremors of interstellar war test Union\u2019s integrity, you and your party members will face the enemy with new weapons and old tactics, thrown into combat with only one goal: survive, and return home.\nAs big OSR fans, we're very pleased to bring everyone Isle of Ixx from Swedish designer, Skullfungus!\nThe Isle of Ixx is both a light OSR-style ruleset and a sandbox adventure in one. The rules are based on \"Into the Odd\" by Chris McDowall, and have been chosen for their simplicity and ease of use, so that the focus can lie on adventuring and discovering the island. The system itself is also easy to adapt to any style of OSR-ruleset you might have in mind, should you prefer that instead!\nThe setting text will be written in an open-ended way, often asking the players questions about their characters and surroundings. This way, they'll be a big part of the setting and will get to influence much of what goes on in the story!\nThere will be roughly 16 key locations on the map for players to explore, ranging from cities, villages, lairs, and dungeons. There will also be tools for the game master to create their own content, in the form of generators and sample maps they can use for their own dungeon adventures!\n We're also proud to be partnering with Swordsfall to launch The Fifth Ebon Expedition, the newest expansion to this massive Afropunk universe!\nThe Fifth Ebon Expedition is a 4+ player campaign set in a unique Mission style. Your group will be part of the larger expedition, fighting to establish forward camps, and with it a railway for a future supply line. If your expedition is successful, then the question is... can you defend it?\nFrom popular Filipino creator, Sword Queen Games, we're bringing Voidwalkers - a tarot-powered game that combines mysticism with deep space exploration for an experience unlike any other!\nVoidwalkers will be a complete stand-alone science fiction TTRPG where mysticism and space-magic guide creative and intuitive stories. In this Powered by the Apocalypse game, characters must learn how to harness and balance the wild space-magic, the VOID, within themselves, while navigating and staying clear of its wild manifestations in the physical world. You must rely on creativity, luck, and relationships in order to succeed and thrive out in the Void. Players will use a tarot deck as a way to generate intuitive stories and resolve challenges. A unique tarot deck will be created for this game, but any tarot deck may be used!\nIndie designer Steven Medeiros, in collaboration with the Role team, is developing Astra - a unique blend of classic OSR and cooperative action where players pool their dice rolls and act together as a group.\nAstra is a rules light 3-6 player OSR-style tabletop role playing game with a focus on cooperative group dice pool mechanics that allow players to work together and overcome obstacles. It explores heavy themes of interpersonal connections, self exploration, and building community. Suitable for one-shot or campaign-style play, it features quick & easy character creation and narrative driven gameplay.\nLast - but certainly not least - we're working with Magpie Games to bring players a brand-new supplement for Masks! Cataclysm at the Metajunction will bring new levels of superhero action to this popular superhero RPG.\nCataclysm at the Metajunction is a playset for Masks: A New Generation, a Powered by the Apocalypse game of teen superheroics. This playset will give you everything you need to play through superheroic tales in the endangered Metajunction, along with two new costumes, or playbook variants, for you to use with existing Masks characters. Ever wanted to play a version of your character from another reality? Cataclysm at the Metajunction provides the support for doing just that!\nThis playset includes: a 32 page full-color, illustrated playset, including custom moves and villains. And 2 new playbook supplements (costumes) that expand existing Masks playbooks.\nAll 6 of these awesome supplements will release exclusively on Role, as part of Year 1 of our platform launch!\n From all of us here at Role, thank you so much for joining us on this adventure. We can't wait to share in the worlds, characters, and stories you create. The world is a better place when we imagine together.\nThis is your game table.

During a game you engineer and play out stupid, disastrous situations, usually at the intersection of greed, fear, and lust. It\u2019s like making your own Coen brothers movie, in about the same amount of time it\u2019d take to watch one.\nFiasco is inspired by cinematic tales of small time capers gone disastrously wrong \u2013 inspired by films like Blood Simple, Fargo, The Way of the Gun, Burn After Reading, and A Simple Plan. You play ordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control. \nSo what's in the box? \nThe new Fiasco retains all the features familiar to old friends, while being much more welcoming to new ones. \nWe\u2019ve tossed out all the dice and index cards and replaced them with playing cards. Setup elements? On cards. Tilt, Aftermath and positive and negative Outcomes? On cards. It speeds up play, adds intuitive, strong visual appeal, and just plain improves the play experience. \nAs an added bonus, it\u2019s now possible to \u201ctune\u201d playsets, combining elements from your favorite Fiasco settings old and new. Since playsets are now decks of cards, we\u2019re committed to rolling out old favorites and new surprises regularly, and we\u2019re looking into how we can share the tools you need to make you own. \nThe game has been playtested thoroughly and is ready to go. We\u2019ve taken great pains to make it beginner friendly - everything you need is in the box.\nThe start of any Fiasco is in the Setup. You and your friends (3-5 players) will choose one of the playset decks that sounds fun and put it on the table with the Engine deck. That's all you need to play the game, but we'll also include a game board and player aid cards to guide you and make sure everyone is on the same page. \nInside the box you'll get three playsets- Dragonslayers, Poppleton Mall, and Tales From Suburbia. These are some of the most popular and well-loved playsets for classic Fiasco and we think you'll have a great time with them! You can also back at reward tiers that include Expansion Packs- more info on those in the What's Included section below.\nThe prototype deck for the Poppleton Mall playset\nTo create the Setup, you'll shuffle the playset deck and hand out all the cards to the players. The players will then take turns choosing Relationships from their hand and placing them between any two players, establishing connections between characters. \nOnce you have the Relationships chosen, you'll add details to each relationship, including Needs, Locations, and Objects that will all help to drive your story. \nOnce these connections are in place, each player looks at the relationships on either side of them and determines what sort of person their character must be. The last step is putting together a name from the options on the back of each playset card. \nPoppleton Mall all set up and ready to play\nOnce the setup is done, you'll use the Engine Deck to begin playing Scenes in two Acts. Each player will take a turn framing a scene about their character, choosing the setting and determining what their character wants. Other players will join in, offering suggestions and playing their characters. After a minute or two, the other players at the table will decide whether the scene has a Positive or Negative Outcome and give you a card. \nThe Fiasco Engine Deck prototype\nEach player will get two spotlight scenes in the first act and two in the second. In between you do the Tilt, which uses elements on the Outcome cards to determine some crazy new twists in your story. At the end of the game, you'll use the Aftermath cards to determine how your characters' stories end up, before you describe your final epilogue.\n Praise\n\"Damn this Fiasco game is ingenious.\" \u2013 John Rogers, TV and film writer for Leverage and The Librarians\n\"Fiasco is unique among RPGs because it encourages us to actively reach for that moment we all dread in most games, that moment when something truly awful is going to happen, with possibly dire results for our characters.\" \u2013 Wil Wheaton, Actor and Writer\n\"I think, for me, there\u2019s a kind of non-Aristotelian catharsis in that active rehearsal of everything I fear and dread and also pine for; it\u2019s a chance to dance with Poe\u2019s Imp of the Perverse, to give in, to make the dangerous choice\u2014it\u2019s the same thing release I get from the act of writing. But writing is a solitary discipline for the most part and Fiasco\u2026 Fiasco is so gloriously communal.\" \u2013 Kelly Sue DeConnick, Writer of Captain Marvel, Pretty Deadly, and Bitch Planet\n\"The joy of Fiasco comes when the line between game and story blurs and suddenly you\u2019re sitting around a table with the brilliant and wonderful souls you allow into your home and you all try to make the perfect Big Black Box. Impose logic, reason, design, over the chaotic horror of existence because in story-space, in a game-space, because here we CAN. We aren\u2019t just allowed but it\u2019s ENCOURAGED. Draw this map of hell, we tell ourselves. Later on we can find our way out.\" \u2013 Matt Fraction, Writer of Hawkeye and Sex Criminals\n\"Fiasco is roleplaying stripped down to sheer elegance, to virtually zero ramp-up time. The notion of playing ambitious crooks with poor impulse control \u2014 inspired by a host of movies like Fargo or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels \u2014 is both inspiring and immensely replayable. But the real genius of Fiasco... is that now you can enjoy it in almost any setting you like.\" \u2013 the 2011 Diana Jones Award Committee\nAwards and Honors\nFiasco \u2013 Winner, 2011 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming\nFiasco \u2013 Winner, Best Support, 2009 Indie RPG Awards \nFiasco \u2013 Judge\u2019s Spotlight Award, 2009 ENnie Awards\nFiasco \u2013 Finalist, RPG of the Year, 2010 Indie RPG Awards Boardgamegeek.com \nActual Play Videos\nPodcasts\nCatastrophic - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/catastrophic-a-fiasco-podcast/id1063907406\nFandible - http://www.fandible.com/fiasco-with-great-power/\nGosh Darn Fiasco - https://goshdarnfiasco.simplecast.fm/ \nOne Shot - http://oneshotpodcast.com/tag/fiasco/ \nThe Tilt - http://thetilt.libsyn.com/podcast \n Please Note!

We\u2019re cautious about the possibility of overcharging some of you, so rather than set flat rates by country, we\u2019ll be adding shipping costs when your package is ready, though BackerKit. This will get you the most accurate rate based on the time we send and your location.\nPrices do not include shipping or customs!\nPlease keep in mind that these are estimates, and with things as they  are in the UK/EU, these numbers could change. We're continuing to work  with our shipping partners and will adjust as needed as we get closer to  charging for shipping.\nAlso, while we say \"the rest of the world\" there are some  restrictions imposed by our partners- shipping to Russia, Brazil, China,  Israel, and Saudi Arabia may incur additional charges, due to increased  difficulties shipping to there. We'll continue to look for affordable  options.\nIf shipping charges turn out to be too expensive for you, you will be  able to request a refund of your pledge amount after the campaign  through BackerKit, either by sending us a Kickstarter message or email  to info@bullypulpitgames.com. \n This Kickstarter campaign is designed to be very lean and straightforward - our goal is to get the word out to as many people as we can, so that more people can find out how much fun the game is. If you back this Kickstarter at any level you\u2019ll get immediate access to the pre-release draft of the rules, and we\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll love them. Please play, and tell your friends! \nThe primary reward for jumping on board now is the chance to help us explore this new direction for the game and to get access to the upcoming playsets before they're publicly released.\n Fiasco was created by Jason Morningstar and Steve Segedy. Together, we run Bully Pulpit Games, and we've been creating and publishing award-winning games such as Star Crossed, Night Witches, The Warren, and the original Fiasco since 2006. This is our sixth Kickstarter campaign.\nBrennen Reece created the layout and visual design for Fiasco. Brennen is an essential part of the BPG team and has helped us create a number of great games including Star Crossed, Night Witches, The Warren, and The Skeletons. He also provided the editing and music for our video!\nJenn Martin is our Production Coordinator and the Project Manager for this edition of Fiasco, and is the one keeping this train on the rails. Jenn is a maker, editor, writer, and game designer.

That said, while we don't expect any problems, shipping from overseas means that there is always a slight risk that a cargo ship will be late and things will be delayed by a month or so. We will keep you informed!\n\nFULFILLMENT\nWe'll be using the same local fulfillment service as we have for all of our previous campaigns to handle U.S. customers. We're also looking to expand our options for overseas fulfillment so that we can offer customs-free shipping to more international backers. Stay tuned for more on that. \nInevitably a few shipments will get lost or damaged\u2014particularly those going overseas\u2014but we'll be following those shipments closely and making sure backers get what they ordered!\n\nTRANSPARENCY\nFinally, we're committed to keeping you informed and being transparent about the process.

You know what an RPG is. This isn\u2019t exactly your first rodeo right? Also, I\u2019m reasonably sure that you\u2019re also a GM, which means you know how books like this work already. All of which is good. I\u2019ve written King of Dungeons in a pretty conversational tone. If I\u2019ve got it right, then this should feel like one gamer talking to another. Rather than hold your hand through basic roleplaying procedures that you have seen umpteen times in the hoary old \u2018What is a Role Playing Game?\u2019 section that you probably just skimmed anyway, I\u2019m just going to pitch this my way, to you, GM to GM.\nThe Character Sheet\nWhere did it come from?\nI've been gaming since the days of yore (when everything was black and white, and you had to colour in your own dice with crayons). I've spent most of that time searching for the perfect dragony/dungeony-like experience. I've read so many other people\u2019s iterations on the classics I thought it was time to brew my own. I call it a remix, or a cover version.\nThe inspirations and influences are clear: it is dungeoning and dragoning through a modern lens of systems, married to a mind-set of making it up as we go along. It\u2019s not from any particular school, it\u2019s just the way I like to play my games, hopefully presented with some passion and a sense of humour.\nA previous King of Dungeons, pictured yesterday.\nWhat are you trying to achieve?\nI\u2019m really bolting together three elements of play. I like tactical, action-oriented combats. I like free-wheeling exploration and interaction in my games. And I wanted a reason for it all to hang together, based on the core premise of; what if professional adventuring was an actual thing in the setting?\nI also wanted to have the chance to record my personal thinking on gaming ideas without having anyone answer me back.\nSpot art from the book\nHow is it played?\nThe system chassis is the Archmage Engine, which you might know from The 13th Age Roleplaying Game. That itself is a blend of the world\u2019s most popular roleplaying game and the more indie narrative sensibilities. It\u2019s been simplified and stripped right back. I\u2019ve added other bits and pieces from all over the gaming spectrum and my own brainium. The system is to 13th Age what Basic D&D was to AD&D; compatible, but stands up on it's own.\nThe setting is implied. It\u2019s heavily adventurer-centric. It\u2019s actually more of an adventuring structure that you can drape over your own, or shop bought, setting of choice. Adventuring is a career, and after a while becomes its own raison d'\u00eatre beyond simply killing monsters in ill-lit holes and absconding with their stuff. \nInterior art\nHow does it play with other games? \nAwesomely. If you\u2019re old school, then there might well be some bits you fancy nicking to liven up the downtime elements of your gaming. If you\u2019re more new school then the more loosey-goosey soft-crunch might inspire you in some way. You can use all your old adventures as a skeleton for your sessions. For example, using the montage system, veteran gamers could drop the Tomb of Horrors into a session and have it done in one sitting. That would be cool right? \nMoar art!\nWhy \u2018King of Dungeons\u2019?\nMe and my mate Gaz always used to joke about how being a King would be cool because you could do anything you wanted. I even use the term as an internet handle. It\u2019s all bravado really, just like the way I play most of my characters in RPGs. I like the idea of the GM being King, and of perhaps having a setting where the King of Dungeons is something you could actually aspire to be. Gender doesn\u2019t come into it. It\u2019s more of an attitude and maybe it\u2019s a brand. If you\u2019re the GM here, you\u2019re the King of Dungeons, and it is great being King. Or Queen. Or Marquis.\nMonstrous foe, by Jonny Gray\nWhat do you need from me?\nYour sweet, sweet validation. Look, the game is ready. The book is A5 (digest sized) and clocks in at 138 pages. You'll get digital rewards as soon as the funds have cleared (usually a couple of weeks after the campaign closes), and the physical books will be ordered then too. \nI will be using DriveThruRPG.com's Kickstarter fulfillment program to distribute all Kickstarter rewards. Some rewards are digital products (the PDFs) as well as the option to print the books at the same cost it costs me. I take no further money from you printing the book.\nEstimated print costs are:\nSoftcover: \u00a33 or $4 (US)\nHardcover: \u00a36 or $7 (US)\nDelivery varies, depending on location, speed, and the whims of global economics. Nah, they're not too bad really.  \nWhat I need is to understand how many of you fine folk are out there, who really want some King of Dungeons in their life. This funding pushes the game into your hands first (at an early adopter price), and then to everyone else later. Back me, and make me sweat for you. Force me to come up with stretch goals (I want to show you my campaign, the city it's set in, and all the extra rules stuff that I couldn't squeeze into the main book), encourage me to find new artists, guilt me into paying the good friends who've already done so much for the project with nary more than a promise of a pint. Please!\n...and thank you.\nBaz\nHow your stuff gets to you\nMulti-classing\nOne book not enough for you? Don't blame you. Surely the collective noun is a coronation of kings? (It isn't, I checked) Here's how you order extra books. Pledge for one reward as usual. Then, use the Pledge Manager option to manually add more funds to your original pledge. For example, if you want another soft-back, add another \u00a312 via Pledge Manager. If you want to add two hard-backs to your single soft-back, that's \u00a348. (Don't forget, you'll still need to stump up for the printing and delivery costs when I send out your At Cost Discount Codes post campaign.) \nOnce the campaign is finished, I'll fire up the spreadsheet and send out Backer surveys so that I can get your orders just the way you want them.\nI'm going to set a hard limit of 10 copies per backer max on this. It's only fair. \nStretch Goals!\nDue to popular demand, I have some stretch goals planned for you lovely backers. \nI have assembled a crack cadre of the UK's finest GMs to write adventures for King of Dungeons. These guys are truly masters of their craft, and they've spend decades behind screens and in front of Convention tables. I can't wait to see what they'll cook up, and I'm offering a simple threshold to get these.\n\u00a34000 gets the first adventure unlocked. \u00a35000 gets the second one. And so on.\n\u00a34K - FIRST ADVENTURE UNLOCKED! Writer TBA\n\u00a35K - SECOND ADVENTURE UNLOCKED! Writer TBA\n\u00a36K - THIRD ADVENTURE UNLOCKED! Writer TBA\n\u00a37K - FOURTH ADVENTURE UNLOCKED!

Veteran Con GM, incredible purveyor of pacey, gritty, dilemma driven plots, and my personal gaming inspiartion.\n Neil Gow. The man behind Omnihedron Games, home of Duty & Honour, Beta to Quarters and Era. The legendary Con GM of multi session spectaculars, and a major contributor to the new Liminal RPG.\n Guy Milner. Head honcho of the Burn After Running blog, and driving force behind the Go Play Leeds games days. Literally wrote the book on one shot gaming. Quirky, slick and always tasty gaming goodness.\n Dirk the Dice. You'll know his dulcet tones from The Grognard Files podcast, where he talk about the games from back in the day and today. The archetypal cabaret GM, with a laminator and a Sharpie by his side, Dirk never knowingly stints on the production values.\n Mat Hart. Doyen of the gaming industry for many years. Creative director for Steamforged Games, home of Guild Ball and the Dark Souls Board Game among many other Kickstarter breaking projects. And, more importantly, my GM in our weekly gaming group that meets up at least twice per year.   \n Richard August. Freelancer and all-round RPG luminary, contributer to Conan, John Carter, Lamentations shizzle and many many more.  \nYou'll get these unlocked adventures included for free with your pledges from Adventurer and up. They'll be in digital form, and they will come separately to your main order. These adventures are not yet written, but they will not slow down or delay this Kickstarter in any way shape or form.

Not alone. That future won\u2019t be built by any one of us: we need to team up to do it. Here at Factr, we\u2019re putting our faith in a small but strong group of you who give a damn about changing things. If you\u2019re reading this, we think you might be one of them. \nEven the smallest pledge for Factr is a vote for that better future. \nPerhaps you\u2019re thinking, I can only afford to pledge $1. What difference could that possibly make? Our answer: a big difference. Every single pledge sends a message that one more person is dissatisfied enough with the status quo to ask for something different.\nWhether or not you ultimately choose to be an active member of Factr and participate in building that future with us, a small pledge simply says, \u201cYes, I want an alternative like this to exist. I don\u2019t want a world where a few tech giants control the channels to and from my devices. I want to be in control.\u201d\nIf you agree, cast your vote by backing this project. \nCreate streams about anything that matters to you and control who can access and contribute to them.\n\nHere\u2019s how Factr is different:\nControl what you share and what you see\nOrganize all your information in one place\nSave time, find focus, be productive\nNo distractions, no ads, no tracking, no manipulation\nPowerful curation and presentation tools\nMore conscious and productive engagement with your network \nFactr is built to improve your digital life in a very simple way: we\u2019ve removed the unwelcome aspects of most social networks, so that you can focus on what you want to do\u2014without being manipulated, tracked, profiled, distracted, followed by ads, or served content unrelated to what you\u2019re doing. \nInstead, you determine exactly what you see, what you save, and what you share.\nThe result? A clearly focused, better organized, and more thoughtfully connected digital life, with you at the center. \nPost. Save. Create.\nFinally, there\u2019s one place where you can post or collect just about anything.  \nNow, whenever you have something that matters to you\u2014a thought, a note, a link, an image, a file, video, audio\u2013you name it\u2013just post it to Factr. It\u2019ll be there, saved for later, in your private Factr inbox. Folders and tags make it easy to organize, and our search finds it quickly when you need it, from any  device.\n\nWant to share something with others? If you want to share it widely, post it to your Factr profile. Or if you want to share it privately, message it directly to another member or to a group.\nCreate original posts \nSave and annotate links (pro tip: our browser extension makes it super easy!)\nUpload images, video, audio, docs, virtually any kind of file \nAdd integrations including Twitter, and an increasing number of other apps.   \n\nPost almost any type of content.\n\n Curate and customize with streams\nIf you want to collect or share even more powerfully, Factr streams are custom spaces where you can focus on one topic, issue, or project. You can save and organize content any way you want to. A stream can be public or private, and Factr\u2019s access controls let you specify exactly which people you share it with. You can give them permission to view only, contribute new material, help edit the stream, or manage it with you.\nCreate subject-specific focus \n Share with one, a few, or many (or just yourself)\n Drag and drop items from stream to stream or from your inbox\nAdd folders to organize more deeply\nCustomize display: cover image, icon, title, and description\nCustomize order: by name, by post-time, or by custom time-line\nCustomize notifications and emails to keep you current \nAggregate and filter\nMonitor hundreds of websites and use Factr\u2019s customizable filters to automatically distill relevant content in your streams.\nCombine RSS feeds and Google alerts for powerful automated scanning\nCreate sophisticated filters to refine your results \nCreate smart folders that collect items for you automatically\nCopy feeds from stream to stream \nOrganize\nFactr is built to keep you on top of all the information you manage. Factr helps you organize it, annotate it, and find it quickly. Factr\u2019s organizational tools are easily customized to your requirements as they change.\nUse folders to sort quickly and easily\nAdd tags for easy reference\nClick to highlight important items\nArrange by date to create useful timelines\nAdd custom streams for any use\nCreate smart folders to do work for you\n Drag and drop items to rearrange easily\nCustomize notifications and emails to keep you current\nCollaborate\nFactr supercharges your work with others. \nFor groups or organizations, there\u2019s a lot of redundant effort around information-gathering. Teams often operate in isolation from each other. Factr allows everyone to focus on curating what they know best and then share it with the people to whom it\u2019s relevant. Everyone benefits, everyone saves time, and organizations can save a lot of money.\nDiscuss and comment on individual items\n Highlight important content\nCreate groups \n Message other members\nCreate shared understanding across networks, large and small\nStay up-to-date effortlessly\nCreate and share reports and digests \nFactr messaging.\nDiscover\nFactr's range of search and discovery tools are focused on finding what you want, and filtering out what you don\u2019t. \n Search Factr for items\nFind streams to follow \nExplore and discover new sources \nCreate smart folders that collect items for you\nAccess material from external sources, or Google alerts (or your Twitter feed!)\nDiscover subject-matter experts outside your social bubble \nFind and engage with subject-matter experts.\nWe work for you, not advertisers\nThe key difference between Factr and the other social networks is the very nature of our business. We\u2019re completely member-supported. You\u2019re the boss.\nWe don\u2019t profit from selling your attention.\nWe\u2019ll never show you content you didn\u2019t ask for.\nWe\u2019ll never sell your data to anyone.\nYour privacy is our priority\nFactr is built for your privacy and security like no other social network. \nSave personal items, visible only to you\nShare access to exactly what you choose, with exactly the people you choose\nControl roles and permissions like no other platform\nFactr's built to help you out, not sell you out\nCurrently in private beta, Factr has been piloted by hundreds of individuals and teams of all kinds. It\u2019s been used for almost every purpose and project you can think of, by academics, activists, artists, athletes, bakers, collectors, cooks, dancers, designers, entrepreneurs, filmmakers, forecasters, humanitarians, investors, journalists, knitters, novelists, parents, podcasters, researchers, teachers, and more.  \n\n\n\nFactr is built for people who care about knowledge, who collect and share ideas, articles, images\u2014and for whom the discussion around them is something thoughtful and nurtured. Factr is for people who want to connect and share in distinctly different ways with different groups: colleagues, loved ones, neighbors, like-minded peers, or your entire network/public.\nFactr is for individuals\nCollect information and organize for easy access\nCheck in on all of your favorite websites in one place.\nConnect with others\nShare files one-to-one\nOrganize personal documents, records, notes safely \nFactr is for groups, teams, friends, and family\nCollaborate on research and knowledge-gathering\nPrivately share pictures, video, artifacts\nPlan events, projects, or travel\nShare content related to common interests\nFactr is for companies, communities, and organizations\nReal-time news and issue monitoring\nCumulative knowledge base\nSimple-to-implement and inexpensive intranet\nInteraction with members\nCommunication with the public\nFounders\nChris (left) and Michael\nCo-founders Chris van der Walt and Michael Grossman have unique experiences that have shaped Factr.\nChris van der Walt has over 20 years of experience as a graphic and interaction designer across various sectors. For almost a decade, he worked at the United Nations , where he was a member of the founding team at Global Pulse, an innovation initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General. The team sought to apply real-time and big data to sustainable development and humanitarian action.\nMichael Grossman is a long-time creative director, editor, and consultant with over 30 years of experience leading multiple startups and legacy media brands into the digital arena. A charter member of the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences (which has juried the Webby Awards since the mid-\u201990s), he\u2019s focused on the evolution of content-sharing in online communities.\nChris and Michael certainly aren't working alone. Factr is built by a small but incredibly talented team of engineers, communications people, freelancers\u2014and with the invaluable support and advice of our community of family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and advisors. \nMembers of the Factr family.\nFactr\u2019s origins\nFactr is an outgrowth of two projects that Michael and Chris were working on individually.\nComing out of the content world, Michael was creating a community where subject-matter expertise (rather than sheer popularity) was used to recognize value, amplifying weak signals.\nAfter his time at the UN, Chris was working on a project focused on ways to collaboratively evaluate real-time intelligence, and quickly form and ratify actionable hypotheses.\nAfter a lot of idea-sharing at their local coffee spot, they decided to team up. Now, their goal is to build a platform that gives members unequaled control of their information, and enhances their ability to discover, organize, and share knowledge\u2014maximizing both privacy and productivity.\nKickstarter is a platform powered by participation\nWe\u2019re launching on Kickstarter, because Kickstarter is an example of a project we love. While mostly strangers to each other, the Kickstarter community teams up to identify and elevate good ideas. We can't think of a better way to underline the people-powered vision of information sharing that we have for Factr.\nTo build a community that mirrors this, we see a two-step approach:\nThe first step is to earn your pledge, which is your vote for a more ethical social network. The more people that back our project, the more clear the need for change is, and the more viable Factr becomes. The money raised during this Kickstarter campaign will build the next set of features to give you control of the information in your life.\nThe second step is your participation, which will define our long-term vision. Factr is taking a revolutionary approach to creating a social network: a human approach. We will always remain true to our core values, but how the platform evolves (the features we prioritize, even our community standards) will be based on your feedback. \nWhy is our goal 50K?\n$50,000 is clearly not enough to build a platform like the one we\u2019re describing. We\u2019ve already invested far more. We\u2019ve been lucky enough to get this far with the help of a network of friends, colleagues, and family, and our own savings. We\u2019re betting big on Factr.\n\n         Some in the investment community may not be attracted to this kind of venture, as we aren\u2019t aiming to be the next unicorn. Instead, we\u2019re working to craft a strong, steady, self-sustaining business, one that serves its community of customers and employees well.\n\n         So we\u2019re taking a grassroots, community-driven approach to growth and funding. Reaching $50K is an incremental target, a goal that will enable us to launch with the set of features we\u2019ve laid out here. There are even more useful features ahead on our product roadmap, and the more we can raise, the sooner you\u2019ll have them in your hands!\nOur roadmap (The more we raise, the faster you get these)\nNew Android and iPhone apps\nImport content and groups from Facebook\nImport Twitter history\nImport browser bookmarks\nImport from Pinterest, Pocket, other collection tools\nGeotagging and location search/filtering\nMap view and pin-drop\nGroup profile and inbox\nPost as a group\nPaid group memberships\nMember-to-member transactions\nGroup subscriptions\nSlideshow view\nExpertise/reputation system\nEnd-to-end encryption\nInformation fiduciary model\nOptional two-factor authentication\nReports/Newsletters\nFree to join, get even more when you subscribe\nBasic Factr membership is free, and always will be. It\u2019s a great tool for your own personal use and/or small scale collaboration. \nSo how will our members support us? \nOnce you try Factr, and become a consistent user, our hope is that you\u2019ll choose to become a supporting member. Support from our premium users will not only keep the platform going, but help us to continually improve it. And as with everything on Factr, you\u2019re in control, so those improvements will be based on input from you, the community.\nProtect yourself from your camera being used without your permission.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFactr is the culmination of years of experience and planning, and is being brought to fruition by a conscientious team of designers and developers. While there are always risks and challenges in creating a new platform and planning the growth of a new community, we\u2019ve worked to minimize them.\n\nWe plan to onboard our first wave of new users in early July. Barring any unforeseen issues, that launch will contain an even more expansive suite of features than you see here, giving you even more control of your information.\n\nWhile Factr is open to anyone, we do realize it isn\u2019t for everyone. Surveys show that most (three out of every four) of the 200+ million users of major social networks in the US are happy, and say they wouldn\u2019t pay for an ad-free alternative. But the other one in four (representing over 50 million people) are unhappy enough that they\u2019d vote with their wallets to change it, saying they would be willing to pay anywhere from $5 to over $15 for an ad-free alternative. \n\nOur projections have assumed paying membership from at the very most 1.5 percent of those 50 million. A risk is that even fewer of them follow through on their stated willingness to pay. Our research (and our pilot experience) also shows a sizable audience outside the social media audience: knowledge workers, community groups, businesses, NGOs, membership organizations, researchers, curators, educators, content creators, and more. We project a small number of paying members from these ranks. Again, our risk is that these groups do not take to Factr in accord with our modest projections.\n\nOf course, many of these unknowns are up to you, our future members. If you\u2019re willing to spread the word about Factr, we believe we have a great chance to eliminate those risks\u2014and change the information landscape for good.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Factr Fan", "descp": "\u2022 Our eternal thanks via email\n\u2022 Beta access\n\u2022 Every dollar pledged is a vote for a more ethical social network, and will help us provide an even better tracking-free alternative.

MSPE (as it came to be known) allowed players to run rpg adventures from the 1800's all the way to the modern era, ranging from Victorian steampunk, and crime noir, to super spy thrilllers in the cold war. Michael Stackpole wrote the MSPE role playing game, using the Tunnels & Trolls framework as a jumping off point. \nIn 1986, Flying Buffalo took a hit from an unrelated disaster, and sold the rights of MSPE to Sleuth Publications. They came out with an edition that had a black & white cover, and they left out a few things that Buffalo had included, and inserted a few new things that weren't in the Buffalo edition. The last existing copies of the Sleuth edition have sold out, so now Flying Buffalo is printing a third (Combined Edition of MSPE) which includes all the material that was in both editions! \nThe Combined Edition: What's in it? The new edition will contain all the original text and art from the Flying Buffalo and Sleuth editions.  From the Buffalo edition, we will use the amazing painted cover and will include the Tunnels & Thompsons section (which was not in the Sleuth edition) along with some missing art. We have also made various corrections to the rules text that have been found by players and fans over the years.\nRestored and enhanced covers and the Tunnels & Thompsons section\nThe Sleuth edition had several extra sections at the end of the rules that are not in the Buffalo edition. These include optional rules on aging; 13 fully described statted Non-Player characters (including Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty - illustrated by Liz Danforth) and a special folding version of the MSPE Character sheet. All of these will be added to the Combined Edition. \nPLUS New material: On top of that, we are also going to add some new information on using MSPE in sci-fi environments and info on stopping distances for vehicles. All newly illustrated by Steve Crompton. We just might also add a few other rule enhancements based on the response to this Kickstarter.\nPlus sample characters/portraits, and additional material added to the Combined Edition!\nWe will be including all of this in the Combined Edition - (Along with  possibly a few other surprises!)  The rules will  be printed as a trade paperback 8 x 11, (or as a hardback) and for a little extra you can even get your copy of the rules signed by Michael Stackpole. (see details in the pledge levels)\nIf you are a Tunnels & Trolls player you should get this book to see how T&T evolved to allow for guns, grenades, cars, planes and tech skills. And you can easily adapt the MSPE rules for use with your T&T characters and campaigns. Trolls with grenade launchers? Elves with machine guns? Why not!)\nADD ONS: Here are some extras you can add to your pledge!\n Stormhaven printed -  $6 (note if you are buying a hardcover you get 1 free copy)\n Stormhaven PDF -  $5  \n  Add your name to the book - $10 if you are buying a hardcover book\n Mugshots 1: Case of the Pacific Clipper printed - $9 (Written by Dave Arneson)\n Mugshots 1: Case of the Pacific Clipper PDF - $3 (Written by Dave Arneson)\n Jade Jaguar solo printed  - $6 (Written by Mike Stackpole)\n Jade Jaguar solo PDF  - $2 (Written by Mike Stackpole)\nGM Screen printed - $7\nGM Screen PDF  - $3\nTo purchase add-ons, just add the price listed above of any item you want to the your pledge total. At the end of the KS, we'll send a survey out and you can let us know which  add-ons you want us to ship you. PLEASE NOTE: if you have bought just a PDF of the MSPE rules, but want printed copies of any of the add-ons, there is a $4 extra charge to cover shipping. So remember to add that to your pledge total. (If you bought a printed rulebook there is NO extra shipping charge.) Also if you buy printed copies of any books you will also get a FREE copy of the PDF.\nOTHER INFO ABOUT THIS PROJECT:\nWe've already scanned and restored all the pages of the rules and the book is ready to go to press. All we need to do is add the page of backer names, scan Stormhaven and Jade Jaguar and give them to the printer.  So there really should not be much delay. \nPledge today and help bring this classic piece of RPG history back to life again! \n Final (probably) stretch goal:  If we make $25,000 we will make a poster of the original cover art for the book, and send one free poster to everyone who has requested a physical copy of the rulebook!  If you only requested pdfs, you can get a poster by adding $10 for postage to your pledge.  If you want more than one poster, add $5 for each additional.\nWhere does the money go? Almost half goes to the printer to print 1000 copies. another share goes towards production (scanning, restoration, new material added to the book, new art and pre-press) About 5% goes to kickstarter ($500), 5% more goes to the credit card company and we expect to have to ship around 300 copies at $4 each for postage and packaging. The rest goes to cover any expenses I've forgotten about, or unexpected expenses, and if there is any left over I might get to keep some. \nKickstarter doesn't let you support with more than one reward. So if you want extras, just add extra money as below to your pledge: for each extra copy of the book, add $16. Fpr each extra signed copy of the book, add $25. When I send out the survey I'll ask you for what you wanted. You can also select other items when you answer the survey.\nUS Backers note: postage is included for USA backers.\nAlso note: nothing from this project is limited edition, so if you want something, but cannot afford it right now, just tell me when you answer the survey. You can send the extra funds later by credit card or by paypal. We will work with you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe book is written, edited and laid out. All we need now is the money.

The Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master uses the experiences of thousands of GMs to help us focus on how we prepare our games, how we run our games, and how we think about our games. It includes practical steps for focusing our preparation activities on those things that will bring the biggest impact to our game.\nFive years ago, the Lazy Dungeon Master offered a simplifed approach for preparing fantasy RPGs with one clear directive: prepare only what most benefits our games. This focus on lightweight preparation and improvisational preparation resonated with many GMs over the past five years.\nBut during that time and with the release of the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons, the world of fantasy roleplaying has changed and expanded. With five years of new systems and new ideas, all GMs have a wealth of experiences to share and explore to help us prepare and run great RPGs. Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master builds off of the concepts of the well-received GM's guidebook Lazy Dungeon Master, updating that book with five years of new experiences, new approaches, and new observations of the way people prepare and run RPGs. This new book is a completely self-contained work, which does not require anyone to have previously read The Lazy Dungeon Master.\nReturn of the Lazy Dungeon Master offers a new focused approach for preparing and running our roleplaying games. The book includes an eight-step guide for lightweight game preparation and is focused on how we prepare for our games, how we run our games, and how we think about our games.\nYou can check out the PDF preview of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master or check out the table of contents below to see if it's the right book for you.\n   Based on research involving hundreds of books, videos, articles, and interviews with top Gamemasters, as well as thousands of results from Gamemaster surveys, Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master helps us understand the best tips and tricks used by GMs all over the world to bring the most fun to our games.\nPrepare what benefits your game.\nAbout This Kickstarter\nThe full text of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master is complete. Your funding towards this Kickstarter will go towards the editing of the book by veteran RPG editor Scott Fitzgerald Gray, and the layout and art direction of the book by veteran RPG art director Marc Radle. The book will also include internal art by Pedro Potier. Here's an example of the art.\nThe Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook\nAs this Kickstarter grows, we will put together a Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook. This workbook will include a wide range of tools, maps, and reference sheets to help you run your 5e roleplaying game. It will have a brand-new cover by Jack Kaiser and is intended to be used right at the table. All backers will get the PDF of this workbook and digital versions of the maps. Backers at the $13 level will be able to order print copies of the workbook for the cost of printing (about $6) and shipping (about $6 in US and UK).\nHere are some example worksheets we will include:\nLazy DM Reference Sheet \nSession Preparation Worksheet \nCharacter Tracker Campaign Worksheet \n5e Cheat Sheet \nRandom NPC Names \nRandom Traps \nRandom Single-Use Magic Items \nRandom Dungeon Encounters \nRandom Fantastic Features\nBelow you'll see some example draft reference sheets. Note that these sheets have not yet gone through formatting or design.\n5e Quick Reference\n Trap Generator\nLazy Lairs\nThe Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook will also now include ten \"Lazy Lairs\" including full-color maps of commonly-used dungeons and one-page write-ups with descriptions, read-aloud text, and area aspects. They're designed so you can easily use them in your game with little to no preparation needed. These Lazy Lairs will be included in the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook and all backers will receive digital versions of these maps with fully-annotated DM versions and unannotated versions for use in virtual tabletops like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds.\nHere are two example maps by Derek Ruiz and Daniel Walthall.\n  Stretch Goals\nLazy Dungeon Master Workbook PDF ($5000 - Unlocked!). All backers will receive the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook PDF. \nInternal Artwork ($6,000\u2014UNLOCKED). We'll commission internal artwork to make the book even more beautiful.\nEPUB E-book Version ($8,000\u2014UNLOCKED) Every backer will now receive Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master as an EPUB e-book as well. This format is perfect for reading the book on a phone, tablet, or e-reader.\nHardback Version At Cost for $13 Pledges ($10,000\u2014UNLOCKED). Those who back at the $13 level will be able to buy the book in a deluxe hardback edition. This collector's edition will be available from RPG Now for the cost of printing, about $15, and is perfect or sitting in a comfortable chair, drinking a favorite beverage, and pondering how to make your next game awesome. You do not need to increase your pledge above $13 to have this option. You will receive a link to order the book at the cost of printing and shipping when the book is ready.\nFive Lazy Lairs ($15,000\u2014UNLOCKED). The Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook will contain five full color maps of common locations we use in our D&D games including Caves, Temple, Castle, Sewers, and Dungeon. These maps will be done by Daniel Walthall, Derek, Ruiz, and Miska Fredman.\nFive More Lazy Lairs and a Print Version of the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook ($20,000\u2014UNLOCKED). We'll add five more Lazy Lairs to the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook including the Cellars, Tower, Docks, Mines, and Catacombs. We will also commission a new cover for the workbook by Jack Kaiser and create a print-on-demand version of the workbook for those at the $13 tier. We expect the cost of printing to be roughly $6.\nHigh Resolution Cover Artwork (2,000 backers\u2014UNLOCKED). Every backer will receive high-resolution JPEGs of Jack Kaiser's covers for each of the books suitable for printing or using as a background for a phone or tablet.\nLazy Lair Descriptions ($30,000\u2014UNLOCKED). All ten Lazy Lairs will include a one-page lair description with general notes about the lair and read-aloud text for each of the lair's rooms or chambers. These lair descriptions will make it easy to use these lairs right at the table with very little preparation ahead of time.\nDiscounted Original Lazy Dungeon Master ($50,000\u2014UNLOCKED). For those who don't have the original Lazy Dungeon Master, all backers will be able to buy the original Lazy Dungeon Master PDF for half price ($3) and $13 backers will also be able to buy the softcover version of the book for three bucks off ($7) from Lulu.com.\nA Note on Print Delivery\nAs we have with Fantastic Locations and Fantastic Adventures, we will be fulfilling print copies of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master for the Print Option tier through RPGNow. This means you will be able to purchase a copy of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master directly from RPGNow at the cost of printing and shipping. We expect this cost to come to roughly $6 for the softcover book and $15 for the hardcover book plus $6 for shipping in Europe and the US. This cost is not included in your pledge and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to receive them. When the books are ready, you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from RPG Now.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe full text of the main book is complete, and both the editor (Scott Fitzgerald Gray) and the art director (Marc Radle) are on board to build it into a full book. \n\nPersonal catastrophes can always get in the way of the production of a book like this, but the risk is low.

Technology puts the tools to defeat death, emancipate from need, and reshape bodies and minds in the hands of everyone, but it also provides the means for oppression and mass destruction. After losing Earth in a war with AIs, transhumanity disperses throughout the solar system and beyond, struggling to survive. In a typical Eclipse Phase game, characters belong to Firewall, a secret, cross-faction organization that protects transhumanity from extinction threats. Alternate campaigns involve traversing the mysterious Pandora gates to explore extrasolar worlds or navigating the treacherous terrain of high-tech criminal cartels.\nThe first edition of Eclipse Phase won numerous awards (2010 Origins Award for Best RPG, 2010 ENnie Gold for Best Writing, and 2010 ENnie Silvers for Best Cover Art and Product of the Year) and was critically acclaimed for the innovation and depth of its setting. The Eclipse Phase line is recognized for its creativity, world-building, amazing artwork, and high production standards.\nAbout Eclipse Phase, Second Edition\nEclipse Phase, Second Edition (EP2), is a full-color, hardcover tabletop RPG book. It contains the full rules for making and playing Eclipse Phase characters, four sample teams of four characters each, and detailed setting information\u2014a complete roleplaying game in one book!\nEP2 will be in gaming stores after the Kickstarter ships, and will be a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licensed release!\nEclipse Phase, Second Edition Cover\nWhat\u2019s New in EP2?\nWe\u2019re focusing on improving and simplifying the existing Eclipse Phase system, not re-inventing the wheel. Changes include:\nFaster Character Creation \u2014 A package-buy character creation system lets people build characters quickly without missing essentials.\nStreamlined Resleeving \u2014 An aptitude-linked pool system means that skills don\u2019t need to be recalculated when a character resleeves (switches bodies).\nUpdated Gameplay \u2014 We've reduced the number of skills and made them easier to acquire. Gear costs are replaced with a system that works the same whether you are buying gear, acquiring it with rep favors, or nano-fabbing. Combat, hacking, and other systems are also updated.\nFour Sample Teams \u2014 Pre-fabbed teams can be dropped right into a game and serve as examples of balanced parties.\nRedesigned Book \u2014 A spread-based organization keeps material close-at-hand with less page-flipping.\nMost first-edition source material is compatible with EP2.\nOpen Playtest\nOur Open Playtest of the EP2 system has started, and will continue into June 2017. You can download the playtest packet for free on DriveThruRPG.\nStretch Goals\nThe Eclipse Phase, Second Edition campaign unlocked the following stretch goals:\nFreelancer Bonus and Freelance Bonus 2\nNPC File Volume 2 (Digital Stretch Goal)\nYour Whispering Muse Series 1 (Digital Stretch Goal)\nEclipse Phase, Second Edition Player's Guide (Digital Stretch Goal)\nAmbient Album from Scott Fox (Digital Stretch Goal)\nXenovore gatecrashing adventure for Eclipse Phase, Second Edition & Transhumanity's Fate (Digital Stretch Goal)\nOfficial Eclipse Phase, Second Edition Wiki\nIntroductory Adventure from Jack Graham (Digital Stretch Goal)\nThe Digital Stretch Goals will be made available to backers first, and then released for sale to the public!\nDelivery Dates\nOur electronic release date for Eclipse Phase, Second Edition is in August. The print version is projected to ship in October, with electronic stretch goals to follow into 2018.\nWe will be using BackerKit to manage add-ons and handle shipping. If you are a backer, you'll get more information from us about that no later than September 2017.\nThe Creative Team\nEclipse Phase, Second Edition, is developed by Rob Boyle and Jack Graham, with Adam Jury\u2019s graphic design. Authors include Simon Berman, Rob Boyle, Katherine Cross, Nathaniel Dean, Jack Graham, Travas Gunnell, Sarah Hood, Marc Huete, Jason Mical, Ross Payton, and Evie Smith.

We are game-industry veterans with over four decades of combined experience. We first published Eclipse Phase in 2009; originally through two different publishing partners, but on our own since 2011. We sell our traditionally printed books through game distributors to your friendly local game store, we offer print-on-demand for other books, and we sell in open electronic formats. All of our releases are Creative Commons licensed, which gives you the freedom to share them with your gaming group, make changes to the game as you like, and distribute those changes.\nVideo Credits\nVideo by Davidson Cole: davidsoncole.com\nAnimations by Justin Grizzoffi: speedwagonmovie.com\nThanks For Your Support!\nAs a small publisher, navigating the waters of RPG publishing is always difficult.

The production process for the book is well underway. The artwork for the book has been assigned and many pieces are already completed. The bulk of the writing is complete, and we'll be running an Open Playtest during the Kickstarter campaign.\n\nPosthuman Studios is a small company. As an owner-operated company, the health and happiness of our owners and the freelancers we hire is a high priority to us, and that means we sometimes run into unforeseen delays. That said, this is far from our first space rodeo.\n\nWe are likely printing Eclipse Phase, Second Edition, with a printer we have worked with in the past. We have a great relationship with them and have never had a major problem. The books will be shipped to an established game distributor and shipped to backers from there. We are only creating one other physical item for this Kickstarter campaign: a USB key with all our books on it. Keeping the number of physical items down keeps logistics simpler, for faster and more accurate deliveries.\n\nIn 2013, we ran a Kickstarter to fund Transhuman, a first-edition Eclipse Phase supplement. We delivered Transhuman before the end of 2013. We still have a few small electronic-only stretch goals left over from that project, and Transhuman backers have been recently appraised of their status.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "I'm buying at my local game store!", "descp": "Supporting the cause -- thank you!

Click here for more information!\n     Shipping and Fulfillment\nSong of Swords will be printed and fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG! \n\nBacker tiers and add-on costs have factored in shipping to the United States, which means that you do not need to pledge extra if you are shipping domestically. \n\nWe have tried to absorb international shipping as much as we can. Most Backer tiers have very low additional shipping costs to international destinations. As it's a little more difficult to know how many international Backers plan to purchase add-ons, we have requested a flat USD$10 rate for EACH individual printed add-on.\n\nHowever, if you really want 10 copies of the hardcover Core Rulebook, please get in contact with us! During the campaign, we can open up pledge levels for popular bundles that may have significantly reduced shipping costs than if you purchased the items individually.\n\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks with every project, though we are confident that we will complete Song of Swords to the quality level we've set for ourselves by the expected delivery date.\n\nThe Beta rules (free to download at www.songofswords.net) are mostly complete, however we intend to refine how the rules are presented. It will take time and a healthy serving of playtesting to make sure we nail them just right. It's taken our team a while to get to this point, however in this time we've learned so much--about the realities of game development and delivery--and we now have the tools available to deliver the project. We have a schedule, but it is possible there could be delays.\n\nThis will be our first printed product, and we have done extensive research on the common pitfalls of printing and shipping. By partnering with DriveThruRPG, we are able to manage those risks more easily. Whether we have five backers, or five thousand, DriveThruRPG's POD platform simplifies this process. However, despite our careful planning, there will inevitably be lost or late packages, and we will be open about delays and how we can help put things right for our Backers. \n\nNo matter what we're getting this product out there, and in your hands.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Contributer", "descp": "You will receive a PDF of the completed Core Rulebook!\nINCLUDES:\nCore Rulebook (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Squire", "descp": "You will have your name immortalized in the Core Rulebook and on the Song of Swords website as thanks for making this project possible!\nINCLUDES:\nYour name in the Core Rulebook\nCore Rulebook (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Squire PLUS+", "descp": "The Digital Pack is a two-part reward:\nFirst, you will receive the Magic Compendium (PDF), the NPC Army Deck 1 (PDF), the Map of Vosca (PDF), the print-ready GM Screen inserts with quick rules and art from the game (PDF), the Character Sheet (form-fillable PDF), NPC Builder (MS Excel), and high-quality desktop backgrounds.\nSecondly, Digital Pack Backers will also receive all Stretch Goals digitally (where applicable).\nINCLUDES:\nYour name in the Core Rulebook\nCore Rulebook (PDF)\nDigital Pack (PDFs)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "Knight", "descp": "You will receive a printed softcover version of the Core Rulebook in full color!

Although it feels like a traditional notebook, the Everlast is endlessly reusable and connected to all of your favorite cloud services. \nWhen you write using any pen from the Pilot Frixion line, your writing sticks to Everlast pages like regular paper. But add a drop of water\u2026 and the notebook erases like magic.\nThe Everlast notebook is compatible with the Rocketbook app. That means before your notes go off the page they go online to destinations like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote \u2014 perfectly organized.\nPrior to shipping, we will send you a survey, so you can select which size(s) you want. Feel free to mix and match if you purchase multiple Everlast notebooks.\nNote: There is a typo in the 5+ reward where we reference Waves (not Everlasts). It should read \"US and Canada backers add $30 for each additional Everlast. International add $36. (additional Everlast prices include the extra shipping)\"\n The Everlast is not a whiteboard book.\nYou can use any pen from the Pilot Frixion line. Frixion gel ballpoint pens come in all different kinds and colors and are available for purchase online and in stores.\nWe worked closely with paper industry experts to find the optimal synthetic polyester blend to create pages that could be wiped clean of Frixion ink, but also felt perfectly natural to write on. Writing on an Everlast page feels just like writing on regular paper with a smooth finish.\nThe pages do not have a weird high gloss. And, the writing doesn\u2019t just wipe away.\nHere is where things get crazy. When you combine Frixion pens with the Everlast pages a dry paper towel doesn\u2019t do a thing. But a moist paper towel removes every bit of ink. So you can reuse your notebook over and over again.\nMACHINE VISION \nThe Rocketbook System is the combination of a special notebook and a free mobile app. Write notes and create designs in your notebook with a pen. Then, using patent-pending image capture technology, the Rocketbook app accurately and quickly captures and sends your notes to pre-configured cloud services.\nSEVEN SYMBOLS \nThe seven symbols at the bottom of each page are the magic \u201cbuttons\u201d behind the Rocketbook\u2019s quick and easy cloud organization. You assign each icon to the destination of your choice, any folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Drive, Box, Slack or your email address. When you mark that icon on your page, the Rocketbook app automatically files your notes in the right place.\nIMAGE PROCESSING \nIn an instant, the Rocketbook app crops and enhances each page so your digital notes are more crisp and vibrant than the real thing.\nINTELLIGENT PAGES \nEach page of your Rocketbook Everlast contains a special QR code which tells the Rocketbook app the page number of each scan. That means no matter how or when you scan your Everlast, we can always get your notes in the right order. Each page also has a narrow dark border surrounding it. The border allows the Rocketbook app to find your page quickly in any environment or background, like a messy desk.\nDOT GRID+ \nThe pages all feature a unique dot grid pattern that is perfect for both text notes, sketches and diagrams. NO NOTEBOOK? NO PROBLEM. \nForgot your book or just want to take a test drive? We offer free PDF downloads of Rocketbook pages with our special border. Give it a try today! \n8.5 x 11 Page | A4 Page \nSMUDGE FREE ZONE\nFrixion pen ink completely dries and bonds to the page in about 15 seconds. After that, you\u2019re writing doesn\u2019t budge without moisture. You can flip the page before that, but there may be some slight transfer of the ink. Frixion markers are great for adding a dash of color but they can transfer a small amount of ink to the opposite page. \nPLAY\n\nMAXIMIZE EVERLASTICITY \nONLY USE PILOT FRIXION PENS. Although there are other inks that work, the entire Frixion pen line is the most accessible and they erase perfectly. Plus, they are just excellent pens. If you leave the ink on a page for a really long time (like months), it may leave a faint ghost behind, so it's a good idea to erase every few weeks to keep your book in perfect condition.\nCUSTOMS & DUTIES INFORMATION - FOR INTERNATIONAL ORDERS\nWe cannot mark as gift, this is illegal so we will not be able to do this.\nOur prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.\nAs many of you know, our terms of sale are CIF destination.

See this update on Kickstarter for details on the stretch goal and a new feature called Safe Replies.\nHi, my name is Manton Reece, and I\u2019m writing a book called Indie Microblogging. I'm also launching a brand new platform for microblogs.\nDo you remember how the web used to work? How the web was supposed to work?\nIn the earlier days of the web, we always published to our own web site. If you weren\u2019t happy with your web host, or they went out of business, you could move your files and your domain name, and nothing would break.\nToday, most writing instead goes into a small number of centralized social networking sites, where you can\u2019t move your content, advertisements and fake news are everywhere, and if one of these sites fails, your content disappears from the internet. Too many sites have gone away and taken our posts and photos with them.\nI want to encourage more independent writing. To do that, we need better tools that embrace microblogs and the advantages of the open web. We need to learn from the success and user experience of social networking, but applied to the full scope of the web.\nI first set out to build a new service just for microblogs. It has a timeline experience like a social network, with replies and favorites, but it\u2019s based on RSS, with the main posts pulled from independent sites.\nIf you don\u2019t have a microblog yet, there\u2019s a full publishing interface with Markdown support and a native iPhone app. I call it Micro.blog.\nThe second thing I\u2019m doing is writing a book and I\u2019d love your support for it on Kickstarter. This short book will make the case for microblogging and show you how to participate in the growing community of writers who own even their short-form writing.\nSome of the topics:\nHow to adapt blogging tools like WordPress and Tumblr to work with microblogs.\nThe important role of cross-posting to Twitter, and the best tools out there.\nTips for integrating your microblog into an existing full weblog.\nThe architecture for microblogs, with a behind-the-scenes look at how I built Micro.blog.\nOverview of the latest IndieWebCamp and W3C proposals for indie microblogging, such as Webmention and Micropub.\nPlus my own personal stories on why it matters so much to preserve our content on the internet.\nYou\u2019ll get the book itself and early access to Micro.blog so you can reserve your username. Whenever the Kickstarter project is successfully funded, I'll start sending out invites to backers.\nI love real books, too, so I\u2019m even doing a limited run of print copies of the book in addition to the standard e-book. There are also rewards with Micro.blog stickers and more.\nOver the last couple years, I've posted dozens of articles to my blog about independent microblogging and the open web. Some of them have even inspired others to write more on their own site. I'll be going through all of these posts to take the best writing \u2014 as well as brand new essays and technical topics \u2014 to put together this book. I'm putting everything I have into it.\nThere's a growing community and movement around independent microblogging. With your support, we can take back the future of the web from closed platforms and silos, and leave our own mark on the web. Thank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWriting a book \u2014 even a short one like Indie Microblogging \u2014 is a lot of work.

Expected ship date is the first week of December, likely sooner. We'll share more shipping info in the backer updates. \nI missed the campaign--is it too late to get a Volt Planner? \nIt's never too late! :) We have the 2017 Volt Planner available for preorder on our website.

We sold out of covers so quickly on the Kickstarter but we're already making more.

Keep on shining, superstar. \nHOW WOULD IT FEEL TO ACCOMPLISH EVERY SINGLE GOAL YOU SET OUT FOR YOURSELF THIS YEAR?\nHow successful could you be if you weren't slowed down by day-to-day distractions, and started making real, tangible progress on your most important work and goals?\nIf you\u2019re tired of always feeling like you\u2019re farther behind than you want to be, and you\u2019re ready to start accomplishing the things you truly want to do to move your career and your life forward, then you need the Volt Planner.\nDesigned and delivered by the same team that brought you the incredibly popular Spark Notebook and Spark Planner, the 2017 Volt Planner takes the very best goal-setting, planning, and personal organization tools from those planners and bundles them into a full year of laser-focused amazing success and productivity. \nYou don't need to be perfect or have superpowers to be successful. You just need the right tools. Anyone can be amazing. You can be amazing.\nThe Volt Planner is sleek, professional, and designed to make you more successful. We have taken the science of setting and achieving your goals and wrapped it into one beautifully designed planner - and you won't want to start your year without it.\nWith the Volt Planner, success is always at your fingertips.\nOver the course of my career, I have worked with some of the smartest, most successful people in the world. From my time as a software engineer at big companies like Microsoft and Amazon to my time as a Chief Technology Officer at successful startups like Moz and Decide, to sitting on boards of international organizations, I have seen one thing time and time again:\nThe most successful people in the world are always organized and put together.\nThey rely on targeted goals, smart planning, and deep, focused work to accomplish amazing things. I\u2019ve learned so much about how to be amazing from these people, and now I want to share this proven system to help you be more successful too.\nTwo years ago I launched a Kickstarter to produce a goal-setting and note-taking system called the Spark Notebook. We were able to share the notebooks with people all over the world - it was amazing to create something that made so many people more successful and productive. \nHere we are today, over 30,000 books later. We've shipped to thousands of people and were overwhelmed with inspiring success stories and lots of encouragement to keep the goodness coming year after year.\nYou've got your goals--mine is to take these proven planning tools and give them to you in one planner that you can use to make 2017 your best year yet.\nResearch has shown that people who write down their goals \u2014 and who review those goals regularly \u2014 experience more success than those that don't.\nI wanted to create a place where goal-setting could be beautifully simple and powerfully effective.\nIn the Volt Planner, you\u2019ll find smart, simple, easy-to-use layouts that will help you stay on track every day, all day. This planner takes those big, complex goals and turns them into accomplishments by breaking them down into manageable tasks. After just one week, you'll feel like you're actually getting somewhere and will be one step closer to success.\nTake a look at the images below to get a feel of how beautiful (and functional) these pages are:\nYEARLY THEME & ACHIEVEMENTS\nGreat things come to those who plan for them. Lay out your great plans and big dreams, and keep a record of what you achieve and when.\nMONTHLY GOALS & 30-DAY CHALLENGES\nTrack your monthly goals and challenge yourself to create (or break) a habit. Success is *all* about consistency.\nMONTHLY CALENDARS\nMonthly calendar spreads so you can keep track of all your important dates, reminders, and appointments.\nWEEKLY GOALS & WEEKLY JOURNALING PROMPTS\nEach week there is a place to recognize your progress, learn from your mistakes, and plan how you'll keep going. And of course plenty of blank, flex space to be used for your big thoughts and grand ideas.\nWEEKLY OUTLOOK\nA weekly outlook designed for time blocking - that way you can plan your day and always know you are working on something that matters.\nHAND-CRAFTED AND ARTFULLY BOUND TO LIE FLAT NO MATTER WHAT\nEach book is put together by hand. This isn't just a planner; it's also design, a craft, a work of art. We use a special binding so the planner lies flat, no matter what page you are on.\n---\nThe Volt Planner has the following layouts:\nYearly Theme & Goals - you need to set direction\nAnnual Achievement Tracker - so you can celebrate all the great things you do next year \nMonthly Overview (12 months) \nMonthly Goals (1 for each month) \n30 Day Challenge (1 for each month) \nWeekly Goals - prioritize and strategize so all of your work matters \nWeekly Overview - designed for time blocking to help you make the most of every single day \nWeekly Inspiration Prompts - these are designed to get you thinking, but also designed to be mostly blank so you can fill them with great ideas, fantastic drawings or plans for your next big thing.\nIn addition to the useful design, you\u2019ll also discover these other great features:\nMade in the USA. I\u2019m proud to send something to you made in the country where I live. \nTwo-page markers. You\u2019ll never have to worry about losing your place. \nA luxurious and sophisticated cover. I want this planner to feel and look sophisticated so we have tested all kinds of cover materials and picked one we know you will love. \nHigh quality, ink-proof, acid-free paper. No more ink bleeding through pages. Fountain pen safe (I\u2019ve tested it myself!). \nSpecial lay-flat binding. These books are hand-sewn and designed with a very special binding that allows you to write easily on every page - front and back. \nEnvironmentally sound. We use soy based inks for printing. We use rainforest friendly paper. Everything is produced where we know the labor and manufacturing practices are to the same high standards as our products. \nOver 250 pages. We have designed each page to be clean, simple and flexible. \n 5.75\u201d x 8.25\u201d size. A perfect size for at your desk or in a meeting.\nDuring my entire career as an entrepreneur and executive, I've struggled to find a notebook that had the functionality I needed that I also wouldn't be embarrassed to carry into a board meeting.\nIt seemed like the only notebooks with goal-planners, journaling pages, and organization systems were bright pink and looked like a scrapbook. Not exactly what I was looking for to be taken seriously.\nOn the other hand, though, the sleek, modern notebooks I found lacked all functionality and served only as appointment books or calendars. They were just lined pages with no system for notes, goal-setting, or effective planning. \nThe search for the perfect, professional notebook left me wondering: Why is it so hard to find a notebook with tons of functionality and a beautiful, professional design?\nSo I built my own. I launched the Spark Notebook as a Kickstarter two years ago and the Spark Planner last year. Once the notebooks were delivered to thousands of people across the globe, feedback came pouring in.\nI heard again and again from users who wished for two things: \nA full year of pages \nFewer notes pages and more planning pages \nI listened, and that's exactly what I want to give you with the Volt Planner. Tons of functionality, a full year of amazing planning and goals, and no distractions from your biggest dreams and accomplishments.\nWith the Volt Planner, you can achieve any goal. You can make anything happen.\nAccomplishing amazing things isn't about being superhuman. It's not about being perfect. It's about having the right tools, the right system, and the right plan.\nThe Volt Planner helps you put all those things right in one place, and a place that's so artfully designed you'll want to have it with you all the time \u2014 and your coworkers will ask you where they can get one too.\nNo more wishing you could accomplish more every day, or feeling at the end of the year like you could have done more if you'd only worked harder.\nWith the Volt Planner, you can look any goal in the face and know you'll achieve it. You'll look back on every year and be amazed by what you've accomplished.\nI want you \u2014 and your ideas \u2014 to be heard. I want you to walk into your next meeting as the person everyone else wants to listen to, the person so organized and on top of things that everyone turns to you first. I want you to get more from your career and the things in life that leave you feeling accomplished and proud.\nI want you to do everything you want to do. I want you to wow your boss, coworkers, and clients with how incredibly productive and effective you are. I want you to feel proud and accomplished. And I know the Volt Planner can help you get there.\nIf you want that too \u2014 if you want to show 2017 what you're truly capable of\u2014 then please pledge now so we can build The Volt Planner and make being achieving your goals in 2017 a beautiful reality.\nThe badge below is only displayed because we were contractually required to do so.

For many Americans, playing with army men was almost a rite of passage. While these toys encourage a variety of creative types of play, critics accused them of advocating gun violence and militarism. This accusation led to our vision.\nWith so much misrepresentation of the black community and the vicious cycle the justice system has created for the impoverished, we wanted to take a strong stance in a sort of silent protest. Our Army Men stand strong and proud. They carry no guns and are a tribute to a community that has come from so little to create opportunities that have led to so much.\nWhile many men and women carry guns into battle, these figurines use their bond and their voice. Today we are in a new kind of battle and there has never been a more delicate time to take the right approach. Our supporters appreciate collectibles and understand diversity. \n     The design for these started in an old sketch book. Each character instantly came to life on paper and we knew that more had to be done. We took our sketched design and began going to work. Illustrating each part and finally completely our first set.\nCompletely inspired by these illustrations we moved into 3D. Enlisting an amazing 3D artist our final step towards the beginning.\n    Our perks includes Black Army specific items as well as items produced from Brothas N Sistas company overall. We want to give you a variety of what this brand has to offer.\n   Black Army has been written up by these wonderful publications! \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBrothas N Sistas has recently signed a partner with extensive experience in building new businesses.

If you're into rampant yelling, read on!)\nI\u2019m Grant \u201cGoblin Quest, Drunken Bear Fighter, Doctor Magnethands\u201d Howitt and I\u2019ve written a tabletop roleplaying game with a guy called Chris Taylor. Who\u2019s Chris Taylor? I met Chris Taylor in 2005 and we immediately became BEST FRIENDS FOREVER so you can take my word for it when I say he\u2019s a STAND-UP CHAP and BRILLIANT AT GAMES.\nANYWAY the game we have written is called UNBOUND and it is STELLAR. Here\u2019s why: it\u2019s a UNIVERSAL GAME, and before you say \u201coh Grant, we don\u2019t need another universal game,\u201d let me say NO, YOU DON\u2019T, you need THIS ONE. It can run ANYTHING so long as it\u2019s got FIGHTS in it, and ALL the best stories have fights in them so THERE. \nThe cover, and all interior art, is by the immensely talented Adrian Stone\nWant to tell a story about CORRUPT CYBERPUNK POLICE OFFICERS in OVERCLOCKED POWER ARMOUR? You can do that. Princesses riding SOULBOUND UNICORNS? YUP, as long as you LET US PLAY TOO. Captains in charge of ELITE MILITARY UNITS, taking back a fractured city, BLOCK BY BLOODY BLOCK? 100%. BEARS, as in, everyone just plays a BEAR, and some of the bears are wearing HATS? A HUNDRED TIMES YES.\nGHOST ROAD is our example adventure that's running during the Kickstarter. It features a nightmare world of bound ghosts and ash wastelands, where shamanic tribes dig through the ruins of a shattered civilisation\nWe designed the rules to be liquid, in that whatever space you create with the setting, they\u2019ll FLOW NATURALLY IN to fill it up perfectly. (We are VERY PROUD of the rules.)\nThe Deadeye role focuses on long-range combat and mobility\nALSO you make the world when you make the characters. How great is that? I\u2019ll tell you - MANY GREAT. Gamesmasters, tired of having to spend HOURS slaving over a HOT NOTEPAD while your players SWAN UP every week like they OWN THE PLACE? We\u2019ve written a system that lets you run with BASICALLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF PREP AS YOUR PLAYERS because they do MOST OF THE WORK and you turn up and TAKE ALL THE CREDIT.\nWe played Field Trip prior to the Kickstarter; a fantasy jungle adventure where a group of wizards are sent on a research mission designed to kill them for insurance purposes\n(I\u2019ve written a gamesmaster chapter, too, a companion to my 11 Ways To Be A Better Roleplayer that's helped just shy of 400,000 people improve their game, and it's FANTASTIC.)\nWhat\u2019s more, making a character is EASY and FUN AS HECK. Here\u2019s the breakdown: a character\u2019s CORE is their motivation, their story position. Every character in the group shares the same core - like WARRIOR or OUTLAW or DEVOUT - and it comes with SIX GROUP QUESTIONS that cement the WORLD and the PLOT into place in ONE FELL SWOOP. Okay, SIX FELL SWOOPS.\nThe Warrior core tells stories about fighting, conflict and conquest\nNext up is the ROLE- the particular way you rock in combat. DEADEYES are masters of shooting stuff; WARDENS are excellent at getting punched in the face; STRIKERS stab people and look good doing it; PROTECTORS heal and support their allies; and BRAWLERS generally get their teeth kicked in but take a few guys down with them.\nFinally there\u2019s the TRAITS, and traits are awesome stuff like MIGHTY WEAPON or SPIRIT or FIRE or THE UNNATURAL or RAGE, and they FLAVOUR your character and give them COOL POWERS. Want a pet swarm of bees? Want to become a werewolf? Want to teleport to the SHADOW REALM with one UNLUCKY CHUMP who GOT IN YOUR WAY? We\u2019ve got that covered. And they all have QUESTIONS ATTACHED which BUILD THE WORLD, like: Who is your BEE SENSEI? How am werewolf happen? WHAT AM SHADOWREALM? Et cetera.\nZERO ANGEL is a cyberpunk adventure where the agents of heaven have found the inhabitants of Tokyo wanting, and hunt them through frozen, grimy, neon-bleached alleyways. (Created by Dr D King, as part of a Twitter contest)\nANYWAY.\nPOP QUIZ, HOTSHOT. What\u2019s the average intended length of a roleplaying game campaign? Yes, you at the back - that\u2019s right, FOREVER. You get a bunch of people together and you pretend to be elves once a week until a) level 20 or b) you get bored, and AIN\u2019T NO-ONE GOT TIME FOR THAT. Unbound works in LUMPS OF STORY called ADVENTURES which are FOUR TO SIX GAMES LONG. Loads of ADVENTURES make a SAGA.\nThe Captain trait helps characters lead others and control the battlefield\nBut here\u2019s the deal; you change characters when you change adventures. You find some interesting part of the world and explore it through play like a GENIUS. You play the BAD GUYS. You play the KIDS of the previous characters. You play ALIENS landing six thousand years in the future, skimming through the wreckage. You play the CHUMPS left behind to defend the city while the HEROES went off on an adventure. You keep playing, you keep changing focus, until you want to make a new world. And that\u2019s UNBOUND.\nIn NEW CAMELOT, arcology agents (\"Knights\") strap on semimagical powered exo-skeletons (\"armour\") and carve themselves a niche in a broken world. (Created by Anthony Stiller and his playtest group)\nWhat else? The battle system is CRACKING and we\u2019ve got an INNOVATIVE STAMINA SYSTEM that means, every round, you\u2019re judging whether or not to press on or fall back. We use cards, rather than dice. OH YEAH, NEARLY FORGOT, you and all your players will be SCRAWLING THEIR PERMANENT WOUNDS and MAGNIFICENT GLORIES on a deck of playing cards that BEARS THEIR HISTORY and is also ALL OF THEIR HITPOINTS. It\u2019s CINEMATIC and TACTICAL at the same time and we\u2019re so BLOODY HAPPY WITH IT.\nWe've got our GAMES DESIGN FRIENDS and HEROES to write TOUCHSTONES in the book to help YOU generate WORLDS and PLOTS. Who do we have? How about GAV \"Inquistor\" THORPE? ROB \"13th Age\" HEINSOO? JASON \"Fiasco\" MORNINGSTAR? MERRITT \"Lim\" KOPAS? MEG \"80 Days\" JAYANTH? FROG \"Happy Birthday Daniel Barker\" CROAKLEY? CARA \"Dishonored 2\" ELLISON? SEAN \"Cons Prial\" SMITH? They're all on board, and we have more besides. Merritt's touchstones are all based on Morrissey lyrics so GOOD FOR HER.\nIn 1920's Chicago, you gotta make a deal with the devil to survive. And if you want to do more than survive, you gotta make a deal with something even worse, too. (Adventure by Jorund Kambestad Lie and his playtest group)\nWe\u2019ve got FIFTY ADVERSARIES in the book and drop-dead GORGEOUS art from Adrian Stone. We\u2019ve made the WHOLE DAMN THING with an eye to GENDER EQUALITY and BODY EQUALITY and we\u2019ve point-blank refused to have any SEXY ELVES or CHAINMAIL BIKINIS or ANY OF THAT TOSH IN IT. \nThe Unnatural trait lets you walk through hell, unleash tentacles, or take something called The Parasitic into your body which point-blank refuses to let you die\nWe\u2019re tall, debonair, devilishly handsome and can hold our drink. We are going to KNOCK THE GAMES INDUSTRY OFF ITS AXIS with our BEAUTIFUL IDEAS and you will have to attach yourselves to us with SKYHOOKS to KEEP UP WITH US.\nSOMEBODY BRING ME A MIC SO I CAN DROP IT\nWE OUT\nNICE THINGS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID ABOUT UNBOUND \n\"Mate. Unbound. Bloody excellent. [...] We've never had so much fun building and playing in a campaign world together.\" - Anthony Stiller, games designer and artist \n\"Unbound has a great combination of action and drama - it's tactical enough to get your teeth into, but cinematic enough that you don't get bogged down in the mechanics and always have a chance to do something cool.\" - Joanna Piancastelli, winner of the 2015 Golden Cobra live games award\n\"I think UNBOUND might be my favorite RPG, for serious. I had fun with it before, but we played again tonight with the newest rules, much changed, and it's badass. One guy had never played an RPG before, asked if his character could be \"basically Swamp Thing\" and it was great to be able to say yes. And have it be true! I've been playing and GMing a lot of new RPGs lately and this one was by far the most fun, right out the gate.\" - Andy North, livegames designer and improv genius \n\"Unbound is so awesome. Building a world out of stories is super satisfying - it's like creating a mythology. A whole damn mythology!\" - Ed Croft, comedy musical pirate and games designer\n\"The hierarchy of adventure-building tools is very very elegantly put together.\" - Laura \"Smith\" Loolaid, writer and playtester\nTHE TEAM\nWe\u2019ve assembled a FANTASTIC-LOOKING and HIGHLY-SKILLED TEAM of EXPERTS to make this happen. WE ARE: \nGRANT HOWITT, maverick indie writer and games designer, author of all those games he mentioned above and also One Last Job, Warrior Poet and several others. He ran the Kickstarter for GOBLIN QUEST last year and it went PRETTY WELL, and he's part of the team that won Threeforged in 2015 with FIELD WORK. \nCHRIS TAYLOR, writer and maverick indie games designer, creator of Zombie LARP and this NEW HOTNESS you might have heard of called UNBOUND; Chris has been playing and breaking roleplaying systems since the AGE OF NINE and was GRANT\u2019S FIRST GM. \nADRIAN STONE, heroic glistening art god, and GOD DAMN have you SEEN HIS DRAWINGS give us MONEY so we can get him to DRAW MORE OF THEM. \nALINA SANDU, crackerjack layout and design professional, who made GOBLIN QUEST look good and who once let us CAPTAIN a PRETEND SPACESHIP in her LIVING ROOM and we ALL DIED. \nHARRY GOLDSTONE, straight-shootin\u2019 freelance copywriter and proofreader and noted pedant, who\u2019s been CORRECTING GRANT\u2019S BLOG POSTS for YEARS for FREE and so now we decided to PAY HIM to do it because we\u2019re SPLENDID. \nMARY HAMILTON, producer; certified goddamn genius, executive editor for audience at the Guardian, Grant\u2019s wife, and possessor of many other fine achievements - has done BRILLIANT STUFF with her BRAIN and SPREADSHEETS which means that this project will WORK. \nSTRETCH GOALS\n\u00a322,000 - FUNDED. You are the ACTUAL BEST PEOPLE and things are only going to get BETTER from HERE ON IN.\n\u00a324,000 - MORE ART. Look at that GORGEOUS ART. You want more of it? OF COURSE YOU DO. We\u2019ll commission more art from Adrian Stone and WHACK IT IN the book for everyone to see. \n\u00a328,000 - GENRE PACK COMMUNITY VOTE: TWO-FISTED ROAD WARRIOR VAMPIRES. We want to write more rules for Unbound, so this is basically a reward for EVERYONE, including us. We\u2019ll commission a piece of art and write a new core, 52 touchstones, a new trait and a hierarchy of adversaries for one of the following background genres, as voted on by YOU, the backers: URBAN HORROR, POST-APOCALYPSE, or PULP ADVENTURE. We\u2019ll release the rules as a PDF.\n\u00a333,000 - NICEST BOOKS. We\u2019ll upgrade the paper and binding quality of the physical book, making it as nice as we possibly can. \n\u00a336,000 - GENRE PACK COMMUNITY VOTE: CYBERTHULHU AND DRAGONS. Time to have your say on what we write rules for: LOVECRAFTIAN HORROR, CYBERPUNK, or CLASSIC FANTASY. \n \u00a339,000 - GENRE PACK COMMUNITY VOTE: MAGICAL GOBLIN TEA PARTY. Time to have your say on what we write rules for, again. THIS ROUND: JUNK MAGIC, REGENCY LADIES, or GOBLINS! \n \u00a342,000 - GENRE PACK COMMUNITY VOTE: SILVER REMATCH. Get back in there, SLUGGER, it\u2019s time for the SILVER REMATCH. We\u2019ll round up the three genres that came second in the three previous votes and give them a FIGHTING CHANCE to make it into RULES-HOOD.\n\u00a345,000 - LET\u2019S GET PHYSICAL. Every stretch goal will be printed in the ACTUAL BOOK, both SOFTCOVER and HARDCOVER, which is EXPENSIVE but also PRETTY EXCITING.  \n\u00a346,000+ - STAY TUNED.

The tribal leader is dead, the community in tatters, and the future a mystery. What will become of you in this barren wasteland? Who will emerge as both savior and tyrant?\nThis is not a safe game. Characters will die.\nLet's be honest. No one is going anywhere. The world is a shitty place. The sunset over the horizon doesn't make it any less shitty. We can't just pick up and leave here and hope the world is better on the other side.\nIt's still the world.\nIn other words, \"How could Hell get any worse?\"\nThe 'Exodus' is everywhere. Every tribe is on the verge of collapse. Every part of the world is about to fall. But why?\nHow did the worst conditions of human existence get worse?\nAnd what is next?\nThis version of The Carcass cleans up the previous edition. All of the expansion notes and classes are in one place. While the core principles are there, the rules, advice, and structure are stronger. In addition, the rules are being updated to the 5-10-20 in-house game system of Post World Games, including rules for play with and without a game master.\nIn the first edition of The Carcass, the game used a 2d6 system, with charts that reflected the powerlessness of people at the end of the world.\nThe powerlessness remains, but the system is adapting to the 5-10-20 game system, because I personally like it better. It's vastly more dangerous for everyone involved. The Carcass: Exodus takes a second look at the ways we prop up this dying world through powerful effects (and side-effects) of the things we do when we defy the odds. This is best highlighted by the powers in the 5-10-20 system, first designed here for Exodus.\nDisfigurements, mutations, and experience are also more concrete in this edition. You can play with or without them, but the rules for each can have a bigger impact on play. The character questions are better organized and I've added relationship mapping that will look familiar to Protocol players.\nThis edition deals more closely with the Exodus, the Fall of humanity in what might be the final age of mankind. In the previous edition, the Fall is hinted at. No longer. The Fall plays a major role in this edition. Do we try to rebuild? Or do we cut and run?\nThe Fall is not coming\u2026 its here!\nSample Page Spread from The Carcass: Exodus\nSample Page Spreads from The Carcass: Exodus\nThis game is 75% finished. It needs art, editing, and time to put some finishing touches on the writing. It is around 120 pages at the moment, but that's without pagination and all that.\nThere\u2019s something wrong with the world. Not the obvious wrong. We\u2019ve all heard our grandparents talk about the \u2018before time,\u2019 when food was plentiful, people didn\u2019t fight everyday, and there were permanent structures to live under. And there was fuel, too.\nNo. It\u2019s something else.\nI\u2019ve heard rumors from the other tribes. Some suffer from a lack of reliable food and clean water. In some places of the world fewer children are born. Radiation is so thick that people get sick and die within a matter of hours once exposed. Mutations are rampant.\nHope is a distant memory.\nI\u2019ve heard of tribes rising up against their own kind and killing their leaders. And then what? Without a plan, the tribe is cast into chaos almost immediately. Power vacuums create wars. And wars lead to more chaos and death. Some are calling it \u2018the Fall,\u2019 that definable moment in a tribe when everything turns sideways and upside down.\nEveryone is suffering from some kind of Fall. Every tribe, in every corner of the world. At least, as far as anyone can tell. Not that we were ever peaceful beings, but the fall has brought out the worst in us. And it\u2019s growing.\nSome blame the mutants, psychics, and witches. Others speak of outsiders who bring curses with them. Some think there are haunts living among them that brought the fall. None can say for sure what the real cause is, only that nothing is the same.\nIt's only a matter of time before we pack up and leave. Who knows what the exodus holds?\n$10. Scavenger.

Plus, you create a character class for the game. Plus, jim pinto comes and visits you and plays a full day of games at your house/game store/basement. 100 miles radius limit. See the sidebar for details.\nInformation about all the character classes (called roles) stretch goals will be revealed in the upcoming project updates. At the moment, there are over 20 classes designed. But the roles that make the final cut are contingent upon how well the kickstarter does.\nThe Carcass: Exodus uses a simplified version of the 5-10-20 system that is coming later this year. In this system, players roll between 1 and 5 dice (depending on proficiency and drama points expended) and tabulate the results. Each chart has a value listed for rolling a 0 (below 5), 5, 10, or 20. For each value, an effect is listed. That effect has a result on another chart, explaining how the foil (or GM) will interpret the result. Like so:\nSome results are concrete, and others are grey. The more common the result, the less swing-y the result. Rolling low can result in some really bad stuff with lasting impact for the tribe. In this instance, the Hatchet who rolls less than a 5 is in some deep shit.\nObviously you can't roll a '20' on 3d6, so there must be rules in the game for rolling more dice.\nAnd there are.\nIn addition to their own problems, players need to keep track of their fatigue, wounds, trepidation \u2014 which is a measure of how the community feels about the characters \u2014 and even the community's fear level. Some characters even start with trepidation.\nAdd $25 to your order. This includes shipping. Only available in the US.\nA fistful of dice. I won't count them. I'm just going to cram my hand into a bag and stuff the dice in the mail. Dice come in five colors, with a stylized X for the '6.'\nI can't guarantee you'll get all five colors, but I can fit about 15-20 dice in my hand. So your odds are good.\nIf you want me to take a hammer and spray paint to them to make them ever more \"post-apoc\" looking, I will. But you'll get fewer dice out of it. Just because.\nAs stretch goals, I would like to do the following four decks for the Carcass. These would not be free, but would be available as print-on-demand.\nWorld Building Deck\nA quick-start deck of 30 cards, with random world setup information, including community names, character names, NPCs, conflicts, and even some starting projects. This deck would cut setup time by about 30 minutes. Art forthcoming.\nToolcards: The Carcass\nToolcards are a powerful tool for gamemasters to generate quick encounters and scenarios, in addition to making fast NPCs and effects (like sights and sounds). The deck comes with 30 double-sided cards for nearly endless game options.\nFor more information on Toolcards, see this page.\nCondition/Result Cards\nPerhaps the most important deck of the three, this deck includes all the game effects and conditions for ease of play. The back of the cards will have the game result term in BIG BOLD LETTERS, so it's easy to find. And the other side will have the condition and description for that effect, so players can hold onto it.\nThe deck isn't designed yet, but this is an example of how easy the cards will be to read. This is NOT a final design of the card.\nCarcass Poker Deck\nUsing the art from the game, I will make a poker deck with the carcass logo on the back. Very post-apocalyptic. This will be a print on demand deck of cards, so the material won't be the waxy bicycle plastic cards people are used to.\nAnyone who knows my work, knows that I make games because I love making games. I do not make a living doing this. I do this out of love. Even when those games are about hate.\nThis project is a lite version of the 5-10-20 rules and the beginning of an era of new roleplaying games from Post World Games. This rule system has been brewing in my mind for years. No counting modifiers and arguing about whether or not traits apply to your bonuses. No memorizing \"forward-moving threads\" or working from a spreadsheet to know everything your character can do.\nRoll dice. Look at chart. Play.\nIt's that f***ing simple.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI wrote the first edition of this game in two weeks.

Howard\u2019s legendary adventurer king. Check in with their Facebook page for ongoing updates.\nIn 1932 Robert E. Howard created CONAN, the greatest character in pulp adventure, changing fantasy fiction forever. The first Conan story was \u201cThe Phoenix on the Sword\u201d, and in it he leapt to savage life. Many stories followed quickly after, mere glimpses into a saga like no other hero had lived. Barbarian and thief, pirate and brigand, mercenary and scout... Conan was all of these things.

Writers, artists, editors, rules designers, layout artists, proof readers, logistics, finance, warehouses, and more. People often have problems - it's just part of life and this can cause delays. When this happens we do the best we can to help - moving workload to someone else, finding a replacement, getting more people involved, or moving things around in the schedule to allow them more time. Modiphius is a family owned company (Chris & Rita) and we know that most people working on games like this do it for the love, not the salaries so we work hard to make it as supportive an environment as possible. \n\nThere are always issues to deal with no matter how well you prepare - perhaps a supplier's moulds break and need several weeks to replace, perhaps a printer gets flooded destroying some stock they just spent a month printing, deliveries can go missing, data can be collected in such a way that it causes problems with fulfilment, and so on. \n\nWe have run 4 major Kickstarter's now so are familiar with a lot of the possible problems and do our best to prepare. Modiphius has expanded adding two people who help analyse data and plan logistics with the various companies we use to ship out our rewards across the world. We've learnt from our mistakes and taken steps to simplify how we run Kickstarters at every step possible. \n\nEven so we allow more time 'just in case' and we work hard to ensure everyone queries are answered in a timely manner. Modiphius has one of the best reputations for customer service. When things do go wrong we are open and transparent. We try to find a fair solution for everyone. \n\nYou can check out out previous Kickstarters for Achtung! Cthulhu, Mutant Chronicles 3rd Edition Roleplaying Game and Thunderbirds Co-Operative Boardgame to see how happy people are with their rewards. We have completed shipping 12 books and lots of merchandising for Achtung! Cthulhu. Mutant Chronicles has had over 70% of shipments across 7 books with lots of accessories and a further 20% of pledges with 7 books have started shipping this month. The first shipment of Thunderbirds pledges shipped only 2 weeks late and the final shipment will be despatched the middle of next month. \n\nWith each of these projects we have a different team of writers, artists, editors and layout designers so one project's schedules (or delays) doesn't affect another. We also have many other games we have published (or co-published) including the award winning Mutant: Year Zero, Dust Adventures, Mindjammer, Fragged Empire and Symbaroum. \n\nConan has some particular issues we are bearing in mind: \n\n- All products will need to be approved by Conan Properties LLC. We have a great relationship with them though, and they have loved everything we have done so far so I don't foresee any problems here. With Jeff Shanks involvement we are effectively ensuring everything we produce for Conan is about as true to the spirit of Robert E. Howard as possible. \n\n- We're using major name artists for each of the main books in the line. They can have demanding schedules and if they are delayed delivering a book cover to us by a previous project over-running then that could affect the timetable. We do have a number of covers we're commissioning that could work for several different books, so in the event one cover is delayed we can likely substitute another cover in it's place by an equally amazing artist.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #151", "update_userinfo": "More Previews, and Age of Conan Dev Starts!", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nWe\u2019re back with some more previews, as well as some exciting news about upcoming developments!\nPreview: Shining Kingdoms"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #150", "update_userinfo": "PREVIEWS: The Isle of the Eons and Waves Stained Crimson", "update_content": "Brave wanderers,\nAs you continue your quest through the strange and distant lands beyond the Hyborian kingdoms, your party finds itself faced with a coastline which gives way to violent raging seas.

It's a sexy, cinematic post-apocalypse, full of action, danger, mystery, romance, and horror. We first published it in 2010, and after five years of intensive play we've decided it's time for a second edition.\nYou can read a lot more about Apocalypse World at apocalypse-world.com. But before you do, download the new character playbooks and take a look. They'll give you a good idea how the game works and what it's all about.\nSomething's wrong with the world and I don't know what it is.\nIt used to be better, of course it did. In the golden age of legend, when there was enough to eat and enough hope, when there was one nation under god and people could lift their eyes and see beyond the horizon, beyond the day. Children were born happy and grew up rich.\nNow that's not what we've got. Now we've got this. Hardholders stand against the screaming elements and all comers, keeping safe as many as they can. Angels and savvyheads run constant battle against there's not enough and bullets fly and everything breaks. Hocuses and the Maestro D' gather people around them, and are they protectors, saviors, visionaries, or just wishful thinkers? Choppers, gunluggers and battlebabes carve out what they can and defend it with blood and bullets. Drivers search and scavenge, looking for that opportunity, that one perfect chance. The quarantine thinks that the past can save the future, and doesn't see that the past made us. Skinners remember beauty, or invent beauty anew, cup it in their hands and whisper come and see, and don't worry now about what it will cost you. And brainers, oh, brainers see what none of the rest of us will: the world's psychic maelstrom, the terrible desperation and hate pressing in at the edge of all perception, it is the world now.\nAnd you, who are you? This is what we've got, yes. What are you going to make of it?\nApocalypse World kicked off a small revolution in tabletop RPGs. There are now dozens of games in print that have built on Apocalypse World's approach to design. You can read a more-or-less current list here.\nWe're running a stripped-down and straightforward campaign just to get the second edition book out. The game design is done, the writing is  done; we're down to rewrites, editing, and book design. We want to finish the book, print it, and get it into your hands, no delays, no distractions.\nThe book is A5 (approximately digest-size), paperback, and about 300 pages long.\nIf you're already familiar with Apocalypse World and you're interested in the changes we're making, stay tuned for our updates. You'll see a couple of obvious, big changes\u2014streamlined Hx, a whole new set of battle moves, a threat map instead of fronts\u2014and if you know your stuff, you'll be able to spot a bunch of smaller changes too.\nThanks!

Over 3500 people attended what was the largest gaming convention in the US at that time. In the main hall gamers could pick up the latest games from all the major publishers: Cross of Iron by Avalon Hill, Atlantic Wall by SPI, and The Hall of the Fire Giant King module by TSR. In one small booth near a corner you could also purchase RuneQuest, the first Roleplaying game published by The Chaosium, a quirky 3 person company from the Bay Area. It sold out over the weekend, and every print run continued to do so for the next several years. \nRuneQuest took the young world of roleplaying games by storm; it cast aside many of the approaches most other games took. It had no character classes, no experience points, no levels, and far fewer restrictions on how weapons, armor, and spells could be used. Instead of a D20 it uses a percentile 01-100 system. It also has the built-in fantasy world of Glorantha. \nDuring what many consider to be the golden age of roleplaying, the second edition of RuneQuest enjoyed its greatest popularity, second only to AD&D in sales. It won numerous awards, starting in 1978 with the Strategist\u2019s Club Award for \u201cOutstanding Miniatures Rules\u201d, which may sound quirky, but that was because the industry had yet to create award categories specifically for roleplaying games. \nThe second edition went out of print in 1983, and the rules went on to be licensed to a series of other companies that published several more editions, but sometimes fate has a funny way of having things come full circle... \nHere we are in 2015, the 40th Anniversary of Chaosium as a game company. In a few months Glorantha, Greg Stafford's fantasy game world, celebrates its Golden 50th anniversary. We feel the time is right to bring the celebrated classic second edition of RuneQuest back into print. Gaming is going through a bit of an Old School renaissance as of late, and we want RuneQuest to be a part of it. We hope you\u2019ll join in on the fun!\nREWARDS:\nThe RuneQuest Hardcover Book - is 144 pages. It will have sewn binding. It contains all the 2nd edition text, but with all the errata incorporated where it belongs. Additional material has been added to the appendices at the end. If you want more than one copy of the book, add another $30 for each additional book (with PDFs too) to the level you are backing.\nThe RuneQuest Leatherette Hardcover Book - is 144 pages. It is in red leatherette with gold foil stamps on the front and spine. It has a color dust jacket. If you want more than one copy of the book, add another $50 for each additional book (with PDFs too) to the level you are backing.\nThe Player Handouts - are 20 pages of reference material for the players to use during character creation and ongoing play. \nThe GM Screen - is two 11 inch x 17 inch (very close to A3 paper size) color cardstock panels with handy charts and tables from the Rulebook on the GM side, and classic Luise Perrene art on the Player Side.\nThe Old School RQ Source Pack - consists of four of the earliest RQ1/RQ2 supplements published: Militia & Mercenaries, Scorpionmen & Broos, Trolls & Trollkin and the Balastor's Barracks scenario. It also includes The Sea Cave, an unpublished Gloranthan scenario written by Greg Stafford back in the same era. Each is about 16-20 pages in length with a color cardstock cover. This OSR Source Pack can be purchased as an add-on for $50 (print and PDF). Just the PDFs of this OSR Source Pack can be purchased as a $25 add-on.\nThe Runequest Playtest Manuscript book - is a 250+ page hardcover book created from high resolution scans of the original playtest manuscript. This manuscript is the only known set of playtest notes in existence which were lovingly kept in a binder for the last 40 years. This playtest material was used to create the first edition of RuneQuest. It includes newly written introductory essays by Steve Perrin and Greg Stafford. Here's a few pictures of the original:\nThe 3 volume \"Unpublished Scenarios and Source Material\" set - is three hardcover books with hundreds of pages of unpublished RuneQuest material by Greg Stafford and other early authors. It includes a fair bit of Sorcery rules for the West, the Howling Tower scenario set in the Upland Marsh, as well as a wide range of other material, esoteric and otherwise. We will describe it in more detail in the comments section and the FAQ. This reward is only available as part of this Kickstarter.\nSPECIAL ADD-ONS:\n+$50 USD - The Guide to Glorantha PDF Bundle. This $50 add-on gets you the 800 page PDF of the Guide to Glorantha and a PDF of the Argan Argar Atlas as a bundled set. Click here if you want to know more about these products. That's a discounted price offered just for this Kickstarter. We are reprinting the Guide to Glorantha as well, and if you buy this PDF bundle you get a $25 credit towards purchasing the Guide and Atlas bundle of books.\n+$10 USD - RuneQuest 1 Rulebook PDF. This $10 add-on gets you the 120 page PDF of the first edition Rulebook as released in 1978. We have not redone the layout. The $250 backer levels and higher have this included for free as one of their rewards. \nSHIPPING SECTION:\nWe hate the high cost of shipping, and have worked hard to set up the fulfillment of the rewards so they get shipped as quickly and inexpensively as possible. We do not expect to make any money from our shipping charges. However, we also cannot afford to lose money on shipping. The way it will work is after the campaign we will send out a survey to gather your addresses. We will use this data to get the most detailed shipping pricing we can based on our actual cost to ship your reward level to your home and then charge you that amount. We will ship from fulfillment centers in the US, Canada, the EU, and Australia. More locations may be added based on where backers are located. \nThe Hardcover book, a GM screen, and the 20 pages of player handouts as a bundle weigh in at 1 kilogram. For example, the shipping estimates for that bundle (with tracking) work out to:\nAustralia: $13\nBrazil: $30\nCanada: $13\nFrance: $13\nGermany: $13\nJapan: $25\nNew Zealand: $16\nNorway: $24\nRest of Europe: $13\nSwitzerland: $24\nUK: $11\nUSA: $11\nSTRETCH GOALS:\nTo simplify the Kickstarter and ensure a fast delivery, our stretch goals will unlock PDFs of the other books that can be purchased as add-ons. If there is enough interest we may print physical versions of the books, but we don't want to hold up the RuneQuest Classic Edition shipment. All of these publications will be in the same layout style as the RuneQuest Classic Edition.\nACHIEVED: $30,000 - FANGS FOR FUNDING US!\nA softcover booklet of pre-rolled RuneQuest characters.

The remnants of these civilizations shaped the Ninth World into a place of incredible beauty, wonder, and danger. And weirdness. Oh, so much weirdness. Explorers who undertake the challenges presented by the Ninth World look not only to the wilderness, but also to the night sky, the ocean depths, and even into the worlds beyond that they cannot easily perceive.\nThis Kickstarter campaign takes us into these realms through several new titles that expand the Ninth World beyond Earth's shores. We're launching this campaign to fund Into the Night, Into the Deep, and Into the Outside, each an all-new 160-page hardcover supplement, along with the 100-card Numenera Artifact Deck. But with your help, we'll take these books even further, and maybe add some new titles as well!\nEarly this year we started an in-depth exploration of the Ninth World, the setting of the Numenera roleplaying game, with the Ninth World Guidebook. Numenera fans were excited to see the world expanded, as that in turn expanded the options for their own campaigns. We knew we wanted to keep going, and that the Ninth World had many more fascinating lands and cultures to explore. But those conventional (sort of) lands are just one aspect of the Ninth World. There were other sorts of realms, inspiring and unique, many of which had been introduced in our previous products but never really explored in depth.\nThe obvious first direction was up! The eight previous worlds had all, to one extent or another, reached beyond the embrace of Earth\u2019s gravity. Remnants of those civilizations linger in the Ninth World\u2019s datasphere, and were touched on in adventures such as Vortex and discussion of the moon in the Ninth World Guidebook. This is an aspect of the Ninth World we\u2019ve wanted to develop since\u2014well, since Numenera came into being!\nSo we started work on Into the Night, a sourcebook that allows characters to explore the moon, Mars, and much, much farther beyond that. Here and there over the past year, we've let slip hints that this was the next big book for Numenera.\nBut then we got thinking\u2014what if we kept going? After all, the sea\u2014particularly under the sea\u2014is as uncharted, as exciting, and as alien a place as another planet. We began talking about multiple \"Into the Ninth World\" themed books, with the next one being called Into the Deep. And beyond that, an exploration of the other dimensions unlocked by the previous worlds: Into the Outside.\nAfter that... well, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We decided the smart thing to do would be to see if these topics interest you as much as they interest us. In this campaign, you can get any of these books\u2014or all of them. And if things go well, we have lots of other ideas in mind for exploring the Ninth World. Furthermore, hitting stretch goals can allow us to make these books something really fantastic, as well as possibly add more to the Numenera story. New corners of the Ninth World to explore? New character options unlocked by these exciting environments? New creatures encountered there? New stories? It all depends on you!\nInto the Night is already written. It\u2019s in editing, and will go to press before this campaign ends. That said, there\u2019s still time to make it even better\u2014to add elements we wouldn\u2019t normally be able to risk through the normal publication process. In fact, our first stretch goal will add a Kickstarter-exclusive poster map to that book. We have some great ideas for that and for what follows, and we\u2019d like you to be a part of it. So here\u2019s what this Kickstarter is all about:\nWe\u2019re going to further broaden the horizons of the Ninth World, first with Into the Deep and Into the Outside and then with\u2014well, some other pretty cool titles that we\u2019ll unveil as this campaign progresses.\nWe\u2019re going to make Into the Night, Into the Deep, and other titles funded by this campaign as cool as we can, offering elements we normally wouldn\u2019t be able to put into a book developed in the conventional manner.\nWe\u2019re going to give you a voice and a chance to interact with the content of these books. To have a hands-on role in shaping them.\nInto the Night: This 160-page hardcover takes Numenera players and GMs beyond the grip of Earth's gravity, to locations pioneered by the previous worlds on the moon, elsewhere in the solar system, and in remote reaches of the galaxy. Into the Night releases in late September. It's already written and in editing, and it does not rely on the success of this Kickstarter to be released\u2014although we do hope this campaign will allow some cool upgrades to the book through stretch goals.\nInto the Deep: Delve into the depths of the Ninth World's oceans in this 160-page hardcover book. The prior worlds extended their empires into the seas\u2014as previously touched on in the Numenera corebook and The Devil's Spine\u2014and the wonders to be found there are every bit as glorious, mysterious, exciting, and just plain weird as the landbound realms of the Ninth World. Into the Deep will release in the spring of 2016.\nInto the Outside: It's well known that the denizens of the prior worlds bent time and space to their liking, creating links to realms outside the normal world. This 160-page hardcover book takes us into these other worlds, exploring pocket dimensions, the realms of ultraterrestrials, and parallel universes. Into the Outside will ship in the autumn of 2016.\nNumenera Artifact Deck: Experienced Numenera GMs agree that our decks (such as the Creature Deck and Cypher Deck) are great for inspiration, and huge time-savers in game prep and during play. We're going to add an Artifact Deck full of all-new content to help you generate artifacts quickly and easily while getting ready for your game, or when you need one at the gaming table.\nAll the Ebooks: You receive all the books funded by this campaign in PDF format, along with a PDF version of the Artifact Deck. If we unlock new books as stretch goals, those are added to your rewards automagically!\nAll the Print Books: You receive all the print books funded by this campaign, as well as the Artifact Deck in print. If we unlock new print books as stretch goals, you get them as part of your reward. Please see the shipping information, below.\n                Add-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator; it\u2019ll help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire. Find more details on these add-ons at our pledge calculator. \nAfter the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-ons items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nWe offer a variety of backer levels with some great rewards.

(Select items may also appear in one of the books, but there's no guarantee that'll be the case.) Your idea does not have to be themed to the Into the Ninth World books\u2014in fact, we want the Artifact Deck to be useful to GMs running Numenera campaigns set anywhere in the Ninth World.\nBest of all: You will be credited for the idea on the card, and you will receive a print copy of the card autographed by Monte! That's in addition to the card included in your copy of the Artifact Deck\u2014so you'll have one to use in play, and another that's suitable for framing!\nPlease note that we'll adapt your idea as we see fit to best serve the game and setting (or to ask you for an alternate if your idea can't be made to fit). Your credit will be subject to a reasonable character limit, and we require all pseudonyms to be tasteful.\nYou also get the benefits of the lower levels, including the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, a custom autographed bookplate for each book, playtest access, and an invitation to the Ninth World party.

A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale.\nThe lure of a quick payday draws you from Seattle into the neon glow of Victoria Harbor\u2026 and into a corporate conspiracy nearly thirty years in the making. A terrifying threat looms on the horizon - a supernatural force that corrupts and consumes everything it touches. Dragged into the shadows of Kowloon City, you will need to forge new connections and gain \"face\" to survive.\nHong Kong contains fantastic elements for a new Shadowrun setting: an underworld of triads, tongs, and gangs to navigate, wild magic to harness, and bleeding edge cybertech to equip. Plus, Hong Kong\u2019s culture is steeped in \"guanxi\" - a network of influence and relationships based upon a combination of social status, and prestige. All of these elements add up to a great new setting for running the shadows.\nShadowrun: Hong Kong has everything you expect from a Harebrained Schemes Shadowrun game: strong storytelling and sharp writing, lots of morally gray choices, a crew of memorable characters with distinct personalities, challenging tactical turn-based combat, a robust character creation system, and a one of a kind cyberpunk-meets-magic game setting that\u2019s endured for over 25 years. \nOur Backers voted for Hong Kong as the next city for us to bring to life and we\u2019re excited to be working on it! \nYour New Crew\nJust as in Dragonfall, our Hong Kong story will feature a crew of flawed, dangerous runners with backstories that can only happen in the tech-meets-magic Shadowrun setting. \nAnd, as introduced in Dragonfall, you'll be able to guide your crew's advancement by choosing special abilities on their Growth Tracks to complement the choices you make for your own character. \nGobbet is an ork street shaman and a follower of Rat. Her devotion to her totem has granted her unique abilities to control the battlefield, trapping her enemies behind barriers of coruscating magic and herding them with clouds of blistering poison.\nTerritoriality Track: Focuses on battlefield control by buffing Gobbet\u2019s barrier spells (increasing damage, increasing the number of tiles affected) and planting AOE damage spells, such as Toxic Fog. She also gains the ability to destroy or consume summoned spirits, eliminating threats from enemy shamans.\nSpiritualist Track: This track focuses on improving Gobbet\u2019s control over summoned spirits. She can reduce the chance that they slip out of her control, and even seize control of hostile spirits summoned by her enemies. Progressing down this track turns Gobbet into a versatile and powerful summoner.\nWu is a veteran security expert with years of sprawl-site combat experience. He has the muscle and the weaponry to either beat his targets into submission or to break them outright, depending on the demands of the situation.\n\nCrowd Control Track: Focuses on a variety of non-lethal attacks that inflict stun (-AP) effects. Progressing down this track unlocks a shock baton, tear gas grenades, and zip ties to subdue stunned enemies.\n  Lethal Force Track: Focuses on inflicting lethal ranged damage. Progressing down this track gives Wu attack abilities such as Mercy Kill, which does additional damage and has a higher to-hit percentage on targets who are close to death.\n\nIs0bel is a dwarf decker with the tools and the expertise to clear her own way to a target mainframe. Trained for combat by a cabal of hacktivists, she\u2019s as deadly in meat-space as she is in the Matrix.\n\nEspionage Track: Increases Is0bel\u2019s decking skills and her Mark Target ability. Progressing down this tree unlocks new custom programs/abilities for use in the Matrix, as well as custom Expert System Programs (ESPs).\n\nSabotage Track: Is0bel carries a sniper rifle for meat-space skirmishes. Her arsenal also includes proximity mines that she can use to create traps for her enemies. This track increases and adds to the effects caused by these weapons, unlocking higher-yield explosives and Flechettes that strip armor from enemies.\n\nWith your generous support, we're adding Racter to your crew!\nRacter is a highly specialized roboticist-turned-rigger who fights with the aid of \u201cKoschei,\u201d his custom walker-form drone. He also carries an engineering toolkit that he can use to repair Koschei and enhance its abilities during combat.\nMangler Track: Makes Koschei into a melee-ranged wrecking machine. Progressing down this track unlocks movement boosts for the drone and bolts close combat weapons onto its chassis, such as rotary saws and clawed feet. These attachments unlock new close combat attacks for the drone.\nPredator Track: Turns Koschei into a walking artillery piece. Progressing down this track bolts new ranged weapons to the drone, such as an auto-shotgun or a grenade launcher.\n\nWith your generous support, we were able to add Gaichu to your crew! And don't forget, now that Racter and Gaichu are unlocked, their COLLECTIBLE FIGURES have been added to THE TALISMONGER Reward Level!\nThanks to his elite Red Samurai training, Gaich\u00fb has access to close combat abilities that are inaccessible to other characters. These take the form of stance-based katana attacks that flow together in sequence, each of which has its own unique animation.\n\nRed Samurai Track: A mixture of offense and defense. Includes additional sword attacks, such as a coup de grace that can be used to dispatch stunned targets. Gaich\u00fb also gains self-buffs that can temporarily boost his armor, or give him the effects of cover when standing in the open.  \n\nGhoul Track: HMHVV infection has its advantages. This track includes a bite attack that inflicts damage and heals Gaich\u00fb, and claw and spit attacks that inflict damage and cause debuffs on enemies.\n\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong contains all the features of Shadowrun Returns and builds upon the engine and gameplay upgrades we added to Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut (including the ability to save your game anywhere). \nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: The Shadowrun series hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG\u2019s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart 12+ hour non-linear story with a diverse cast of all-too-(meta)human characters. (Some funding goals will add more hours of gameplay.)\nA One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique \u201cTech meets Magic\u201d dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting that recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. \nCommand Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions. Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities.\nGripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you\u2019re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. \nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun\u2019s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.\nPowerful Game Editor: Create Your Own Stories! With the Shadowrun Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns. No advanced coding or art skills are required to create content using the SRR Editor. Our new Hong Kong setting will add tons of new weapons, spells, characters along with oodles of new tiles to the long list of editor assets from Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut!\nSoundtrack\nThe music for Shadowrun: Hong Kong will be composed by fan-favorite Jon Everist, composer of the award-winning Shadowrun: Dragonfall -Director's Cut. Here's an example of Jon's work:\nPC Only Release\nShadowrun: Hong Kong is being developed for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems only. We have elected to focus all our efforts on PC in order to deliver the best game we can without the current processing and memory limitations of tablets. This focus allows us to have higher-fidelity visuals, larger map sizes, and more stuff on screen.\nBecause we want to do more.\nWe're totally committed to making Shadowrun: Hong Kong and we're already several months into development. The project is budgeted, fully staffed, and on-schedule for a mid-2015 release. We also have a story we're really excited about. At our current budget, it's going to be 12+ hours long and at the quality level of Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut.\nBut this is Harebrained Schemes and, as always, we have more ideas than we have budget. \nThat's where you come in.\nBy backing the project, you'll increase our production budget and get more features, more improvements, and more game. Take a look at the funding goals below to see all the stuff we want to add.\nNow, we could always talk to traditional publishing partners, but we\u2019re pretty independent-minded around here and we only want to serve one master - our audience. \nWe're gonna ship a great game and it can be even greater with your help. Our last adventure together was a blast and we think the results speak for themselves. So help co-fund our third Shadowrun game, Shadowrun: Hong Kong, and let's make the best Shadowrun game yet!\n$100,000 - Enhanced Player Controls! In addition to all the new Tech, Magic, Weapons, Consumables, Creatures, and Enemies we're already planning, if we reach our initial funding goal, we\u2019ll add a bunch of interface upgrades. These include the ability to decide which team member picks up an item in free-move mode, item swapping between party members, a player-initiated turn-mode toggle so you can position your team before you enter combat, and a spread-range indicator for shotguns and sweeping melee attacks.\n$150,000 - Animatic Scene Transitions! These are short animated slide shows with voice narration that play at key points in the story - the opening, end of Act 1, end of Act 2, and at the end. \n$200,000 - Racter joins your team of runners! Racter is a Russian rigger with a wry smile who relates better to his custom drone than he does to people. We'll tell you about Racter's unique gameplay abilities and player-influenced upgrade paths when we get closer to unlocking him.\n$250,000 - More Animatic endings! If we hit this goal, we'll be able to create multiple animatic endings for the story to reflect the choices you make in the game.\n$300,000 - Gobbet's personal side mission! Dive deep into the backstory of your team's resident Rat shaman. Gobbet's absurdist philosophy and impulsive nature have led her on a twisting path through life. In her personal mission, you'll get the chance to walk that path with her and see for yourself where Rat takes you.\n$350,000 - More better sound! We can only describe smells (for now) but we can definitely improve on our audio. Dynamic combat music will ebb and flow as a battle progresses, providing more atmosphere and tension. Enhanced Ambient Sound is a catch-phrase for lots of technical babble about making your play environment sound more real and less repetitive.  \n$400,000 - Gaichu joins your team of runners! Gaichu was a member of the Renraku Corporation's elite Red Samurai security force. Infected with the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV) on a mission gone wrong, he was forced to abandon his pure-human unit as the virus slowly twisted him into a ghoul. Now a shadowrunner, Gaichu could prove a valuable ally, but his loyalty comes at a price\u2026\n$450,000 - Enhanced Cyber! If this goal is reached, we'll add a new skill to our character creation system that enhances a character's cyberware and unlocks the ability to install powerful new cybernetic enhancements. This system will further differentiate characters with 'ware from their flesh and blood counterparts. We'll also add cyberweapons that you can install into your characters' arm slots, complete with new animations and visual effects.\n$500,000 - Is0bel's personal side mission! Born to immigrant parents of Somali descent, Is0bel has experienced life in the slums of Kowloon first-hand. Escaping at a young age, she retreated into the cold perfection of the Matrix, but her family still languishes in the depths of the sprawl. Her personal mission will take her back to a place that she barely escaped from - and you'll come along for the ride.\n$550,000 - Expanded magic! If we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll add new gameplay options and equipment for magic-using characters. Shamans will gain the ability to summon Shrine Spirits at specific locations in the Hong Kong environment. These great-form spirits are far more powerful than their mundane counterparts, can\u2019t break away from your control, but are limited in duration. Hermetic mages and physical adepts will gain access to Foci - enchanted weapons and objects that can boost a spellcaster\u2019s magical power or allow an adept to deliver devastating magical attacks.\n$600,000 - Gaichu\u2019s personal side mission! When Gaichu became infected with HMHVV, the Red Samurai code that he'd sworn to demanded that he take his own life. Instead, he took to the shadows, dishonoring himself and the rest of his team in the process. In Gaichu's personal mission, you will square off against a squad of highly-trained warriors who will stop at nothing to destroy their old teammate... and you alongside him.\n$700,000 - Revamped Matrix: Art and Gameplay! If we hit this goal, we'll add more people to the team to revise the look, feel, and gameplay of the Matrix. We want the Matrix to feel more like you're traveling in the digital world. We also want to add new types of Intrusion Countermeasures and new ways of interacting with them so that decking feels more like an illegal entry into someone's system. \n$1,000,000 - Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign! We have our plans set for the story we want to tell in Shadowrun: Hong Kong, but if we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll create an ADDITIONAL 4-5 hour Hong Kong Mini-Campaign that takes place AFTER the story ends. The Mini-Campaign will allow you to IMPORT your high-karma Hong Kong character for a challenge only a prime runner could accept.  The Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign will come out sometime before the end of 2015 and will be FREE to Backers at the $15 pledge level and up. \n\nWe know from experience that fulfilling lots of physical rewards is a big, distracting, and expensive undertaking and we want your funding to go into making a quality game - not into shipping a bunch of tchotchkes. Remember, the people making your game are also the ones making and sending your stuff! So, we created a bunch of cool digital rewards and TWO sweet physical rewards. We hope you like them and we hope you support us. \nHey! Here's a special BONUS for Backers at the $35 Reward level and above!\nEveryone who backs the project at the $35 Reward Level and above will get access to an AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACK from the Shadowrun Development Team. Hear the writers, designers, artists, engineers, and composer discuss how the game was made, the challenges they faced, and the fun they had while making the game. The audio commentary will arrive in an update after the game is released.\nAND everyone who backs at the $35 Reward Level and above will also get TWO HIGH-RES DIGITAL POSTERS that, when placed together, combine into a beautiful Shadowrun Panorama. The first poster contains a Timeline of Shadowrun History. The second contains a Glossary of Shadowrun Slang. Tell your friends!\nAll rewards starting at the CHUMMER ($15) level come with at least one copy of Shadowrun: Hong Kong.\nThe actual figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted and numbered!\n Here she is along side a Golem Arcana figure.\nThe power of a Fire Ram is no match for the cunning of a Rat Shaman!\nHer final figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted, and numbered\nCreated over 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of The Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world should have ended on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic returned to end our world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them. As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to.\nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\n Thanks for reading all the way to the bottom!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere's the good news - we've done this before. More than once. \n\nWe've run successful Kickstarter projects and we've made two Shadowrun games plus a Director's Cut, so we know how to deliver. \n\nThere's always risk in game development, though. In this case, we have a few new team members who need to learn the ropes - but we've got a pretty damn good track record for hiring talented, dedicated people, who go the extra mile for their game and their Backers and they've already distinguished themselves as great additions to the team.\n\nBeyond that, the standard game development caveats apply. Some new features may take longer to make than we thought. Some piece of gameplay may not be as fun as it sounded on paper and we need to revise it several times until we're happy. A critical bug could take a whole week to fix while others take ten minutes. \n\nSo while we've done Shadowrun games before and have a solid idea of what we're doing and how our tools work, we haven't done THIS Shadowrun game before and you never know what's gonna happen.\n\nAnd that's part of the fun of making games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "The Shadows of Hong Kong Bonus Campaign Is Here!!", "update_content": "We are pleased to announce that the Shadows of Hong Kong bonus campaign is now available as part of a free update to Shadowrun: Hong Kong.This update also adds the developer audio commentary Kickstarter reward and a variety of small game improvements such as new visual effects, updated dialogue, and editor features for User Generated Content.\nSo, we\u2019ve rebranded the title asShadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition to reflect all the new content.

We'll turn it into a fully playable myth with full color art, monsters, heroquest rewards and whatever other attention it deserves. \nStretch Goals!\nWe'll add five additional full-color pieces from one of our top artists to 13th Age in Glorantha. \nThe raging hyper-violent undead-friendly troll god of war joins the Berserker class as a third option. Yes, that means we'll do Elder race Uz stats also. \nIt's the Crimson Bat, the gargantuan and oh-so-hungry Chaos demon that the Lunar Empire parks as far from its own heavily populated heartland as possible. Also evil bat priests. And since this is 13th Age, some of the bat cultists ride smaller-but-still-enormous bats. Aieee! Includes a couple different versions of the Bat, ranging from starved-and-shriveled to inhaling-regiments. \nA full chapter on using Gloranthan trolls as PCs, with playable myths and a new Uz* class that taps into many troll goddesses and gods. (*Also accessible to Darkness-rune humans!)\nDraft 1 of the map by Darya Makarava\nWe\u2019ll use the detailed maps from the Guide to Glorantha as the basis of a new color map of Dragon Pass, executed in a side-view landscape style to support the gazetteer chapter\u2019s location-based adventures and location-relevant myths. The map will appear as at least a two-page spread in the 13th Age in Glorantha book. In addition, all backers at the $35 pledge level and above will receive the map as a PDF. [[For a good look at this draft, visit http://www.13thAgeInGlorantha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Draft-Map1.jpg]]\nThanatar is a Chaos god whose severed head and undead-ish body survived independently for so many ages that the pieces cannot rejoin even now that they have been reunited. Thanatar\u2019s worshippers are still rebuilding the Severed God\u2019s knowledge-base one severed head at a time, so we\u2019ll have stats for headhunter cultists, severed head ghosts, Doom Seeker initiates, Doom Master priests, and the Voice of Atyar, as well as notes on the cult\u2019s underground complexes, and a heroquest that might just cost someone their noggin.\nWe heard the pleas. We changed course. Glorantha\u2019s adventurous feathered curiosities enter 13th Age as a playable race! We\u2019re not doing any duck-myths as playable myths, not in this book at least. Instead, we\u2019ll present a mini-adventure set in the zombie-haunted waters of the Upland Marsh. One version of the duck legend is that their hunters keep zombies from overrunning the center of Dragon Pass. Your campaigns will determine their own truths. \nWe\u2019ll create distinctive silhouettes to show the shape and relative size of the monsters in the book. Each monster entry will have at least one such silhouette in addition to any other illustrations, appearing next to a human silhouette for scale. As a bonus, anyone who pledges $35 or more will receive a digital file containing the monster silhouettes.\nThey talk well, but they\u2019re still monsters! The Comet Seers, Blue Moon School, and Spell Archers should complicate the PC\u2019s deaths. And the Crater Makers might just drop a chunk of the Moon on everyone the PCs ever loved. (FYI, Lunar warriors like the Granite Phalanx soldier and Antelope Lancer are in the monster chapter already, no stretch goal necessary.)\n We welcome the Chaos goddess Krarsht to the banquet! We\u2019ll stat up cult assassins, devouring maws known as krarshtkids that dig out weird dungeon complexes, the Tongues of Krarsht, and Krasht myths that are eating the Godtime one myth per mouthful.\n13th Age in Glorantha already includes a short sample adventure set in Snakepipe Hollow, as well as a duck-backers\u2019 mini-adventure in the Upland Marsh. This stretch goal adds a higher-level adventure for perspective. The Lunars and the Scorpionmen have clasped hand to pincer in an unholy alliance to overturn a myth in which a great Orlanthi hero defeated the Chaos goddess Bagog and cut off her stinger. Raid your enemies directly or cut them off in a heroquest into suddenly hostile myths.\nIt\u2019s time to unleash the 40-year storm that Greg Stafford started brewing in White Bear & Red Moon! We\u2019re unleashing powerful pieces of Glorantha\u2019s Hero Wars board games, setting them loose in 13th Age in Glorantha: the magicians of the Sartar Magical Union! It\u2019s the Orlanthi answer to the Lunar College of Magic - a dizzying array of bush priests, earth priestesses, twisted warlocks, wandering devotees, crazed holy men, a mystic or two, and various wielders of magic weapons melded together into magical secret societies. Each secret society within the Sartar Magical Union offers cunning new talents, powers, or spells to characters initiated into their mysteries. We\u2019ll cover at least three of the nascent secret societies in detail; likely candidates include the Eaglebrown Warlocks, Free Philosophers, Night Jumpers, Snakepipe Dancers, and the Warm Sisters.\nClaw and stinger, horror and spike. The champion-tier adventure in the Moonstinger stretch goal touches on the terrors of the Scorpion men, and now we\u2019ll detail Queen Gagix Twobarb herself, the epic-tier demigoddess responsible for adding subtlety and intelligence to Bagog\u2019s brutish agenda of devouring everyone and rebirthing them as Chaotic scorpion people. We\u2019ll also stat up a range of Gagix\u2019s nasty lieutenants and a couple freelancers trying to evade becoming a meal for the Queen. We\u2019ll have a couple different versions of Gagix\u2019s stats to make sure she can fit into different campaigns. When you\u2019re writing up Heroes and near-Heroes, you want to make sure the players are surprised, even if they\u2019ve read the book.\nWiP by Jan Pospisil; Gagix Twobarb receives Lunar ambassadors\nPeople wanted the Trickster in this book, we\u2019re listening! Eurmal is a splendid Trickster god and 13th Age offers a couple ways of modeling trickster characters. Rob has worked through how he\u2019d create a new set of Gloranthan powers using the structure of the 13th Age chaos mage class to portray a powerful Eurmali hero. In the spirit of tricksterdom, there\u2019ll be non-chaos mage options as well.\nEurmali trickster R&R (by Jan Pospisil)\nWe\u2019ll add between three and five new illustrations of magical places to the geography chapter. We\u2019ll choose locations that deserve illustrations to convey their weird power.\nSir Ethilrist went to Hell. Unlike other mortals, he didn\u2019t stay there. Ethilrist returned with bizarre martial powers, a Doom Hound companion, and some weird enemies. He commands the Black Horse Troop, the world\u2019s most dangerous mercenary troop. Hint: Those aren\u2019t actually horses they\u2019re riding. We\u2019ll stat up the mercenaries, their demonic steeds, and Sir Ethilrist himself. As with Gagix Twobarb, we\u2019ll present a couple different versions to support varying interpretations of the Hero.\nBlack Horse Riders (by Per Sjogren from The Guide to Glorantha)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe 13th Age designers tend to push for ambitious design rather than cookie-cutter design.

Author Shannon Appelcline guides you company by company through the history of tabletop starting in the 1970s all the way up to present day. This series is chock full of fascinating insider tidbits, company profiles, and yes\u2014enough drama to fuel a hundred campaigns.\nEvil Hat Productions is incredibly proud to produce this updated edition of Designers & Dragons. You may remember the first edition that came out from the lovely people at Mongoose Publishing\u2014we'd wanted to publish it then, but missed the chance! So we leapt at the opportunity to take it on once their one-volume version went out of print. \nEven if you own the big black book (aka, the first edition), there\u2019s still plenty of new material in this second edition\u2014over 50,000 new words in the first volume alone. Our edition is fully expanded and extensively updated, a multi-volume set that won\u2019t break your back, illustrated with pretty pictures of the games you remember fondly. RPG WIN! Bathroom reading victory! \nWhy a History of Roleplaying Games?\nThis sort of thing is important! But don't take our word for it \u2014 here are some thoughts from folks throughout the industry:\n\nJason Morningstar:\nEmily Care Boss: \nChris Pramas:\nQuinn Murphy:\nLilian Cohen Moore:\nPeter Adkison:\nAdam Koebel:\n Miranda Horner: \nThor Olavsrud:\nMark Diaz Truman:\nJenn Brozek:\nRyan Macklin:\nMarissa Kelly: \nKenneth Hite:\nAnd we've just been reviewed by GeekDad! Check out the GeekDad review here.\n\nWhy Are We Kickstarting Designers & Dragons?\nPre-press production on Designers & Dragons: The \u201970s is already complete, and it\u2019s so gorgeous that it got us all riled up. We\u2019re really excited about this project, and we want this first volume to have company. In short, we want to be able to print and release all four volumes at the same time. But...\n... production and printing on each volume costs $10k or more, and the idea of producing all four volumes at once gives our financial people a case of nervous twitches. We want to make this happen responsibly so we can continue to produce the high quality products you\u2019ve come to expect from Evil Hat Productions. \nThis Kickstarter will enable our goal of printing more than just the 1970s volume at the same time. It will help cover the print runs and some of the costs for Volumes 2-4 so that we can do this right\u2014and with full knowledge of how many of you out there are interested! Plus, if we hit our initial funding goal and our first two stretches, we'll be able to release the full set all at once. \nThis Kickstarter gives us an opportunity to spread our excitement in more productive ways than running through the neighborhood whilst festooned with streamers and blaring horns. (And with less of a chance of getting arrested, which is a double win.) If you\u2019re as thrilled as we are about the chance to dig into the history of our hobby, we hope you\u2019ll help spread the word to people who feel the same. Seriously, these books are addictively awesome. They nearly drove us to festooning and horn-tootery, which we think says a lot.\nProject Rewards & Goals\nEach volume in the Designers & Dragons series will be a 6\"x9\" softcover, several hundred pages long, with black and white interior. Each decade's volume of Designers & Dragons covers dozens of companies founded in that decade and follows them through to their end, or the present day for those still with us.\n\nPlease note: Companies are generally listed by their best-known, or at least most-recent, name. So you might see something like Margaret Weis Productions listed above where it was originally known as Sovereign Press, and so on.\n\nDesigners & Dragons: The \u201970s: Immediately available in multiple digital formats to our backers.

Bonus!\nWhat Are My International Options?\nShipping kills, friends. Shipping kills.

Please make sure to read the relevant section in Update #3 so you can understand exactly how this will work and how high that later shipping charge will be!\nThe books will be made available for sale to the international market once they're in print, so if you'd rather wait, that's totally fine. There are also some other options to consider besides the BILL MY SHIPPING LATER reward tiers.\nIf you want to stay apprised of developments on this project, consider backing us at one of the digital levels\u2014even for $1, a low-cost way to \"subscribe\" to this project's updates. \nAnother good option is to contact a retailer closer to you and arrange for them to order the books you want! Evil Hat's books are distributed and sold to and by game retailers in multiple international markets, including Canada (served by Lion Rampant distribution), Australia (dependent on individual retailers placing orders with us), the United Kingdom (distributed by Esdevium to many stores in the UK and Europe, including Leisure Games), and Germany (often carried by Sph\u00e4renmeisters Spiele), for starters. \nOr you can find a way to effectively \"pretend\" to be a domestic backer by finding a person or organization in the US that can receive a package for you, then get it to you in a way you're willing to afford. (We've heard mention of Ship It To as one option, tho we have no experience with them ourselves.)\nInternational retailers without a reliable distribution source for our books may pledge for the MASTER OF RETAIL reward tier\u2014so long as you have a US-based address for us to ship to.

We've produced multiple printed role-playing games in a variety of physical formats over the past six-plus years. This is a non-fiction book series, which is markedly *less* challenging to produce than a RPG book.\n\nEvil Hat's experience puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that arise\u2014as with any project, experience tells us a few problems and bugaboos *will* arise.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nTHE TEXT: While the editing and layout of several volumes is largely done, it's possible that we will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we've got an editor, a proofreader, and a historian going over every sentence in close detail, so we feel we have this under control. \n\nPRINTING: Our company has grown up alongside the big boom in digital short-run printing technology. Thanks to the advances made there, we'll be able to print the book in any quantity we need. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, or simply goofing up the manufacture or shipping of the books in some way. With a number of potential domestic printers to use, we'll always have a back-up we can go to in the event that our first choice printer has to be set aside. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nSHIPPING: Packages get lost. We'll work with you to send replacements. Our shipper may take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFINANCES: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and Fate Core, Evil Hat is\u2014for the game industry\u2014a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already spent thousands on getting Designers & Dragons to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

It's not too late to support us and try our Beta test! Please visit us at storium.com for more information.\n4/8/14: WE DID IT! With the help of our incredible backers, we have unlocked every stretch goal, funded a staggering 60 worlds, and reached 1000% of our original funding target. This has been an incredible campaign and we are deeply grateful for the support we've received.\n(Are you a backer looking for your Beta invite? Please see the first FAQ at the bottom of this page \u2014 the info you need is there!)\n\u201cStorium is everything I never knew I always wanted in a game.\u201d \u2014 Eve Jacob, playtester\nStories are part of what makes us human. They\u2019re all around us, from books and movies to TV and video games. Experiencing a good story can be one of life\u2019s great pleasures. But telling your own can be even more fun!\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve devoted the last year of our lives to creating Storium, the online storytelling game. We\u2019ve been playtesting an early version for months with hundreds of people. The feedback has been amazing, and we\u2019re ready to bring Storium to the public. We need your help to make it happen.\nStorium is a web-based online game that you play with friends. It works by turning writing into a multiplayer game. With just your computer, tablet, or smartphone, you can choose from a library of imaginary worlds to play in, or build your own. You create your story\u2019s characters and decide what happens to them. You can tell any kind of story with Storium. The only limit is your imagination.\nStorium uses familiar game concepts inspired by card games, role-playing games, video games, and more. In each Storium game, one player is the narrator, and everyone else takes on the role of a character in the story. The narrator creates dramatic challenges for the other players to overcome. In doing so, they move the story forward in a new direction. Everyone gets their turn at telling the story.\n\u201cStory and Game had a baby, and it\u2019s Storium. This is vital stuff, equal parts revolutionary and fundamental \u2014 giving the old ways of storytelling a major digital upgrade.\u201d\u2014 Chuck Wendig, novelist and screenwriter\nThe following three-minute video gives you a glimpse of our current beta playtest:\nWhat makes Storium special?\nTotal freedom: You decide what happens in your story.\nMultiplayer: Write and play with your friends, online.\nAsynchronous: Play at your own pace.\nWorlds: Pre-made playsets that help you tell stories in different settings and styles.\nSomething for everyone: You can tell any kind of story you want!\n\u201cStorium is one of the most fascinating systems I\u2019ve ever used to facilitate games, and it\u2019s helped me fall in love with storytelling all over again.\u201d\u2013 Lillian Cohen-Moore, playtester\nThis campaign funds the work that\u2019s needed to launch Storium to the general public. That means:\n1. Worlds for you to play in\nStorium needs a wider library of what we call worlds. Each world is a complete playset that gives you all the tools you need to play a game in a certain style or fictional setting. This includes virtual playing cards that drive gameplay, ideas for stories, pre-made characters, and backstory. We\u2019ve assembled an award-winning group of novelists, game designers, storytellers, and artists to create these worlds. Some worlds are wholly new, while others are adaptations of worlds you\u2019ll recognize.\n2. Important features\nThere are key features that Storium still needs. Your support will help us build them. This list is subject to change based on prioritization and technical feasibility, but here are a few of the examples we are considering:\nReal-time play: Chat and play live with your friends when they\u2019re online.\nShared narration: Give everyone in your game a chance to be the narrator.\nParallel storytelling: Play out two scenes at the same time with different characters.\nImproved support for tablets and smartphones: Play using interfaces created specifically for your mobile device.\n3. Technology and team\nOperating an online service like Storium can be a labor-intensive and expensive task. While it's easy to use and play, behind the scenes Storium is a complex piece of engineering. It requires dedicated, ongoing developer attention. We also have to pay for servers, storage, and a number of underlying services upon which the system relies. As Storium grows, these costs increase. \n\nWe\u2019ve been working full-time on Storium without pay for over a year now. That\u2019s how much this project means to us. We've set our target goal as low as possible, but anything we raise beyond that helps ensure that as Storium grows and evolves, we\u2019ll be able to keep up by investing in the technology and people we need.\n\n\u201cStorium revolutionizes storytelling not by new bells and whistles but by returning it to its most pure form in this most complex of ages \u2014 dynamic characters and people telling evocative and passionate stories.\u201d \u2014 John Adamus, playtester\n\n\n\nHere's a visual overview of the rewards we're offering!\nAnd here are more details about a few of the more popular rewards:\nBeta player\nEvery backer at the BETA PLAYER ($10) level gets instant access to our current beta test of Storium. You\u2019ll find an invitation URL in campaign update #1 (backers only). This URL enables you to immediately sign-up, start a game, and invite your friends to play with you.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this is an early test version of Storium. We expect it to change and grow quite a bit before the public launch. As a beta player, we welcome your feedback. There\u2019s a \u201cGive feedback\u201d button at the top of every page that goes to a built-in playtesters-only feedback system.\n\nMember\nWhen it launches to the public, Storium will have a modest annual membership fee of $25 per year \u2014 the equivalent of just $2 per month. Becoming a backer at the MEMBER ($20) level gets you your first year of Storium membership (starting on the date we launch publicly) for just $20.\n\nMembers will also be granted a special ability when Storium launches publicly: the use of our forthcoming World Creator tools to build their own Storium worlds and share them with the Storium community.\n\n(By the way, there will always be a free version of Storium \u2014 and it will be the full game, not a demo version. You\u2019ll be able to play up to three games, with full functionality, before you have to pay any membership fee!)\n\nWe want to grow Storium into a sustainable business, and we want to do it without plastering the game with advertisements. Our membership fee will help make that possible.\n\nThe Deal\nOur campaign starts by funding ten worlds, but we have dozens more in the works from a wide array of award-winning creators. Every backer at THE DEAL ($40) level will get a year of Storium membership, plus early and ongoing access to every world that we fund through this Kickstarter. This means you'll always be able to play games in these worlds, regardless of whatever they end up costing in the future.\n\n(When Storium launches publicly, many of our Kickstarter worlds will have a small fee for usage. Much like how Apple's App Store works, Storium world creators will have the option of charging app-like prices for their worlds. We will then pass on the majority of the proceeds to the world's creator! We hope this will become great new way for players and fans alike to support the authors and designers whose work they love.)\n\n\"I work nights and weekends and haven\u2019t been able to game with my friends in years.

With these cards, great stories and exciting quests begin with a simple flip of a card.  From medieval castles and bustling towns to dark forests and even darker dungeons, Storyteller Cards will bring your fantasy stories to life.\nEach card contains so many narrative elements and gaming mechanisms that you can't help but start imagining games and stories that you would create.  These elements act as a kind of toolkit that allows people of any age to tell stories, to modify their gaming experiences, or even to write and design completely new games.\nARE YOU A WRITER who needs a location for a scene or a character to spark a new adventure? Flip a card and you've got one! \nARE YOU A DUNGEON MASTER running a role playing game and you need a special item for your party? Flip a card and you've got one! \nARE YOU A TEACHER trying to encourage your students' writing skills? Pass out a card to each student and let their imagination finish the story. \nARE YOU JUST LOOKING FOR SOME CREATIVE FUN? Flip 5 cards and craft a scenario using an element from each card. Pass the cards to the next player to continue the story. Keep passing, it's a blast!\nStoryteller Cards: Fantasy feature the following unique RPG-inspired elements on every card: a CHARACTER made up of a RACE and CLASS, interacting with an ITEM and a WEAPON, completing an ACTION, in one of four LOCATIONS. Each of these elements can be individually used to help create something new, get you out of a mid-project slump, or just to have some creative fun with family and friends.\nThe cards also feature additional icons in the corners to help you dig a little deeper into storytelling, creating, and gaming. The icons represent a RANK, SUIT, COIN, 20-SIDED DIE and a COMBAT RESOLUTION icon. There are a few more surprises within those icons, but we'll get into all of that later.\nWhile we encourage you to make your own games, stories, and adventures with the Storyteller Fantasy deck, we've also enlisted some of today's best designers to make awesome games that you can play with the deck. Everyone will receive the PDF rules to all of these at no additional cost as part of the Storyteller Fantasy Manual. We also have a physical version of the manual available as an add-on.

It may be used for storytelling games at parties, serve as random elements for creative writing programs, or deal out parameters for an improv scene. Game-masters in role-playing games might want to keep a deck handy to quickly conjure background characters to fill that shadowy tavern. Of course, the deck could always be used for a quick game of poker, because everyone needs a break sometime, even witches carrying pirate treasure.\"\n\"My daughter found my Storyteller Cards where I had left them on the counter, and she asked what they were. I told her to look through them and tell me what she saw on each card, and then I told her to deal both of us some cards. Five minutes later, we were playing a game that we had created on the spot, and we were laughing and joking about the quirky and fun story that we were telling to gather points using the elements on the cards. I love playing games with my kids, but these cards allow us to collaborate on game and story creation even while we are playing competitively. I love these cards, and I recommend them to anyone who likes games, stories, and the fantasy genre.\"\n-Ilan Mitchell-Smith, former actor (Weird Science), professor of Medieval Literature, and Nerdy Dad.\nMore press coverage and reviews:\nhttp://entropymag.org/storyteller-cards-by-jason-tagmire-and-campbell-whyte/\nhttp://www.geeknative.com/45158/storyteller-cards-fantasy-inspiration-takes-kickstarter/\nhttp://www.nerdspan.com/preview-jason-tagmires-storyteller-cards-and-sc-fantasy/\nhttp://www.geekadelphia.com/2014/04/14/storyteller-cards-a-playing-card-deck-to-inspire-creativity/\nTHE DESIGNER:\nJason Tagmire is a game designer from South Jersey.

Generations lived\u2014and died\u2014locked away from the stars and sky behind their wards.\nThe Scourge ended a hundred years ago. The survivors, blinking in the light of the sun, opened their kaers and began to rebuild. Much has been lost and forgotten, and dangers await the unwary. There are those that conspire to seize power and dominate their fellows, and some Horrors still lurk in the darker corners of the land.\nHeroes have emerged in this new world. Some fight to protect those rebuilding their lives. Others uncover mysteries and treasures lost to the past. And some bring the light of hope to those still hiding from the darkness of the Scourge.\nIn Earthdawn, you take on the role of these heroes. Play a Swordmaster, whose tongue cuts as deep as his blade. Master the powers of earth, water, and fire as an Elementalist. Use the magic of story and song as a Troubadour, entertaining and inspiring.\nBeastmaster. Nethermancer. Weaponsmith.

Nomadic bands of orks ride with their herds and field fierce cavalry.\nSome might go into how the open-ended dice system allows a chance at heroic results, or how the numbers on your character sheet are more than an abstraction, but also something concrete in the game world.\nStill others might explain the importance of legend\u2014not only in how it plays into the past, but how it affects the future. Your character is inspired by the heroes and legends of the past, and is creating their own legacy and legend for those heroes yet to come.\nPerhaps they would mention the rich magic system; how patterns and threads bind everything together. That magic sword you found can only have its true potential unlocked by learning its history\u2014who wielded it, and what deeds did they perform? Once you know these answers, you bind yourself to the item, adding another chapter to its tale.\nThey might talk about the lands and peoples of the world. The Lost City of Parlainth, whose magicians sealed themselves away\u2014with the very monsters they were trying to hide from. Garlthink One-Eye, the legendary Thief who some say sneaks into Death\u2019s domain every night and steals another day of life. The Wastes, once a rich and fertile land; now the source of a continuous rain of ash. The Great Dragon Icewing, who will allow visitors to ask him questions\u2014provided they bring a sufficiently valuable gift.\nAll of these things\u2014and more\u2014make Earthdawn a game that has been earning fans for over twenty years.\nCrystal raiders drop on an unsuspecting caravan\nA New Edition?\nThe original edition of the Earthdawn game stopped being produced in 1999. In the following years fan-founded efforts licensed the property and released their own material for the line: Living Room Games released Second Edition, and RedBrick Limited released the Classic and Third Edition of the game.\nNow, twenty years after its initial release, a new edition is in development under the FASA Games banner. In addition to revising and polishing the game rules, this new edition of Earthdawn will update the setting, putting in place a new status quo for players to explore. The goal is to make the game more accessible and friendly to players unfamiliar with Earthdawn and its history.\nWe're revising the game mechanics, keeping the Step System but streamlining how successes work, among other changes. We're opening up the Disciplines a little more, but keeping some constraints a to how they advance, which ties in with how legend and belief power the Disciplines in the game world. We're going through the spell lists and bringing them up to date with the revised mechanics, and adding new spells. There's a lot of changes - too many to present here without flooding the Kickstarter page.\nFollow these links to the Line Developer's blog posts about the new edition.\nPreview #1: Basic changes to Talents and Success Levels\nPreview #2: Discipline redesign, using the Beastmaster as an example\nPreview #3: Discipline redesign theory, Karma Ritual, and Durability changes\nPreview #4: Metaplot Advancement\nPreview #5: Spells changes, with an example new spell\nPreview #6: Design Goals\nPreview #7: Revised Talents list and descriptions\nThe Gates of Throal, seen from Bartertown\nWhat am I funding?\nThe Player\u2019s Guide and the Gamemaster\u2019s Guide include all the rules needed to explore the Age of Legend. Thanks to a stretch goal being achieved, these volumes will include color plates, like the First Edition rulebook back in the day. This campaign is intended to fund production and print costs for those two books, which includes new artwork, substantial revisions, and new material for the game world.\nIn addition, we have unlocked the following through our stretch goals:\nGM Screen - Free to everyone who orders a physical book (softcover or hardcover), this is a standard trifold cardstock screen, with tables on one side for the GM and artwork on the other for the players.\nTravar: City of Merchants - sourcebook covering a location previously only briefly mentioned, now a fully developed setting\nED 4E Companion - a third core rulebook containing all the higher Circle information: Discipline structures, Talents, creatures, and challenges appropriate to higher Circle characters\nElven Nations - sourcebook covering the Blood Wood, Shosara, Sereatha, and the former Western Kingdoms, now known as the Wastes\nQuestors - sourcebook detailing those who dedicate their lives to one of the Passions, the divine archetypes of basic drives who form the pantheon of Barsaive. Includes substantial new material about the Passions and their Questors, their path, their powers, and their impact on society.\nPledge Levels\nHere's a summary of the Pledge Levels and what you get at each.\n$1 - Our most heartfelt thanks!\n$10 - PDF Copy of Travar: City of Merchants, Questors, or Elven Nations\n$15 - PDF copy of the Earthdawn 4th Edition Player's Guide, Gamemaster's Guide, or Companion\n$20 - Softcover of Travar: City of Merchants, Questors, or Elven Nations, plus PDF copy.

There may be additional goodies.\nPlease look to www.fasagames.com for more details on the print products. Once again, thank you for your support.\nAlternative Payment Options\nIf you can't or don't want to use a credit card, you can pledge through our online shop. The products listed in the linked shop section mirror the rewards currently available with this Kickstarter campaign. They are provided for people who do not have credit cards and/or wish to participate via Paypal. A few things to remember: Your account will be charged as soon as you place your order. Shipping costs will likely be higher than for Kickstarter pledges because of the way our on-line shop works. All pledges made via our online shop will count towards meeting stretch goals.\nAdd-Ons\nLooking to customize your pledge rewards a little bit more? Want extra copies of some of the rewards? Here is a list of add-ons currently available. To add these on, adjust your pledge amount to include the price listed below, and add in your note what add-ons you are including. This will be confirmed in the survey at the end of the campaign. You don't have to add shipping unless you're outside the USA, and then only if the add-on puts you over the item count. See below for the international shipping charges.\nTravar: City of Merchants, Questors, or Elven Nations PDF -- $10\nPlayer's Guide, GM's Guide, ED4E Companion PDF -- $15\nSoftcover and PDF copy of Travar: City of Merchants, Questors, or Elven Nations -- $20\nCover art poster -- $25\nAdditional copy of softcover Player's or GM's Guide or ED4 Companion -- $30\nPolo shirt -- $30\nAdditional copy of hardcover Player's or GM's Guide or ED4 Companion -- $50\nPrices include domestic U.S. shipping. For international shipping, add:\nOne item -- $20\nTwo to Four items -- $30\nFive or more items -- $60\nOur apologies if this shifts during the KS. We're at the mercy of the international shipping industry. Prices fluctuate whenever a postal service somewhere in the world raises their rates. If the price of international shipping rises after you make your pledge, we'll eat the difference. This shipping cost covers all items shipped as part of your pledge reward. For example, if your normal pledge reward included two books, and you add-on two more items, you would not need to increase your shipping cost, as you only have four total items.\nWe will hold your order until all the items are available, and only ship one package, unless you tell us otherwise. If you want to split the shipping, and receive your items as they become available, please contact us at contact@fasagames.com so that we can work out the necessary additional shipping based on where you live. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll projects carry risk, whether building a tall building, making a movie, or any other complicated endeavor. Projects can run out of time and/or money, people may leave, assumptions made at the beginning may turn out to be incorrect or the results may simply not be as good as expected. Game development is no different in this regard.\n\nWhile much has already been done to validate our assumptions wherever possible, there is always the possibility of something unexpected cropping up. Games take time to create and we don't always know which challenges are going to the most time consuming. Our project managers have taken this into consideration, but there is always the risk it may not be enough.\n\nEarthdawn is a richly developed gaming world. We are only enhancing what already exists. The changes to the core rules are complete at this time. Barring the unexpected we feel confident we can deliver the Player's Guide and Gamemaster's Guide as scheduled.\n\nWe believe our target funding goal is sufficient to complete our vision for the products. If you're as excited about this game as we are and help us exceed that goal, we have much more we wish to do for Earthdawn. This is just the first step in an exciting journey!

Discovery of an ancient Martian radio signal known as the Aeon Wave leads to the development of advanced technology known as Aeontech. The shift of technological power topples governments and gives rise to the megacorps that wage a silent war over the remaining priceless secrets held within the Aeon Wave. Fueled by the greed of the megacorps, humanity finds itself on a path of ecological and economic destruction that points to extinction in 200 years. In the city of New Tianjin, freelancers ride the razor\u2019s edge between the megacorps as they fight for power, wealth, anarchy, or to save humanity from the fate portended by the Aeon Wave.\nAeon Wave Color Cover Draft by Kurt Komoda\nWhat Is Aeon Wave?\nAeon Wave is a cyberpunk themed scenario for Fate Core. It will be released as a PDF (currently estimated at 50 pages) with a full-color cover by Kurt Komoda, editing by Amanda Valentine, and graphic design by Erik Nowak.\nAeon Wave's unique story is based on the themes of great cyberpunk and science fiction stories such as Blade Runner, Neuromancer, Snow Crash, AI, and Altered Carbon. Aeon Wave is designed to be run as a single session adventure or short campaign with little to no preparation ahead of time. The scenario includes all the tools the GM and players need to play the game including the scenario summary, locations, non-playing characters, a player's guide, player handouts, and pregenerated player characters. The scenario also includes enough information to develop new PCs and expand the scenario out into a short multi-session campaign.\nWhere Your Money Is Going\nAeon Wave has been already written and has gone through playtesting. The money from this Kickstarter will fund artwork, editing, and page design.\nArtwork: Kurt Komoda, the artist for Fate Core as well as numerous other RPG products, will develop a full color cover for Aeon Wave. If we meet our stretch goals, he will develop black and white internal art as well.\nEditing: Amanda Valentine, the editor of Fate Accelerated and many other Fate-based products, will edit the product and ensure it fits well in the wide range of existing Fate material.\nPage Design: Erik Nowak, the page designer behind The Lazy Dungeon Master and other RPG works, will ensure the Aeon Wave PDF looks awesome and fits well with the theme.\nReleased in the Creative Commons with an Open Gaming License.\nLike Fate Core, the text of Aeon Wave will be released under both a Creative Commons and Open Gaming License. This will let you extend and modify Aeon Wave any way you wish without having to worry about licensing agreements. Aeon Wave is intended to be a project that expands our community and gives freedom and value to game masters and Fate designers who love the cyberpunk genre.\nDownload A Sample\nYou can download a Kickstarter sample of Aeon Wave that gives you an idea of what sorts of things you'll find in the final scenario. Keep in mind this version doesn't include the page design, artwork, and editing of the final version \u2013 that's what your backing pays for!\nDiscounted Print Version\nIf you select the $12 ebook package, you will get a link to purchase the discounted print version from RPGNow. I expect the price to be no more than $5 plus shipping, a steep discount from the $10 it will go for when the Kickstarter is complete!\nStretch Goals\n$1,500 Additional Art (REACHED!): If we reach $1,500 in funding, we will commission four pieces of internal artwork by Kurt Komoda. This artwork will depict some of the characters and locations the PCs will encounter in the scenario.\n$2,000 Improved Character Sheet Design & a .mobi Ebook: If we reach $2,000, Erik Nowak will design improved versions of the character sheets to better fit the cyberpunk / science fiction theme of Aeon Wave.

It lets you browse and preview you all your stuff within a single view, just like you're already used to with your email. Save time, save energy, browse and manage your content without over-click syndrome.\nReady for Sharing and Search\nGhost comes ready to connect to your social media services right out of the box. No endless plugins required to do stuff that everyone with a blog wants to do. Connect your blog to publish to your Twitter and Facebook accounts, rank properly in search engines, and much more.\nCustomise it Completely\nGhost is Open Source, and it's all yours. You can write themes for it so your blog can have its own design. You can write plugins for it to add your own functionality. You can host it on your laptop, or you can host it on a public server. The code is open, and so is the MIT license. No restrictions.\nWe're incredibly proud to announce that WooThemes have backed us at the partner level and will be creating themes for Ghost.\n\"WooThemes wanted to support Ghost and see it become a reality, because we want our users to experience the same awesomeness. As such, we'll be working closely with the Ghost team to get some of our themes Ghost-ready\" - Adii Pienaar\nNot Just for Solo Bloggers\nThe first version of Ghost is focused on small blogs, but Ghost was born out of many frustrations. One of those was managing online newsrooms. Want to build the next Mashable? We're building Ghost to scale with features that allow news sites and magazines to manage editors and authors and content in a way that makes sense.\nMobile Friendly\nInspiration can strike anywhere, not just when you're sitting behind a computer. So, Ghost works where you work. Ghost is a fully responsive web application that works on all devices. Not just moderating comments or token functionality. The whole thing.\nMade for Love, not for Profit\nGhost is a non-profit project. If successfully funded, Ghost will be legally registered as a not-for-profit organisation. Why should you care? It means that no one owns shares of monetary value in the project. We're building Ghost because we want online publishing to be better. We want to make decisions focused on that goal, not on building a startup that we can sell to Facebook for $1billion. \nBeing a non-profit means that any money Ghost makes can only ever be used to re-invest in making Ghost better. Not making shareholders rich.\nUse Ghost in The Cloud + Help us Grow\nThis Kickstarter project is all about building Ghost v1.0 and delivering it to our backers - but we don't just want to stop there. The majority of the problems which exist with self-hosted blogs, exist due to complications with hosting. That's something we want to solve.\nWe're setting up world-class hosted platform that allows you to set up a new Ghost blog in just a couple of clicks \nYou'll need hosting for your blog no matter what, but our service will be the most powerful way of running Ghost - and the easiest to get started with. You'll have the full Ghost software with all bells, whistles, themes, plugins, and some extras that are only available with us (like automatic updates and backups).\nWhat's more by choosing to run your blog through our hosted platform, you'll be investing in the future of the software. \nEvery penny we make from our hosted customers will be re-invested to make Ghost better and grow the platform. \nThe sad thing about Open Source software projects funded on Kickstarter is that they usually have an initial flurry of activity when they launch, and then they slowly but surely die off when the money runs out because they have no business model to keep going. We want to build Ghost to be a self-sustaining open source project. \nUsers hosting with us = revenue = development = better software = more users = more revenue = more development = well... you get the idea.\nHow Does it Work?\nWe're incredibly excited about creating the first fully-featured blogging platform in the world that's built entirely with JavaScript.\nGhost is a Node.js application powered by the Express framework. Ghost ships with SQLite, which means it can run pretty much anywhere - however everything is connected through JugglingDB ORM, adding future support for many other database formats.\nGhost will be available via NPM, making it extremely simple (and fast!) to install on all major environments.\nGhost theming is done with Handlebars, which keeps our business and view logic separated. Mmmm semantic + sexy. If you know how to write WordPress themes, you'll be writing Ghost themes in under 5 minutes. Here's an example.\nOf course there's also support for customising and extending your blog with additional functionality via plugins with helpers and data filters built right into Ghost. We'll also be supporting full international translations from the word go using Node Polyglot.js.\nFinally, Ghost is being released under the MIT License. It's pretty much the most free Open Source license out there. It means you can do whatever you want with Ghost, and you can choose whatever license you want when you build something with Ghost. Want to release a GPL Ghost theme? That's fine. Want to release an MIT theme? That's fine too.\nWhere We Are Now\nWe've been slowly working on Ghost since I posted up the idea in November. As you can see from the video, we have a real working prototype - but there's still a lot to do.\nWith your support we can work hard to finish the first complete release of Ghost and get it out into the world. Your backing will help fund:\nDevelopment time. We want to work on Ghost and nothing but Ghost in 2013. We want to ship the first public version of Ghost by the end of the summer.\nLegal stuff. We need to do a couple of important things like register trademarks, and register properly as a non-profit organisation.\nInfrastructure. We've got tons of work to do to complete the Ghost community website and platform to allow us to properly support users, provide hosting, and be the home of Ghost. We want to complete this by the end of the year.\n\nThe People Behind Ghost\nMy name is John O'Nolan. I've been building websites (but mainly blogs) with WordPress since 2005, a year after it was launched. From 2009-2011 I worked as the Deputy Head of the WordPress UI Group, where I helped to design and develop the WordPress user interface - and spoke at conferences all over the world about designing WordPress. I've designed, built, and worked on blogs for companies including Microsoft, Ubisoft, Nokia, Virgin Atlantic Airways, easyJet, MTV, Travelllll.com, Tourism Australia, Tourism Spain, WooThemes, W3 Edge and many others.\nMy main partner in crime, Hannah Wolfe, is a Senior Developer at Moo.com where she is currently working with a small team focused on a little site called Flavors.me. Hannah has been developing WordPress sites for over 7 years and prior to MOO - worked as a developer for a web agency, building websites (and blogs) for large household names in the UK.\nEqually, this first prototype of Ghost would not have been possible without the generous contributions of many other people:\nCode - Rob Hawkes\nCode - Scott Riley\nPhotography - Rick Nunn\nWireframes/UX - Simple as Milk\nCode - Matt Hojo\nCode - Gilbert Pellegrom", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith a software development project like this, the biggest risk and challenge is inevitably shipping on time.

You\u2019re a scoundrel, a villain, a wastrel, a vagabond, a criminal, a sword-for-hire, a cutthroat. Respectable people belong to guilds, the church or are born into nobility. Or barring all that, they\u2019re salt of the earth and till the land for the rest of us. Your problem is that you\u2019re none of that. You\u2019re a third child or worse. You can\u2019t get into a guild\u2014too many apprentices already. You\u2019re sure as hell not nobility\u2014even if you were, your older brothers and sisters have soaked up the inheritance. The temples\u2014they\u2019ll take you, but they have so many acolytes, they hand you kit and a holy sign and send you right out the door again: Get out there and preach the word and find something nice for the Immortal Lords. And if you ever entertained romantic notions of farming, think again. You\u2019d end up little more than a slave to a wealthy noble. \nSo there\u2019s naught for us but to make our own way. There\u2019s a certain freedom to it, but it\u2019s a hard life. Cash flows out of our hands as easily as the blood from our wounds. But at least it\u2019s our life. And if we're lucky, smart and stubborn, we might come out on top. There\u2019s a lot of lost loot out there for the finding. And salvage law is mercifully generous. We find it, it\u2019s ours to spend, sell or keep. \nTorchbearer is a riff on the early model of fantasy roleplaying games. In it, you take on the role of an adventurer seeking his or her fortune. To earn that fortune, you must explore fornlorn ruins, brave terrible monsters and retreive forgotten treasures. However, this game is not about being a hero. It is not about fighting for what you believe. This game is about exploration and survival. You may become a hero. You might have to fight for your ideals. But to do either of those things, you must prove yourself in the wilds. Because there are no jobs, no inheritance, no other opportunities for our deadbeat adventurers. This life is their only hope to prosper in this world.\nTorchbearer is part of the brand of games Burning Wheel HQ has been producing for over ten years. So like all of our other games, this is a game about making difficult choices while exploring the world and your character through the game rules and systems. And like all of our games, the heart of the experience is about how your character changes when faced with adversity. \nThis is a hard game, not a simple one. There are many moving parts and it\u2019s not possible to experience the whole game in one or even two sessions. But if you\u2019re ready to sink your teeth into a good game that will reward you for mastering the system over 10 or 20 sessions, this is the game for you.\nThe Game\nTorchbearer was designed by Thor Olavsrud, our long-suffering editor. It's based on our 2008 game Mouse Guard. It shares the same core system and concepts, but it adds a layer of complexity in the form of resource management, turn structure and conflict.\nIn the spectrum of BWHQ games, Torchbearer is advanced Mouse Guard. It\u2019s not as complex as Burning Wheel or Burning Empires, but it\u2019s certainly more involved than Mouse Guard or even FreeMarket. From a broader perspective, it's Basic D&D on Hard mode. \nThe Book\nThe book itself is a 200-page letter-sized hard cover with a four color cover and black and white interiors. We're breaking away from our traditional digest-sized book as a bit of an experiment. We want to see what it feels like to publish a big ol' RPG book. And of course it's an homage to all those great AD&D hardcovers.\nUpdate: Since we have had such a wonderful outpouring of support for the game, we've upgraded the book for all backers! Read about it here.\nPreviews\nYou can see previews of the character creation and world-building chapters in our updates. We hope you'll be inspired to make a character and a world and post them to our forums. \nDigital Content\nAll backers who pledged to a tier will receive PDFs of the following: the rulebook, the character sheet, the player reference sheet, the GM reference sheet, the Thief bonus class, the Paladin bonus class, the Middarmark Gazeteer and the bonus scenario The Dread Crypt of Skogenby.\nKickstarter\nWe're using Kickstarter this time because we really and truly are out of money for this project. We've spent it all on art and editing. To go forward, we need you to tell us if you want to see this game in print.\nCharacter Sheet\nTorchbearer Character Sheet Front\nCustom Leather Bound Books\nOur custom-bound books will be created by friend and fan Dan \"thebookguy32\" C. He's created custom covers for our other books, as well as Dungeon World and other games. \nSamples of Dan's custom binding work\nSketches by Dro\nThis is a sample of what you can expect if you'd like a sketch in your book from Dro. Dro is not an illustrator. Yet he insists on drawing strange creatures on his character sheets.

We are \u2013 slowly \u2013 making money after setbacks and slowdowns in 2011-2012. However, some major factors pushed us towards Kickstarter for this project:\nAs we did the initial work on Transhuman, the scope kept getting bigger, and we have needed to devote extra time to it to make sure that scope is properly filled.\nWe have other games in the works, including several card games. By using Kickstarter for Transhuman, we plan on smoothing the process of funding it, to further facilitate the funding of those card games. We spend our money carefully (which has helped us avoid \u201cfeast or famine\u201d cycles) but we do not yet have the steady cash flow we would like.\nWe just reprinted another Eclipse Phase title\u2014Sunward\u2014because we believe it is important to keep major sourcebooks available. This, however, is a long-term investment in Eclipse Phase on the whole, and has tied up some money for at least a year. We may have other reprints coming up this year as well.\nEclipse Phase fans have plenty of additional ideas for the line, and this allows us the chance to achieve some of them at an accelerated pace!\nTranshuman is a player's handbook for Eclipse Phase, full of optional and additional rules and advice. Most importantly, It features two new alternative and simplified character generation systems for Eclipse Phase. One of these uses pre-created packages to build characters, and the other builds off that system but uses random elements to add twists. These systems are designed to make it quick and easy to create a new character or for gamemasters to whip up NPCs as needed.\nTranshuman covers different types of Eclipse Phase characters in detail: AGIs, asyncs, infomorphs, uplifts, infugees, and indentures. In addition to roleplaying advice and optional rules for these specific character types, other elements of the game that affect characters such as insanity, death and memory loss, psychosurgery, nanofabrication, and reputation are explored.\nThe final section goes in depth on morphs. It starts with rules for creating your own morphs and then goes on to cover some brand new morphs to Eclipse Phase. It closes with a section on exotic and specialized morphs, such as flexbots, swarmanoids, aquatic morphs, and using bots, vehicles, habitats, and other non-traditional constructs as morphs.\nTranshuman will be 176-200 pages and available as a full-color hardcover book through fine gaming stores. Like our previous Eclipse Phase titles, it will be published under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.

This Kickstarter campaign is how we're going to find that out!\nFate Dice\u2122 are a premium line of Fudge Dice. Each package contains three sets of four 16mm fudge dice each (12 dice total). We've gotten right down into the details and rethought everything about Fudge Dice. We've made the symbols larger and wider, so they're easier to read (and can accommodate some thicker and heavier ink options). We've given the symbols more personality than before, with rounded, flared ends and a gentle curve expressed throughout the stroke. We're using materials and color combinations that have never been on the market before for Fudge Dice. For sale in game stores everywhere, we've designed the packaging to stand upright on its own, lay flat, or hang from a hook for an ideal range of display options. For our customers, we've put a \"surprise\" image behind the dice to give you an extra smile and thank-you from us here at the Hat. \nWhen it comes right down to it, these are dice that you can display proudly alongside all the other fancy non-Fudge dice in your collection\u2014we know you have one\u2014giving your Fate and Fudge games an extra dose of style. Top to bottom, these are Fudge Dice reimagined\u2014Fate Dice\u2122!\nThe Fate Dice\u2122 Line For This Project\nAt present we have four sets planned. We are investing $50,000 to produce these first four sets in quantities that hit or exceed the minimums needed for the materials we want to use, creating 8,000 units of each set\u2014so this is a big investment on our part!\nFor this Kickstarter campaign, we will reveal a new set each week for the first four weeks, starting with the Centurion Dice set for our launch week. (This will let each set get its chance to shine -- and will help us gauge how exciting each one is!)\nWith that in mind, you can accelerate our timetable for revealing the three mystery sets we have planned. Hit the funding targets listed below before the planned \"reveal\" dates, and we'll reveal that set ahead of time.\nIf we hit our Early Batch stretch funding goal of $30,000, we'll work with you, the backers, to determine our next stretch goals through a blend of your ideas and ours. \nThese next stretch goals at $40,000 and beyond will be a Second Batch of one or more dice sets, shipping late this year or early next year (in the December to February range, give or take).\nPricing (and adding more dice)\nIf you just want something to do the math for you, download one of our pledge calculation spreadsheets and use it to figure out the amount you should be pledging.\nBelow is the MSRP pricing for our DICE IN A BOX reward tier.

(MSRP $15) Our launch-time set comes straight from Spirit of the Century\u201412 pearlized dice in gorgeous, high-contrast colors: burgundy with white ink; golden with black ink; black with golden ink.\nCore Dice! (MSRP $15) Our first revealed set comes straight from the colors of Fate Core\u201412 iridescent dice in lustrous, rich, jewel-like colors: blue, green, and purple, all with white inking.\nAtomic Robo Dice! (MSRP $15) Our next revealed samples its colors from the Atomic Robo comic and roleplaying game\u201412 dice in all: 4 pearlized \"robot body\" grey with \"blue eye\" markings; 4 turquoise/cyan translucent \"robot eyes\" dice with white markings; and 4 translucent \"science!\" dice which will have white markings in the final version (instead of the black shown here). See the video below for more!\nUPDATE! Here's a look at the Atomic Robo set with the new white ink on the green dice:\nDresden Files: Winter Knight Dice! (MSRP $18) Our final Early Batch set is in a bit of flux. The first round of prototypes we got had two styles we aren't as happy with, and one that we love. So we're rethinking the two other styles as described in the image and video below.\nRight now the plan for Winter Knight dice is: four dice in light blue iridescent style with white markings; four dice in pearlized fiery orange with black markings; and four dice in pearlized dark blue with silver inked markings. Once we see the physical prototypes on those several weeks from now, more changes may ensue -- can't know until they're here! We'll inform you and listen to your comments every step of the way.\nUPDATE! Here's a picture (in direct sunlight) of the set's new prototypes:\nSECOND UPDATE! We've polled folks for a final take on the \"fire\" die from the set. Learn about the results here. With those survey results in mind we're going to be changing the black ink on the orange dice (seen above) to yellow ink to complete the fiery effect. Here's a digital mock-up of what that should look like:\nSecond Batch! (Would ship in early 2014)\nAt $40,000 and beyond, we are extending the Fate Dice\u2122 line to include additional sets. The Second Batch dice will ship several months later than the Early Batch, likely in early 2014. They'll offer more variety and eye-popping color combinations. \nIf you want both Early Batch (above) and Second Batch (below) dice, you should consider a second shipment to avoid your Early Batch dice getting delayed until the Second Batch is ready. Details are found in the last paragraph of your reward tier.\nUNLOCKED: Valentine Dice ($15 MSRP) \u2014 For that special character in your life! Three lush Valentine-themed styles \u2014 translucent pink and lavender, and a pearlized white with red ink. Perfect for dreamers, lovers, and white court vampires.\nUpdate: Samples have arrived! We're likely to tweak the red ink just a little darker, but these are looking good.\nUNLOCKED: Vampire Dice ($15 MSRP) \u2014Vampire Dice will be an all-pearlized set. This set will feature bright red with black marking, royal purple with white marks, and a purple-tinted black die with white marks. Read the update for more info.\nUpdate: Samples have arrived! And they're pretty damned great.\nUNLOCKED: Eldritch Dice ($15 MSRP) \u2014 This set will feature glow in the dark ink, and a mixture of greens, greys, and purples. We're still exploring what this set might look like, and will check in with the backers to help guide our decisions on this one. Read the latest here (the reveal) and here (first batch of samples).\nUnlocking at $70,000: Leather, Ivory, and Brass! (MSRP $15) This set will mix ivory, brown, and metallic copper/brass tones to produce a set that satisfies steampunks, rough riders, and space cowboys. \nUpdate: Our first samples have arrived! There are a number of modifications we have in mind. Read more about those modifications on this recent update.\nAnd here's the packaging:\nHow We Got Here\nFudge Dice and Fate have enjoyed a whirlwind romance since the Fate system's debut in the early years of this century. The rise in popularity of the Fate system from Evil Hat has massively increased the demand for Fudge Dice around the world. Through Evil Hat's own Spirit of the Century and Dresden Files RPGs and the widespread use of the Fate system in general, we've increased the sales levels of Fudge Dice by a factor of ten over the past decade, according to Ann Dupuis of Grey Ghost Games, the original manufacturer of most of the Fudge Dice on the market. That's been absolutely great for Fudge Dice, but not so great for the worldwide Fudge Dice supply, even as other third party manufacturers make the occasional Fudge Dice of their own. \nEvil Hat is looking to change that. We started our journey into diceland at the beginning of 2012, and it's taken this long to find the right supplier, the right design, and the right timing. Now we're on the threshold of a big move into dice manufacturing, and we're excited to get it going!\nWith the Fate Dice\u2122 line, we aim to create an always-available supply of Fudge Dice in a variety of eye-catching styles, materials, and colors to meet the needs of Fate and Fudge gamers everywhere.\nWhy call them Fate Dice\u2122? It's pretty simple. Not everyone remembers to call \"those dice for Fate\" Fudge Dice, and not every retailer out there knows what kind of dice Fate uses. So in tandem with our relaunch of the Fate System (as seen in the Fate Core Kickstarter campaign), we're packaging these as Fate Dice\u2122: Dice for Your Fate and Fudge Games. Turns out that when you put both names on your packaging, you increase the chances that folks will find what they're looking for!\nFor Our International Fans\nInternational shipping costs have risen rapidly this past year, with the post office and other shippers sharply increasing already-high rates. Worse, we've seen rate increases occur in the time between when a Kickstarter funds and when manufacture and delivery are finalized for many campaigns (both for ours and those of others)\u2014this leads to a budget-busting ballooning effect in the shipping costs.\nDue to the peculiar timing of Kickstarter campaigns, where payments are decided and set in stone well in advance, we've determined that a high minimum purchase tied to a $30 shipping fee is our best (and really, only workable) method to offer an international shipping option.\nThis also supports the math that we used to build our Kickstarter goals for this project: we need shipping costs to represent no more than 25% of the contributions made to the project. The shipping dollars of each tier move us towards our goals just like any other contributed dollars do, but don't really pay for the manufacture of new sets of dice at all\u2014so we must price each tier such that the shipping dollars are only 25% of the cost, at most.  Applying our formula to a $30 international fee, we arrive at $120 total as the entry point for international pledges.\nThis was the logic going into our INTERNATIONAL POOL PARTY reward tier. We know it won't work for everyone (or even more than a few), but we felt it was better than offering no international option at all\u2014which is what we were originally compelled to do.\nBut all is not lost if that's outside of your price range. We have a strong partnership with multiple international distributors and a few retailers that we should be able to leverage in order to get our product available overseas and across national borders. When it comes down to it, distributors can order in quantities that make the shipping costs a lot more acceptable overall.\nOur primary recommendation to our international fans\u2014short of finding a USA-based backer buddy who can reship to you\u2014is to contact your local or online retailers and ask them to back this project (or at least keep an eye on Evil Hat's catalog as carried by their local distributor of choice).\nOur international distributor and retailer clients include:\nIn Australia: Good Games Canberra (Twitter, Facebook)\nIn Canada: Lion Rampant Imports\nIn France: Trollune\nIn Germany: Ulisses Spiele and Pegasus Spiele\nIn Spain: Conbarba\nIn the UK: Esdevium Games\nIf you are an international retailer or distributor backing this project or planning to order Fate Dice\u2122 once they're available, please drop us a note\u2014we are happy to publicize your interest in carrying our line.\nIf you have no international distributor-using source where you can buy the dice, and the quantities of INTERNATIONAL POOL PARTY are simply not workable for you, you can wait until we have the dice in stock later this year and buy individual sets from our online store. That said, we should warn you: the shipping price could be as high or higher than the cost of a single set of dice.\nCredits\nProduct Design: Fred Hicks\nBrand Marketing: Chris Hanrahan\nQuestions\nWe love answering questions! If you have any for us, please ask in the comments, and we'll do our best to give you an answer quickly. You can also follow us on twitter at @EvilHatOfficial and on Facebook.\nFAQ\nHow many dice per package? \n12. There are 3 sets of 4 in each package; each of the 3 sets has a particular material and inking style. We try to do some kind of thematic linking between the three sets within a package.\nHow big are the dice? \n16mm. Essentially the same size as Grey Ghost's fudge dice, with the same great heft.\nI noticed you've rearranged the order of the symbols on the faces, compared to other Fudge Dice I've seen. Why? \nIt's about axial traversal. \nOn the face layout that Grey Ghost Games uses, if you spin the dice along one axis, the four faces you encounter sum up to +2 (plus-blank-plus-blank); on another axis, they sum to -2 (minus-blank-minus-blank). On a third, they sum to +0 (minus-plus-minus-plus). \nOn ours, any axis-spin sums to the 4 times the average, +0: either a minus-minus-plus-plus sequence (1 axis) or a minus-blank-plus-blank (2 axises). \nOur design matches how dice faces are arranged on a d6: 1 (minus) is opposite 6 (plus), 2 (minus) is opposite 5 (plus), 3 (blank) is opposite 4 (blank). Thus any spin around one of the three axises of a cube gets you the same sum. \nSome of the engraving looks deep in those photos. I think that might affect the weight and the results of a roll. Do the dice roll evenly? \nWe've done a thousand-roll test of these dice and they roll pretty evenly.\nIn an eerie world where a thousand throws fell perfectly evenly, you'd end up with 333 of each result and one 'floater' as a spare (let's assume a blank); an average of 0; and a standard deviation of ~0.816.\nOur thousand-throw test gave us 339 +'s, 355 blanks, and 306 minuses; an average of 0.033; and a standard deviation of ~0.803. That's pretty damned close to the eerie-ideal-world mathematically perfect but in-practice unlikely result; the spread of 49 results between the lowest and highest number is essentially negligible, and if we'd had the stamina to go up to 10,000 rolls, might well vanish. We're satisfied that if there is a bias, it is so slight as not to make a difference worth worrying over.\nIs that seriously as low as you can make the international option?\nYep. See our explanation above, but this is the compromise we were able to find. Any lower and an international pledge would actually harm the project more than help it (sad reality of the math). \nIt's also about addressing the future cost of shipping -- we have to make a guess as to how much shipping costs will rise over the next 6-12 months, here. The past 6-12 months suggest it's going to happen. Right now a small flat rate international box from the post office runs $20, for example, not including handling charges from our shipper, and the much higher per-shipment time commitment necessary to process the customs paperwork for every non-domestic shipment.\nThis project was originally going to launch without any international shipping option at all. We're glad to have found a way to back off of that launch strategy, even if it's not going to suit everyone.\nAs noted, you can always buy a single set from our web store once the dice are produced! The shipping cost will be accurate (and by all signs disgustingly large) at that time, and the price per set will not be any different.\nCan my dice be shipped with my Fate Core kickstarter books?\nNo. The timing and data coordination on that idea is a higher logistical load than a small company like Evil Hat can really accommodate, unfortunately. In a number of cases it might well mean you wouldn't get your books until practically (or actually) next year, too, which is potentially too costly to Evil Hat in terms of our taxable carry-over inventory going into 2014.\nWill you be offering [style of dice I don't yet see above]?\nCould be! Many things are possible if we're able to fund up into our \"second batch\" stretch goal territory.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvil Hat is an established game company with a proven track record of delivering high quality games and game products. We've got the experience with Kickstarter and with making games to make this a smooth process all the way.\n\nFinances: Our record of success puts us in a strong financial position for taking some risks in manufacturing dice. What this boils down to is simple\u2014we've got the money to absorb any cost overruns we experience with this Kickstarter. Your dice will get made and they will be coming to you, full stop.\n\nSupplier: Furthermore, we've partnered with Grand Prix International, a big name in games manufacturing, to make these dice a reality. We were put in touch with GPI by the big Munchkins themselves over at Steve Jackson Games; this is no fly-by-night manufacturer. They know their dice, and they could answer questions we couldn't get answered by any other supplier we investigated over the past year. Confidence in GPI is very high.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the dice on sale until all backer sets have shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nTime factor: The real cost of any big physical manufacturing product like dice is felt in time as much as money. Delays can and do happen, due to safety testing, package and prototype reworking, and more. That said, we've been able to invest the money to move us along to the point of having real, physical prototypes in hand for our Early Batch of dice. While we have a few adjustments to make to some of the prototypes we've received (including making a second mold), that should only add about one to one and a half months\u2014which we've already factored into our timetable. We've given our approval and go-sign to GPI to get started on those adjustments. A few months have already been shaved off prior to this project. It will still be several more months before we have the dice made, shipped, and ready to go at our warehouse, of course\u2014that's the reality of a manufacturing job like this. Six month timeframes start to finish are very typical. That said, we are definitely going to be dealing with a \"slow boat from China\" factor here, which is always a bit of a wild-card.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please ask.

One is a mystery-thriller and the other an adaptation of a wonderful love story; both will be presented with all of the care and skill we brought to Judas Kiss.\nOur first feature, Judas Kiss, was made with Kickstarter backing. It went on to win at dozens of film festivals and gain international distribution.\nSo far, we've raised much of the money for The Dark Place and plan on raising money soon for Something Like Summer, but this time out we want to do even better. Now we want to go to the technological cutting-edge for these two films \u2014 and beyond. \nLittle films like ours don't have to look little. We pushed Judas Kiss well past the place other, comparably budgeted features go. We're raising a lot of the money for these two films on our own, but we're seeking backing on Kickstarter to help us push the technological edge. \nYour backing allows us and other indie filmmakers with whom we'll share the camera to make these films with a Red Scarlet, a state-of-the-art, 4K camera that will allow us to shoot images on par with big-budget studio pictures \u2014 ready for the screens of the future.\nThe Dark Place is prepping now for principal photography in April near Portland, Oregon. Something Like Summer is scheduled to shoot this fall.\nWe know producing two feature films in one year is ambitious, but your backing moves the camera from a rental expense to an investment that pays off in producing more movies for years.\nIn fact, those who back us at certain levels will get free copies of all the films we end up making with this camera.\nYou can help us and other independent filmmakers produce movies that look like big blockbusters!

I'll include an option in the survey after the Kickstarter ends, and you can choose 3.5/4E/Pathfinder.  Don't worry - I got you covered; no edition warring here!  Just be aware that the 4E version isn't a single compiled edition, and it's the Pathfinder edition which will have the new art and stuff].\nCLICK HERE TO READ ABOUT OUR FINAL STRETCH GOAL!\nThe final, \u00a345,000 stretch goal!\nThis page is divided into four sections - FEATURES, BONUS REWARDS, STRETCH GOALS, and BOLT-ONS.  (Also note that a good way to keep up with minute-to-minute updates is to follow me on Twitter where I haven't stopped talking about this for days...)\nAs you may know, EN World was hacked in December 2012. The entire site was destroyed, and I'm building it again from scratch. While the basic functionality is there (news and forums), much of the functionality built up over a decade was lost. I need to hire developers to recode all that cool stuff, but that takes time and - more importantly - money. While EN World ain't going anywhere, I'm turning to the community with whose help we can restore much of what was lost within a few months.\nMonte Cook said \"EN World is a good cause\"; Green Ronin's Chris Pramas said \"EN World has been a great center of gaming community many years. I had to back Rebuilding EN World on Kickstarter\"; Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens said \"Glad to help EN World get back up on its feet!\"; and Ryan Dancey said \"The ENWorld community is an asset to the whole hobby. Helping them get back up on their feet is just the Right Thing To Do. Back this Kickstarter.\"\nOur goal, put simply:\nEN World will be FAST, it will be RELIABLE, and it will have AWESOME FEATURES. It will also, most importantly, STILL BE AROUND FOR YEARS TO COME! And we all want that, right? Right?\nKickstarter staff very kindly said to me: \"Normally, we don't accept website projects, but we talked about what you're doing and we think rebuilding a community website through Kickstarter is a great use of our platform.\"\nI'm calling the hacking \"The Great Breach of 2012\" and the Kickstarter backers \"The Defenders of the Wall\". Gear up, and take your place on the wall now!\n[Lots of people have been asking about backup strategies -- I've added that info to the \"Risks & Challenges\" section below].\nAs a community website, I feel it appropriate that this Kickstarter use the Kicking It Forward system.  This means that 5% of the profits will be spent supporting other RPG-related Kickstarters as a way not only to give a little back but also to foster more cool RPG stuff!\nHere are some of the things that need writing, and the funding targets for each.\nOur goals are quite modest.  We're not asking for the millions or hundreds of thousands that some other RPG Kickstarters have raised.  For example, the first thing - the server optimization and security overhaul - is only \u00a3300 (or about $480).  I've put both UK and US currencies in the descriptions below.\nPre-Funding: New Server\nI've already purchased a brand new, powerful, server, which will be going online this week (being the week this project launches, 13-19 Jan). That bit I've funded myself in advance, and we should be seeing the benefits of it before this Kickstarter ends.\nSite Optimization and Security (\u00a3300/$480)\nFirst and foremost, the immediate plan includes hiring a professional to optimize the entire site, database, and server.  I hired someone to do that late last year, and it worked swimmingly well, but all that work was lost shortly afterwards.  This is actually the most important thing, and so is first on the list.\nCampaign Manager (\u00a3500/$800)\nThe Campaign Manager is a collection of tightly integrated campaign-management tools including a campaign wiki, journal, links and files, picture albums, calendar system, and more. Together, they make a functional and convenient campaign website. Various tools for the GM include permission and privacy settings, the ability to contact players via PM or email, inviting and booting players from the campaign, and more.\nWe have 285 campaigns being run in the campaign manager!  That's 285 active campaigns and GMs who badly need the features returned!\nYou don't actually play your campaign in the campaign manager (well, you could if you wanted, I suppose) - its purpose is to organize your campaign, schedule events, store and distribute information, discuss topics outside the actual game itself, and so on. It's designed for both tabletop and online play. It doesn't matter where or how your campaign takes place.\nDice Roller (\u00a31000/$1600)\nOur dice roller is not only attractive, it is also secure; there is no way for players to cheat it while using it in an online PbP game.  It's one of EN World's most popular features - our play-by-post (PbP) players make hundreds of dice rolls every month.\nOGRE  (Online Generator Randomizer Engine) (\u00a31500/$2400)\nEN World's Online Generic Randomizer Engine (OGRE) is a powerful, flexible framework to create your own random generators and share them with other EN World members. You can create anything from the very simple (a random color generator which rolls a d6 to choose a color) to something very complex (such as an entire, detailed populated village with homes and businesses).\nWe built this in 2012, and there was a whole pile of random generators created by a variety of talented people.  I created some planet generators for space RPGs, someone made a pirate generator, and there were town generators, room generators, NPC generators, and more which all referenced each other.  It was horrible losing all that, because they were such fun to make and use!\nThis is accomplished by the creation of two types of object: tables and generators.\nOnce someone creates a table or a generator, it is available for use by anyone else creating their own tables and generators. In this way, generators can reference and include other generators as part of their own output. So if Bob has created a table which picks a random color such as green, blue, or red, and Alice has created a table which picks a random object, such as box, table, or book, Eric can create a generator which references both of those pre-existing tables to generate an object of a random color, such as a blue box or a green table.\n\nIn this way you can create random generators for your tabletop gaming needs. From random elf names to potion descriptions, to entire treasure hoards and NPCs. \nGamers Seeking Gamers (\u00a32000/$3200)\nOur extensive Gamers Seeking Gamers system has map and distance searches, and with which many gamers met up and formed groups and games.  All the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of members who added themselves to the GsG system are still sitting safely in the database, which means we can be up and running with thousands upon thousands of gamers upon launch! \nIt really is the most comprehensive, fully populated system of its type on the entire internet, with tens of thousands of gamers already in the system, just waiting for the code to be rewritten! \nWhat's this - more stuff? The \u00a325 PDF Reward Level Keeps Growing!\nBONUS ITEM - Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns for the PATHFINDER RPG\nWe've produced an updated, revised version of our best ever selling book, Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns.  Originally for D&D 3.5, this exclusive Pathfinder edition is not available for sale anywhere else.We're adding this to the \u00a325 pledge.\nThe reviews for the D&D 3.5 version of this book were universally glowing!  Folks have been begging for a Pathfinder version for years, and now here it is.\n\"One of the best sourcebooks I ever laid my hands on - you can use it in any Fantasy/DarkAge Setting.\" [from RPGNow]\n\n\"This is one of the most universally useful books I have ever seen. It is also a fun read.\" [read at RPGNow]\n\"Tournaments, Fairs & Taverns is one of those extremely usable books. It\u2019s the type of supplement that\u2019ll see use in more than one campaign, more than one gaming world. It\u2019s the type of supplement that can be grabbed and used by a GM working on a scene on the fly and can be used by a GM in the planning stages. Fortunately, T, F & T is good enough that you\u2019ll want to use it in all these occasions.\" [read at Geek Native]\n\"I loved the electronic version so much I had to order the print version for quicker reference.\" [read at Amazon]\n\"I still have fond memories of this 74-page book. I have tried to find a way to use it in every one of my campaigns.\" [read at RPG Centric]\nThere are many more, but we don't want to bore you!\nWild Spellcraft was our first ever real product.  It was released in RPGNow's first days, and shocked RPGNow owner James Mathe by selling hundreds of copies within hours.  Originally for D&D 3E, we are now updating it for Pathfinder and including it in the \u00a325 EXCLUSIVE PDF reward tier. You should expect this within 3 months of the project's end.\nCONFUSED about what's included at the \u00a325 (and above) PDF level?   At present it's well over \u00a3200 worth of stuff; that's an awesome deal.\nTOURNAMENTS, FAIRS, & TAVERNS for the Pathfinder RPG\nAdmiral o' The High Seas for Pathfinder and D&D 4th Edition\nWar of the Burning Sky 700-page compiled for D&D 3.5\nFive ZEITGEIST adventure path adventures for Pathfinder or 4E (your choice)\nWhat's the Pirate Ship Like, Anyway?  from Raging Swan Press\nVillainous Pirates from Raging Swan Press\nWild Spellcraft for the Pathfinder RPG\nThe Town of Kalas and the Castles & Crusades Quickstart Rules from Troll Lord Games [also please see Troll Lord's own Kickstarter, which is awesome, too!]\nNEW! Plus the Borderland Keep Deluxe 3D paper terrain models from Fat Dragon Games and A0: Crows Nest Island from Adventureaweek.com (both pictured above, added after the big image below was made).\nNEW! Plus the Darklight 4E Bundle pictured below - adventures, amps,a and a sourccebook!\nNEW! Plus the Savage Mojo bundle pictures below - an adventure, and the largest PDF set of map tiles ever in the form of The Leviathan!\nPLUS -- the O.G.R.E. mobile app, which EVERY backer will get!\nPlease note that stretch goals will take longer to provide than the core rewards. I have given rough estimates below.\nGoodness me!  We hit those goals quicker than I dared hope!  I guess it's time for a stretch goal.  This one's for the PATHFINDER fans amongst you, especially those fond of chaos and wild magic...\nUpdate - we made the \u00a33000 stretch goal, which means that everybody who pledged \u00a325 or more will get the Wild Spellcraft PDF.  Thank you - that's astonishing! \nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a36000: MORE OGRE POWER! -- ACHIEVED!\nThanks to you, we achived this stretch goal, and O.G.R.E. will have the additional scripts and functionality to make it truly awesome!\nThe O.G.R.E. system  is something you need to see to appreciate. Its usefulness can't be exaggerated; it's a crowd-sourced, ever-growing library of interrelated random generators. It's a \"generator generator\". Creating and sharing random tables and generators of ever-increasing complexity is easy! Honestly, you could create a generator to detail an entire town, and it could call upon already existing tables and generators that others had made before you - descriptions, names, stats, anything you can think of. The utility of this system is really hard to convey, but once you see it you get it!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a39000: Server Upgrade (and you get THE PERTURBED DRAGON Season 2!) - ACHIEVED!\nSo we have another stretch goal to announce!  This one's a little different to the usual RPG PDF type goal/rewards.  In 2012 we produced a cartoon series.  It was six episodes long, and featured an adventuring group hanging out at their local tavern, playing an RPG called \"REAL LIFE\".  It's called THE PERTURBED DRAGON, and we are very proud of it.\nTo raise some more money for a new server upgrade (we have a new one on its way, but we can add stuff to it to make it faster!), we will make a second season, taking everything we learned making the first, if we reach \u00a39000.  This means shorter, snappier, tighter episodes; more animation frames; and guest stars!  We even have a guest star lined up - you probably already know who Monte Cook is, but if you don't, he helped design D&D 3rd Edition, Planescape, just finished a half-million dollar Kickstarter for his own RPG called Numenera, and a whole bunch of other things in a long, long list of achievements.  Well, Monte has agreed to appear in an episode of The Perturbed Dragon (we're toying with the idea of having him play an artist called Monet Cooke; but he might play himself).  Also appearing will be the winner of our BATTLE OF THE BARDS competition, the wonderful singer Mary Crowell who won with the incredibly catchy song \"I Put My Low Stat\", to sing in it.\nSo, the new stretch goal is \u00a39000 for a server upgrade; if we make that goal we'll make a cartoon.  That's some more money we can spend upgrading the server already en route to us (making the site even faster than it was going to be!) and also helps us arrange a server maintenance contract for a year.  Please help us!\nKickstarter backers will get this before everyone else!\nNew Stretch Goal: \u00a311000 for a server maintenance contract (and you get a 4E PDF megabundle!) - ACHIEVED!\nI've set a new goal which should appeal to the D&D 4E fans among you. We've got some solid Pathfinder material already in the stuff you're getting (and even some Castles & Crusades stuff), and there will be more if we manage to keep this Kickstarter trucking, but for the moment this one's for the 4E fans. Darklight Interactive has donated what can only be described as a pile of stuff. I've made another of my awesome (read; not awesome at all) infographics below to show you what's in it; but here's the list:\nAdventures:\nA Hero's Journey (level 0, D&D 4E)\nDeath's Edge (level 0, D&D 4E)\nThe Dragon's Master (level 5, D&D 4E and Pathfinder)\nThe Endless Winter (level 12, D&D 4E)\nThe Heart of Fire (level 12, D&D 4E, \"megacampaign\" of 135 pages; we reviewed this on EN World last year -- \"I was very impressed with The Heart of Fire, and I think a lot of gaming groups can enjoy an adventure of this quality. While there are some familiar tropes in this fantasy adventure, they are put to good use making a plot which is fun and exciting, as opposed to being too obvious. The adventure blends a \u201cnew school\u201d sand-boxy encounter series with an \u201cold school\u201d mysterious dungeon delve quite seamlessly, and there is a lot of play sessions packed into one dynamic mini-campaign.\")\nMap Packs:\nM1: The Wayside Inn\nM2: The Ring of Stones\nM3: Crypt Entrance\nOther:\nItems of Legend (D&D 4E supplemental)\nYou don't have to do anything to get all this.  If you pledged \u00a325 or more for the PDF bundle, it will be automatically added as soon as we hit \u00a311,000.  We have 26 days, so there's a good chance we'll do it!  \nThank you all again for this wonderful response.  It's both humbling and gratifying at the same time!\nCourtesy of Darklight Interactive, all this gets automatically added to the \u00a325 PDF bundle if we hit the target of \u00a311000!\nNew Stretch Goal: \u00a315000 for the O.G.R.E. mobile app! - ACHIEVED!\nThe OGRE mobile app will be free to EVERY Kickstarter backer!\nYou will have read about OGRE above - now imagine you're running your game and you need a random elf name.  You grab your phone, hit a button, and you've got one.  Or ten.  It was there along with the potion description generator, the random weather generator, the planet generator, and the hundreds of other generators all created on EN World by users of both the website and the app! \nOGRE stands for ONLINE GENERIC RANDOMIZER ENGINE.  There's info about it above, and documentation for the web version here.\nIf we hit \u00a315000, I'll have mobile version for iOS and Android made.  If you're a backer (at any level), you'll get it free.  It'll also be on sale in the appropriate app stores.\nThe potential for this application is amazing!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a321,000 to unlock the exclusive EN World dice bolt-on! - ACHIEVED!\nThis stretch goal works slightly differently.  I'm lucky enough to be able to offer exclusive EN World dice (pictured below) as a separate bolt-on alongside the t-shirts, as well as an automatic bonus reward for some higher pledge levels (\u00a3100+).  But I can ONLY do that if I make a certain minimum order.  The stretch goal, therefore, allows me to make that minimum order without being worried about not selling enough of them.\nSo it works like this -- if we hit the \u00a321,000 goal, I'll bulk order the dice, and then begin offering them as a separate bolt-on.  I know it sounds a bit odd doing it that way round, but that insulation ensures the Kickstarter doesn't *lose* money, which would defeat the purpose!\nThe good bit for backers of \u00a3100 or more is that you will get a black EN World d20 automatically included in your reward package as a bonus if we make that target!\nNew Stretch Goals - \u00a327,000 and \u00a329,000 to unlock print versions of WILD SPELLCRAFT and Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns! Plus \u00a330,000 for new art! - ACHIEVED!\nThis stretch goal took a bit of juggling of schedules and resources, but it's a very cool one!\nThe two new Pathfinder PDFs, detailed above, are incredibly useful.  But I would like to make them into gorgeous, colour softbacks!  So the deal is this:\nIf we manage to hit \u00a327,000 I will produce a full-colour softcover version of Wild Spellcraft!\nIf we manage to hit \u00a329,000 I will produce a full-colour softcover version of Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns\nIf we manage to hit the lofty heights of \u00a330,000, I will commission a bunch of new colour art for both!\nAs you know, if you've pledged the \u00a325 PDF deal or higher, you're already getting the PDFs - guaranteed.  You will still benefit from this, though - because your PDF will benefit from the new art and layout being commissioned for the print version!  So the PDF you're already getting will look better!\nAnd if you've pledged \u00a3100 or more, guess what?  I will send you one of those softcovers (your choice) for FREE as a bonus item.  Yup, all you have to do is let me know at the end of the Kickstarter which you want. (Hey, and you're already getting an exclusive black EN World d20!)\nBoth softcovers will also be available for purchase separately at your online vendor of choice (RPGNow, Amazon, DTRPG, etc.) at a later date.\nAll that IF we hit the goals of \u00a327,000, \u00a329,000 and \u00a330,000 respectively.  That's quite the challenge - but these books are awesome and useful enough that they deserve to be on your bookshelf!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a336000 for FAFNIR's TREASURE! - ACHIEVED, BABY!\nThis latest reward/stretch goal is courtesy of the fine folks over at Fate of the Norns.  Please pay them a visit!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a339,000 for an OSR Gem - the 1977 4th Edition Tunnels & Trolls PDF!\nVery kindly donated by the fine folks at Flying Buffalo!\nBolt-Ons are optional bonus items that you can add on to your existing pledge.   Simply add the appropriate amount to your pledge.  So, if you have the \u00a375 pledge and you would like a t-shirt, you'd alter your pledge and increase it to \u00a395.  If you want two black d20s, you'd add \u00a310.  Note that backers who have pledged \u00a3100+ automatically get one free black d20.\nFor t-shirts, please add \u00a35 if you're not in the USA (sorry - that's where they'll be shipped from!)\nFor dice, shipping is free in the USA and the UK. For up to 10 dice total, please add \u00a35 for Canada and Europe, \u00a310 for the rest of the world excluding Australia and New Zealand, and \u00a320 for Australia and New Zealand (sorry!) Add the same again foe each additional 10 dice or multiple thereof!\nAt the end of the Kickstarter, you'll need to let me know which bolt-ons you chose.  Don't worry  - I'll be sending out a survey, and you'll be able to note that you selected a bolt-on!\nDice - set of d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 (blue/green dice assorted randomly): \u00a320\nDice - single black d20: \u00a35\nT-shirt: \u00a320\nMen and womens' t-shirts, exclusive to this Kickstarter!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be EN World's third Kickstarter, after we successfully raised funds for Admiral o' the High Seas (a naval sourcebook for Pathfinder and 4E) and To Slay a Dragon (an adventure). For this particular Kickstarter, I'll be hiring coders to specifically rewrite certain features to specification; the most challenging part of that is locating reliable coders within the budget, something I've had a great deal of practice at over the last decade. To that end, I have already sourced these coders in order to ensure that, should the funding be raised, progress is quick.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I've discovered working on Kickstarters is the management of stretch goals -- in the unlikely event that we manage to exceed our target, it's important not to set stretch goals which drastically inflate the time period required to provide rewards (which goals like \"OK, instead of a 32 page book, it will now be a 500 page book!\" tend to do). The current stretch goals are all rooted in that core functionality we lost; any later stretch goals, should there be any, will not affect the time required to provide existing rewards.\n\nThe final - and most difficult challenge - will be that of reaching out to the community, to gamers, to publishers and garnering the support I need to make this happen. I do know that the EN World community has proved itself to be incredibly generous in past years, and that many of my publishing friends and fellow website owners have been very supportive. I hope they will be again!\n\nREGARDING BACKUP STRATEGIES -- a number of people have asked \"why didn't you have backups?\"\n\nWe did. The database was entirely backed up (if you go to EN World right now, you can see that every post, thread, and user is still present and correct - no data was lost).\n\nThe code, on the other hand, consisted of a heavily modified vBulletin 3.x codebase. It was a decade old, and subject to exploits over the years. In short, a decade after it was installed, it was no longer secure or reliable -- that's why the hackers were able to get in. In short, it was vulnerable, and the backups of the code were therefore also vulnerable. I made the decision, therefore, to upgrade to the modern, supported, and far more secure vBulletin 4.2. The effect of this was that our code was all rendered obsolete/incompatible. I couldn't just use it again; it was for a different version of the core codebase. \n\nHopefully that explains why I couldn't just use the backups. I could have, but if the site had been restored to exactly how it was before the hack, the hackers would have immediately jumped in again the next week using the exact same method.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Latest Silver Lifetime Subscriber Rewards", "update_content": "Hi everyone!

After seeing some success with it in their home games, they created a free, downloadable version for anyone who cared to grab it. They figured a few dozen people would have a look. Instead, hundreds did, and it fast became one of the most popular variants of Fudge out there, spawning its own thousands-strong discussion list and eventually helping to launch Evil Hat as a commercial game company.\nFrom there, Fate grew into new revisions and iterations, showing up in Evil Hat's own Spirit of the Century in 2006 and the Dresden Files RPG in 2010 (each one leading to a temporary shortage in the supply of Fudge dice as demand spiked), as well as dozens of third-party Fate games and a few other popular games that borrowed ideas from Fate, if not the whole system.\nToday, Evil Hat is proud to bring you Fate Core: the latest evolution of the Fate role-playing game system. Inside you'll find refined, clearer language about every part of the game -- ranging from streamlined language about aspects and skills, to a unified approach for game actions and outcomes, to our trademark, rock solid GM and player advice.\nSimply put, Fate Core is the best version of Fate we can possibly make, built upon over a decade of play and design experience by Evil Hat, and with the Fate player community at large, taking the best lessons from all of gaming and distilling them into a cohesive, compelling whole. \nWith Fate Core, you'll be able to drive right to the heart of your characters, using simple-yet-deep rules to make the most of those stories. Throughout, you'll use Fate Core's mechanics to model how fiction, not physics, operates, producing an experience that's better than \"realistic\" -- it's authentic. \nAfter the kickstarter campaign concludes and the game's text, art, and layout are finalized, the PDF of Fate Core will be made available to everyone on a \"pay what you like\" scheme. We'll also be selling a printed version of the game, and will use the system to power upcoming games like the Atomic Robo RPG. \nUpon publication  we'll place near to 100% of the Fate Core text into the Open Gaming License as open content, once again continuing our commitment to supporting third party efforts to build the Fate games everyone wants to see.\nIn the meantime, as a backer of this Kickstarter campaign, you will get immediate, early access to the laid out text of Fate Core as it currently stands (see the link right below the video). You will have the opportunity to tell us what you think, and help us determine the final shape of the game. \nIt's an exciting time for Fate, and for Evil Hat, and we hope you'll join us as a backer, a fan, and a member of the Fate community. Let's rock this thing!\ncover art by Kurt Komoda\nWe've set the project timeline on this to the maximum because we want a solid two months for our backers to have a look at the Fate Core preview, give it a whirl, and let us know what they think. We'll be iterating through the feedback you give us in that time to make any necessary tweaks to the text and the layout.\nAs project funding progresses, we'll continue our efforts to get the art buy and execution put together for Fate Core. At launch time we don't expect to have all of our art done, of course -- but we believe in getting a head start when we can afford to do so. Depending on complexity and speed of execution, art creation and placement into layout may run past the end of the Kickstarter campaign; we're giving it about a month.\nOnce the art is in and the text and layout are final, we'll charge hard on getting the print run complete. We'll be going with one of our established, fast-on-execution-and-quality domestic book printers for this. Setup and proofing will eat a week; manufacture shouldn't run much longer than a month, if that.\nAfter that point, it's all about shipping, which is probably the most potentially elastic part of our timeline. But we'll be shipping out the copies we owe to all of our backers before we put the book on sale anywhere else. \nSigned copies, consultations, and fudge dice will take a bit longer to get out there, due to the added steps involved.\nThe PDF: As a backer of this project at any level, you'll get immediate access to the early preview PDF (see the link at the top of this page, under the video) before the kickstarter campaign even concludes.The final PDF that will be released after the conclusion of the kickstarter will be available on a \"pay-what-you-like\" basis -- which includes free for those so inclined. (But folks who don't back this project will have to wait a few months before they'll get to see that.) We're doing this because we want you to see what's already been done -- and for you to get a chance to provide us critical feedback that will improve the game in its final form.\nThe HARDCOVER Book: Those backing at $30 and higher will receive a 6\"x9\" formatted hardcover, black and white interior version of the Fate Core rule-set, with a page count somewhere in the lower 300 range. Shipping in early spring 2013.\nThe Digital Expansions: Backers at $10 or higher will get access to a digital expansion pack that starts with a fantasy adventure playable with Fate Core. Our stretch goals on this kickstarter will add more expansions into that pack at no additional cost to the backers! The higher we soar, the more awesome the expansion set gets. After the kickstarter concludes, each individual PDF in this expansion pack will sell for about $5 each, so this has a chance of being a real steal.\nUNLOCKED: The Fate System Toolkit Book: A $20 HARDCOVER book containing the Magic System Toolkit and other unlocked \"system-tinkerer's\" content. See Update #5 for how to add this to your pledge. Shipping sometime in summer 2013.\nUNLOCKED: The Fate Worlds Compilation Books: A two-volume set of softcovers for $30 total containing the non-Toolkit expansion content from the Fantasy Adventure on up through Camelot Trigger. See Update #5 for how to add this to your pledge. Shipping around mid-spring/early summer 2013.\nUNLOCKED: The Fate Accelerated Edition Book: A $5, 32-ish page softcover book containing the very basics of Fate for fastest learning and use. Shipping by early spring 2013.\nUNLOCKED: Sally Slick and the Steel Syndicate: A $15 softcover, 200-ish pages, of the Young Centurions-set young adult novel by Carrie Harris, shipping late in 2013. \nUNLOCKED: Strange Tales of the Century: A $40 softcover by rockstar nerd-researcher Jess Nevins, hundreds of pages, filled with pulp character archetypes and timeline material to bridge the gap between Spirit and Shadow.\nFred's Fudge Dice Stash: Folks who pick a reward that includes Fred's Stash will get four fudge dice of one random color (i.e., all four dice will be the same color, and that color will be picked randomly) included with a signed-by-Fred copy of the Fate Core book. The six colors include the three bronze, copper, and gold tones of Grey Ghost Games' Olympic Fudge Dice set, and the translucent red, translucent blue, and glow-in-the-dark yellow-green of the no-longer-available Wizard Fudge Dice set that Evil Hat produced.\nFred's stash includes the largest quantities of the front row pictured here (the Wizard dice), and a smaller number of the back row (the Olympics). We will try to take requests if it seems feasible, but can't offer any guarantees about the color you'll get. Supplies will dictate!\nThe Consultation: Got a particular thing you want to do with Fate Core for your home game? We'll pair your ideas with an Evil Hat approved expert who will help you sort out your Fate Core implementation for your home game, and will also write up to 2,000 words so you'll have an official reference document to work from. Part of your contribution will be used to pay the experts for their time and wordsmithery. You'll share rights to the document with Evil Hat, or we can simply agree to enter it into the available open content surrounding Fate Core (assuming it's viable for us to do so) -- your call. This will be carried out either by a Skype call or an exchange of emails (or a mix of both), as fits the schedule of those involved. If it turns out your ideas exceed what's feasible in 2,000 words, consider this a starting point rather than a total solution -- but we'll do our best to cover the essentials!\nFeel like you need a spreadsheet to figure your pledge level out? We've got a Backer Pledge Calculation Sheet right here!\nBig Blue Box\nWe have a number of stretch goals in mind. Below, we reveal some of the ones that lie ahead. Stay tuned for updates as the project continues to learn of more!\nKABOOM!\nWhat am I getting?\nThe Fantasy Adventure (Tower of the Serpents): When our project hits its first funding goal, we start the roster for our set of digital expansions with a fantasy adventure playable with just a few friends, some dice, and the Fate Core rulebook. This will be written by Brennan Taylor, author of the Bulldogs! Fate game published by Galileo Games. [Learn More][Preview & Playtest]\nKriegszeppelin Valkyrie: Our first stretch goal travels to a mini-campaign set in a World War One that isn't quite like you read about in the history books. You play the multinational barnstormers and daring fighter pilots of the era, crewing the biggest airship that ever flew, as you take on the forces of a mad scientist and his army of galvanic automatons. It's one part pulp, one part Battlestar Galactica, and100% high-flying zeppelin-and-biplanes action, from Evil Hat's own Clark Valentine. Once unlocked, the Valkyrie will join forces with our EXPANSIONS package for our backers. [Preview & Playtest]\nMagic system toolkit: In one of our earlier incarnations of the Fate system, Evil Hat co-founder Rob Donoghue lost his damn mind and included a chapter of over half a dozen different magic systems for use with the game. With this stretch goal, Rob will create a new supplement doing exactly that for Fate Core to be added to our EXPANSIONS package for our backers. This will be included in our Extras Toolkit (see below)! [Learn More] [Preview & Playtest]\nMultiple electronic formats: You've made us commit! We will release the final electronic version of Fate Core in multiple formats -- PDF, ePub, and mobi (for Kindle) at the least.\nWild Blue: From Bulldogs! co-author Brian Engard comes this setting of six-guns and superpowers, monsters and outlaws and keeping the peace on the frontier. It's a dangerous world out there, but opportunities abound in the Blue Lands for those willing to help themselves. You're one of the Queen's Wardens, a newly inducted recruit into the land's most elite law-enforcement team, a team made up entirely of Powers, people born with unique capabilities beyond those of the common folk. You're a superhero, a law-bringer, a Warden. But all power comes with a cost, and being a hero is never without danger. [Learn More] [Preview & Playtest]\nCourt/Ship: The court of Louis the XV of France was a weird place. He had a place called a \"Deer Park\" where he kept a stable of young mistresses, he kept his court in the cramped and weird living situation of his palace, and from all reports lived a crazy and decadent lifestyle. Women would come to court to become his mistress to gain a title and lands. This was also the time of the \"gentlemen scientist\" when there was growing interest in science and technology, as well as new systems of government. Into this environment... an alien invasion begins. This Fate Core expansion by J.R. Blackwell will explore themes of identity, hierarchy, and what it means to be human. [Learn More]\nHardcover upgrade: It's our first mega-stretch goal. We've gotten a lot of inquiries about a hardcover option for Fate Core. When we looked into it, it wasn't terribly workable as a partial thing, where some books would be softcover, others hardcover. So with this stretch goal, we're gunning hard for hardcovers -- hit this mark, and we'll be able to add enough extra cash to the print budget to make the whole Fate Core print run a hardcover affair, while keeping the same cover price of $25 that we would have charged for the softcovers!\nBurn Shift: From the Mindjammer mind of Sarah J. Newton, a post-apocalyptic vision of the future! The Age of Space is gone, blasted to atoms in a devastation which buckled continents and boiled seas. Now the sky flickers with many-colored lightning and roiling clouds, and the air is heavy with poison. Twisted by strange energies from forms already geneered beyond natural adaptation, the remnants of posthumanity struggle to survive in the ruins of a once-glorious civilization. But for every one who succumbs to the curse of the Wounded Earth, another thrives with the Burn Shift -- the new power which gives survivors an edge in this harsh and nightmarish world. Where most post-apocalyptic RPGs stop, Burn Shift starts: it\u2019s not about wallowing in the devastation, but about pushing through it, reforming and rebuilding communities, going beyond... Whatever the future will be, it won\u2019t be like the past. [Preview & Playtest]\nFight Fire: Fight Fire expands Fate Core's handling of objective hazards, answering the common question \"the warehouse has the On Fire aspect... now what?\" Not only is this answered -- literally -- but it is enhanced and expanded in the form of a mini supplement that tackles both the day-to-day operations of urban firefighters (using tactics cribbed directly from the FDNY) and their lives off the clock. Raised in a firefighting family, Fiasco author Jason Morningstar takes Fate Core in a direction that tempers hard-researched realism with drama and danger. [Learn More]\nNo Exit: From writer Shoshana Kessock, take a journey into psychological horror, \"Lost\" style. Characters find themselves living in an apartment building they can't leave, and must come to terms with who has put them there and what they did to deserve it. Dark truths will come to light, in No Exit. [Learn More] [Preview & Playtest]\nThe Ellis Affair: In May of 1923, an American businessman dies while abroad. Investigators are dispatched to try to make sense of it, and uncover a hidden world of conspiracy, diplomacy, and covert operations gone awry. Who was Earl H. Ellis? Businessman, or spy? Was his death accident, or murder? And why was the last man to have contact with his ashes found catatonic and weeping while clutching them to his chest? It's up to you to solve this real-events-based mystery from author Lisa Steele. [Preview & Playtest]\nCrimeWorld: Leverage television show head writer (and series co-creator) John Rogers uses his extensively-researched knowledge of cons and capers to craft this sourcebook for running grifts and heists in your Fate Core games. Use CrimeWorld to run a game in the world of the ultra-criminal, or apply it as a toolkit to give added depth and adventure to confidence games and thievery in any game based on the Fate Core RPG system. [Learn More]\nFate Core Dingbat Font: In the final digital release, we'll include a font (used to create the little pictures you see next to the headers on this project) that sports the icons for the four actions, icons for fudge dice, and strings-of-boxes you can use to create a stress track quickly. Maybe more!\nWhite Picket Witches: Small towns are cauldrons full of family secrets. In Salem, those cauldrons bubble over. Inspired by paranormal cozies like Practical Magic and the Witches of Eastwick, White Picket Witches give the players magic and charms to deal with small town pressures... and sometimes, the forces of evil. It's about accepting the past, fitting in, or breaking out. It emphasizes friendships, brother/sisterhood, community, and a touch of romance. Designed by Filamena Young of Machine Age Productions, who has worked with Margaret Weis Productions, White Wolf, and many others. [Learn More]\nTimeworks: \"Want to have developed the iPhone? We can make it so that your firm had the idea before Apple. Want to get rid of a tricky rival? We'll make sure his parents never met. After all, it's only murder if someone gets killed. Not getting born doesn't count. Our time technicians are experts at moving the timestream in revenue generating directions. We're discreet, careful, and always on time. After all, we know you expect the best. Timeworks. Making time work for you.\" From game designer Mark Diaz Truman. [Learn More]\nExtras Toolbox: We'll take the Magic System Toolkit and absorb it as one chapter -- then go beyond the field of magic, doubling (or maybe even tripling) the word-count, to create the Extras Toolbox, a series of collections-of-extras that will illustrate in greater depth how to construct full add-on options for your game. Each collection will be viable as a plug-and-play addition to your game, if it turns out to be a fit. We'll look into exploring ways to implement powers, vehicles, gear, and more, with a few system-tweaks and variants for extra spice. If funded to this level, we'll also be taking your suggestions -- and maybe even contributions! -- to make sure this covers, at least lightly, all the \"gear-head\" topics you're hungry for.

Star Wars Saga Edition writer Rob Wieland remixes Arthurian legend and big stompy robots in a setting featuring courtly intrigue, duels of honor, and XTE-78 Lancepack missile launchers. [Learn More] [Preview & Playtest]\nCreative Commons for Fate Core: One of the things we've done with Fate Core is write the rules up from scratch. This got us the clearest text possible. It also meant that absolutely none of our rules text uses text written by someone outside of Evil Hat. With that kind of ground-up ownership of the text, it frees us up to do more than just the Open Gaming License (OGL) if we want -- and the most popular other-license request we've gotten over the years has been for some kind of Creative Commons licensing alternative. With this goal funded, we'll put the time in to make that a reality -- we will choose a commercial-friendly, non-viral license that fits our vision for others using Fate Core (likely CC-BY), and provide documentation for how to properly follow the license if you decide to go that path with your own derived material, as well as protocols for commingling your CC-derived work with others' OGL materials if you happen to design like Frankenstein.\nMore Words for the Toolbox: We'll add 10,000 words (about 30-40 pages in the 6x9 Fate Core format) to the wordcount budget for the Extras Toolbox if we hit this goal.\nCompilation Book for all non-Toolbox Expansions: If we hit this goal, all the expansions up to this point (from the beginning, up to Camelot Trigger) that aren't in the Extras Toolbox will get bundled together in a softcover compilation book that will ship at least a few months later than Fate Core. Our rough estimate suggests this will be a 6x9 softcover book with at least 300-400 pages of content -- bigger than Fate Core itself! [Learn More]\nAll Expansions in Multiple Digital Formats: All the expansions will be released in ePub and mobi (Kindle-friendly) formats as well as the originally-promised PDF.\nEven More Words for the Toolbox: We'll add another 10,000 words (about 30-40 pages in the 6x9 Fate Core format) to the wordcount budget for the Extras Toolbox, putting us at a minimum of 40,000 words all told (~130-160 pages), about half the word count of Fate Core itself.\nShadow of the Century: The Spirit of the Century setting moves forward to 1984 -- where the world is poised on the brink of explosive technological advance... and the end of all things! If we hit this stretch goal, we'll put Shadow of the Century on the 2013 development docket, all backers at $10 and up will get the PDF of this project when it completes in late 2013 or 2014. [Learn More]\nDeck of Fate: We'll put the Deck of Fate into production in 2013. You can learn much more about the Deck of Fate in Update #9!\nHardcover Toolkit: If we hit this stretch goal, all copies of the Fate System Toolkit will be in hardcover instead of softcover -- at the same price!\nFate Accelerated Edition: At this stretch goal, we will produce Fate Accelerated Edition: a compact (32-ish pages) lighter-weight version of Fate with all the dials cranked towards ease of use and learning. Fully compatible with Fate Core! When we hit this goal, backers will have the option to add to their pledges ($5 per copy, plus shipping charges as needed) to add a copy of the printed version. The electronic version will be made available on a pay-what-you-like basis, just like Fate Core.

You can also follow us on twitter at @EvilHatOfficial and on Facebook.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvil Hat is an experienced RPG publisher. We've produced multiple printed role-playing games in a variety of physical formats over the past six-plus years. This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise -- and as with any project, experience tells us a few problems and bugaboos likely will.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Art: The art could take longer to execute than we're hoping it will, or could simply manifest in a fashion we find unsatisfactory (requiring a 'do-over'). Artists are people with real lives and those lives come with schedule-complicating problems. If any delay looks like it will be short, we'll likely roll with it, and we'll let you know what's up. If it looks like something long, we have an assortment of other artists we've worked with over the years who we know can execute quickly and on-time for a deadline.\n\nThe Text: While the editing and layout of Fate Core is largely done, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several Fate-savvy writers available if we need a fix, and our editor is also our layout guy, so making changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: Our company has grown up alongside the big boom in digital short-run printing technology. Thanks to the advances made there, we'll be able to print the softcover, affordably, in any quantity we need. We're also adept at working with domestic hardcover suppliers to get product quickly. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, or simply goofing up the manufacture or shipping of the books in some way. With a number of potential domestic printers to use, we'll always have a back-up we can go to in the event that our first choice printer has to be set aside. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and our other projects, Evil Hat is a -- for the game industry -- perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already spent $10,000 on getting Fate Core to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

The Guide is written by Greg Stafford, Sandy Petersen, and Jeff Richard, and incorporates over forty years of Greg\u2019s work on the setting.\nThe Guide details the history and cosmology of Glorantha, and its major human and Elder races. The entire world is mapped, with the places and people of interest for every region, as well as directions as to the future history of that region. Over 20 regions have population and political maps. This Guide is written without reference to any RPG rules system and can be used with equal ease for HeroQuest, RuneQuest, or any other system.\nThe Guide will be published in various editions, available through the pledge levels in the right-hand column. The physical product will exceed the high reputation for excellence established by Moon Design with books like Sartar: Kingdom of Heroes, Sartar Companion, and Pavis: Gateway to Adventure.\nPLEASE NOTE: Many backer levels on the right have additional rewards added to them through the achievement of various stretch goals. Unfortunately, Kickstarter does not allow us to edit the backer text once people have selected that backing level.

A supplemental atlas with over 96 pages of full color maps compliments the guide. This covers all of Glorantha! Due to the completion of a number of map related stretch goals almost the whole of Glorantha will be super-detailed with hex maps five miles wide (the same scale as the classic Griffin Mountain and Trollpak maps and the White Bear Red Moon boardgame) that show every settlement of at least 1000 people. \nA small piece of a zoomed in map....\nThe Guide is a pair of 10\"x12\" hardcover books with the main text, all the art, and all maps.

This will not be trite, nor pithy, and it will bump the size of the book up way more than 4 words.\n$237,500: (ACHIEVED) ART FEST! Jeff thinks there really should be even more art in this book. We will commission up to 5 more pictures of anything he thinks would fill in the gaps, and you are welcome to send in suggestions. Maybe Beast Folk, maybe the Tower of Xud, or the armor of the Tournament King, who knows? But really, let's just go nuts with art! Help us not worry about the Illiteracy Era.\n$242,500: ART PART DEUX! Jeff thinks the art list should get bigger and bigger.

You do not need to own, or be familiar with, any other FATE game to play Nova Praxis. \n\u2026a relatively \"hard sci-fi\" setting that takes place in the aftermath of a short lived technological singularity. \n\u2026an exploration of the tropes of transhuman sci-fi. Mind uploading, resleeving, AI characters, and body augmentation. \n\u2026an exploration of the societal impact of a reputation based post-scarcity economy. \n\u2026a game in which players play characters who know how to slip between the cracks of civilization and perform the jobs their patrons would rather keep off the books.\n... a setting full of conflict. The Houses wage a secret Shadow War against each other, purist and transhuman ideologies erupt in violence, and apostates lash out against the oppression of the Coalition government.\n...home to gauss rifles, powered armor, star ships, security drones, bipedal war frames, swarms of nanomachines, kill-sats, and the horrors of accelerated evolution gone wrong.\nNova Praxis is the third book to be released by Void Star Games. But in many ways, it is the oldest.\nVoid Star's first release, Strands of Fate, was developed to provide the rule set for the setting. Strands took the award winning FATE game system found in Spirit of the Century, Starblazer Adventures and the Dresden Files RPG and rebuilt it as a universal FATE toolkit. The result went on to become a Gold Best Seller on DrivethruRPG, and the next year was followed up with Strands of Power, Strands' first expansion.\nNow we've come full circle, and Nova Praxis is finally starting to take shape. It uses an evolution of the FATE system as presented in Strands of Fate, purpose built to reflect the needs of the setting. You can read more about how Nova Praxis differs from Strands of Fate and \"traditional\" FATE here and here.\n\"With the upcoming release of Nova Praxis, Mike McConnell's new transhumanist SF game, we now have a complete RPG powered by Strands of Fate.  And no fears, you don't need to buy Strands to play this: Nova Praxis is a complete RPG with a rich setting and a streamlined version of the Strands system... Even better, it's a game I want to play.\" - John Till, FATE SF (Read the rest of this preview here, Part 2 here, Part 3 here.)\n\"I don\u2019t want to spoil too much of the story behind the game setting; suffice to say it is extremely evocative, with plenty of scope for role-playing opportunities.\" - Greywulf, Stuffershack (Read the rest of this preview here.)\n\"For a mere beta version of the game it already looks gorgeous. If you expect your modern sci-fi game book to look sleek and stylish you won\u2019t be disappointed by Nova Praxis at all.\"....\"Overall I noticed a lot of very cool tweaks to the FATE system. Even if you are not necessarily interested in the setting, you might want to pick up Nova Praxis for its rules alone.\" - Michael Wolf, Stargazer's World (Read the rest of this preview here.)\n\"Nova Praxis is a well-integrated bundle of setting and rules, one section plays off of another creating a game where setting informs the rules and rules inform the setting. Much of this has to do with the strength of the Fate system, in any incarnation of the rules. This is a sexy and good-looking game that will make you want to run it, or play in its world.\" - Christopher Helton, Dorkland (Read the rest of this preview here, and the follow-up here.)\nThings have changed. We have changed.\nEarth is lost to us, but even in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy, we grow, evolve and even prosper. We have witnessed the death of our mother and the birth of a new era. \nIn what might have been the end, the synthesis of biology and technology proved our salvation. Augmentation, ranging from basic genetic manipulation to Apotheosis, set us on the path of prosperity. But it also emphasized the importance of identity, individual humanity, and the purity of the species. \nThe loss of Earth and the resulting Exodus gave us a oportunity to start over with a clean slate. And we seized it. \nThough the need for organization, stability and a reliable government was clear, the old ways were seen by most as archaic, clumsy and too prone to corruption. \nIt was time for a new way\u2026 a Nova Praxis. \nToday, social networks allow the will of the people to be measured instantly, accurately and without the need for representation. The Coalition, guided by the collective voice of its people, has established new homes on worlds lit by new suns. Molecular assembly technology has made it possible for society to provide a quality of life never before imagined, at essentially no cost, to everyone. And we are virtually immortal. \nBut can this would-be Utopia last? \nCorruption in the Coalition government fosters decay from within. The Houses, our benefactors and patrons, run shadowy networks of intrigue, espionage and assassination. Apostates, non-citizens, condemn those who would trade their privacy for the Coalition\u2019s false security. Remnants of Earth\u2019s old governments wage an unrelenting guerilla war on Coalition forces. Ideological extremists commit acts of terror using the latest horror to spring from a factory or test tube\u2026 \nAnd the value of a human soul is weighed and measured in lines of code. \nNova Praxis is a post-singularity sci-fi setting that explores transhumanism and post-scarcity societies against a backdrop of action, adventure, conspiracy and intrigue. \n_______________________________________________________ \nLearn more about Nova Praxis!\nPost-Singularity\nPost-Scarcity\nTranshumanity\nSavants\nThe Loss of Earth\nRise of the Houses\n\"Utopian Prison vs. Dystopian Freedom\"\nConspiracy and Intrigue\nThe Last Frontier\nAugmented and Virtual Reality\nNova Praxis has been in development for about three years now.

The character sheet is also a fillable form, so you can be reading about an Advantage, hit the character sheet button, add the Advantage to your character, then hit \"back\" to return and continue reading.\nThe PDF itself is being formatted for optimal viewing on a tablet or laptop. In fact, this particular screen shot comes from an iPad 3 using the Goodreader app. But of course, it will look just as good on an Android tablet, laptop or widescreen monitor.\nThe print version of the book will be full color hardcovers. \nWhat do the Kickstarter funds pay for?\nArtists, writers, and printers are expensive, and that's what the Kickstarter funds will be used to pay for. At $10,000, we will break even with a small buffer for unforeseen expenses.\nAdditional funds will go toward developing future products and exploring additional stretch goals.\nIf Nova Praxis is funded beyond the initial $10K we need to break even, we will give contributors additional free products based on how far we go.\n#1 ($15,000) - If we get to $15K, all PDFs or printed copies of the book will also come with a PDF of our first supplement, the GM's Companion, when it goes on sale.

He's well versed in the traditional ways. Now he has a story he wants to tell in a new way. A way built for the Internet and by the Internet. It's the story of Road.\nCLOUD TRIBE is about a young Marine trying to put his three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan in perspective. So, to talk to or at or with anybody out there who'll listen, he calls himself, Road, and uploads four short videos to the Internet. Pretty soon he has a small audience.\nThe night we meet Road, he's told this \"cloud tribe\" that he's driving around with four cameras rolling; one on the front of his car, one on the back, one on the dash, and one in his glasses - the only angles we'll ever see - \"broadcasting live.\" \nOf course, he has no idea what to expect. And as more and more viewers tune in, what happens runs the gamut from a road rage incident; to the theft of his car so that the thief can \"become\" Road; to a confrontation with a violent political group intent on using Road\u2019s live cameras to publicize its agenda. (Please take a look at the scripts for first two episodes.)\n\nBut Road's physical journey that night is not really all this project is about. It\u2019s also about a \"cloud\" full of possibilities, and the stories we've always needed to tell, and how we tell them. Starting with cave painting. Only now we can \"paint\" our stories on digital cave walls - computer screens, smart phones, tablets - and not only tell them to almost anybody, anywhere in the world, but also interact with whoever is out there watching.\nCLOUD TRIBE is not a TV show, or a movie shoe-horned onto the Internet. It's about, of, and for the Internet. A 100 minutes broken into fourteen, 6-8 minute, serialized, bite-size, web-i-sodes. Perfect for a quick look during a coffee or cigarette break, or on the bus, train, or subway, or at recess, or while you're waiting for the dentist, or your tofu, or your eggs and bacon.\nYeah, but why's it gonna cost $450,000...?!? Because to do this script we\u2019ll be paying SAG actors and stunt people, and police, and firemen, and we need to buy (and wreck) cars, and buy music rights, and pay for locations, and...Because we want to make this as good or better than anything you'd see on TV or at the movies. So, please take a look at the budget.  \nFinally, I've written and re-written this script more times than I care to admit, sometimes calling it, ROAD, and sometimes, CLOUD TRIBE. But I'd love your input. So the very first Reward is about voting for the name. Which do you prefer?\nIf this sounds like something you'd like to support, please join us.

This should make having Dungeon World at your local shop a much easier option. (We'd love to update the reward descriptions, but since some people have already chosen them we can't!)\nWhat Is Dungeon World?\nDungeon World is a fantasy roleplaying game about exploring dungeons, fighting monsters and looting treasure. In Dungeon World you and your friends take up the role of classic character classes and undertake exciting adventures together. Through your triumphs and travails the world changes around you.\nThe Dungeon World rules are simple and elegant. They exist to help you create unpredictable adventures and fluid action - to move from battles to exploration to moments of magic and mystery with ease. Dungeon World's rules all tell you when to use them: every rule comes into effect just when it's needed and stays out of the way the rest of the time.\nDungeon World emerged from our love of two things\u2014modern game design and old-school RPG action.  We wanted to create a game with the wide-eyed excitement and wonder of your first time playing a fantasy RPG and rules that draw on a long history of innovation and creativity. The best of both worlds!\nThe text of the game is complete and we're working with an editor to polish and perfect it right now. The text of Dungeon World is available under a creative commons license and will remain that way whether we meet our Kickstarter goal or not (we wanted to make sure that everyone got a chance to play Dungeon World).  \nIf the game is done and the rules are ready to go, what do we need your help with? We want to make Dungeon World the best game it can be, and to do that, we need your support. We'll offer the game to our contributors as a fully-featured PDF (with art, professional layout, hyperlinks and indexing) and, if you contribute at any level above the first, a softcover or hardcover version of the rules. As well, we've got a whole bunch of fun rewards at various tiers including t-shirts, pins, custom dice, and one-of-a-kind art from our artists.\nCommunity\nDungeon World was developed out in the open\u2014documentation and feedback has always been a huge priority for us. You can see the open development taking place here at our GitHub site. As a result of this model we've had over 250 playtesters over the two years that DW has been in development! Hundreds and hundreds of hours of gameplay have gone into the game. Here's a few nice things our players had to say\u2026\n\"Dungeon World is a slice of fried gold and I adore it!\"\n- Jason Morningstar, Designer: Fiasco\n\"Dungeon World is my go to game for a quick to setup one-shot fantasy adventure. Every game I've played of Dungeon World invokes the feeling of exploration, danger, and wonder that I had when I first started playing RPGs.\"\n- Jeremy Friesen, Adventurer's Guild Member\n\"Dungeon World is fun and innovative take on the oldest kind of roleplaying experiences. It's a wonderful blend of old and new that should make practically any gamer happy.\" \n- Monte Cook, Co-Designer: Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)\nEvery contributor will receive a copy of the game in PDF form, with all the bells and whistles. Additionally, we'll be providing PDF copies of two Kickstarter-only supplements: one filled with exciting new monsters and the other with compendium classes (special themed mini-classes you can use in your Dungeon World game). All contributor levels also include special DW wallpaper for your PC, Mac, or mobile device. Your name will appear in the Thanks chapter as a backer.\nLevels including the softcover version of the rules will receive a printed copy of the game rulebook. We're big fans of games as physical artifacts\u2014you can be sure we'll provide the best quality book we can put in your hands.\nContributors who choose a level including the hardcover reward will receive a limited edition premium signed copy of the game rules in hardcover. We're only planning one run of hardcovers, so get one while you can.\nIn Dungeon World, \"Bonds\" are what tie the characters together, forming their shared history and giving them relationships to build on even before play starts. A Bond might say \"Avon has trusted me with a secret.\" Contributors who choose a level including this reward will get to work with us to write their own Bonds with Dungeon World, to be included in the PDF and printed books.\nThis reward replaces \"Thanks\" and is included free-of-charge in all reward levels where it appears.\nBreak out the soda and clear off the old ping-pong table. This package is a trip back to the basement that includes two custom Dungeon World dice and a Dungeon World notebook and pen set for keeping track of who owes you gold pieces and where you hid that magic ring.\nLet all the other kids at DW High know how you roll with this backpack customization kit. Including a full set of eight Dungeon World Glyph pins and a special Kickstarter-only Dungeon World sew-on patch. You will be the coolest kid within 3d6 x 10\". \nAny contributor whose reward includes this level will receive a Dungeon World logo t-shirt in classic white-on-black style.\nIt may not give you an armor bonus, but you'll always take +1 forward to impress. We promise.\nThis reward entitles the contributor to work with us to design a \"Compendium Class\" for inclusion in the Backer Supplement. You give us a theme and we'll design some moves for you and distribute them to the whole DW Backer group when the game is released.\nHave a favorite beast, creature or abomination you want to see in Dungeon World? Contribute at a level including this reward and we'll work with you to create and stat out a monster (with description, statistics, and special moves) that will be included in the Backer Supplement once the game is released.\nLove the Bard? Admire the Ranger? Want to create a signature character of your own? With this contribution reward, you'll work with our character artist, Emily DeLisle to create a full-color digital portrait of a character of your own design in the style you see on the class pages in Dungeon World. You'll receive high-resolution print-ready images as well as custom character sheets with your character in them.\nWith this reward, you'll work with famed dungeon cartographer Tony Dowler to create a special dungeon map for use in your next Dungeon World game. We'll also create a Front to use with your map so that you can just throw it in to your game.

Conserve Ammo. And Never Cut a Deal With A Dragon.\nJordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world. \nCreated almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to. \nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\nThere are a couple of key ideas at the core of Shadowrun Returns.\nDeep, Interactive Stories \nWe intend to follow a braided anthology structure for our story. Jordan, his partner Mitch Gitelman and Mike Mulvihill, who led Shadowrun game development at FASA Corp. will craft and structure the meta-story, then supply key information for a group of writers to weave into their own short stories, which we'll then use as the basis for our missions. To ensure an authentic tone, we'll incorporate the storytelling skills of many Shadowrun authors and designers who've been carrying the flame over the last 23 years such as:\nMichael A. Stackpole\nMike Mulvihill\nTom Dowd\nMalik Toms\nMel Odom\nJason Hardy\nStephen Kenson\nThe result should be an overall narrative that is layered, textured, and satisfying. \nOne of the many innovations in Data East\u2019s Shadowrun Super Nintendo game was a unique conversation engine that opened up new avenues of conversation based upon information you learned through interactions with characters and objects. We intend on taking a similar path with a new twist or two.\nContextual Gameplay in Four Realities\nFour realities overlap in the world of Shadowrun (the Physical, the Digital, the Mystic, and the Astral) and associated character classes such as the Street Samurai, Hacker, Combat Mage, and Shaman, each have the ability to view and interact with the world in ways the others can\u2019t.\nHere are some ways that selecting each character type allows you to see the map from a different perspective:\nStreet Samurai see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.\nCombat Mages see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.\nHackers/Deckers see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.\nShaman see the \u201ctrue world\u201d that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other \u201cdead\u201d objects appear as mere shadows.\nMissions (aka \"Runs\") in Shadowrun Returns can require interaction with all four realities simultaneously, requiring you to use information learned from each character\u2019s perspective to coordinate their context-sensitive actions to get the job done. . . and survive.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to make Shadowrun Returns a turn-based game\u2014so we can offer you a wide range of context-based gameplay options from which to craft a your plan.\nThe Streets Tell a Million Stories\nOne of the things that we feel most strongly about is that the world of Shadowrun was created for all of us to tell stories within. That\u2019s one of the beautiful things about in-person tabletop role-playing\u2014the stories are extremely relevant to you and your friends because they were made by you and your friends.\nIn honor of that tradition, we plan to release our PC-based level editor when we release Shadowrun Returns so that everyone can create their own Shadowrun stories & \u201cruns\u201d. When you upload your stories, you can make them available to your Friends Only or the entire Shadowrun community. \nThe game we want to make is very humble by modern blockbuster game standards but it is still way beyond the ability of a small start-up to fund by itself. The restraints on the license from Microsoft made it impossible to get established publishers interested in Shadowrun and so it remained just a dream for a long time until Jordan saw the recent successes of some other veteran designers on Kickstarter.\nCrowd sourcing to fund creative content represents truly profound change to the status quo. While we watch financial models for the creation and distribution of creative content continue to erode, Kickstarter charts a direction for how fans can directly impact development of creative content they want by funding its creation.\nWe hope that Shadowrun Returns is a creative concept you want to help make into a reality and we thank your consideration and support.\nIt is strange to be required to license your own game in order to make a new version of it but that\u2019s what can happen when you\u2019re old and keep changing companies. Here's the fast-forward version:\nAnd so, our favorite game has come full circle and Jordan is again leading the development of a world he started oh, so many years ago.\nAnd for those of you that have been around since the very early days, we want to make sure that YOU understand that WE understand and that we'd love to see things like this (and more) in the game. \nAres Predators and Ruger Super Warhawks (yes, with smartlinks), Maglocks and Doc Wagons, datajacks and  credsticks, dermal plating and wired reflexes, \u201cchummer\u201d and \"drek\", Ares and Fuchi and Aztechnology (Oh my!). \nBut that's not all. \nMr. Johnson(s), Lofwyr  (can\u2019t leave him out can we?), gangers, toxic spirits, Renraku Arcology, The Sprawl, the Redmond Barrens & the Ork Underground (oh yes), UCAS, Tir Taingire and even the Sioux Nation, but most of all you WILL be saying (or is that screaming?). . . \u201cNever EVER Deal with a Dragon!\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter Now LIVE!", "update_content": "We\u2019re excited to let you know that the Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter has launched.

New nations and states have appeared in Northern Europe, struggling for their place in the sun. The new nations have abandoned the dead past and have embraced equality in a way our society hasn't. Racism and sexism are things of the past. \nThe nobles of Peimar, the traders of Kirkoslet and the despots of Han\u00f6 are all seeking fortune and power. The pirates of Bornholm seek to gain wealth by raiding merchant vessels and the Gotlanders try to keep control of their island when the great powers of the age start encroaching on their territory. It's The Age of Lions, and it means means that anyone is free to carve out their own destiny on land or at sea. It's an age of free women and men, an age where your birth and gender don't mean anything, having a strong swordarm or a cunning mind means a lot more. \nBeyond this struggle, mythical creatures and strange magic appears on the new frontier. What are the dark forests hiding and are you brave enough to find out?\nThe System\nLions of the North uses the No Maths Land system, where the goal is to just allow you to roll dice without having to do complicated math while you play. You roll ten-sided dice exclusively, and you see if you get dice with matching numbers, it's as simple as that. \nNML is a classless system where there are no character classes and no levels. characters instead have skills and traits which they can improve. NML also includes rules random character creation methods that allow you to create characters fast if you one evening want to play a quick game with your friends. \nIn addition the book will offer advice for exploring the different themes and possibilities in the game, from political intrigue to swashbuckling to horror, not forgetting advice on how to run the game for younger players. \nWhat does your pledge get you?\nOur goal is set at 9,000 dollars to cover layout, editing, proofreading, indexing and other production costs for Lions of the North. With 9,000 dollars, lead designer Jussi Marttila will probably see enough money to buy a pint and a sandwich at the pub.\nIf we get more than 15,000 dollars, our four artists, proofreaders and editors will get more money which will probably make them very happy. Our lead designer gets another pint at the pub. You, the pledgee, will get an extra scenario pdf.\nIf we get 25,000 dollars, we'll throw in an additional scenario for everyone who pledged. And everyone involved get paid a bit more, too. Our lead designer has clearly had enough so he doesn't get a third pint. \nWhen you pledge for Lions of the North, your pledge money is going to excellent art (which we will be showing off in updates, some is already on display), solid mechanics, and a deep and flavorful setting.\nAbout Us\nGoblinworks is a small startup web based RPG publisher based out of Washington.

THE KINDNESS OF OLD & NEW FRIENDS HAS BEEN AMAZING!\nWhy are people helping us get started?  Quotes from our donors:\nhttp://hypothes.is/docs/Donor-Quotes-Oct-2011.pdf\nhttp://hypothes.is/docs/Donor-Quotes-Nov-2011.pdf\nhttp://hypothes.is/docs/Donor-Quotes-Nov-12-2011.pdf\nOur website has more details:  http://Hypothes.is\nSolving the World\u2019s Biggest Challenge.  \nFrustrated by the media?  Disillusioned by our seeming inability to come to grips with difficult issues?  Us too.  We think improving the credibility of the information we encounter is key to solving this problem.  In fact, we think it's humanity\u2019s biggest challenge.\nImagine:\nIf as we encountered new information, in text or video, we could easily know the best analysis and insight on it\u2014sentence by sentence, passage by passage.\nWhat if we had confidence that this analysis truly represented the combined wisdom of the most informed individuals in those domains\u2014not as dictated by a top-down hierarchy, but as measured objectively, statistically and transparently over time.\nAnd what if the knowledge of that capability created a powerful incentive for authors to take extra care that their work met a high standard of excellence.\nWhat if it became more difficult to publish information that was factually incorrect?\nThese goals are achievable with today\u2019s technologies. Realizing them is the objective of Hypothes.is, a non-profit, open-source project led by Dan Whaley, the entrepreneur and coder who launched the online travel industry in 1995. It is advised by some of the leading minds in Internet technologies, rhetoric and language, reputation, identity and distributed systems. The Internet Archive (archive.org) has agreed to ensure long term storage of user content.\nExactly what is it?\nHypothes.is will be a distributed, open-source platform for the collaborative evaluation of information. It will enable sentence-level critique of written words combined with a sophisticated yet easy-to-use model of community peer-review. It will work wherever you are\u2014as an overlay on top of news, blogs, scientific articles, books, terms of service, ballot initiatives, legislation and regulations, software code and more\u2014without requiring participation of the underlying site.\nIt is based on a new draft standard for annotating digital documents currently being developed by the Open Annotation Collaboration, a consortium that includes the Internet Archive, NISO, O\u2019Reilly Books, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and a number of academic institutions.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe project until now has been self-funded, but in order to deliver a working prototype, we need to bring in funding to feed our developers and cover basic administrative costs.  $100,000 will allow us to get started. \nEvery dollar helps!  Since we plan to crowdsource peer-review in an open and transparent way, it only makes sense that we use Kickstarter to crowdsource our initial funding..\n100% tax-deductible!\nHypothes.is is a non-profit effort.  Your donation is 100% tax-deductible and may also qualify for matching funds from your employer if they support such a program for charitable contributions.  While we file for our own non-profit status, which can take 6-9 months, we have teamed up with a well-known 501.c3 fiscal sponsor, Planetwork (they helped fund early work around OpenID and other standards).  For any contributions you make you will receive a letter from Planetwork/Hypothes.is verifying that your contribution qualifies as tax-deductible.\nTimeline\nWe are in the middle of the design phase now and will begin coding after the successful completion of the Kickstarter project. We expect to deliver a prototype in early 2012 and will keep our launch community in the loop with a quarterly email newsletter.\nHow you can help:\n1.       Back us! \nPlease make a donation through Kickstarter by clicking the green button above. It's easy.  You need to have both a Kickstarter account, which you can create easily, and an Amazon.com account-- which most folks have already.  (Amazon Payments handles the backend credit card processing for Kickstarter.)\nIf you have any challenges, or need an alternate way to contribute, email us at donate@hypothes.is.\n2.       Reserve your username / handle now:\nReserve the username / handle of your choice, and let us know how we can periodically update you on the status of our project.\n3.

Join us!\nIf you are a world-class coder or designer, or just think your particular skills might be helpful to us, we\u2019d love to talk to you.

One of our many great donor quotes from this week:\n\n\u201cYou are tackling a pervasive problem that has been endemic to the internet, nearly since its inception\u2026. Every day, it becomes easier to produce and retrieve data. In the past (read as before the internet) the cost of disseminating your information, insight and opinions was costly enough to force a review process before it became generally available to the public. As the cost of dissemination begins to approximate zero, this review process, though never perfect, has completely disappeared. The rate of production and ease of accessing even extremely high quality knowledge has become so great that even well known, peer reviewed, science journals can't keep up and it has leaked into the public as raw, unfiltered, highly valuable, but nearly lost knowledge. In its current unqualified, unreviewed state, your average knowledge consumer lacks the ability to separate the wheat from the chaff. The current state of affairs needs, nay demands, the ability to qualitatively mark up information in a way that is universally accessible and that delivers expert analysis to the average end user. During the centuries of the renaissance, a single man could be an expert in nearly every field of human knowledge and as a result we changed the world. During the internet renaissance, one man will be able to tap into the expertise of nearly every field of human knowledge and there is no telling how we will reshape the world as a result. Hypothes.is is on the cutting edge of making the true internet renaissance possible and I am honored to be a part of helping that happen. Thank you for working to make the world a better place.\u201d - Sean Carley"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "The final weekend push. $82k!

I partly accept it for what it is. However, I think that since so many news sites are racing to tell an exciting story, true or false, and many sites are biased, some people, like me, take the articles with just a grain of salt. \u2026.
