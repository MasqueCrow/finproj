Designers are encouraged to collaborate, share and teach one another the tricks of their trade. \nPink Hot tub\nThe permanent location of DOH is 15 Acres of Gotlandic countryside. A mixture of limestone bedrock and dense juniper bushes. The site is a source of inspirations for the designers who attend the annual camp.\nStandard issue camp tents at night\nA CAMP SITE BUILT BY DESIGNERS \nAfter 5 years behind the beautiful Juniper bushes of the Swedish Island of Gotland Designers on Holiday (DOH) is preparing to welcome visitors to the site and host creative workshops, dinners, and movie nights. For the past 4 years, over a 2 week period annually, internationally acclaimed designers have been busy building DOH up into a sustainable campsite. So much love and attention has gone into the site and so many wonderful things have been produced, from cabins to hot tubs, shower towers to bread ovens.\nCabin no 3 on the move.\nDOH COMES OUT FROM BEHIND THE BUSHES \nNow it\u2019s time to open up the site to the public and invite visitors to stay in our cabins, attend workshops and lectures, and share the knowledge we have acquired over the years. In order to do this we are missing a nice toilet for guests to relieve themselves in. \nNew Toilet\nWe have the location chosen on site and we know that we want it to have a toilet, a sink and another seperate unit for a new shower. We will then hand it over to a team of designers to design and build the toilet onsite. Letting the location inform the design.\nNOT JUST A TOILET  \nOur minimum goal is to build a toilet and 3 new cabins, but our ambitions are even greater and for that reason we have a few STRETCH GOALS. Reaching these stretch goals will really accelerate the Designers on Holiday camp to greatness. Allowing us to build faster and more adventurous as well as really lay the foundation for the camp to live long into the future hosting environmental design conscious events.\nOUR GOALS \n\u00a35,000 - COMPOSTING TOILET AND 3 NEW CABINS\nEco friendly composting toilet set amongst the juniper bushes for campers and visitors of the Gotland site to relieve themselves in style and in comfort.\nEcco Toilet\n3 new sleeping cabins that can be moved around the site on the back of the trusty massy Furguson tractor. \nMicro cabins\n\u00a37,000 - COMPOSTING TOILET, 4 NEW CABINS  AND WELDING EQUIPMENT\nEco friendly composting toilet set amongst the juniper bushes for campers and visitors of the Gotland site to relieve themselves in style and in comfort.\n4 new sleeping cabins that can be moved around the site on the back of the trusty Massy Furguson tractor. \nA mig welder, bench and safety tools to allow the DOH reach the next level of construction. Currently we have to borrow a welder from southern Sweden and drive it all the way to the island.\nMIG welder\n\u00a310,000 - COMPOSTING TOILET, 4 NEW CABINS, WELDING EQUIPMENT AND A SITE OFFICE\nEco friendly composting toilet set amongst the juniper bushes for campers and visitors of the Gotland site to relieve themselves in style and in comfort.\n4 new sleeping cabins that can be moved around the site on the back of the trusty Massy Furguson tractor. \nA MIG welder, bench and safety tools \nA portable site office for CAD work, meetings and storage over the cold winter months.\nModular site office\nModular site office assembled\n REWARDS \nA thank you post card sent from Gotland\nAn official DOH pin badge\nPDF Instruction manual for a micro cabin\nPDF Instruction manual for a standard issue camp tent\nNatural dyed DOH T-shirt in XS,S,M,L,XL (EU SIZES)\nDOH enamel mug\nOne nights Bed and Breakfast during July 2018\nA celebration in your honour.

What do you think the camp needs?\nWHERE IS MY MONEY GOING?\nEach year the Designers on Holiday camp is run on a shoe string budget, but with that small amount of cash we have been able to build a lot. Once we have given all of our generous backers their rewards the rest of the money will go back into the site. With our minimum goal of building a toilet and 3 more micro cabins we will have everything we need to open the site up for visitors outside of the annual designers residency program. Once we have this minimum goal we will be able to welcome guests through out the summer months. If we meet our STRETCH goals we will be able to expand our capacity for guests and expand our capability for producing more amazing ecologically mind work on our unique site.\nMILESTONES\nAs soon as we receive the funds from Kickstart we will start ordering the materials needed to to fulfil all of our rewards whilst simultaneously ordering the necessary materials from local suppliers to complete the build projects.\nOnce on site we will collect the supplies needed to produce the rewards and produce them onsite. When they are already we will pop them in the post. \nBy then end of July 2018 we will have a fully functioning campsite ready to welcome camping guests, workshop and lecture attendees.\nDOH OUT IN THE WORLD\n\"Sweden\u2019s number one retreat for designers\" - ELLE DECOR\nDesign Milk\nCond\u00e9 Nast Traveler\nFast Company\nIt's Nice That\nMorewithless Magazine\nThis is Range\nThe Hinter Land\nThe Holborn\n Vice\nDesign Boom\nDis-up\nBLEND\\BUREAUX\nGRINDTV\nFALCON\nTHANK YOU SO SO MUCH\nThe Designers on Holiday has been a labour of love for Tom and Bobby over the last few years and we can't express enough how grateful we are for your support.

It's incredible.From all of us at IDEO.org, a huge thank you! \n\nWe hope you will continue to share the Travel Pack with your family, friends, and community! Every share on Facebook or Twitter makes such a difference.\nDESIGN KIT TRAVEL PACK\nIDEO.org is a nonprofit design organization on a mission to improve the lives of people living in poverty.\nAs designers, we believe any problem can be solved with the right mix of empathy, creativity, and experimentation, and we\u2019ve used that recipe countless times over the past six years to design products and services that have reached more than 5 million people\u2014from low-cost solar lanterns in Kenya to teen-friendly health clinics in Nigeria.\nNow we want to put our design tools in the hands of problem-solvers everywhere, and we need your help. Building on the success of our Design Kit learning platform, we\u2019re creating the Travel Pack\u2014a brand new set of bite-sized design exercises to help anyone solve big challenges.\nWHAT IS IT?\nThe Design Kit Travel Pack is a deck of 32 cards containing bite-sized design exercises you (or your team) can use to unleash your inner creative genius.\nGathered from our years of experience designing solutions to some of the world\u2019s toughest challenges, the exercises in the Travel Pack are divided into three sections designed to help you get inspired, take creative risks, and test your ideas in the real world, no matter what you\u2019re working on.\nYou can use these exercises to: \nGain a deep understanding of the needs and experiences of whoever you're designing for \nSet big, bold goals for your project \nLearn the best way to collaborate with a new team \nExpand your thinking beyond the usual solutions \nTest and iterate on your solution based on real feedback\nLast but not least, we\u2019re calling it the Travel Pack because these exercises can be mixed and matched to suit any situation from New York City to Nairobi\u2014whether you\u2019re looking to kick off a team meeting with a dash of collaboration or embark on a month-long design process.\nWHY WAS IT CREATED?\nWe\u2019ve been teaching human-centered design to social good organizations for years, and we\u2019ve heard over and over again how challenging it can be to incorporate the tools of design into day-to-day work. In speaking with our nonprofit partners and the Design Kit community over the past year, it became clear people needed tools and exercises that would fit into their busy lives.\nHere is some of what we heard:\n\u201cIt's difficult to use some of the [current] tools during workshops. I need to lead teams through a 4-6 hour workshop with tools that will generate actionable outcomes.\u201d \n\u201cI wish Design Kit had more practical activities for prototyping and to challenge the way people empathise.\u201d\n\u201cI wish Design Kit had more examples of how to apply the tools to practical examples. Issues you may run into and how to get past them.\u201d\nWHO IS IT FOR?\nThe Design Kit Travel Pack is for anyone interested in learning, practicing, or experimenting with human-centered design. Whether you are a student, a designer, or work in social impact, you can keep these exercises handy for whenever your projects need a boost of empathy, creativity or experimentation.\nWHAT YOUR PLEDGE MEANS\nIDEO.org is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that applies design to poverty\u2019s most pressing challenges. In six short years, we have worked across the globe and reached millions of people through the solutions we\u2019ve designed.\nYour donation will help bring Design Kit Travel Pack to life, while also supporting IDEO.org to continue improving the lives of people living in poverty by designing things like low-cost solar lanterns, teen-friendly health clinics, a platform to improve refugee services, or a mobile app that helps low-income families afford health insurance.\nMORE REWARDS\n3 pins from The Good Pin Club (Each 1\" tall)\nPack and Pin Bundle\nGive One, Get One\nLearn HCD Toolkit\nDesigner's Travel Toolkit, includes Scout Books and Blackwing Pencils\nOne Week in Residence at IDEO.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen Design Kit Travel Pack is fully funded we don't anticipate too many challenges.

Has it been awhile?     \nGetting past small talk to a certain level of depth in our everyday interactions can be hard, and it\u2019s increasingly rare to meaningfully connect...even with those we see most.  After hosting over 50 conversation-focused dinners and team building events, we\u2019ve learned that a specific question-focused methodology invites great conversation and brings people together to learn and connect.\nPrinted Prototype of Convers(ate) Contents\n In each box you'll find:   \n28 Conversation Cards: Compelling topics that are universally relate-able (like Gratitude, Impermanence, Leadership, Nature and Friendship). \n300+ Questions: Each card has an icebreaker and a set of 10 expertly crafted questions that range from philosophical, like \u201cIs wanderlust something we're all born with?\u201d to experiential, like \u201cWhen did you first fall in love? What was it like?\u201d The last question on each card is future-looking + designed to inspire action.\nInstruction booklet: Fun variations for play, including a Jeffersonian Dinner inspired version, an \"Adventure\" version, a \"Spiked\" version, and more.  \nPocket Guide for Facilitators: Our best tips for how to ask great questions and create a dynamic conversation. \nTakeaway Cards: For each player to capture personal \"lightbulb\" moments from their experience.\nThe product is printed on heavyweight paper, so that it lasts and can easily travel with you. The set comes in a custom box that you'd be happy to display on your coffee table. We plan to share an update of the box design shortly after launch!\nUpdate: With some of our Kickstarter funding we were able to hire a graphic designer to help us polish Convers(ate)'s designs, including the box. Here's a sneak peek of what's to come! \nSneak peek of Convers(ate) Box design\n  Behind the fun is a methodology backed by history and scientific research.\nConvers(ate) is inspired by the concept of a Jeffersonian Dinner, in which individuals gather around a dinner table for conversation about an important topic of the day. Guests share perspectives on the topic at hand, listen and learn from one another -- one speaker at a time.\nResearch clearly demonstrates the impact that this kind of learning and connection has on our mental + physical health and general well-being. People everywhere crave authentic and meaningful interactions, but aren't always sure where to start.\nFriends using Convers(ate) at a Dinner Party\n  Convers(ate) is already a proven concept with real impact. \nCreators Taylor and Mollie met by chance in 2007. Their brief but meaningful conversation led to a long friendship. Over the past decade, across industries and continents, they\u2019ve explored the ideas of storytelling, authenticity and connection in their personal and professional lives. \nMollie + Taylor have hosted over 50 conversation-focused dinner parties and team building events, for 500+ participants around the world. That\u2019s 120+ hours of meaningful conversation, over which they\u2019ve honed Convers(ate)'s methodology and developed tried and true recommendations for people everywhere to host great conversations.\nPeople genuinely connect with each other when playing Convers(ate).\nSome have said that Convers(ate) gave them a chance to learn things about friends or family that they never knew. Others arrive as strangers and leave as friends.\nWhat will your takeaway be?\n  Great conversation unfolds with Convers(ate)\nConvers(ate) Featured by Listen Money Matters, BK Reader, Colgate University and Eat Society\n What You're Supporting \nBy joining this campaign, you are also joining the movement to #bringbackconversation. Whether you like good old-fashioned dinner table talk, or you're excited to use Convers(ate) to more deeply connect with friends and family who live far away by playing over the phone or video chat, you are part of a movement to learn and connect through conversation.\nJoining also means that you are a part of the creation of Convers(ate). We would love to hear your ideas for new topics. If we exceed our funding goal, one of your suggestions may appear in your Convers(ate) set!\nThe funds raised on Kickstarter will go towards completing an initial production batch, including packaging, printing, licensing, shipping from the manufacturer, and start-up costs. A successful campaign will allow us to truly launch this product and later bring to retailers across the country. The graph below shows the breakdown of costs:\nA breakout of how the Kickstarter funds will be used.\n  Our Stretch Goal and a Holiday Conversation Card are at the Finish Line!\n  Thank you \nConvers(ate) was created with love to invite more depth of connection among friends, family members, team members and even new acquaintances through meaningful conversation.

As we take the next step toward a physical product, we envision an easy to read, durable, and visually pleasing set of cards with packaging to match. Doing this requires working closely with our chosen printer, packager and distribution partners to ensure that the physical product meets the highest standards. Our goal is to deliver a great product that you\u2019ll use for years to come.\n\nThe largest risk factor to our project is timing. Delays. We are working toward shipment in time for the December holiday season, but the process of proofing and coordination may take longer, so we have identified a ship date of late December.

In it, he kindly asks the recipient to answer a broad question that traces back to the medium on which it was sent.\n\u201cWhat's worth preserving?\u201d\nResponses poured in. Each was more interesting and profound than the previous, expressing its author's heartfelt, authentic and captivating thoughts through their handwriting. While the individual letters are fascinating, the sum of the portfolio is greater than its parts.\nIn an era of constant distractions, the process of writing a letter by hand serves as a reminder to breathe, and to be in the moment. Writing an answer to a thoughtful question promotes reflection. Unexpectedly, the project also produced other rewards like a discussion with John Massey on astrological philosophy, an original piece of art from Debbie Millman, and a one-year supply of strawberry preserves from Matthew Hoffman.\nFor more, check out WBEZ's Morning Shift, WGN Radio's The Download with Justin Kaufmann, Columbia Chronicle's \"Design Museum launches book Kickstarter\" and The Oregonian's \"5 things Tanner Woodford knows for sure about design.\"\n     Every Sunday morning, Woodford sends a scanned response to members of ChiDM in a private newsletter. The letters are then transcribed and archived on a password-protected, members-only website. In addition to a one-year membership to ChiDM, backers at the $100 level will receive full access to the online archive, and an original, rare and collectible press sheet from the book's production. (This members-only content series is continuing in 2018 with a weekly campaign that contains the oldest objects in Chicagoland's vast collections.)\nOther rewards include: Digital PDF ($10), Book ($40) and ChiDM Membership ($100).\n Largely centered in Chicago, responses came from across disciplines and borders.

Responses are being actively solicited while we continue editing the publication.)\nPeople who have answered \"What's worth preserving?\" in their handwriting so far.\n The first response came from Dave Eggers of McSweeney\u2019s and 826 Valencia, who suggested \"it's worth preserving the knowledge that good design comes from good designers (not robots)\" on a custom, hand-drawn letterhead.\nDave Eggers is the Founder of McSweeney\u2019s and 826 Valencia.\n  Later, President Elissa Tenny, the 15th executive and first woman to lead the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, shared thoughts on \"the pursuit of the question.\" All Kickstarter backers will receive this complete note (and others) in project updates.\nElissa Tenny is President of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n   Bestselling author Seth Godin sent a giant novelty post-it note with a short list on it that included both \"lemons\" and \"giving a damn/making a ruckus.\"\nSeth Godin is the author of 18 bestsellers.\n Proceeds from sales of this book support ChiDM, a 501c3 non-profit organization that strengthens design culture and builds community.

Once I became an event planner, I realized that other women of color also struggled with the lack of options for their children. So, I decided to create party supplies that celebrate our beautiful brown babies!\n  Having a daughter has taught me so many things. The most important lesson that I've learned is that I am her first and most influential teacher. She mimics everything that I do. Everything! As a result, I have made a conscience decision to be a positive frame of reference for her. Like all children, young girls are looking for where they fit in, because they want to belong. Its human nature.\n  Over time, they develop an idea of themselves based on what or who they associate themselves with. This shapes their identity and impacts their self-esteem. That\u2019s why it is so important to constantly give them positive images that they can relate to. Our party supplies are tools that will be used to help develop a self-image of value and love.\n  I chose a mermaid as our first design because I have been unable to find a brown-skinned mermaid anywhere. When I began designing our Mermaid Collection, it was very important to me that her skin be chocolate brown. I also wanted her to have full lips, beautiful brown eyes and big hair. Her costume was created in shades of purple because it symbolizes prosperity and royalty in Africa.\n  I want my daughter, and every brown little girl on this planet to feel beautiful, acknowledged and loved each time they look at our party products and see themselves smiling back.\nWe are so grateful for your love and support. Please share our story with your family, friends and on social media. Collectively, we will empower children of color all over the world. This is more than party supplies, it\u2019s a movement!\nHANDMADE CROCHET DOLL\nAdwoa Design created a beautiful handmade doll inspired by our Mermaid Collection.

The mermaid design is complete, and all of the samples have been received and approved. I am very excited to work with manufacturers that have decades of experience creating party supplies. Their pride in craftsmanship can be seen in the high quality products that they make. The manufacturers are also equipped to print mass orders and prepare them for distribution.\n\nThe only potential delay would be getting on the print schedule. A deposit must be paid in order to be placed on the schedule, then printing will be executed 30 days from the payment date. I maintain an open line of communication with the manufacturer and will continue to do so during this campaign.

He spent a year illustrating the Handbook, and Sustainable Data. Lee isn't camera shy.\nFollow Lee on Instagram/leejohnphillips.\nADVANCED PRAISE FOR THE HANDBOOK\n\u201cThis remarkable book is so detailed, well-organized and intellectually exotic that I could easily make Jan Chipchase the action hero of a science fiction novel. It would be a suave Patrick Leigh Fermor travelogue, where a cosmopolitan guy of well-nigh supernatural insight unravels cultural riddles in the world\u2019s oddest by-ways\u2026 oh well, don\u2019t get me started.\"\u2014Bruce Sterling, Sci-Fi Writer\n\"TFSH is a book about respecting the world and engendering curiosity. A curiosity to go deeper into cultures, cities, communities. And to do so respectfully, with an awareness of how and why the machinery of society works as it does. TFSH teaches you how to be a global citizen of the highest order.\" \u2014Craig Mod, Designer, Author\n\"Whether you are a novice or experienced, in-house or consulting, Jan provides an inspiring and actionable framework to figure out what users need and how this translates to design. For anyone designing for an international audience.\"\u2014Raphael Grignani, Design @ Facebook\n\"I had the pleasure of working with Jan for several years at frog. He has an intense curiosity, a love of people and culture, and a thirst for knowledge everywhere he goes. He has translated all of that into a replicable framework in The Field Study Handbook. His unique style has allowed him to transcend borders. A skill truly needed today.\u201d \u2014Doreen Lorenzo Exec Director, Center for Integrated Design, University of Texas\n\"Jan goes to the places we are too-often afraid to visit, talks to the people we don\u2019t always see, and asks the kind of questions that most of us had long forgot to ask.\"\u2014Mark Rolston, Argo Design, ex-Chief Creative Officer, frog\n\"When I think of Jan's work (and that of the teams he has led) I think of a very specific form of fearlessness. That doesn't ignore risk (far from it) but minimises missed opportunity or insight by being rigorously prepared and attuned to context. I also think of a fearlessness of communication - an emphasis on the raw and the human - in order to build a platform for understanding and invention across cultures.\"\u2014Matt Jones, Design Director, Google Research and Machine Intelligence.\n\"Through Jan's example, collaboration and support, I've honed my approaches, tightened up my ability to call my own bullshit, and learned how to find flow in the hustle. The work is hard, and not everyone is cut out for it; but fieldwork with him makes long days feel like days spent the way they ought to be, and the act of tackling tough challenges feel instantly corollary to personal and professional growth. I was leading teams and fieldwork before working with Jan; Now I do so differently.\" \u2014Lauren Serota, Designer\n\"I suspect this massive heavy-duty tome will become the canonical classic reference for cross-cultural research. The crisp design and typography shine in timeless elegance.\"\u2014Kevin Kelly, Author, The Inevitable\nTHANKS\nTo Lee John Phillips for committing to this project long before we knew what it really entailed. For informing and inspiring this process Keiko Mori, Ben Barry, Kevin Kelly, Craig Mod, Dan Rubin and Frank Chimero. See also the comprehensive acknowledgements in the Handbook.

Once we're funded we'll complete the logistics. We expect the books to be shipped out in June. Perfect reading for your summer travels.\n\nFIELD / YOSHINO & FIELD / SICHUAN\n- Minimal risk -\nMake sure you have a valid passport and the necessary visas.\n\nKASHMIR TRAVEL FOLIO\n- Minimal risk -\nProduction quality prototypes are complete, the materials are ordered and the lead-in times are accounted for. I've have a close relationship with our California factory that makes our SDR Traveller field equipment.\n\nFIELD STUDY TEMPLATE KIT\n- Minimal risk -\nThe digital templates are on track to be proofed by end May, and will be available ready for download in late June.\n\nFIELD METHODS WORKSHOP\n- Minimal risk - \nIt's a matter of coordinating on dates to schedule training for your organisation. To be delivered within a year of the Kickstarter closing.\n\nBORDERLANDS FIELD EXPEDITION\n- Low risk to happen, moderate risk when you're there- \nPart of the enjoyment of these kinds of expeditions is that they expose the traveller to uncertainty, from closed border crossings, being hustled for bribes at checkpoints to helping locals deal with emergencies. I've been doing this kind of travel for many years\u2014reading the situation, understanding and mitigating risks as they arise (there's also a chapter on managing these kinds of risks in the Handbook). \n\nPortions of the Pamir Highway lie above 4,500m, and the journey includes an appropriate time spent acclimatising. We'll have a sturdy 4WD, a Russian speaking guide, and the right attitude to overcome obstacles to make the most of the journey. You should be reasonably fit. Due to the altitude, not suitable for pregnant women.\n\nA SHORT WALK IN THE HINDU KUSH\n- Low risk to happen, moderate to high risk when you're there -\nThere are perceived and actual risks associated with travel to Afghanistan. How you frame, process and mitigate these risks is an integral part of the reward.\n\nWe can coordinate on the best time to travel. The most likely route-in to the Wakham Corridor is through the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border crossing near Khorog, that is sometimes shut at short notice due to increased Taliban activity. Being at high altitude, the weather can impact the route and day-to-day progress. It is generally considered a low-risk region in Afghanistan, though of course, risk is relative. Risk assessment is carried out prior to and during travel, based on recent events, and reports from my contacts on the ground, and the journey is adjusted as required. I will have the final say on whether to proceed, based on current conditions. (The Field Study Handbook includes a section on the psychology of travelling and working in higher risk environments, which I suggest you read prior to departure.) For all that you might imagine can go wrong, the bigger risk lies looking back on a life half-lived.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "Digital Pack + Backer Updates", "descp": "A collection of five beautiful desktop wallpapers based on the illustrations of Lee John Phillips, and a PDF of Sustainable Data, a little book with a big idea: that there's a better way to source and apply data.

After centuries of increase, population growth has begun to slow and is trending toward equilibrium. \nThis change is accompanied by an equally significant change in human values \u2014 a shift from those based on unlimited availability of resources, unremitting growth, excess, independence, competition and short-term thinking to those based on limits, equilibrium, balance, interdependence, cooperation and long-term thinking. This momentous transition is the source of the far-reaching tension and conflict.\nThe way through this difficult era is to understand its basis and to focus on new values that will be of the greatest benefit both to individuals and humankind. There is an urgency, however, and failure to adapt will result in disaster both for humanity and for the planet as a whole.\nA New Reality delivers a message of both caution and hope. Readers across the social and political spectrum will find it a reasoned and balanced counterpoint to current social and political trends. It's elegant design and long-range perspective will appeal to general readers, policy makers, millennials, baby boomers, teachers, and students, filling a need for a work of positivity and wisdom in otherwise bleak times. \nHere are some sample spreads from the book:\nIn the book, the sigmoid curve is used as a \u201cthinking tool\u201d and as a symbol. Its shape reflects a pattern that applies to growth in living systems and reflects the transformational character of change in our time.\n  The book puts human population growth in context with other living systems where similar populations trends can be observed.\n   The global population story is rich and exciting, and we have done our best to bring a compelling graphic language to the data.\n  One of the most valuable lessons from the book is the huge imbalance in population between more developed countries (left) and the less developed countries (right).\n  The conceptual core of the book is separating the sigmoid into two periods \u2014 one of acceleration and one of deceleration \u2014 and the realization that this represents a shift not only in population growth, but also in values, attitudes, and behaviors.\nThe Reissue\nA New Reality is completely revised, rewritten, and redesigned. All the work is done - research, copy editing, layout, and design. The current version is beautiful, powerful, and clear in its message. We already have a small run of preview copies that will be available to early Kickstarter backers before publication.\nProject Goal #1 Get this book into the world. Once the book is published, we will need to promote it so that it reaches the largest possible audience. \nProject Goal #2  Build out our website. This will include production of a longer animated video and full web design. In this way, we will create a platform online where anyone can access these ideas.\nProject Goal #3 Once we achieve goals 1 & 2, we have plans to bring this message to educational settings. We've already been in discussions with one university about hosting an interdisciplinary conference to address population, values, and the future of our species. We're also interested in creating a teaching guide to bring this message to younger learners.\nJonas Salk\nIn the early 1950's Jonas Salk led the team that developed the first effective vaccine against polio. That achievement was a huge step toward eliminating a dreaded disease that crippled and killed children around the world. It also resulted in his being regarded as a kind of folk hero and a benefactor of humankind. \nIn the last third of his life, he devoted considerable time and energy to the development of an evolutionary philosophy that he hoped would be the basis for finding solutions to the basic problems of humankind. A New Reality is part of that vision. \nThe Story Behind the Story: a Personal Account\n1950's: My father loved to write. As a child, I remember him, often in a chair or in bed, with a legal pad in his lap, writing in his distinctive script and working out his thoughts and theories. \n1960's: He had a realization. Looking at human population growth which was expanding seemingly without limit, he realized that it would likely slow and assume the shape of an S-shaped or sigmoid curve.\n1973: My father published a book called The Survival of the Wisest in which he presented the idea of the curve along with the concept of Epoch A and Epoch B. \n1970's: Several years later, he was asked by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) to write a short book relating United Nations projections of population trends to the concepts of the epochal change he had described in his earlier book. \nLoving graphs and simple, minimal design, he assembled what he called a \"pictographic essay\" \u2014 a page of short text opposite a figure or graph. \n1981: The manuscript sat unfinished for several years. I joined him to help with the project. This resulted in World Population and Human Values: A New Reality, which was published in 1981. It received little attention. In retrospect, it was decades before its time. \n1995: My father used the ideas and images in his lectures, but after he died in 1995, few people knew of this work. Over the years, however, as I watched many of the things we had predicted come to pass, I often thought about the diagrams and concepts in the book and related them to current trends and events. \nThere things sat for nearly twenty years.\n2014: Out of the blue, I received a call from David Dewane, a young architect and designer. He had come across the book, felt that it spoke to him and his generation and wanted to know if I would be interested in updating, redesigning, and republishing the work. I said yes. \nPLAY\n\nWe then embarked on a journey. We revised the data, rewrote sections, assembled a small team, and engaged a wonderful designer, Courtney Garvin, who transformed that simple text and diagrams into a work of clarity and of beauty. \nWith your participation, we have a chance to write the next chapters in the story. Please join us and take part in this exciting venture. \nProject Credits\nJonas Salk: Though not physically present, my father has been central to this effort. He developed the first effective polio vaccine. He went on to found the Salk Institute.

Twenty-six years later, I wrote The Deep Sky.  To describe its content, it\u2019s easier for me to talk about the questions at play; what is meaning and how do we find it and construct it?  How does romantic and sexual love create meaning and what is the effect of its end on who we believe ourselves to be?  What is otherness, and how does it inform a sense of who we are in relation to it \u2014 how does the other expand or contract our understanding of who we are and our value in a greater world?\nThe Deep Sky is deeply personal, but not at all autobiographical.  It is the embodiment of ideas that I find at the core of who I am and who I strive to be.  I hope that I am able to create a work that raises my personal questions for my audience.

She has appeared in dozens of German daytime and primetime TV shows, like the highly popular crime series \u201cTatort\u201d, \u201cPolizeiruf 110\u201d, and \u201cSoko Leipzig\u201c. In 2003 she received \u201cDer Deutsche Fernsehpreis\u201d (The German Television Award) as best upcoming actress for her role in the TV feature \u201cK\u00f6nigskinder\u201d. Internationally, Luise Helm played in the Australian daytime TV show \u201cOutriders\u201d alongside Abbie Cornish. She also appeared in several movies, the best known being the teen comedy \u201cHarte Jungs\u201d (\u201cAnts in the Pants\u201d).\nKelechi Nwadibia : Arlan\nAstute at a very young age, Kelechi had an epiphany-like realization that in everyday life is where most acting takes place. Life and perspective would change when he took to the stage and felt the real, true, and vulnerable feeling that comes with performing. It was in those moments that he fell in love with the craft of acting and performing arts. In every performance he gives, he hopes to share his passion and a piece of himself that in real, everyday life, he is at times unable to share.\nSarah Rose Butler : Lenora\nSarah Rose is a locally grown and sustainable source of Bay Area snark. Trained in theater and cutting her teeth on corporate and commercial work, she has starred in the independent films \u201cRefuge,\u201d and \u201cArt School of Horrors\u201d, in addition to roles in other independent projects. Besides acting, Sarah Rose also models. As a model she has appeared in campaigns for Levi's, Dolby, Adobe, Cisco, and eBay.\n \nclockwise from top 1. Kelechi Nwadibia and Sarah Rose Butler, 2.

Alex Zjicek slates a scene.\nIn The Deep Sky Lenora teaches Nina how to fold an origami crane. It is a touching moment of connection between two women reaching for an understanding of their shared experience. Later, Lenora and Arlan use origami cranes as a symbolic release of the complex deep emotion that is experienced by the young couple.\nTraditionally, it was believed that if one folded 1000 origami cranes, one's wish would come true. It has also become a symbol of hope and healing during challenging times. As a result, it has become popular to fold 1000 cranes (in Japanese, called \u201csenbazu.\"\nCommunity support is vital to the success of independent film.

We are Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo, co-founders of Timbuktu Labs. Nice to meet you!\nThis picture was taken in Milan, at the end of 2011. In those days, we were packing our belongings to fly to California and try to build a company. Elena had been working as a journalist and Francesca as a stage director and playwright. Working late nights and weekends, we had just built the first iPad magazine for children in the world, Timbuktu Magazine.\nTimbuktu Magazine won lots of awards and was featured in so many amazing publications! \nFast forward to 2016, we have 12 mobile apps in the Apple App Store, we published 6 paper books in English, French and Italian and we built a toolkit that allows underserved communities to design and build playable spaces in collaboration with the NFL, Kaboom, Zynga.org and the YMCA.\nBecause we are girls. Our entrepreneurial journey made us understand how important it is for girls to grow up surrounded by female role models. It helps them to be more confident and set bigger goals. We realized that 95% of the books and TV shows we grew up with, lacked girls in prominent positions. We did some research and discovered that this didn't change much over the past 20 years, so we decided to do something about it.\nBut, by any means, read these stories to your sons! It is crucial that they learn to identify and empathize also with female heroes! The stories in the book are a great source of inspiration for anyone, male or female, child or adult.\nWe need your help to print the first 1,000 copies, get an ISBN, hire an editor, pay the artists.

It was the spring of 2014 and I had recently traveled to a monastery in the high desert of New Mexico to escape the prose of religion and embrace the pure poetry of spirituality. The brothers and I were in the midst of observing 40 days of silence during the Lenten season when Father Andrew approached me with a Scottish Gaelic dictionary. He opened to a crowded page and motioned to a single word. I followed his finger and saw my name: Dane. My eyes widened with wonder, but it was the word\u2019s definition that caused them to fill with joyful tears. It read: poem. He then pointed up to me and broke his vow of silence to mutter, \"That's you! Your name is poem.\"\nTHE GUY NAMED POEM, GET TO KNOW HIM\nHi there. I'm Dane Johnson and I'm a freelance writer, musician, and explorer based in Northern California. \nAs a freelance writer, I've contributed to companies and causes ranging from education startup to community building to creative agency.\nAs a lyricist, I've been fortunate enough to write and record three album's worth of music with my band The Music Room. \nAs a poet, my heart and mind work together to interpret the wonders of our world through writing. My favorite themes to write about involve spirituality, mystery, and chasing down curiosity as if living a meaningful life depends on it.\nThis book means a lot to me. Though definitely not the final chapter, it feels likes the completion of one. \nI would be utterly delighted if you found some delight in them. \nDON'T JUDGE THIS BOOK BY ITS COVER, HAVE A LOOK INSIDE:  \nThe poems selected for Rambles were written over the course of a 200-day writing challenge, which saw me create nearly 200 poems. After the challenge was over, a small team of writers and editors helped select the most inspired writings. Here are the titles of their selections: \nWHOSE HANDWRITING IS THAT? \nNot mine. All titles throughout the book, as well as the lovely cover title artistry, were hand-lettered by Ali Nelson.\nMEET THE CONTRIBUTORS:\nThis book provided a rallying point for us to collaborate on a project that endorses an ethos of exploration and creativity integral to each one of our lives.

We want to bring Groupmuse to your city. \nGroupwhat? Classical house party what now?\nWe are a new organization solving an ancient problem: how do we bring meaning to our lives? We think part of the answer is sharing great music with great people. We believe in classical music. We believe that it can reach across centuries of space and time and grab us by by the hearts and by the throats: that it can shock us, charm us, inspire us. We don\u2019t think the music we love so much deserves to be isolated in an ivory tower and reserved for the enjoyment of experts.\nThis music is ours. It belongs to all of us, and all of us deserve to enjoy it. Share the great masterpieces of music with old and new friends \u2014 in your living room and throughout your city. Because art is better with your friends. Because music can\u2019t hear itself. Because we need to feel together. Because we all need to be alive.\nOur Story\nGroupmuse is the social network turned social movement, a phenomenon that with almost no funding and a staff of six has created over 1,000 house concerts worldwide and raised more than $300,000 for young musicians. \nGroupmuse\u2019s origins can be traced back to the Allston apartment of pianist Cristian Budu, in 2010. There, musicians from New England Conservatory would gather for chamber music house parties that would rattle the rafters with the sweet sounds of Brahms late into the night. Groupmuse founder Sam Bodkin was lucky enough to be invited to these concerts, refined the idea while working for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and put on the first groupmuse in January of 2013. Every week, the Groupmuse platform brings hundreds of new listeners to classical music.\nSo If You're So Damn Successful, Why Do You Need My Money?\nOur traction is very strong and the response to Groupmuse has been overwhelming, but if we take cash from a typical startup investor, there will be a lot of pressure to grow revenue at all costs, and that pressure was going to be coming from places outside of our community from people who don\u2019t actually go to groupmuses and don\u2019t fully appreciate how miraculous what we\u2019ve created really is.\nWe\u2019re committed to our mission and our community above all other things, and that\u2019s not the way to raise capital these days.\nWe don\u2019t want quarterly pressures to bevel and genericize this strange and marvelous movement that has brought so much depth and beauty and warmth and connection into people\u2019s lives. We want to stay bizarre; we want people to continue to regard this odd idea with some initial skepticism, and we want them to all, one by one, come to a groupmuse, and be blown away by the power of the experience and by the sincerity and optimism of its ambitions.\nBut we do need capital. Groupmuse has become too big and too important for us to continue to do it justice with our shoestring budget and our skeleton staff. We want a world covered in groupmuses. We want an international community of people who believe in the power of this great art and who give up their living rooms for a night to share a moment of humanity with their friends and neighbors. We want summer Groupmuse festivals. We want warm homes where you can find shining faces and profound masterworks in any city you might be passing through.\nWe don\u2019t just want to change the way communities interact with art \u2013 we want to change the way communities interact with themselves. It might sound too good to be true, but it already is true. With practically no resources, we\u2019ve put on 1,000 groupmuses in less than three years. We have tens of thousands of users. We\u2019ve raised more than $300,000 for young players. We\u2019ve gathered crowds of hundreds of millennials dancing like pagans to live performances of Stravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring. We\u2019ve had crowds of new listeners demanding an encore of a Bach Fugue under the implied threat of mob violence.\nWe all want to live in a world where something as wonderful as Groupmuse can survive, but we\u2019ve got to create that world.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe make house parties in random cities and homes!

After seeing William hand make the most incredible leather shoes he'd ever seen, Patrick asked: What\u2019s the problem with this picture?\nHere's William who can hand make a designer quality shoe yet struggles to provide for his family. At the same time, the fashion industry is the largest and most profitable it\u2019s ever been---AND the most unjust for the producers working in it, with the last few years even being the deadliest in history.\nMany of us know that producers like William in the fashion industry are facing some major ethical challenges, and of course we want to do something about it.\nWe also face a challenge as consumers. Let\u2019s be honest, most of the products on the market that are ethically produced, just aren\u2019t cool. Yes, we want to make a difference, but do we have to sacrifice our own style in order to do so?\nAt Nisolo, we believe that you can have both ethical products AND great style. That\u2019s why we value the design and quality of our products just as much as we value the people who make them.\nWATCH OUR SHOEMAKING PROCESS\nRESULTS\nOur production team in Peru is composed of men and women who have generations of experience creating beautiful, quality leather goods. By connecting Peruvian talent to the global marketplace, we are able to implement a twofold solution: provide consistent work & fair wages for our shoemakers + equip them with the ability to make better decisions for their household. Results to date include:\nConsistent employment - 200 livelihoods supported by Nisolo\nFair wages \u2013 161% average income increase from working with Nisolo, leading to tangible results such as improved living conditions, and inaugural access to education (including university level) and savings\nSkills Training Program \u2013 the opportunity to learn new skills within the shoemaking process\nCapacity Building Training Program \u2013 weekly educational courses around topics such as basic financial planning, teamwork, conflict management, etc.\nSavings Program - through the Nisolo savings program, our producers have the ability to save in a safe manner and be educated on the importance of saving within a vulnerable economy\nBenefits & Health Care - all of our producers are offered free healthcare, a pension fund, paid vacation, and normal working hours\nWHY WE CARE\nThe fashion industry currently employs over 100 million people in the developing world alone, and it\u2019s growing. However, the industry is growing in search of cheap labor to create cheap products, prioritizing final margins first and labor costs last. The lack of transparency in today\u2019s fashion industry has created a disconnect between producers and consumers, allowing this practice to perpetuate with the rise of fast fashion. At the end of the day, garment workers pay the price for the fashion industry's poor practices.\nNisolo means not alone. Our social impact is founded on the belief that as consumers and producers, our small choices create a big impact somewhere else, and that gives us immense power and potential to change the industry for the better. As a producer, Nisolo acknowledges that providing fair compensation for one\u2019s work is an essential human right that gives way to many other basic human rights. As a team, brand and culture, we not only take responsibility for respecting and protecting human rights throughout our supply chain, but we believe that doing so is good for business and good for the world.\nKENYA\nThrough a new member of our team, Travis Gravette, who has been working in East Africa for the last ten years, we were introduced to Raymond and his team who have been making jewelry for almost 20 years.\nOur relationship with our artisans goes beyond just design and creation of a great product. We also work to help them better organize and manage their businesses to be optimized for growth. These small companies are a vital part of lifting families out of poverty and we are committed to seeing them succeed. \nWe pay our artisans a fair price up front for their work. We also provide them interest free loans that can be paid back over time through purchase orders.

The world's most comfortable, versatile and technologically advanced bra. \nWe\u2019ve reinvented the bra, and designed it with the active woman in mind. With eight wearable options in one, the evolution bra was designed to adapt to the rigors of your busiest days, seamlessly transitioning between work, play, and whatever else you\u2019re up to. Using the latest in performance fabric technology and patented bonded construction that moulds to your unique shape, we have created the most comfortable bra that you will love to wear. The only problem? You might never want to take it off.\nWe wear tested the bra on over 70 women of different cup sizes to create the sizing chart below. We are also happy to provide online fit consultations to make sure you pick your perfect size. The evolution bra's patented design moulds to your unique shape making it better, wear after wear. To see the bra on women of all different sizes click here. \nOur Story: \nKnix Wear is an active intimates brand that came about when we noticed that women\u2019s intimates had way too much frill and not enough function. And that women everywhere were being underserved by their underwear. We wanted to create an intimate apparel brand that was designed by women for women.\nWe launched our original line of high tech women\u2019s underwear (leak proof, absorbent and anti odor) two and a half years ago through a successful crowdfunding campaign. Since then, we\u2019ve become the leader in performance underwear for women, redefining the women's underwear market. Known for our seamless design, moisture wicking and odor killing technology we have sold over 100,000 pairs of underwear to women from over 35 countries. Re-inventing the bra was the logical next step...but like our underwear, it couldn't just be good, it had to be GREAT. \nFor us, the difference is in the details, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve scoured the globe to find the best possible fabrics and finishes, had hundreds of women wear test our products to get the fit just right and spent two years developing our proprietary technology.\nOur Mission: \nKnix Wear merges performance, technology and design to knix the bad and make the good better. We are driven by the belief that active can be attractive, comfortable can be cute, and functional can be fashionable. Our mission is simple: to create the best active intimates on the planet that empowers you to do more of what you love.\nTesting:\nWe have been wear testing our bras for the past 10 months. Over that time we have had over 70 women of all different cup sizes put our bras through the rigours of their daily lives. From yoga, pilates, hiking, treking, cycling, riding, surfing, swimming, sleeping and working this bra has been up to the task - keeping you fresh, dry, comfortable and confident. Every test led to the final prototype we present you with today that we feel confident you will love. \nProduction:\nWe have production lined up and ready to go, but as a relatively new brand we need to guarantee certain production minimums. That is where you come in. By taking part in this campaign you will help us fund our first production run..and be the first to get your hands on the Evolution Bra. We cannot wait to bring this product to market and thank you for your support.\nUnderwear:\nWe are pleased to offer our award winning performance underwear as part of our perks. Available in a variety of colours, fabrics and sizes (XS-2XL) and with your choice of gusset technology.\nHeadbands:\nOur moisture wicking headbands feature our built in patented Fresh Fix Technology panel that absorbs sweat and keeps it off your face. The sleek bonded design means it can be worn on it's own or under any helmet. \nSpecial thanks:\nMaderas Village and the amazing women that work there for hosting our photoshoot and to @loosecannon @nikkodetranquilli @nikkibrand and @reallykindofamazing for the photos\nThe 70+ women that leant us their time, feedback and their busts to help create this bra - we cannot thank you enough!\nAttest Media for the video production\nGet Your Project Funded Today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy crowdfunding: \nKnix Wear is a company that was born from listening and there is no better way to listen than to involve our customers in the development process. While we have made tremendous strides as a company, launching into bras is a big step and comes with substantial order minimums. This campaign will provide the much needed capital to fund our first production run. We also firmly believe that this is our best product yet and we want to share it with the world.\n\nRisks and Challenges:\nHaving produced underwear for the past two years we are confident in our ability to deliver an outstanding product on time. We have worked with all of our partners before and have set aside time for production and fulfilment. We have also gone through multiple prototypes and testing on the bra and feel confident that the product we are presenting to you is one you will love. \n\nThe biggest potential challenge comes down to sizing and ensuring our customers select the right size. We have wear tested the product over 70 women of all different cup sizes. We will be providing online consultations with a fit specialist to help guide customers. If you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, we want to make it right. Simply let us know what happened and we will happily exchange the bra for a different size, free of charge (shipping charges apply for international orders). \n\nThe truth about the bra is that it gets better with wear and moulds to your body.

Each project pushed me to learn about the world and myself in new ways, but more importantly, the idea sparked a community of people interested in learning to risk and risking to learn.\nThe project culminated with a book, a TEDx talk and the start of a new type of school called Experience Institute, where students design a 12-month education through three 90-day apprenticeships/projects in their field of study, coupled with mentoring and quarterly group projects.\nThe first groups of students who've designed their education with these methods have grown professionally and personally, and have launched into their next steps with greater confidence and clarity. \nThe Ei Leap Kit is a distillation of the approach Experience Institute students take to design learning experiences that shape their lives.\nExperience Institute students who've helped us build this kit include: Muffadal Saylawala, Sustainable Design | April Soetarman, Experiential Design | Carisa Leal, Social Entrepreneurship | Joe Burgum, Organizational Strategy | Dane Johnson, Writing | Jonathan Lazatin, Engineering and Design Education (video above) | Lance Henderstein, Writing and Content Creation | Stephanie Kang, Organizational Design | Chevy Williams, User Research | Melanie Kahl, Design Strategy  Zak Tracy, Social Entrepreneurship | Nicole McCabe, Digital Storytelling | Toph Carter, Communications and Design | Olenka Hand, Experience Design & Hospitality  \nNow, Experience Institute is guiding its largest cohort ever (called EXP3) through a year of apprenticeships and projects and is using the prototype version of the Ei Leap Kit as a primary curriculum tool. \nThese individuals hail from all around the world and have diverse dreams driving them to take leaps that will enrich their lives and lead them into work opportunities that align with their passions. As they engage new challenges, and learn more about themselves, they've continued to offer feedback to make the kit even more relevant to those on the brink of something great \u2013 people like yourself.     \nThe Folio\nIndiana Jones had his satchel, Beethoven had his notebook, Marty McFly his skateboard, and Picasso his paints. For Leapers, we teamed up with the power product design duo, Strand Design, to create a beautiful folio made of recycled bonded leather to help you travel with your kit. We\u2019re working to make this as bold and resilient as you.\nThe Map\nAs much as we like digital tools, there's nothing better than having a large piece of paper to lay out your plans. The Leap Map will become the central place for designing your Leap. You can complete this with others, post it in your living or work space, or easily travel with it to revisit it often.\nThe Field Guide & Journal\nCoaching Cards\nWe won't lie. You're probably going to get stuck or lose steam at some point. Don't worry. The Coaching Cards are ideas and activities curated from leading authors, artists, entrepreneurs, and educators. Use them as quick tips to get unstuck when you\u2019re on the move, or as a way to guide conversation when meeting with a friend or mentor.\nLeap Kit's Online Course\nThis course augments the physical kit by including activities, videos, and curated articles to guide you and your team through different points in your Leap. It also offers a way to interact with other Leapers and share ideas and newfound tips along the way. \n Updated on 10/16 with two new levels!\nAll of this will be ready and shipped by March of 2016!\nLast Spring, our friends at Stanford's d.school invited us to run experiments with the Leap Kit alongside students at Stanford's Palo Alto, Paris, and Berlin campuses. At that point, the kit was nothing more than printer paper and a yellow envelope; but their feedback was vital in helping us think about these tools outside of Ei Students. We learned more than we imagined and are beyond grateful to the d.school team and the students who participated in those experiments!\nWe believe everyone is on the brink of something great. \nEducation is oftentimes the space where we stand at those edges, learning about the world, ourselves, and how we'll work to make things better. We hope these first 1,000 Leap Kits give people of all ages and backgrounds access to a new way to learn \u2013 one that increases every persons' confidence, empathy, and impact. As the idea spreads, so will the width and breadth of leaps. And, with every leap, we'll see what happens when people take learning and growth into their own hands. In our wildest dreams, this will grow from a Kickstarter page into a celebrated way to learn for anyone, anywhere, at any season of life. But, it will take hundreds, maybe thousands of leaps. \nSeriously. Thank you for being here. The past few years have been an incredible journey \u2013 one we could never have imagined. This work is remarkably meaningful and the people involved never cease to blow us away with their kindness, generosity and work ethic. Someday, we hope to have all of you in the same room. Until then, these projects and products are a way to find, connect, and support you...wherever you are. So, keep leaping, and know that we're right behind you.\nSincerely,\nVictor & the Ei Team\nSpecial Thanks:\nNick Martin: Video\nBill Burdett: Music\nGrip Design: Graphics\nStrand Design: Folio Samples\nEi Students & Alum: Late nights.

It has been downloaded more than 117,000 times since December 2012, and earned several awards for its intuitive design. More importantly, it helped thousands of people understand the power of open data. \n\nWhile we love Sitegeist, and we love that all of our tools are free for anyone to use, they aren\u2019t free to create or maintain. \n\nAs a nonprofit we have limited resources and have had to make difficult decisions about allocating our resources.

While we aren\u2019t able to include development of a brand new Android app in this effort, the existing app will benefit from much of the work we do as a result of this campaign. Specifically, the existing app will:\nshow the updated data, including Census and other sources. \nuse the new responsive visualization panes. \nshow any new data sources and visualizations that are on existing panes.\nSo what will the existing Android app miss out on? Only entirely new data screens and a refreshed UI that matches modern Android design standards.

This Kickstarter is raising funds to cover the closing costs and part of the redesign of the space.\nOne Group Mind is an improv comedy organization that offers training and performance opportunities to professional improvisers in Chicago and operates the Titanic Players, which provides free comedy education to collegiate improvisers at five major universities in the Midwest.  Together, the two organizations have existed for 20 years, won awards, and have had alumni continue successful careers on such shows as The Office, Saturday Night Live, Community, Arrested Development, the Jimmy Kimmel Show, and the Mindy Project, to name just a few.\nOne Group Mind is a membership-based organization attempting to bring improvisers together in order to leverage the size of our community in order to forward our careers.  We negotiate discounts and obtain benefits on behalf of our members in an effort to reduce the costs of studying improvisation.\nWe focus on team and time for good training.  It is our belief that any team constructed, if given consistency of cast and training, can become a great team.  Only with great teams can we elevate improvisation from a hobby to a professional art.  Our teams are left for up to 4 years with the same original cast at the time of audition.  \nWe can benefit greatly with your help:\nFinancial Security.  For 20 years, the Titanic Players and One Group Mind have survived with volunteer financial considerations and contributions of time from its members, friends, and family.  By purchasing and owning our own building, our expenses will be considerably less, allowing us to not only survive, but thrive. With our savings, we can support One Group Mind and The Titanic Players as well as offer additional services like a robust membership discount program, promotional support for our teams, sound and video editing equipment, resources to forward careers, the Titanic Winter Tour, and much, much more.  Once the building has been paid for, estimated at 7 years on our current trajectory, we will one of the first institutions to offer compensation to long form improvisers.\nPermanency.  We need a permanent home.  One Group Mind has had to move 7 times in its history, and one event had us closed for 7 years.  The permanency will not only be a boon for our members, who will no longer have to deal with location changes, but also for our marketing efforts, the hallmark of which is consistency of locale.  We will also be able to design the exterior and interior of the space to suit our specific needs.\nArtistic Home.  Alongside establishing a home for our own brand of comedy, One Group Mind is planning to expand our slate of performances, presenting shows 7 nights a week while adding sketch (both filmed and theatrical), stand-up, and music to our offerings.  We also plan to engage the neighborhood through participation in philanthropy, street festivals and other community outreach endeavors.\nCommunal Home. Our planned design of the space has a performance space and rehearsal rooms, but also a self-serve bar and lounge for our guests and a den/hangout space for our members.  It is our hope that this purchase and build out creates an atmosphere of community for those in the immediate neighborhood and for those improvisers and friends who are, or have been, a part of our organization.  \nCareer Services. Our long term redesign also includes plans to provide a green screen for filming, recording equipment for members podcasts or voiceover reels, a projection screen to show member films and sketches, and a resource center that includes a computer lab.\nAlumni Benefits. Since the space will be our own, we plan to use it to trace and record the organization's history from 1994 until today and highlight the members who helped shepherd the organization throughout the years.  The planned space also includes a residential area that could be used to house any visiting alumni traveling through The Windy City (or Titanic Player team!)\nOnce the property is secured, we will update the Kickstarter with details on location, site plans, pictures, et al.

We successfully reached our goal thanks to nearly 2,500 backers.  \nOur sock is now for sale on our website here.\nTwo years ago we were looking for a pair of socks that were warm enough for a hike on the coldest days of winter, but comfortable enough to wear to work. We also wanted socks with a timeless look that were made in America. The wool socks that grandma got us for Christmas were great, but we felt like there had to be something better out there.\nThe answer is the American Bison. Their inner coat is made up of a short, soft fiber that is warmer than wool and softer than cashmere. Blended with a combination of US Merino wool, spandex, and nylon we have created a classic and comfortable sock that will keep your feet warm and dry all winter long. \nJoin us on the journey and help us create The Ultimate American Sock.\nOur rewards are simple and straightforward and we have one goal: To get you wearing the most comfortable, unique, and American sock ever - supporting multiple American industries along the way.\nWe reached our goal within the first 36 hours! And this means all our Early Backer socks were snapped up within hours. Due to popular demand we've added several new reward levels that will still allow you to give the gift of The Ultimate American Sock this holiday season.  \nOur Christmas Gift Packs include a recycled paper notebook with a vintage Bison print, a tuft of raw bison down, and a gift card with a picture and details about the sock(s) you are gifting them. The Christmas Pack will ship in time for Christmas. The socks will ship by March. \nPlease note, in order to make the Christmas Packs affordable and to get them to backers before the holiday, we are restricting these to ship within the USA (all other levels can ship internationally).  \nSTRETCH GOAL REACHED: We have now reached the volume necessary to add both Navy Blue and Brick Red as a color options. To be eligible for the new colors, you must back at least 3 pairs of socks. You can choose from 1 pair of each color, 3 of the same color, or any other combination of at least 3 pairs. After the project is complete you will be able to choose your colors. For more details see our update.\nLast year we set out to explore what it takes to make something in America. And what we learned was that many of the products made in this country are not necessarily made of US materials. Fueled by this realization, we set our sights on creating an everyday wearable item that was not only made in the US, but made of the most authentic American ingredients we could find. \nOur search led us to an animal unique to our country: The American Bison (scientific name Bison bison. Also commonly referred to as the American Buffalo). \nNot only are Bison unique to North America, but at roughly 2,000 pounds they are the largest land mammal to roam the continent. They are often considered the most majestic and fiercest animal in the country\u2019s national parks and preserves. Yet despite their importance to the landscape and people, American Bison were nearly hunted to extinction by 1890, at which time there were fewer than 800 left surviving. Luckily, the story did not end there. Protected by legislation, conservationists, and breeding programs of privatized ranchers \u2013 the Bison population is now near 500,000 and they are no longer an endangered or threatened species.\nBison are not just a uniquely American story, their inner-coat is a soft and insulating fiber with many properties more advanced than the world\u2019s best wool. This \u201cdown\u201d coat is one of the reasons Bison have been able to survive in extreme climates of both hot and cold for millennia. \nCompared to wool, bison down is warmer, better for moisture control, more durable and easier to care for. The major challenges of using bison down are it\u2019s short staple (length of fiber) and exorbitant cost - some of the reasons why you don\u2019t see it used more often.\nDespite the challenges, we have spent the last year developing the yarn and have now created a sock that is technically sound, commercially viable, and fully made in America. We have put together a supply chain of ranchers out west, yarn spinners in the east, and a sock knitter in the Midwest to deliver a high quality sock that is responsibly made and durable. \nWhen bought in small volume, one pound of Bison down can cost as much as $300 because each animal only produces approximately 4-6 ounces of usable fiber per year. The short length of the fiber also presents a major challenge for spinning sock yarns. It wasn\u2019t until we blended it with American merino wool (which has a long staple) that we were able to create a yarn stable enough to knit into socks. \nThe two major factors in creating a good sock yarn are Staple Length and Micron Count. \nOnce our yarns have been spun they are carefully knit into a sock that we engineered with one of the top sock knitters in the United States. With a flat toe seam, reinforced heel, and padding for support, the Ultimate American Sock is built for comfort and durability. \n The final composition of the Ultimate American Sock is the result of thoughtful research and planning and results in a sock that is warm, technical, and incredibly durable. \nThe final product comes packaged in a box made in Wisconsin. The story of the sock and its journey through America is an integral part of the package's design. \nThis box is too cool to get rid of, so we are hoping you will find another use for it.  But if you do decide to throw it away, be sure to toss it in your compost - this box is certified biodegradable and compostable.\nThe Ultimate American Sock comes in two sizes. The fit and sizes are unisex. Reference the below chart for what size you would wear.\nThese socks are incredibly easy to care for. Due to their antimicrobial properties, feel free to wear them a few times before washing. But when they do need to be cleaned, simply machine wash warm, inside out. Then tumble dry with low heat. No need to bleach, iron or dry clean the Ultimate American Sock! \nMy name is Brian and we are United By Blue. We\u2019re based in Philadelphia and have been making and selling responsible, durable goods for nearly five years now. Using natural and sustainable fibers we make everything from shirts and bags to socks. And for every product that we sell, we remove one pound of trash from our nation\u2019s oceans and waterways through company organized and hosted cleanups (116 cleanups and 203,510 lbs of trash and counting).  \nUnited By Blue is a certified B Corporation. B Corps are certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.\nWe\u2019ve engineered a brand new product with a supply chain we put together through months of research. As a new product, we are uncertain of the demand for it. In order to make The Ultimate American Sock commercially viable we need to buy hundreds of pounds of Bison fiber, but this will cost us upwards of $15,000 - a big risk unless we have a reason for all the Bison fiber. \nThis is why we have turned to you and Kickstarter. With your support we can help redefine American made. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a team in place and have experience developing products and taking them to market at United By Blue.

The cart supports lessons across disciplines, moves easily between classrooms, and works outside in the garden or playground.\nInspired in part by the chuck wagons of the American pioneers, each Charlie Cart is designed to bring mobile nutrition education to the next generation.\nHow it started\nFor the past 15 years, Carolyn Federman has been helping build garden programs with the Edible Schoolyard Project, and teaching kids to cook. During this time, school gardens have gone mainstream, and hands-on education has proven highly effective in combating the epidemic of diabetes and childhood obesity. Yet Carolyn realized that cooking in schools is often too difficult and expensive for mainstream adoption. \"Most schools don't have kitchens that teachers and students can use. So to teach cooking, food educators must cobble together hot plates and plastic bins and whatever we can get our hands on. I started thinking that there's GOT to be a better way.\" \nCarolyn asked Brian Dougherty to help her design that better way. Brian is founder of Celery Design. He sees design as a tool for enabling sustainability and promoting large scale social change. \"What intrigued me at first was the scale of Carolyn's dream \u2013 to give a whole generation of kids direct experience with healthy food.\"\nSince then, the team has assembled an incredible panel of expert advisors, developed and refined design solutions, and built relationships with partner organizations. \nThe first prototype, fresh off the production line.\nWe've built a prototype cart, tested it out, and refined the design. We're setting up a pilot program at public schools in California, where we'll test efficacy and refine the lesson plans. A team from the  Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future is designing a set of tools that will help us evaluate and learn from pilot program. \nTesting the first prototype. It works!\nThe kit includes all the gear an educator needs to get started.\nBreville, and OXO have helped to make the pilot possible by generously donating high-quality equipment. Now we need your help to actually build the second-generation carts for the pilot program, and prepare for a nationwide launch in 2015. \nWhat Will This Campaign Fund?\nFunding from this campaign will support our pilot program, helping us to test the cart, lessons and training in real-world classrooms. We need to build the second-generation carts, develop lesson plans, develop training and document and evaluate the program. These are foundational, one time costs.\nOur goal is to deliver a very high-quality program at the lowest possible cost for schools. The design is modeled after a mobile AV cart, so a single kit can serve many classrooms at a school. Once we scale up production in 2015, we expect the Charlie Cart Project toolkit and training program to start at approximately $6,000 - $8,000 per cart. We expect to drive down the cost in future years as quantities increase and as we develop partnerships with outside funders.\nRewards\n$25 - MAGNET We\u2019ll send you the cutest ever Charlie Cart Project refrigerator magnet.\n$50 - TEA TOWEL We\u2019ll help liven up your kitchen with a spankin' new Charlie Cart dish towel.\n$75 - APRON We\u2019ll spice up your cooking attire with a lovely Charlie Cart Project apron. \n $100 - T-SHIRT We'll help you get in touch with your inner beauty with this Charlie Cart Project t-shirt.\n$300 - MARKET BAG We\u2019ll get you fully outfitted with a Charlie Cart Project emblazoned market bag, filled with a t-shirt, a tea towel, apron, and magnet (and a big virtual hug).\n$500 - GIFT BASKET We\u2019ll assemble a Charlie Cart Project Artisanal Gift Basket with our friends at Good Eggs, so you're stocked with pantry items and ready to impress at any moment.\n $1,000 - EARLY 'BIRD' SPECIAL Be the first to donate $1,000, and we'll give thanks with Carolyn's Thanksgiving turkey recipe and an heirloom turkey from BN Ranch for your Thanksgiving feast!

It's also the evolution of the HCD Toolkit, a fantastic resource that has been purchased or downloaded 141,000 times.  \nAt IDEO.org, we address the world\u2019s toughest problems, and we routinely come up with innovative solutions in sectors like sexual and reproductive health, water and sanitation, and financial opportunity thanks to human-centered design. \nBut we're only a few dozen people in San Francisco. And though we wish we could solve all of the world's biggest challenges, we know that the only way to get there is to get nonprofits, social enterprises, foundations, social entrepreneurs, and well, everyone really, solving problems like designers. \nWe\u2019ve built a number of tools to spread and share human-centered design. Design Kit is our online platform which currently has 58,000 members; our online Course for Human-Centered Design has seen 40,000 people register from 148 countries over the past two years; and the HCD Toolkit has been downloaded over 141,000 times.\nBut there are places that the Internet just doesn\u2019t go. And there are times out in the field, when your best friend is a good book. The Field Guide is just that friend, an ally in design and a key to help design a world without poverty.\nThe Field Guide includes step-by-step instruction on how to implement over 50 of the design methods that we at IDEO.org use every day. In addition, you\u2019ll understand the key mindsets of human-centered design, read compelling case studies of our process in action, and have all the worksheets and tools you\u2019ll need to put it into practice. \n Human-centered design is an amazingly generative process, and one that starts with people and ends with surprising answers tailor-made to suit their needs. We use it to directly learn from the communities we're looking to serve, to rapidly come up with innovative new concepts, to quickly prototype them, and then to make our ideas come to life.\nPLAY\n\nAnd with the Field Guide we'll be able to get our approach to everyone all over the world. It won't matter if you have an Internet connection because the Field Guide has everything you need to understand the people you're designing for, to have more effective brainstorms, to prototype your ideas, and to ultimately arrive at more creative solutions. \nThanks so much for your support!\nIDEO.org ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen the Field Guide to Human-Centered Design is fully funded we don't anticipate too many challenges.

For Radiotopia - and all of radio - to be the best it can be, we need to find even more people who are not currently on our radar.\nSo we have a big idea. At $600,000, Radiotopia will create a pilot development fund to find new, talented producers and hosts. We will specifically seek out new voices to pilot programs that tackle subjects not well covered in traditional public media.\nQuality will always be our first criteria. I believe diversity of people and perspectives is the key component to quality that\u2019s too often neglected in media.\nWe are interested in producers who pilot their own program, as well as contribute stories to existing Radiotopia shows.\nBringing in new voices and broadening the audience are critical steps in remaking public radio. Our collective of shows is already proving that incredible talent exists in unexpected places, and that we have a knack for finding it.\nIf you believe in this mission, kick in another buck or two, or just spread the word.\n***The Hover 20,000 Backer Challenge***\nWe did it!

Look what we did together!\n\"[A] kind of Justice League for smart documentarians and sound artists.\"\n--Bill McKibben\nThis is Radiotopia. I'm Roman Mars.\nRadiotopia became a reality in November 2013, when I called on the backers of the last 99% Invisible campaign to fund \"a new kind of public radio.\" Radio full of the most compelling stories imaginable, made by a group of talented creators combining their energies to grow their audiences and thrive. \nPeople - probably many of you - rallied beyond our wildest dreams. It was an awe-inspiring moment, the realization that the heart of a radio fan can grow to make room for many deserving shows. Together with PRX, we\u2019ve taken that love, trust, and money to bring together a collective of the best storytelling shows on the planet.\n99% Invisible\nFugitive Waves\nLove + Radio\nRadio Diaries\nStrangers\nTheory of Everything\nThe Truth\nThese shows make you laugh, cry, cringe, remember, reflect, strive, despair, relax... everything. \nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, as members of Radiotopia, they are reimagining radio from broadcast to digital, and the life of a creator from starving to sustainable. Radiotopia is bringing a listener-first, creator-driven ethos to public radio.\nIn just a few months, we have built a true collective of indie producers who share editorial, business, and emotional resources. It\u2019s not just an amazing group of podcasts, it\u2019s an amazing group of people. And we\u2019re getting somewhere:\nThe Radiotopia Network has increased downloads by 165% since our launch nine months ago.\nTwo shows have more than quadrupled their audience.\n99% Invisible, which had the biggest audience to begin with, has grown by 135%.\nThe dream is alive, but our work here is far from done. \nTo take it to the next level, we need you. Podcasts need about 50,000 downloads per episode for some measure of financial sustainability. Radiotopia wants our existing shows to blow through that number. That takes more gear, more staff, more travel, more branding and promotion. Our shows are not just two people chatting in front of microphone (not that there's anything wrong with that - I love a lot of those shows); they are skillfully crafted, sound-rich productions. That commitment to craft requires a lot of time and resources.\nYour Kickstarter pledge will support all the shows in Radiotopia and ensure that all of us will continue to produce our best work.\nWe also want to invite more shows into Radiotopia. A win-win-win for us, for deserving creators, and for you, our fans and listeners. Your support will make that happen.\n The Rewards\nRadiotopia Ringtones\nAll the shows in Radiotopia are contributing to a set of awesome and awesomely weird ringtones/alert tones.

By incorporating digital principles into an actual, hand-held notebook, the Bullet Journal offers the flexibility of a blank page with the clarity and structure of a digital system.\nBulletjournal.com was launched just over a year ago to make this system freely available to all. It\u2019s since been featured on Lifehack.org, Lifehacker.com, and Fast Company.

Everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative projects that are brought to life through the direct support of others.\nThousands of creative projects are funding on Kickstarter at any given moment. Each project is independently created and crafted by the person behind it. The filmmakers, musicians, artists, and designers you see on Kickstarter have complete control and responsibility over their projects. They spend weeks building their project pages, shooting their videos, and brainstorming what rewards to offer backers. When they're ready, creators launch their project and share it with their community.\nEvery project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. If people like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing.\nBacking a project is more than just giving someone money, it's supporting their dream to create something that they want to see exist in the world.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWebsite:\nThe development of the new site will be collaborative with the backers. Locking down the first set of features for the new bulletjournal.com is the initial goal; based on the number of features, we can then establish a timeline. Sometimes certain features prove more difficult or time consuming than anticipated, which may impact the delivery. In this case, we will choose to either roll out promised features at a later date, or push back the launch. \n\nJournal:\nThe journals are being fabricated by a third party. In the case these journals will not be delivered on time, backers will be notified. \nThe NEW \"unlimited\" edition will be produced and ship after the limited edition.

It\u2019s dirty, it\u2019s loud, it\u2019s filled with fascinating/kind/talkative/insane/drunk people, and perhaps most importantly, it gets you where you need to go in a moderately predictable amount of time. I truly love the L, and I'm sure many of you do, too.\nBut we could make it even better.\nSo today, in the spirit of Daniel Burnham, I am proud to announce a new great plan for the city of Chicago: I want to buy ad space in 100 CTA train cars, so that I can legally put ridiculous stuff up in 100 CTA train cars, and make our commutes more fun.\nWith our ads, we will be able to inject a little silliness, fun and absurdity into the everyday lives of hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans. And backers will get to vote on the potential ad copy, so you will have a voice in choosing what goes up in the L cars.\nSome potential campaigns include: \nFacts About Squirrels - Ads alerting the public to \"facts\" about squirrels. (Example 1: \"FACT: You can't prove that squirrels aren't all plotting to sneak into our bedrooms and tickle us in our sleep. #SquirrelTruth.\" Example 2: \"FACT: Statistically speaking, at least one 'person' on this train is actually 7 squirrels dressed up in human clothing. Can you spot him/her? #SquirrelTruth.\")\n...Vanessa? - Ads from someone pleading to \"Vanessa\" to take him back. (Example 1: \"Vanessa, I'm not allergic to dogs anymore! Please come back.\" Example 2: \"Vanessa, please take me back. I wear button down shirts now. It\u2019s a good look for me, I think.\")\nRandom Pictures of Goats - Ads featuring just pictures of goats, because goats are awesome/hilarious.\nWhatever campaign we decide upon, the resulting ads will be silly, fun, and ridiculous. Let me know which one you like best!\nThe average weekly ridership on CTA trains is almost 4 million. Four million! Imagine how much more interesting we could make those rides\u2014how many commuters\u2019 days we could brighten, how many tourists we could confuse, how many awkward dates we could lend a source of conversation.\nOur lives are perpetually overrun with advertisements. Marketing has permeated nearly every aspect of our culture\u2014seriously, try to come up with a part of your daily routine that doesn\u2019t involve branding\u2014and so it\u2019s no surprise the CTA relies heavily on ad revenues to provide Chicagoans with affordable transit. We can\u2019t stop this advertising onslaught, but we can take back just a tiny little bit of what we see\u2014and make it super ridiculous and dumb.\nWe Can Do This!\nI\u2019ve contacted the company that manages advertising contracts for the CTA, and I\u2019ve confirmed that it is feasible for us to pull this off.\nIf we raise a little over $4,000, I should be able to purchase ad space in 100 CTA train cars. That's enough to reach one in four Red Line cars (the busiest line on the CTA.) If we are lucky enough to exceed our goal, I'll get more ads in as many more cars as we can afford. The more ads we can buy, the more people we can reach.\nSo let's do this! Let's make the world a little sillier, and our train rides a little more fun. Thank you!!!\n(Modified project image by (vincent desjardins), via Flickr)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are some risks and challenges that go along with this project. The CTA has ultimate veto power over all ads that appear in its trains, so it could keep us from pursuing some of the ad copy we would ideally like to include.

They had to sell something.\nThinking creatively and inspired by the exposed wooden skeleton of their mid-renovation new digs, they opened The Pirate Store, which to date sells any necessary equipment for the seafaring brigand\u2014everything from peg leg oil to monkey leashes, from eye patches to Scurvy-Be-Gone.\n826Valencia's Pirate Store\nTheir capitalist tomfoolery backfired, in a way; and in a way it succeeded beyond their dreams\u2014because The Pirate Store turned out to be the best possible support system for their bustling, budding tutoring center. Not only does its sales provide considerable financial support to the organization\u2019s operations budget, but kids are excited to go there. Who wouldn\u2019t want to go to a pirate store? Suddenly, tutoring isn\u2019t such a bad thing\u2014not if the environment is fun. And the imagination is already unlocked and ready to whirr after moving through this mind-boggling, otherworldly environment. \nAnd adults love it too; through the now eight chapters with ten individual tutoring centers and storefronts across the country, thousands of volunteers have been recruited and hundreds of community partnerships built via the walk-in, imagination-sparking wonder of their oddball worlds\u2014time travelers, robots, superheroes, space travelers, bigfoot researchers, un-naturalist explorers, and\u2014in Chicago\u2014spies.  \nIt's never too early to start training operatives!\nPUTTING THE \u2018front\u2019 in STOREFRONT, but uncovering the UNDERCOVER\nAfter seven years hiding under the guise of \u201cThe Boring Store\u201d it\u2019s time to confess. We are spies; and we aim to outfit secret agents from far and wide from our new headquarters in Wicker Park\u2014just one block away from the old address. We\u2019re older, we\u2019re wiser, and we\u2019ve got a new lease on a life of secrecy. And now it\u2019s time to build a brand new spy shop, one that best engages a growing community of allies in its efforts at espionage\u2014and that best initiates those spies to the secret mission of our nonprofit writing center. \nThis project will help build the store\u2019s role not only within the burgeoning community of international operatives, but within our organization itself by better engaging our families, better educating our students, and better welcoming newcomers whether as volunteers, community partners, or donors. \nWe\u2019re building the store as an epic interactive installation in order to expand our programmatic arm into the public sphere, giving anyone walking in off the street access to a creative experience. Not only will people be welcomed into interaction with our students\u2019 writing, they\u2019ll be able to write themselves, and share their writing with our students through a variety of new conduits and channels. We\u2019ll also be able to reach hundreds and thousands more children than we can see in a year of programming by building a wealth of interactive elements that teach aspects of the world of espionage in a hands-on environment. Much as 826CHI programs are designed to help the students engage with the world around them through new eyes and new experiences, our secret agent supply store will be designed to help orient operatives of all ages in the world of Spy. \nActual piece of store, actual perk for backers.\nTIDBITS OF THE PROJECT SPECIFICS\nOur new space needs to engage the young, the permanently young, and the impossible-to-impress.

Through fundraising and strategic partnerships, it aims to offer free graphic design, photography, and video services to deserving artists, entrepreneurs, and small institutions across the country. Successful recipients will apply via DesignEgg.org and their project will be considered and voted on by an online community of their peers. During a one-year pilot program, creative services will be provided by Jess & Andy Wickstrom of Wickstrom Design. If the pilot is successful, DesignEgg will become an entire network of creatives that are able to do meaningful work for deserving clients--and also be paid for their efforts through a nonprofit organization.\nProject Origins \nLike many designers, Wickstrom Design has regularly donated services or offered reduced fees to nonprofit organizations and projects we believe in. We've made album art for burgeoning music labels, done photo documentation of charity events, and branding for young businesses. We've often wondered, however, if there might be a better solution for those on a budget and in need of quality creative services. After all, who really likes to ask for things for free? Many of our clients have great respect for creative work and only wish they weren't constrained by the limitations of their funding. \nThis summer, after more than ten years working in Chicago, we're evolving from an after-hours design team (we're quitting our day jobs) into a full-time, full-service mobile firm. As part of this new endeavor, we are launching a pilot program for what will hopefully become a nonprofit sister organization of Wickstrom Design called DesignEgg. The project arises from a fundamental belief that effective designcan help a great idea to grow into a successful business; can affect social change; and can give voice to creative endeavors. Additionally, during a one-year process of travel, research, and experimentation, we hope to discover that designers can lend their talents to projects with meaning, and be compensated fairly using a crowd-sourced model of funding.\nHow it Works: With Your Support\nIn its first iteration, DesignEgg will be funded via individual contributions. Funds raised will go towards research and development of the project--the nuts and bolts of getting a website established and building awareness for the concept--as well the first round of creative services grants. These grants, or \"DesignEgg Credits\" will be awarded to those who apply and are selected through an online voting process (where anyone can apply and vote) with oversight by a selection committee. Grantees will be awarded a specific amount of credits which they can then redeem for services, which may include: graphic design, videos, and photography.\nThe first $10,000 raised will be allocated as follows during a one-year period beginning August 1, 2014:\n$800: Processing Fees (5% Kickstarter, 2-5% Payment Processing)\n$950: Rewards and Shipping (stickers, tote-bags, mugs, t-shirts, etc.)\n$1,250: Start-up Expenses for DesignEgg awareness-building campaign and website (vehicle graphics, promotional postcards, web-hosting, email services, etc). \n$7,000: DesignEgg Credits awarded to successful applicants (delivered in the form of design services by Andy & Jess).\nAny additional funds raised will contribute to our stretch goal objectives, allowing us to:\nWork with technology consultants to enhance the DesignEgg website and facilitate efficient and transparent crowd-sourced voting,\nProvide additional DesignEgg credits to successful applicants\nAttend arts and technology conferences for educational/networking opportunities (our dream would be to attend the next TED conference in Vancouver!)\nWhy a Mobile Firm? Expanding our Reach\nChicago has been our home for the past eleven years. Since moving here in 2003, we have benefited from the large network of individuals, businesses, and organizations based in and around the city. But there are, of course, diverse groups of people doing exciting work across the nation--and we want to get to know them! That's why we're taking to the road with our fiberglass camper and embarking on a mission to see the country and introduce new audiences to the DesignEgg model.\nWe plan to stop by all kinds of places--from arts-based collectives and small museums to social justice, environmental and community service organizations--to introduce ourselves and explain what DesignEgg might do for them. We also hope to get lots of feedback on our idea and build a whole community of supporters. In the process of traveling and connecting with new people, we will expand our applicant pool, making the selection process rich and competitive. We'll also be executing projects as we go, working from our mobile design unit and documenting the entire experience on our blog.\nThis Can be the Start of Something Big\nAfter the exploratory period (August 2014-August 2015) we plan to settle down and do a full review to assess the feasibility of a community-funded creative services organization like DesignEgg. Hopefully, we will have learned a lot through the process and can retool and establish permanent nonprofit status that will make us eligible to apply for local and national grants to continue our work. In Fall 2015, Jess will be entering a graduate program in Executive Nonprofit Leadership at Regis University in Denver--she intends for this project to be informed by and benefit from her studies.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we embark on this ambitious adventure--to travel cross-country and give away $10,000 in design services--we will meet some unique challenges.

There might be disagreement amongst our community over which projects are funded. We might find a lack of qualified applicants or discover complications with successful applicants (their project changes, dissolves, etc). \n\nWe feel confident that we will guard against and combat issues, should they arise, by: (1) assembling an experienced and trustworthy oversight committee. We will draw upon professional connections to find individuals with a range of experience to help guide and oversee this project; (2) maintaining transparency by documenting all our activities on our blog; and (3) staying upbeat and committed to our work with the help of continuous feedback from our backers and clients.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "DesignEgg Year in Review (in 2 minutes)", "update_content": "Hello Backers!\nWe can't believe it's been a year since our last update.

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

Everyone has that home that was central to their youth - where we sipped our first drink or stole our first kiss, where we shared secrets and mischief, laughter and love. For my friends and I, this place was my family's lakehouse in Georgia.\nIn 2011 my family moved away, so we sold the lakehouse. I had to say goodbye to a pivotal chapter of my youth. My writing partner (Mo Narang) and I began to explore the themes of loss and nostalgia, of letting go and holding on. BESIDE STILL WATERS was born. \nOver the next two years, we successfully funded, cast, shot, and edited the film. It was the most challenging experience of my life, and also the most rewarding. Throughout the process I collaborated with some amazing people, particularly our cast (who brought the story to life in a way I could never have anticipated), and our producers Jason Potash and Paul Finkel of Storyboard Entertainment (without whom we would not be where we are). We played at the Mill Valley Film Festival and the Austin Film Festival, where we won both the Jury Prize and the Audience Award, and received our first distribution offer. \nThe entire BSW team and I have poured our hearts and souls into this project, and we've gotten it so close to the finish line. During our initial fundraising tour, we traveled to New York, Georgia, Michigan, Texas, California and everywhere in between, pitching this film in living rooms, raising the money in a true independent fashion. Until the incredible success of the Veronica Mars Kickstarter campaign, none of us ever dreamed of such an energetic, devoted group of supporters, capable of bringing a story like this to life. That\u2019s the support we need now. Help us take these last few steps.\nIn order to actually get this film distributed (in theaters, on DVD, iTunes, OnDemand, Amazon, etc.), we need to pay what are called \"deliverables.\" These are basically the finishing costs of the film (insurance, cleaning dust & scratches, music rights, closed captioning - it all adds up). If we meet our goal, we'll be able to cover these costs and share our film with you.\nPlease support this project in any way you can, and spread the word - it would mean the world to me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\nSincerely,\nChris Lowell\nREWARD DETAILS:\nAnnotated Script with stories and anecdotes from writers Chris & Mo:\nCustom T-Shirts:\n\"What's A Whiskey Slap?\" T-Shirt\n\"Beside Still Waters\" T-Shirt (featuring custom artwork by Chaney Trotter)\nOriginal Artwork by Carla Weeks featured throughout the film: \nOriginal water-color prints of the Petoskey lake house by Carla Weeks.\nA Carla Weeks print of the lake house dock\nOUR CAST:\nRYAN EGGOLD plays Daniel.

You've all been so generous but please keep the momentum going\u2026.17 days left!\n      Photo Courtesy of Trina Roberts, Grin Photography\nI started Yellowberry after a failed shopping trip with my younger sister, Mary Margaret, to buy her first bras. It was an awkward moment for her, but a chance for me to show off my sisterly knowledge. However, I couldn\u2019t believe the bras that she was supposed to buy. The choices for her, and for all girls her age (the 11-15 age group) were simply appalling to me. They were all padded, push-up, and sexual. Not only that, they did not fit her body properly, which automatically made me wonder \u201cWhere were the young, cute, and realistic bras for girls?!\u201d There were none! So, upon returning home I realized that I could do it; I could make those bras for girls.\nI wanted to make a bra that was not just a bra for a girl to wear, but one that stood for something more. My company, Yellowberry, is based on six themes: Go barefoot, Watch quietly and observe, Love the outdoors and nature, Water the flowers everyday, Seek and find a hug when you need one, and Campfires are rare so eat as many marshmallows as you can. These mantras were originally written about my late sister, Caroline, with the goal of remembering her youthful spirit. However, I have taken and adopted them for Yellowberry, because they represent what I believe to be a great platform and representation of the best parts of adolescence. I also think that for the most part, they are quite universal and relatable for young girls everywhere. Yellowberry bras are made with quality in mind, as well as the integrity of the girls who will wear them.\nI have spent the past 10 months trying to figure out how to build, manufacture, produce, market, and distribute Yellowberry bras to girls in the US and around the world. I am at a point now, where I need funding in order to grow and allow Yellowberry to reach its potential.\nPhotograph Courtesy of Trina Roberts, Grin Photography", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any company, Yellowberry is susceptible to possible challenges moving forward. If the Kickstarter campaign is a success, Yellowberry will specifically face the fact that I am a senior in high school and will leave for college in the fall. Secondly, Yellowberry has the possibility of manufacturing delays. And finally, Yellowberry will be tested as to whether or not it will find its footing in the apparel world.\n\nSo far I have started and managed Yellowberry as a full-time student. As the fall approaches, I will no longer be in Jackson to manage Yellowberry from home. However, I plan to continue to run Yellowberry as a college student. Yellowberry will continue under my leadership to grow and develop. I have a wonderful team surrounding me and my company that clearly understand my vision for Yellowberry. With their help and my strong voice, Yellowberry will continue to grow and prosper!\n\nAlthough we have tested our manufacturing facilities, there is always a possibility that our manufacturing will be delayed. Some forces in manufacturing are out of our control, but thus far our delays have been less than four weeks in addition to our promised deliveries. Should we experience manufacturing delays, our products may be delayed in reaching our donors.\n\nI am confident that our Kickstarter campaign will be successful! The idea of making appropriate beautifully made products for young girls, and a company that stands behind that whole-heartedly, is something that I believe in and am very passionate about. I know that Yellowberry has huge potential! Marketed and managed well, Yellowberry will \u201cfind its footing\u201d and will be a great success.

Thank you so much to everyone who backed, shared and believed in my project!\nOnce the campaign is over, it's over, and since I'm in this unique situation that I might not be in ever again, I want to make the most of it. The original funding goal is enough money to complete our project, but if we raise a little more, we will be able to do more. We can print even more paper, (maybe throw in a few limited edition colors!) we can buy a larger drying rack and help offset some of the Kickstarter and credit card processing fees (5% and 3-5%, respectively) that I will pay on the final amount raised.\nSo without further ado... \nHello! My name is Lizzie and I make decorative picture frames by covering wood frames with handmade patterned paper from around the world. \nI'm ready to take Craftbelly Frames + Mirrors to the next level by designing and printing my own line of screen printed paper to make my products truly original and entirely made in the USA.\nI am a maker and graphic designer who, after working in the design field for a couple years, decided to take a detour to see what else was out there. After moving to Chicago in 2009, I began working at an independent stationery shop where we were given the unique opportunity to design and sell items we made ourselves. I was inspired by the beautiful decorative papers that we sold in the store, so I started to make frames using them. It was such a different creative outlet for me and I loved it. \nI quickly found myself immersed in the handmade culture here in Chicago, surrounded by passionate people selling things that they designed and created themselves. I was completely inspired and Craftbelly was born. Since then I've created a real business featuring ready-made and custom decorative frames and mirrors. \nA couple of years and many craft shows later, I knew something was missing from my work. Two of my biggest passions are art/design and supporting local, independent businesses.\nWhile my design skills were still being utilized to design and build my brand, I wanted to do more. I have always been captivated by color and prints and had even started playing around with pattern design, yet I was still using paper designed and printed by someone else. \nI'm a strong advocate for local and independent companies sourcing all of their materials and manufacturing in the USA, and yet here I was purchasing paper that had to cross an ocean to get to me. \nSomething had to change. Everything, really. \nDuring the summer of 2012 I printed my first test run of an original pattern with help from my friends of Reuse First, who run and operate a screen printing studio here in Chicago. I experienced love at first sight after seeing the pattern come to life on that first printed sheet.\nFrames made from original run\nFast forward to the winter of 2013: During a night of merriment with these same friends, passions and dreams were discussed. We decided that not only did I need to continue to design my own paper to use for frames, but that I should create a full line of wrapping paper and they would silkscreen it. My friends even talked about investing in a larger automated press to print larger sheets. (They did.) No pressure or anything! \nAfter this enlightening evening and rousing conversation, I couldn't get out of my head how amazing it would be to build an original line of papers to use not only to make frames with, but also to sell to people for use in their own projects. After all, that's how I was inspired to start my whole business.\nAfter a few test runs with smaller sized paper, I am ready to take the next step and print large sheets that are 19\" x 25\". The goal is to print about 2000 sheets of a mix of uncoated text and cover weight paper. With these two weights of paper, I will be able to create a variety of high quality products, including frames, notecards, postcards, envelopes liners, etc. \nPrinting: The screens will be made and all sheets will be printed at Reuse First here in Chicago, Illinois.  \nPaper: I have chosen to use paper from French Paper Company, a sixth-generation, family-owned paper mill located in Niles, Michigan that uses fully renewable hydro energy to power their plant. They use recycled materials in their papers and have a great selection of colors.\nFrench Paper Co. Mill\nColor/Patterns: I have created 3 patterns, in six ink/paper combos. \nThe Brights will be printed with gold metallic ink.\nThe Neutrals will be printed with silver metallic ink. \nYour Pledge: Thanks in advance for helping make this dream a reality! The money raised in this Kickstarter will go towards:\npurchasing and setup of the screens \npurchasing the paper\nall printing costs\ncreation, packaging and shipping of all rewards\nMade in the USA: I currently source the unfinished basswood frames that I use from a manufacturer in Ohio. With the addition of this new paper to my business, I will proudly be able to say that my product and all of its materials are 100% made in the USA. \nWe've printed a small run of Pattern #1 so you can see the actual color combos, which you will see in the images below. \nPattern #1 shown in all 6 color combos\nTwo frames from the Neutrals.\nStacks of wrapped gifts.\nA delicious stack of frames featuring all of the styles.\nFront and back of finished frame. Includes glass insert, easel back and 2 sawtooth hangers. Frames are finished with a coating of non-toxic sealant.\nExamples of envelope liner and notecard\nIn the end, it's all about YOU! My goal has always been to give people who love color and pattern a unique, handcrafted option for framing. With this new line of paper, not only will I be able to offer a truly original product, but also a whole new line of goods for all the fantastic pattern-loving people out there! \nKickstarter backers, you will be the FIRST to receive any of these new products, and at special discounted prices! So for example, Reward #7 is a killer deal because the retail price for those three frames will be $114 plus shipping, so backers are getting 35-40% off! \nPlease note: All rewards include the price of shipping!\nNote: Rewards #1-3 will be a pre-selected assortment. For rewards #4-7, backers will receive a survey to choose what style frame they would like to receive if the project is successfully funded. \nIf this project excites you but you are unable to assist financially at this time, I would appreciate even just spreading the word via your favorite social media outlet or passing on to that crafty person in your life that saves wrapping paper after opening a gift.

Everybody had some crazy ideas. People wanted a space to find out how microphones work. Some wanted to know where graffiti came from. Others just asked for a place to relax. Overwhelmingly, most students just wanted a place to read and explore: a place to discover.\nAt Studio H, students and teachers have the audacity to build the environments they need and imagine, and so that's what we did: we designed a place to read, relax, explore and discover for our school.\nDesigning a Library\nSome people call a place to read and explore a Library. We just call it our X-Space. For us, X is something that can be anything, and we thought that would be a perfect place to explore. (That's the empty X Space below.)\nWe designed everything that makes a great library: the bookmarks, the book stamps, the book bags, and the coolest is STAX: a shelving system made out of hundreds of stacked X's. With all of these STAX, we'll be able to fill X-Space with thousands of books.\nSTAX look and work great by themselves, but they're even better, stronger, more beautiful, when put together as many. We designed them out of low-tech materials (13-ply finished plywood), but they are made using high-tech CNC technology (thanks to our good friend Carl Bass, CEO of Autodesk). When put together, they create an incredible structure with a curvy front facade.\nYou can do anything with STAX: you can make your new favorite shelf. You can make supports for a table or legs for a bench. You can make a mile long wall if you want. Whatever you do with them, they'll definitely be the coolest piece of furniture you own.\nThe money we will raise on Kickstarter will be used for the STAX building materials, 3000 books, and all the technology to create our X-Space. Approximately $30,000 for books (3000 volumes), $20,000 for construction materials, lighting, fixtures, hardware, $15,000 for technology, and $10,000 for software, subscriptions, periodicals and ebooks.\nHow You Can Help\nWe\u2019re proud of what we've designed for our X-Space, and we want them to spread beyond our walls so others can enjoy them, too. We\u2019re not only making these STAX for us, but for you, too. Every time you pledge one on Kickstarter, our library gets one, too. When you pledge, you will be a physical part of making the X-Space real. Your name might be in a book or prominently written on our donor wall. You'll be permanently remembered for making X Space happen!\nRewards\n$25 \u2013 Bookmark\nWe\u2019ll send you a sweet X-Space bookmark, and its \"bookmark buddy\" will live at REALM in a student's book. It\u2019s like a friendship bookmark! Keep your place, hang it on the wall or wave it in the air like you just don\u2019t care. Xcellent.\n$49 \u2013 Adopt-a-Book\nWe'll put your name in a book that lives at the X-Space, and we'll send you a certificate with the book\u2019s title and a fact (or fiction) from its pages!\n$99 \u2013 Book Bag\nWe\u2019ll send you a custom X-Space Baggu Bag to proudly carry your own books, tools, groceries or whatever X is to you.

We\u2019ll put your name(s) on the STAX units, and we\u2019ll put your name on the library wall in our future X Space.\n$1,599 - 8 Piece STAX\nWe\u2019ll send you 8 STAX units in a mix of natural, red or any combination of those colors.

Not only that, but we'll also be able to build tables, stools and benches. An entire X Space fit for a school.\nMatching funds from the Quest Foundation\nIf we reach our $75,000 goal on Kickstarter, the Quest Foundation based in Danville, CA, had generously pledged an additional $30,000 in matching funds. This additional funding will go towards the purchase of 3000 more books! What this means for you: Every dollar you contribute is actually worth $1.40 if we hit our $75,000 target!\nHow we're going to pull this off \nOver the past four years, Studio H's teachers and students have designed and built a 2000-square-foot farmers market pavilion, a pop-up park, laser-etched skateboards, sculptural concrete public furniture, roadside farmstands, and more. Our founder and Studio H instructors have architecture degrees from UC Berkeley and Harvard and years of experience building crazy projects with youth and for the community. As a group, we're crafty, stubborn, creative, and tenacious. Students have access to a full wood and metal shop, laser cutter, and digital fabrication tools to bring their ideas to life. The X-Space project will be completed over the course of the Spring school semester and summer, on the following estimated schedule:\n\nMarch 2014: Space planning, prototyping of shelves and fixtures\nApril 2014: Begin build-out of fixtures\nMay 2014: Technology, lighting, table tops\nJune 2014: Order books\nJuly - August 2014: Complete build-out with books\nSeptember 2014: Open library to REALM school community\nTeam\nREALM\nThe mission of REALM Charter School is to advance knowledge through rigorous studies, cultivate resiliency, develop critical thinking skills, and equip students in grades 6-12 to serve our communities and the world in the 21st century.

Most data tools weren't built for design, and most design tools weren't built for data. I discovered this firsthand when I worked with nonprofit organizations, where we had lots of data about our social impact, but few resources to help us tell our story. Our team is democratizing data storytelling by making a powerful and easy-to-use web application. \nWe love the web. The web is a constantly changing, dynamic environment. Infographics should be dynamic, too. Infoactive's graphics respond to changes in data streams, or changes in a viewer's screen size. They move beyond static content and encourage interactive data exploration.\nSharing data should be fun. Whether you're writing an article for your newspaper, presenting campaign results to a client, showing your academic research, explaining your team's performance, creating progress reports, or making a new blog post, Infoactive is here to help you make data-driven stories.\nSo what does it do? Let's dig into the details.\nConnect static or streaming data\nBy feeding live data into a Google Spreadsheet, your infographics will automatically update. You can also upload a CSV. You can work with a few simple numbers, or up to 10,000 rows of complex data. \nWe've tested some different live data options (such as Data Market, Twitter, and Poll Daddy APIs) with good results. In the future, we plan to support additional import options and even larger datasets. We will also develop an API so that you can feed your own streams of live data into gorgeous, interactive templates.\nBuild a story\nDrag-and-drop charts, text, maps, icons, and interactive filters into your infographic. \nWe help you create better stories by programmatically looking at your dataset and determining which visualizations make sense. When you first upload a dataset, Infoactive will automatically draw a chart for you based on the contents of your data. For example, the platform will never ever create a pie chart with 30 slices. We're looking out for you, and doing our best to help you create stellar infographics.\nDiscover new insights \nWith Infoactive, your audience can dive into data and interactively explore information. You can visually analyze and filter by any parameter in your survey, simply by clicking on charts, buttons, and time sliders. Perform visual queries on complex datasets without doing math or writing code.\nCustomize your infographic \nChoose between different themes and customization options to create infographics that match your taste or your brand. In the future, we'll develop options for you to create your own themes and templates. For the more technical crowd, we'll let you dig into CSS to create your own theme.\nShare your story \nWhen you're finished, you can copy the embed code and drop your infographic into your blog or site. We auto-generate a static image version for Pinterest and a few other places where interactive content isn't possible.\nRespond to different screens\n Our infographics are designed to scale. Infoactive delivers graphics that are uniquely optimized for both desktops and mobile devices. Touchscreen data exploration is a challenging problem to solve, but we're committed to crafting great mobile experiences.\nSimplify the process\nWe've put a lot of thought into designing an interface that's easy to use. Data can be complex and confusing, but we want to make it as simple and painless as possible. Our team cares about user experience, and we're proud of the work we've done to simplify a very complex process.\nSupport data-driven stories\nWe came to Kickstarter because we know that this community is full of smart, creative, talented, and passionate people, and we want you to be a part of our development process. Every backer \u2014 from $1 to $10,000 \u2014 will get a special url for immediate access to our private beta. We hope that you'll give it a try, send us feedback, and help us build a truly amazing application.\nWe want Infoactive to be accessible and affordable for everyone, and we need your support to get there. Building Infoactive is a labor of love, and it's also expensive. We want this to be available to all of you and financially sustainable for our team. We're so grateful for your contributions, no matter how big or small. \nHow we show our gratitude\nWe really appreciate your support, and we're offering some exclusive deals for the Kickstarter community.

Data comes in many shapes and sizes, and programmatically recognizing different data structures is quite difficult. It's tough to create a system that's intuitive and accessible for people who are not professional data analysts, but we're up for the challenge.\n\nWe're really proud of what we've been able to accomplish with just a few people in a short time frame, and we're confident that we can continue to deliver great results. \n\nAs is true with any big project, there are risks.

Thank you, everyone! Thank you, MailChimp!\nThanks to the 10,500+ of you who make this show possible. We received the extra $20,000 grant from MailChimp because of an incredible surge of support on Thursday. I\u2019ve long since run out of clever ways to express my gratitude. I have new empathy for the greeting card writers of the world.\nIf you\u2019ve been following along, you\u2019ll notice a pattern in the stretch goals of this campaign: fixing what's broken in the public radio system. Don't get me wrong-- I do this work because I love it, and it has been my privilege to be an independent radio producer for more than a dozen years. I am extremely lucky that I get to do this for a living.\nHowever, there are things about the public radio system that need to change. One by one, our stretch goals have been addressing these issues. You\u2019ve proven that the audience will reward innovation. You\u2019ve provided health care stipends to our contract workers. You\u2019ve ended the endless internship. It has been amazing to watch these goals get shattered so quickly, because I always knew that the right audience would consider these things to be important.\nThe time has come to replicate this across public radio. We\u2019re creating Radiotopia.\nFor a couple years, I\u2019ve been scheming with PRX to create a collective of exceptional radio shows that will push the boundaries of public radio. Modeled after 99% Invisible, we want to provide support for a select group of creator-driven, high-quality, entrepreneurial programs that will establish a path to success for the most talented audio producers. We call it Radiotopia.*\nThe most common question I\u2019m asked, by far, is \u201cWhat other podcasts do you listen to?\u201d There are great ones out there and I want more. The hardest part of creating a new show is getting started and then getting enough audience and support to move into regular production. We want to provide a platform where the best producers can find an audience and flourish. That has always been my ultimate goal, and it\u2019s time to get it done.\nSo here's the plan: pledges collected up to the $350,000 mark will go towards rounding out the 99pi 2014 budget: relocation money for our next hire, raising freelance rates, creating an experimental fund for us to try things that we haven't thought of yet, and also buying some new equipment (Avery is using Sam's computer from college and most of our gear is older than my boys).\nAnything pledged beyond that threshold--$350,000--will go toward establishing a seed fund for programs in PRX\u2019s Radiotopia.\nCreating this support network helps 99% Invisible achieve long-term sustainability, and everyone will benefit from more great radio in the world. I kept thinking that an ecosystem of other 99% Invisibles would spring up after our initial success, and a few have, but not nearly enough. And the few programs out there are in constant risk of going away without a network to support them. So, let\u2019s build it ourselves.\n-roman\n*The term \u201cradiotopia\u201d came from Julie Shapiro when she was at the Third Coast International Audio Festival. Many of the most creative, independent producers of public radio get together every year at the Third Coast Conference to find our community and explore our craft. Julie called this gathering and all the great plans we had for audio storytelling \u201cradiotopia.\u201d It\u2019s a place where everything is radio and everything is really good.\nStretch Goals:\nOver $350,000- Start the Radiotopia program fund.\nOver $400,000- Respect.\nOver $500,000- Mad respect.\n$590,808- Take down Planet Money as the highest-funded podcast on Kickstarter.\n99% Invisible is a popular public radio show and podcast about design, architecture and all the thought that goes into the things most people don\u2019t even think about.\nThe show started as a side project I made in my bedroom at night, and after two years of making the program, I turned to Kickstarter to see if I should keep it going. To my great surprise, the Season 3 fund-raising campaign broke all previous records for a journalism project on Kickstarter. We hired a producer (Sam Greenspan!), overhauled the website, grew the audience, and made the show better than it has ever been.\nFor Season 4, we want to Kickstart the next giant leap in the evolution of 99% Invisible:\nWe want to go weekly.\nWe're staffing up and going pro. This involves hiring more help (contract reporters, editors, a production coordinator, paid interns), moving into a proper office, and commissioning more stories. The 52 weekly episodes of Season 4 will start February 4, 2014 and run for one year.\nWe are making a new kind of public radio in a new way. I must admit, after the huge success and growth of the show in the last year, I thought the public radio decision-makers and granting institutions would really get behind 99% Invisible, but they are slow to act. It's OK, their deliberate nature is part of why we love them, but it means it is up to you to tell us if we should expand and make more. This is as public as public radio gets.\nOur dream is to hire Sean Cole as a monthly contributor. Not only is he the best reporter in public radio, he also produced one of our favorite 99% Invisible stories, \"Some Other Sign That People Do Not Totally Regret Life.\"\nREWARDS\nT-Shirts!\nOur awesome new shirts were designed by Chop Shop and they will be fulfilling the t-shirt orders. We are only guaranteeing that they will arrive by January, but we will do everything in our power to get t-shirts to you by Christmas. After the campaign is over, you will get a Kickstarter survey that collects your t-shirt size and address. PLEASE COMPLETE and RETURN YOUR SURVEY RIGHT AWAY and we'll send out the first set of t-shirts before Christmas.\nAlways Read the Plaque T-shirt\nThe story behind \"Always Read the Plaque\":\nRazzle Dazzle T-Shirt\nThe story behind \"Razzle Dazzle\":\n99% Invisible Logo T-shirt\nLast year's classic 99% Invisible logo t-shirt is back at a bit of a discount.

Each with black line artwork and a one color accent layer. Final version may vary from what is pictured below. Each notebook contains 32 pages of grid-lined paper.\nDazzle Pocket Notebook\nHeyoon Pocket Notebook\nSecret Staircases Pocket Notebook\nPosters!\nSteve McCarthy created a brilliant new poster/desktop image that combines a bunch of our favorite things on one stunning map.

An underwriting partnership with 99% Invisible will demonstrate that your company is very passionate about all aspects of design. During this campaign, underwriting spots are discounted and have lots of bonus prizes and goodies. Get in touch and we will work out all the details: roman@prx.org\nCustom Recording\nAs part of the \"Two-of-everything\" pack, I'll record something unique for you. It could be an outgoing voicemail message, or a favorite short story, video narration, anything under 30 minutes that doesn't make me cringe (I reserve the right to refuse the recording on moral or ethical grounds--e.g. I won't record the narration for your racist cult recruiting video). This is only for non-commercial use. Last year, people used this prize to great effect. I voiced cool videos for The Noun Project and Sing Statistics.\nProducer for a day\nPick from a couple dozen potential days (we'll make something work) and we'll invite you into the 99% Invisible production. You'll sit in on a story meeting, critique whatever rough draft we have in process, go out to lunch (probably for pho, we love pho), and just hang out all day. Plus, you'll take home all the swag you see on this page. You just need to get yourself to Oakland.\nMusic\nThe music in the video is courtesy of two great bands I love, Melodium and Les Savy Fav. Melodium has inspired more of my radio stories than any other artist in existence and Les Savy Fav is quite simply the greatest rock n' roll band alive. If you have spare money after this campaign, go buy an album or two.

We'll also be publishing our conversations with these couples and renowned relationship experts on our podcast, The Loveumentary. \nBy highlighting the relationships that are working, our ultimate goal is to reinvigorate the country's faith in love, marriage, and one another.\nWhen it comes to love and relationships, most of the conversation in America revolves around the high divorce rate, celebrity breakups, domestic abuse, and infidelity. We tend to focus the majority of our attention on what isn't working.\nBut, what about the people who are making it work? \nThere are countless couples (of all religions, races, sexual orientations, etc.) in America who are building satisfying long-term relationships, lasting marriages, and happy families. Why isn\u2019t anyone telling their stories? \nEnter: Melissa and Nate. \nWe met in person for the first time on Day 1 of this project (insane, right?!). When we had our first call after being introduced by a mutual friend in early summer, we realized we shared the exact same dream: To capture the stories of couples who are in love and building lasting relationships\u2014and uncover what they do differently. So, we decided to take a leap of faith and go on this journey together.\nBut, this project isn't just about the fairytale romances. It's about the husband who stuck by his wife, even after her recovery from terminal brain cancer completely changed her personality. It's about the wife who stuck by her husband while he was struggling with drug addiction for over a decade when he came home from the military. It's about the ordinary couples doing extraordinary things in the name of true love, all across the country. \nWe\u2019ve already captured over 25 incredible love stories on Loveumentary.com, and are currently traveling across the country in search of 75+ more! We will also be interviewing relationship experts, marriage counselors, researchers, and psychologists who have dedicated their lives to the study of love and relationships. This journey is ultimately about intertwining storytelling and science to add context and depth to the project and final book. \nIn order to finish this trip, and bring the final book and podcast to life, we need your help! We already started this project, and have been covering our costs for food, gas, accommodations, and content production.\nWe're launching this campaign to cover the following: \nWriting and editing the final \"America, In Love\" book \nDesigning a final print edition of this book\nBook printing & shipping\nLiterary usage permissions for several copyrighted quotations\nInitial setup fee for electronic publication\nCovering the remainder of our gas, food, and additional travel expenses to reach our goal of 100+ interviews\nShooting additional video footage of the journey\nEditing and organizing raw video and podcast content\nMarketing and promotion (online and offline) \nYou can check out what we\u2019ve done so far at Loveumentary.com. \n(1) Back this Kickstarter campaign, and share The Loveumentary project with anyone and everyone who might be interested in what we\u2019re doing! \n(2) Tell us about the couple you most admire. We\u2019ll feature some of the stories on our website, and may even choose a few to go visit and interview during our cross-country journey. \n(3) If you know of anyone in the media who would be interested in covering The Loveumentary project or our journey across America, we\u2019d love a warm intro! \n(4) Follow the project, and share the content you love. We will be posting blogs, podcasts, and video footage of our journey every day. More than anything, we just want to share everything we\u2019re learning about love, commitment, and relationships with as many people as possible. \nSharing the content enables us to reach a bigger audience. That\u2019s the heartfelt goal at the center of all this. Please, share away! We want you to be a part in the journey with us, as it unfolds and thereafter. \nThere\u2019s one more way to get involved. \nWe are now accepting and publishing submissions from readers around the country who answer the following question via a handwritten letter: \nIf you were to write one last letter to the love of your life, what would it say? \nAs we travel across the country to capture the greatest love stories in America, one of our goals is to encourage as many people as possible to write a love letter and send it now. \nTomorrow isn't promised to us. \nWe don't want to wait another day to capture these love stories and shift the collective conversation about love and marriage in America. And we don't want you to wait another day to live out and share your own great love story. \nWe hope you'll write a love letter today, and follow along on The Loveumentary journey with us! \nMelissa was born and raised in Queens, NY.

We will transform a vacant storefront in the Lower East Side to incubate 7 pop-up ideas. The storefront transformer will continue to operate throughout next year to incubate more pop-up ideas by you and everyone!\nMade in the Lower East Side (miLES) open storefronts to possibilities by creating short-term multi-use spaces as community hubs. The miLES Storefront Transformer, designed by Architecture Commons, is a set of modular furniture bundled with support services that will enhance the mission of miLES. We make it quick and easy to turn underused storefronts into anything you can imagine. We give entrepreneurs and artists an easy and affordable way to showcase their work. The neighborhood gets a variety of vibrant programmed uses in a previously vacant space. Landlords get short-term rental income and increased visibility to help them find a longer-term tenant for their space. It is a win-win proposition for multiple stakeholders. \nDespite the rapid gentrification of the neighborhood, there are still over 200 vacant storefronts in the Lower East Side. Rather than wait as landlords sit on these properties, miLES activates these spaces on a short-term basis to lower the entry barrier for creative, entrepreneurial and civic projects, with the potential of converting these into longer-term sustainable uses. This initiative will transform these storefronts in this socially and economically diverse neighborhood into community spaces, temporary homes for emerging projects, and provide economic opportunities for the local neighborhood. \nStarted as an OpenIDEO challenge realization phase, and with the support of Fourth Arts Block, we began our pilot storefront in April 2013 and received over 100 requests for pop-ups of various uses. We have produced 14 pop-up shops, 20 pop-up classes, two design festivals, and even a pop-up film festival! We have worked with a wide range of clients from cultural institutions like the New Museum to entrepreneurs like Etsy sellers. Since then we have talked to numerous landlords, more and more co-op and smaller landlords are open to what we are proposing by popping up one month at a time and receiving income while they are still waiting for their long term tenants. But we still need more validation and support to recruit more landlords!\nYour pledges will help us pay for the rent, insurance, logistics, and the fabrication of the miLES Storefront Transformer and validation for us to talk to more landlords to unlock these underused spaces.\nWe are empowering the community from the bottom-up and are disrupting the commercial real estate market. \nAfter the success of our pilot in April, more landlords have opened to what we proposed and we believe that this model is a viable, sustainable, and scalable means to activate storefronts across the world.\nWe need your help to demonstrate that the Storefront Transformer can facilitate the activation of underused storefronts and incubate entrepreneurs, creatives, and civic activists. \nSupporting our project now means we will be able to incubate more amazing ideas and create more pop-ups in the future!\nADDITIONAL DETAILS.\nPrototype: Alpha by Jack Kirby Museum & Research Center \nJack Kirby is the pre-eminent comic book creator of the 20th Century.

($3,700 of that is fees for Kickstarter and Amazon Payments). \nIn short order you will be able to visit us, share some stories, and meet great people.

It\u2019s full of 21st century tools like a laser cutter and 3D printers, and old-school tools like glue-guns and hammers.\nSparkTruck runs hands-on workshops with elementary and middle school students; promotes design thinking as a problem solving skill; and, encourages kids to find their inner maker. You can read more about the project on its old Kickstarter page (when it was still called SparkLab) or on its current website.\nSparkTruck is currently teaching a class at the Stanford d.school to prepare the truck and a new crew for another summer road trip.\nInside the truck with the laser cutter; and, SparkTruck's road map.\n Now, About the Film\nAt the end; 15,323 miles, 33 states, and 2,673 students add up to one thing: a whole a lot of stories. Luckily, Didi, the designated documentarian of the team, was there to capture many moments of the trip. So far, a small portion of this 100-hours of footage has been edited into short videos for the SparkTruck blog; but, there is a lot more to be shared.\nThe short documentary will mainly focus on the journey of the SparkTruck, and provide a behind-the-scenes look at the struggles, discoveries, and achievements of the SparkTeam as they share their passion for hands-on learning. While the team traveled the country teaching students about design and making, they were also doing a lot of learning themselves. The main purpose of documenting and sharing this experience is to share this iterative learning process with others, and inspire them to take action towards reaching their own goals, no matter their size.\nDidi filming at Pike Place Market in Seattle, WA.\nWhy a Short Documentary?\nIn the age of laptops, tablets, and smart phones shorter videos are the easiest to watch and share, especially for the younger audiences. In order to reach out to many viewers in an effective way, we want to keep the account of our journey brief and engaging. Once finished, the film will be available on the new SparkTruck website for free streaming.\nAnd also a book!\nThere are way too many memories and moments to fit in a short documentary, so we\u2019d like to bring some of our favorite blog posts to life with engaging short videos, and slide shows in the form of an e-book. Once finished, the book will be available for digital download, as well as for print orders as a coffee table book.\nWhy Does It Matter?\nWhen we first started this project, we didn\u2019t know too much about how the education system worked. All we knew was that while the standardized system of learning worked well for some students, many other kids (and teachers) found rigid standards and the mentality of \u201cteaching to the test\u201d to be uninspiring and not so fun.\nAfter spending a couple months hanging out at schools, we found that this top-down, \u201ccheck these boxes\u201d learning system had conditioned kids to fear being \u201cwrong,\u201d and created an environment of learned helplessness. We want to help change that. We want to make sure that fun, open-ended opportunities are made available to kids as they move through school and life because this is what helps kids get over their fear of failure and grow confidence in their abilities to be creative and work through tough problems.\nWe\u2019ve realized that in order to have more of a sustained impact, this summer road trip need to just be the beginning of a concerted effort to get these experiences and ideas to more communities. As the SparkTruck continues its journey, we hope to reach out to more students, teachers, parents, and policy makers through our documentary, and help spark a larger conversation about 21st century education.\nA Word from the Filmmaker\nYou can only imagine how excited I was when Eugene and Jason told me they wanted to have someone on board at SparkTruck to film and photograph. I knew something they didn't quite know then: I was the documentarian they were looking for. From the first meeting on I was a member of the team, which is a little weird for a filmmaker because I am mostly accustomed to stand a step away, observe, and ask questions rather than become an active participant. During the four months we were on the road, I ended up striping a lot of wires, driving many many hours, and answering countless questions that I didn't quite know the answers for. I learned to resist the temptation of helping a kid who's struggling to tape a pompom on a popsicle stick. My experience as a Sparkee will give a unique perspective and reflexivity to the film I'm editing. I'm committed to share my newly acquired perspective on creativity, problem solving, and hands-on learning to expand the discussion on these topics. I do not intent this to be a promotional video for SparkTruck, or a goofy road trip chronicle. I want it to be fun to watch, but also constructive, meaningful, and inspiring. Needless to say I need your help, and I appreciate your support greatly.\nAfter a workshop.\nAnd, the Money is For?\nCurrently, we are in the process of editing. Bringing 100-hours of footage down to a short documentary and an e-book takes a lot of time and resources. Some of the post-production costs include music, animation (if you have a road trip map, you should animate it, right?), titles, color correction, and sound mixing. There is also the cost of building and maintaining a web site and promoting the film and the book.\nRemember creating momentum upfront is the key to reach our funding goal, so donate early! If we exceed our goal, we\u2019ll be able to create more eye-popping animations, a slicker website, and ultimately reach more people with our important message.\nWhat Else Can You Do?\nDonating is a great way to support our project, but there are other ways you can help. Share it with friends, post and re-post it on Facebook, tweet it, blog it, and most importantly, take action.\nWhich Vibrobot are You?\n(In our Vibrobots workshop, we ask kids to brainstorm animals that live on land and animals that live on water; then, they pick one from each list, mash them together, and built these incredible creatures.)\nChoose your pledge amount to find out which Vibrobot you are!\nCheck-out SparkTruck's Media Buzz:\nSouthwest Airlines Spirit Magazine: It\u2019s a Gas, Gas, Gas\nMSNBC (Andrea Mitchell Reports): Educational truck created to tour America\nFast Company: SparkTruck: A \u201cBookmobile\u201d That Brings Rapid Prototyping to School Kids\nTechCrunch: SparkTruck Is A Force For STEM Education On Wheels\nGOOD: Thinkering: Mobile Maker Lab Hits Road To Find High Demand\nFinally, Introducing the SparkTeam\nLeft to right: Duygu Erucman, Eugene Korsunskiy, Jason Chua, Rachel Star.\nDuygu (Didi) Eru\u00e7man grew up watching travel shows on TV in her home country of Turkey and she believes these programs are the hidden inspiration behind her career as a documentary filmmaker. So far, she has directed and edited six short documentaries, which have screened at many film festivals around the world. Didi loves dogs, traveling, and postmodern literature. She holds a BA in Political Science from Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey, and an MFA in Documentary Film and Video from Stanford University. For more information on her work visit Duygu's website.\nEugene Korsunskiy is a big fan of dessert. The last time he made a trip across the United States, it was on a bicycle, yet he still inexplicably gained 10 pounds along the way. He\u2019s worked on giant LED sculptures for Jenny Holzer, taught design thinking to corporate executives, and once designed and ran a class on sketchbooking just so he could get a free Moleskine. Eugene holds a BA in Art and Art History from Williams College, and an MFA in Design from Stanford University.\nJason Chua is a designer, maker, and explorer of new ideas. According to his mother, he learned to read by staring at cars and road signs from his car seat, and he has been fascinated by moving vehicles ever since. Jason has built robots, designed light sculptures, and taught classes in math, branding, and happiness psychology (not all at one time) at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business, and at the d.school. He holds a MS in Mechanical Engineering and a BS in Product Design from Stanford University.\nRachel Star loves to imagine, create, and explore. At her high school, she turned a staircase into a life-size piano (think Tom Hank\u2019s movie, BIG). Since then she has designed a wheelchair attachment for patients at The Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, safer baby products for Kid\u2019s in Danger, and helped teach innovation and design at Nueva Summer. She is currently studying Manufacturing & Design Engineering and Psychology at Northwestern University.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProbably, what makes documentaries exciting, both for the filmmakers and the audience, is their unpredictable nature. When making a documentary film there should be always room for the unexpected. That being said, we can safely assume that the worst part of the process is behind us. We have all of our footage, releases, and a willing editor; now, it's just a matter of time \u2013 and money.\n\nThe biggest challenge of the project is to craft a story that reflects all the different aspects of SparkTruck. Therefore, the final film might be different than the synopsis you just read, but we know that it will be true to SparkTruck experience. Another challenge is time. Editing is a very time-consuming, at times tedious process. It might take longer than we thought to tell the perfect SparkTruck story. However, we really want to have it ready by beginning of the summer when the new SparkTeam is hitting the road.\n\nFinally, we cannot forget the e-book, because this is the very fist e-book that we are preparing, and we might need a little time and some beginner\u2019s luck.

It requires no equipment besides some bits of paper; you can play it just sitting in a circle. I\u2019d call it a party game, except that it\u2019s a game of accusations, lying, bluffing, second-guessing, assassination, and mob hysteria.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Plotkin, creator of Werewolf\n\"Use this deck.\" - Shawnimals\n\"Totally just backed.\" - Chris Messina\n\"Launched and funded at PAX East.\" - Polygon\n\"This set is an absolute must have.\" - Mike Trotzke\n\"Werewolf. By Max Temkin. On Kickstarter. That is all.\" - Chris Shiflett\n\"Finally, Werewolf cards that don't look terrible. Bravo\" - Dan Sinker\nWerewolf\nWerewolf is a simple party game for 7 to 20 players. Werewolf is a folk game - it's based on Mafia, which was created by Dimitry Davidoff in 1986, and became Werewolf at the hands of Andrew Plotkin in 1997. The game has gone on to become a staple of tech conferences and gaming conventions, and many players, including myself, consider it to be one of the most difficult and elegant games ever created.\nThere are dozens of published versions of Werewolf, but I think many of them are overcomplicated and ugly, and some even require special parts and pieces to play.\nI'd like to make my own set of simple, beautiful Werewolf cards, and get them to you affordably.\nEach set comes with 20 cards in a custom zipper case, with a keychain loop so you can hook it on to your backpack. The roles included are:\nThree werewolves\nOne doctor\nOne seer\nOne witch\n14 villagers (7 male, 7 female)\nTo help teach people about my favorite game, I've also created an open source compendium of information about Werewolf. You can read the rules and more at Maxistentialism.com/werewolf.\nThanks\nI got a tremendous amount of help from the Chicago design community prototyping and making these cards. Jana Kinsman created the amazing illustrations and collaborated with me on the overall design. Rob Loukotka lent me the the use of his laser cutter, Shawnimals let me use their corner rounder, and the Nerdologues helped me playtest the cards.\nThank you especially to Patrick Ewing and Fred Benenson for their help simulating the game and building the reactive rules.
