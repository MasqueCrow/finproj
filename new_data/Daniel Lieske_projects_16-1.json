[{"backer": "Daniel Lieske", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi, my name is Jason Brubaker and this is my Kickstarter campaign for SITHRAH book 4! \nSITHRAH is a sci-fi about a little girl trying to find her father after their plane crashes in a unfamiliar land. That's when she starts seeing an invisible creature, called SITHRAH, who has been following her around. It's not long until she runs into a young man named Dino who is running from his own ghosts. Together they set out to find her missing father wherever the evidence leads. \nBook 4 will focus on their journey across The Deep to try to find Light City.\nThis series will be 6 books long.\nSithrah has been a big experiment with the comic format by mixing subtle prose with comic panels. My hope is to blur the lines between comics, children's books, and novels without making it jarring for the reader.\nMost of my inspiration comes from the comic artists of the 90's when I refined my drawing style. Later I became influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling and have been trying to make comics that have a similar depth and feeling.\nFeel free to read SITHRAH for free at Webtoons.com.\n       SITHRAH 4: The Deep - will be 176 full color pages in a hardcover book with a cloth binding. 1000 copies will have a signed and numbered bookplate. The interior pages will be printed on thick, high quality paper printed with the same care and attention to detail that I put into the first three books. The retail price will be $24.95.\nSITHRAH 3: The Symbol (188 pages)\nSITHRAH 2: Propositions (160 pages)\nSITHRAH 1: Kingdom of the Air (96 pages)\nNovember at the latest! In other words, JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS! This will make a great Christmas present for kids and adults. :) So make sure to stock up and add lots and lots of copies as stocking stuffers. ;)\nOkay, let me backup and explain how this will happen...\nSITHRAH 4 will be ready to go to the printer about a month after this Kickstarter ends. The printing process will take about 2 months for the proofs, printing and shipping. This means I'll probably be getting the books around October. I have helpers who will help me fulfill DOMESTIC orders again and I will have an international distributor fulfilling the single book orders for INTERNATIONAL orders and so we will try to get everything shipped within a month. (depending on how big this campaign gets)\nI put November as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario but I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by September and I will start shipping them out soon after that.\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. I plan to print 2500 copies of SITHRAH 4 in China which will reduce my costs big time.\n2000 to 2500 copies = $12,000\nShipping of my last campaign was about $10,000\nFees and Taxes +$3,000 (low estimate)\nLeftover Production Costs $2000\nFUNDING GOAL = $27,000\nWell, I was finally able to reduce the International shipping this time. :)\nInternational shipping is unfortunately very expensive, but I have managed to reduce the cost quite a bit since the last Kickstarter. I've partnered with a EU distributor to help reduce the international costs and so I'm happy to say we are now EU Friendly!\nI will add a shipping chart for Add-Ons as soon as I figure out how to do it best. Check back before the campaign is over to see how to add individual items to your pledge.\nJust like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed book. And so\u2026 ART CONTEST!!! Submit your art during the month of March to get a chance at getting it published in the gallery of Sithrah: Book 4. Send me your amazing artistic version of the Sithrah characters to be printed in the book... FOREVER! Try to keep the art from having any spoilers of the next books or they won't be able to be included in the contest. If you make it into the book, you will be credited with your art. These are the winners that were printed in Sithrah 1:\nThe page dimensions are 6.75 inches (wide) x 10.5 inches (tall). Please make sure all art is 300dpi when scanned. The deadline for submission is the end of March 2018. Please send all submissions to CoffeeTableComics@gmail.com for consideration. The following month, I will display all the entries for everyone to see and we can all vote for our favorites. Then I'll pick the final winner(s) for the book. :)\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nThanks for your support in making SITHRAH the best graphic novel series it can be!\nI can't express in words just how much your support means to me and my family.

My first book series called reMIND took seven years to complete. In 2015 I quit my great paying job at Dreamworks Animation to work on SITHRAH full-time and I am now raising funds for the 3rd book in the series. (Curious what I worked on in Hollywood? My IMDB page here)\n  SITHRAH is a sci-fi about a little girl trying to find her father after their plane crashes in a unfamiliar land.

(DOMESTIC ONLY PLEASE)\n  (If you are International and REALLY want to add something to your order, please message me and we can work out the shipping costs)\nI'll be adding more Add-Ons to this section as the campaign grows so please check back for more soon!\nSithrah has been a big experiment with the comic format by mixing subtle prose with comic panels. My hope is to blur the lines between comics, children's books, and novels without making it jarring for the reader. Here are a bunch of double page spreads from book 3.\nMost of my inspiration comes from the comic artists of the 90's when I refined my drawing style. Later I became influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling and have been trying to make comics that have a similar depth and feeling.\nFeel free to read through my archive at Webtoons.com where I post weekly updates. I will continue to post new pages online until the full story is complete.\nSITHRAH 3: The Symbol - will be 192 full color pages in a hardcover book with a cloth binding. 1000 copies will have a signed and numbered bookplate. The interior pages will be printed on thick, high quality paper printed with the same care and attention to detail that I put into reMIND Volume 1 and 2.

The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping. This means I'll probably be getting the books around September or October. I have helpers who will help me fulfill all the orders again and so we will try to get everything shipped within a month. (depending on how big this campaign gets)\nI put November as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario but I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by September and I will start shipping them out soon after that.\nPeople ask me why I chose to self-publish SITHRAH and reMIND. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough, a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first kickstarter back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print my first book. Then in 2012 I launched a second campaign for reMIND 2 and it raised a whopping $107,500! Although it was a crazy big campaign delivering so many books, it all worked out. Better yet, I now have a distributor for my books which was one of the biggest problems to overcome with self-publishing.\nThe funny thing is now that I have beautiful books published I am approached by publishers like I had dreamed about. I could easily sign a contract with a publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of what's important to a publisher. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn but overall I love self-publishing now. Thanks to Kickstarter and you guys for helping me I'll keep doing this as long as I can. :)\nMy business plan is to continue printing high quality first-printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind.\nI hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see them on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. I plan to print 3000 copies of SITHRAH 3 in China which will reduce my costs big time.\n3000 copies = $14,000\nShipping of my last campaign was $13,000\nFees and Taxes +$3,000 (low estimate)\nFUNDING GOAL = $30,000\nIt seem like every time I launch a Kickstarter the shipping prices go up a few times before I finally ship out the books and so this is all still a pretty low estimate of everything. \nAll single book domestic orders will get free shipping.\nInternational orders will be charged $22 for shipping 1 book. Canada and Mexico will be charged $14 for 1 book. Multiple book tiers will be charged International shipping according to weight. I know it adds up. Sorry, there's nothing much I can do to lower the shipping costs though.\nAdd Ons are domestic only please. But if you really REALLY REALLY want to add on something to your international order then please message me and we can work out the details of how much you should pledge. :)\nART CONTEST - SUBMIT YOUR ART!\nJust like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed book.

(LOCKED)\n  Hi, my name is Jason Brubaker and I have been working on graphic novels since 2006. My first book series called reMIND took seven years to complete. In 2015 I quit my great paying job at Dreamworks Animation to work on SITHRAH full-time. \n  SITHRAH is an all-age sci-fi about a little girl trying to find her father after their plane crashes in a unfamiliar land. That's when she starts seeing an invisible creature who has been following her around. Is he protecting her or just along for the ride? It's not long until she runs into a young man named Dino who is running from his own ghosts. Will they find the crash site? Will her father be there?\nThis series will be 6 books long when complete. Each book will have a different color cloth binding.\n            How Do Add-Ons Work? (DOMESTIC ONLY PLEASE)\nI'll be using BackerKit to handle Add-Ons (surveys, shipping and more) Once you're a backer you can add to your order (DOMESTIC ONLY) like this:\nAdd up the total of your Add-Ons\nClick the blue \"Manage\" button in the upper right corner.\nAdd the total of your Add-Ons to your pledge amount.\nYou don't need to change the tier you've selected.\nThat's it! After the campaign closes I'll send you a survey through BackerKit and you will be able to easily select all the Add-Ons you wanted.\n          (If you are International and REALLY want to add something to your order, please message me and we can work out the shipping costs)\nI'll be adding more Add-Ons to this section as the campaign grows so please check back for more soon!\nSithrah has been a big experiment with the comic format by mixing subtle prose with comic panels. My hope is to blur the lines between comics, children's books, and novels without making it jarring for the reader. Here are a bunch of double page spreads from book 2.\nMost of my inspiration comes from the comic artists of the 90's when I refined my drawing style. Later I became influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling and have been trying to make comics that have a similar depth and feeling.\nFeel free to read through my archive at Webtoons.com where I post weekly updates. I will continue to post new pages online until the full story is complete.\nSITHRAH 2 will be 160 full color pages in a hardcover book with a cloth binding. 1000 copies will have a signed and numbered bookplate. The interior pages will be printed on thick, high quality paper printed with the same care and attention to detail that I put into reMIND Volume 1 and 2. The retail price will be $24.95.\nSITHRAH 2: Propositions (160 pages)\nSITHRAH 1: Kingdom of the Air (96 pages)\nJust so you know some history of my books: The first printing of my first book, reMIND, was printed in spring of 2011 with 2500 copies that sold out in about 6 months. It got much praise from fans and won some awards and achievements including:\n2010 Xeric Grant Winner \n2012 Great Graphic Novels for Teens List (GGNT) \n2012 Selected for Arkansas State Reading list\nNovember at the latest! In other words, JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS! This will make a great Christmas present for kids and adults. :) So make sure to stock up and add lots and lots of copies as stocking stuffers.\nOkay, let me backup and explain how this will happen...\nSITHRAH 2 will be ready to go to the printer shortly after this Kickstarter ends. The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping. This means I'll probably be getting the books around September or October. I have helpers who will help me fulfill all the orders again and so we will try to get everything shipped within a month. (depending on how big this campaign gets)\nI put November as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario but I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by September and I will start shipping them out soon after that.\nPeople ask me why I chose to self-publish SITHRAH and reMIND. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough, a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first kickstarter back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print my first book. Then in 2012 I launched a second campaign for reMIND 2 and it raised a whopping $107,500! Although it was a crazy big campaign delivering so many books, it all worked out. Better yet, I now have a distributor for my books which was one of the biggest problems to overcome with self-publishing.\nThe funny thing is now that I have beautiful books published I am approached by publishers like I had dreamed about. I could easily sign a contract with a publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of what's important to a publisher. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn but overall I love self-publishing now. Thanks to Kickstarter and you guys for helping me I'll keep doing this as long as I can. :)\nMy business plan is to continue printing high quality first-printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind.\nI hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see them on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. I plan to print 3500 copies of SITHRAH 2 in China which will reduce my costs big time.\n3500 copies = $14,000\nPlus Shipping, Fees and Taxes +$10,000 (low estimate)\nFUNDING GOAL = $24,000\nBetter yet, if we can blow past this goal then I will be able to unlock other books that are waiting to be printed. :)\nAll domestic orders will get free shipping. \nInternational orders will be charged $20 for shipping 1 book. Canada and Mexico will be charged $13 for 1 book. Multiple book tiers will be charged International shipping according to weight. I know it adds up. Sorry, there's nothing much I can do to lower the shipping costs though.\nAdd Ons are domestic only please. But if you really REALLY REALLY want to add on something to your international order then please message me and we can work out the details of how much you should pledge. :)\nJust like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed book. And so\u2026 ART CONTEST!!! I'm going to ask for art submissions while this campaign is live to give you a chance to get your art featured in the gallery of Sithrah: Book 2. Send me your amazing artistic version of the Sithrah characters to be printed in the book... FOREVER! I will credit you in the book too. These are the winners that were printed in Sithrah 1:\nThe page dimensions are 6.75 inches (wide) x 10.5 inches (tall). Please make sure all art is 300dpi when scanned. The deadline for submission is the closing of this campaign (May 31st at 5PM MST). Please send all submissions to J@CoffeeTableComics.com for consideration. Once this campaign is over, I will display all the entries for everyone to see and vote on their favorite. Then I'll pick the final winner(s) for the book. :)\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nThanks for your support in making SITHRAH 2 the best graphic novel series it can be!\n(Now I need to run around my house to shake off this nervous feeling of running another Kickstarter. Breath. Breath. It will be okay. Okay, I'm better now.)\nI can't express in words just how much your support means to me and my family. Thank you again and again.\n- Jason", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my 4th Kickstarter campaign and although I have successfully delivered all the rewards in my last campaigns I am even more prepared and confident that it will be a super smooth campaign. \n\nFor instance, before I would have 80% of my book finished, but this time I have it 100% finished and even 100% of additional books finished that might end up being stretch goals. I have people in place to help me with shipping again. Not to mention I am working full-time on comics now instead of just after I get home from work. I have gone above and beyond to deliver on all my past campaigns even to the point of getting freelance jobs to help finish paying for stretch goals that the campaign didn't fully fund. \n\nThere is always a chance that something could go horribly wrong and delays could happen but I have given myself a few extra months of buffer time if anything goes down.

Go to www.skyheartcomic.com to stay up to date on the project!\nI'm Jake Parker, and I'm making SkyHeart Book I: The Star Seed. \nSkyHeart is an all-ages graphic novel inspired by my favorite movies and comics. If you liked Miyazaki's Nausicaa, Star Wars, Tokien's The Hobbit, and Indiana Jones, then you just might become a fan of SkyHeart. \nSkyHeart will be a 7.5 x 10 inch 100+ page book that comes in both soft and hard cover editions. \nThe book is being written and drawn by me and is scheduled to be finished in May of 2016, and shipped out to backers in October of 2016.\nFor years I've been developing this project on the side, but it was so big, and so involved that it scared me! I felt I wasn't ready to create this book. \nAfter years working in animation as a concept artist (Horton Hears a Who, Rio, Epic) and comics (Flight, Missile Mouse, Rocket Raccoon) my skills as an artist and storyteller got better. I feel like I'm finally at a level now where I can take on a project like this and do it justice.\nSo...I'm going for it!\nThe Idea for SkyHeart was planted in my imagination over 15 years ago while on a road trip though the Arizona desert. I imagined the desert floor vanishing, leaving only an abyss of clouds with the rock formations suspended above them in the air.\nFrom that seed of an idea grew an entire world of characters and their struggles, with mythologies, cities, and technology fleshing out the rest of this universe.\nI love classic tales of adventure, of good versus evil, and struggles with real consequences. Which is why I look to films like Star Wars, Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, and Indiana Jones, and books like the Hobbit for inspiration. Just because a story is all-ages, doesn't mean I can't enjoy it as much as my kids do!\nSkyHeart takes place on Airth, a world literally torn apart by a pre-historic war between the gods who created it. That war left the planet divided into 4 realms:\nThe Stratos, a chain of islands high in the sky where the Sylph people live.\nThe Rimland, a massive ring of continents and giant islands where most of the inhabitants of Airth live. Wake, our main protagonist, lives here.\nThe Abyss, a stretch of atmosphere filled with incredible cloud formations and tiny floating islands. Limberg and Grimm are from here. \nThe Core, an ocean covered rocky sphere filled with colossal caves. The Tengru, monsters and beasts, and the Dark Lord live down here.\nIn that great ancient war, the beings of Light were able to defeat the Shadows and banish them to the core, but not without a great cost. Losing most of their godly energy, they left Airth to search the universe for more power. Their children stayed to protect what was left of Airth from the evil trapped in the core. \nThousands of years later these pre-historic events have become myth, and the inhabitants of Airth are consumed with their own wars for power. \nHowever, deep in the core, the Shadows have not forgotten, and have begun sending their agents to the surface to harvest the people of their life force. Once enough of this power has been taken the Shadows will rise again to destroy the rest of Airth and start a new world.\nWake and his crew set off to find the Star Seed with the hopes of both saving Wake's mother, and the world of Airth. That is, if they can beat Malsang and his sinister tengru to it's secret location. \nHow Do Add Ons Work?\nI'll be using Backer Kit to handle rewards and add-ons.

Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. \nThank you!\n\nI'll be updating the add ons and adding more if the project funds and we hit stretch goals. I want to add a map of Airth, a poster, and more, so check back.\nI'm asking for A LOT of money. I've got a great youtube video here that outlines where all this money is going and how I arrived at this number. Basically, half the funds are going to the production of the content, and the other half is getting the books printed and shipped. \nHere's a breakdown of where the funds are going:\nPrinting: $12,000 This covers getting the books printed and shipped to my house. (15.4%)\nProduction: $42,000 This covers my time writing and drawing the book, paying a colorist, editor, and building the book and getting it ready for print. (53.8%)\nFees: $8000 This covers Backer Kit, Kickstarter and Amazon fees. (9%)\nShipping: $16,000 This covers packing up the books and shipping charges. I will be shipping the books PRIORITY MAIL to US backers to ensure the safe delivery of each package. International orders will all be sent FIRST CLASS. Orders will be packed in a bubble wrap sleeve, then put into heavy duty cardboard case. I talk all about how I ship things in this video. (23.4%)\nThis book will be produced in the spring and summer of 2016 and will be delivered to backers in September of that same year. Here's a rough timeline of the production:\nNovember: Run the Kickstarter\nDecember: Finish the SkyHeart manuscript\nJanuary - June: Drawing and coloring\nJuly: Building the book, and prepping for print\nAugust - September: Printing the book\nOctober: Packing and Shipping\nHi I'm Jake Parker, and here's a little bit about me written in third person to sound official: \nJake Parker is an illustrator and cartoonist.

Today's campaign is a bit different, though, because I'd like to print three books this time around. Take a look!\nThe main event! Cucumber and Almond's quest brings them to Trebleopolis just in time for Queen Cymbal's birthday, but the party stops when Noisemaster, second of the Nightmare Knight's minions, threatens to reduce the city to rubble. (Or, uh, maybe the party starts? It's kind of hard to tell with that guy.)\nCucumber Quest's third book will be about 240 pages, featuring \"Chapter 2: Makin' Some Noise\" and the following 41-page interlude, bonus comics, and more! Standard softcovers as well as limited-edition hardcovers will be available.\n It's been two years since CQ's first book was printed, and now, my supply of copies is running very low. To ensure that they don't run out completely, a portion of our goal will be used to fund a reprint.\nEarlier this year, I printed an extremely limited run of an art booklet called Cucumber Dressed, featuring CQ characters in various cute outfits. Since this little book sold out so quickly, I've been asked several times about my plans for a reprint. I'd like to do more than that!\nWith your help, I'll be able to print an even nicer edition of Cucumber Dressed, nearly twice as long as the original booklet. This 8\"x10\" \"Spring 2015\" issue will include 48 full-color pages featuring old illustrations, new illustrations, and some surprises!\nMini Print Set\nA collection of seven postcard-sized (6\"x4\") prints, each featuring a character from the comic. The previous two sets, (which are still available at certain reward levels,) are pictured above and below. Who will be the stars of this year's print set? That's to be determined by a backer poll!\n Bookplate Sticker\nA 6\"x4\" vinyl sticker, signed by me, which can be placed in the inside cover of your book. Or, like, anywhere. I don't judge.\nThree all-new bookplate designs will be available this time around, so if you pledge to a reward tier including three bookplates, you'll receive one of each!\n\"Beautiful Boy\" Shirt\nCount Legato worked so hard in the Kickstarter video, huh? Let's throw him a bone! At certain reward levels, you'll receive this \"Beautiful Boy\" t-shirt, inspired by the Legato Manor portion of Chapter 2. (Oh, and this shirt's for everyone--not just boys!)\nAt the $200 pledge level, you'll receive an inked drawing of the Cucumber Quest character of your choice. This is a physical reward.\nAt the $500 level, I'll work with you to create a custom profile card of yourself as a resident of Dreamside! Or a loved one. Or maybe just your original character. It's up to you! This is a digital reward.\n(And don't worry--it won't actually be Sir Bacon holding your face on a sign. Unless you want that!)\nAt the $1000 level, you'll receive a truly one-of-a-kind reward: a handcrafted paper cutout featuring the Cucumber Quest character of your choice! You can also choose one of the two rewards listed above.\n...And that's it. Thank you so much for reading!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn the past, I've shipped backer rewards with only the help of a few family members, a pretty huge undertaking that severely cut into my time to work on anything else. This time around, Breadpig and Amplifier will be handling fulfillment, which will mean much a timelier, more efficient shipping process. \n\nSince the comic portion of this book is already complete, all that remains is editing for print and completing bonus materials, which will take just a few months. Printing will be handled by the same reliable company that has produced the first two books.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Rewards Shipping", "update_content": "Hi again!"}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "1,931 backers pledged $119,908"}, {"Project launches": "OCTOBER 22, 2014"}]}], "comment_no": 67, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1003106610/cucumber-quest-book-three", "project_name": "Cucumber Quest Book Three"}}, {"backer": "Daniel Lieske", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "300% FUNDED!

My first book was called reMIND which took seven years to complete. Now I have been working on a brand new story called SITHRAH.\nWhat is SITHRAH?\nSITHRAH is an all-age sci-fi about a seven year old girl who ends up alone when her plane crashes in a unfamiliar land. Trying to locate her missing father, she starts seeing an invisible creature that has been following her. This book will be the first in a series of 5 or 6 books depending on how long it takes me to tell the story. :)\nI was inspired by comic artists in the 90's when I refined my drawing style and then was influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling over the last decade.\nFeel free to read through as many pages as you want on my website here. I will continue to post new pages online until the full story is complete.\nAs you can see I'm experimenting with the comic format by mixing subtle prose with the comic panels. My hope is to blur the lines between comics, children's books, and novels without making it jarring for the reader.\nBook Specs.\nSITHRAH will be 96 full color pages in a hardcover book. 1000 copies will include a signed and numbered bookplate. The interior pages will be printed on thick, high quality paper printed with the same care and attention to detail that I put into reMIND Volume 1 and 2. The retail price will be $19.95.\nJust so you know some history of my books: The first printing of my first book, reMIND, was printed in spring of 2011 with 2500 copies that sold out in about 6 months. It got much praise from fans on Amazon and has won some awards and achievements during and after the production including:\n2010 Xeric Grant Winner\n2012 Great Graphic Novels for Teens List (GGNT)\n2012 Selected for Arkansas State Reading list.\nPublication Date\nSITHRAH will be ready to go to the printer in October 2014 if everything goes according to plan. The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping to happen. This means I'll probably be getting the books around January or maybe February if the holidays get in the way (which I assume they will)\nI put April as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario if I can't get the printing started when planned. But I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by January so I can start shipping them out soon after that.\nWhy Self-Publish?\nPeople ask me why I chose to self-publish reMIND and SITHRAH. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first kickstarter back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print the first volume. Now I HAD to self-publish as well as learn to distribute and sell my books. My original kickstarter campaign has been essential in getting reMIND where it is now and it has opened up doors that I never thought possible. Then in 2012 I launched a second campaign for reMIND 2 and it raised a whopping $107,500! Although it was a crazy big campaign delivering so many books, it all worked out. Better yet, I now have a distributor for my books which was one of the biggest problems to overcome with self-publishing.\nThe funny thing is now that I have beautiful books published I am approached by big publishers like I had dreamed about. I could easily sign a contract with a good publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of a publisher who is mainly focused on the bottom line. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn but overall I love self-publishing as well as owning all the rights to my stories.\nMy business plan is to get to the point where I can make a living off of my self-publishing by always printing high quality first printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind once I figure that part out a little better.\nI hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see it on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.\nMoney\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. With SITHRAH I have decided that my goal is to print 4000 copies for the first printing. This will further reduce the printing costs and give me more stock so I don't sell out in 6 months like I did with reMIND. Wait, what am I saying. I'd love to sell out in 6 months! :)\nAnyway, so my printer quote is $11,500 for 4000 hardcover copies. In my last campaign I had crazy shipping costs, taxes and unexpected fees and so I'm trying to add some of these fees to the campaign funding goal. If I can raise over $17,000 I will be in a great spot to cover most of the expense of Sithrah Book 1. As usual, I'm always adding my own money to the mix and I will do the same with this one to make sure the book turns out amazing.\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nThanks for your support in making SITHRAH the best graphic novel set it can be!\nTHANK YOU ONE MILLION TIMES!\n- Jason\nArt Submission:\nJust like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed book. And so\u2026 I'm going to ask for art submissions while this campaign is live to give you a chance to get your art featured in the gallery of Sithrah: Book 1. Send me your amazing artistic version of the Sithrah characters and I will choose some of them to be printed in the book. FOREVER! I will credit you in the book too.\nThe page dimensions are 6.75 inches (wide) x 10.5 inches (tall). Please make sure all art is 300dpi when scanned. The deadline for submission is the closing of this campaign. Please send all submissions to Jason@remindblog.com for consideration. Once this campaign is over, I will display all the entries for everyone to see and vote on their favorite. Then I'll pick the final winner(s) for the book. :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have had a bunch of experience with Kickstarter campaigns in the past with my last two successful reMIND campaigns. Together they have raised over $120,000 on Kickstarter and although I have had unexpected expense, I was able to get everything shipped out and completely fulfilled for both campaigns. \n\nThe biggest challenges that I see are shipping and distribution of all the books around the world in a timely manner.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT GUYS !!!\n------------------------------------------\nThe Perfect Sketchbook\n(60 pages of Artist Grade 100% Cotton, watercolor paper) \nby Erwin lian & Bynd Artisan\n\nThe Story\nOver the past 14 months or so, I have been traveling around the world and sketching... France, Germany, Spain, Italy, across Asia and the list continues to grow. The term \"sketch-hunter\", coined by Robert Henri, describes me best. I sketch almost daily, noting down everything from interesting people to the places I have visited. Whether it is in a moving subway cabin, a car, a bus or on a Tut-Tut, I sketch.\nhttp://cherngzhi.tumblr.com/\nme, my sketchbook and world travels\n\nMy passion has led me to try out numerous sketchbooks and I have tried using everything available in the market. With the need to perfect my watercolor sketches, I began to search for that perfect sketchbook. One that should be hardbound, compact, binds well, opens flat, and filled with  Artist Grade 100% cotton paper (makes it strong but pliable). Unfortunately, I couldn't find such a sketchbook out there... so, I decided to make one.\nI went on and searched for quality sketchbooks manufacturers and discovered Bynd Artisan\u00ae; a premium leather and paper label in Singapore. The people behind this brand have been in the book-making business for more than 70 years, and were very receptive of my ideas on a sketchbook. They agreed to collaborate on this project, and their sincerity & earnestness to create the Perfect Sketchbook moved me beyond words.\n\nThe Perfect Sketchbook is a top-of-the-line sketchbook made with quality materials sourced from around the world.\n\nStay updated with our Facebook page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theperfectsketchbook\n_____________________________________________________________\n      PLAY\n\nphotography by Erwin Lian\nThe ability to assess + establish correct values are two of the most important skills required in painting. Chroma inherits values and this is why many painters will first complete an under-painting (with only values) before applying chroma. Having a value chart with you, allows for you to place it against the subject to properly assess values.\nMost artists hold their sketchbook in a certain way to keep it flat. The value chart was designed for ease of use for both left- and right-handed Artists. So if you are a left holder, you may flip to the left for the value chart and if you are a right holder, you may flip to the right for it. While this could be more user-friendly with a portrait- format book. The decision for a landscape-format was strictly based off reliable data which informs us that users who use a book of this size would prefer the landscape-format. Of course, given a chance in the future, I will release a series of different sizes and formats\nLocating the right value with a value chart\nYou may be able to upgrade the existing value chart by punching holes on each step. As seen in the image above, I managed to pick the right value for the grass by hovering my value chart over it. Squinting your eyes helps a little with the assessment process. However, this would entail that your sketchbook be less aesthetically pleasing, and this is why The Perfect Sketchbook that you will receive will not come with these punched holes.\n___________________________________________________________\n\nGRAIN DIRECTION IN PAPER.\nThe Perfect Sketchbook requires up to 3 full sheets of watercolor paper. Why so many for such a small book? Well, that\u2019s due to proper grain direction.  \nWhy paper grain is important?\nIf the grain is wrong, many undesirable things will happen:\n1) The book will not open very well. \n2) The paper will crease and buckle (due to paper expansion) 3) Stress is put on the stitching and could even break it; \nAn illustration to the utilization of paper with proper grain direction:\nAs there would be more paper wastage when we consider grain direction, I am working on possibly re-cutting the waste to create paper swatches that can be inserted into The Perfect Sketchbook's inner pocket. The Artist can make use of these inserts to test their colors prior to actual application. This suggestion has yet been finalized, and I will keep everyone updated.\nMany sketchbook-makers may not consider the grain direction in order to reduce cost of production. However, this will result in poor quality.\n                                                          Please note that Singapore-based backers will also enjoy the free shipping offered to America-based backers. Simply back the reward at the amount without international shipping charges. Free shipment is ONLY for Singapore and U.S. based backers.

Yet at its heart, each and every book had its beginning much like in the days of old - hand-designed and prototyped by a small band of craftsmen who grew up in the trade.\nBynd Artisan was conceptualized to celebrate the joy of traditional paper and leather making.

Kindly note that funds are subjected to 5% commission from Kickstarter and 5% from Amazon for credit card transaction fees. I have made most of the graphics and shot the photographs myself.

Please scroll.\nJason Brubakers grafischer Roman reMIND ist einfach nur genial. Die Figuren und die Handlung sind einf\u00fchlsam entwickelt, und die Zeichnungen \u00e4hneln kleinen Gem\u00e4lden. Als ich die Online-Version vor einigen Jahren entdeckte, wollte ich sie sofort ins Deutsche \u00fcbersetzen. Ich h\u00e4tte mir nie tr\u00e4umen lassen, dass Jason mir das erlaubt. Sollte diese Kampagne erfolgreich sein, wird f\u00fcr mich ein Traum wahr (auch wenn er mich und meinen Partner Will Hahn viel Zeit und Arbeit gekostet hat).\nWas ist das Ziel?\nWill Hahn und ich m\u00f6chten die deutsche Fassung von reMIND in einem einzigen Band mit hochwertigem Festeinband und Fadenheftung herausbringen. Das sind beinahe 400 vollfarbige Seiten mit wunderbaren Bildern und einer packenden Geschichte.\nreMIND enth\u00e4lt viele intelligente Feinheiten f\u00fcr erwachsene LeserInnen, aber auch alberne Gags f\u00fcr Kinder. Es erz\u00e4hlt die Geschichte der Freundschaft zwischen Sonja, der Leuchtturmw\u00e4rterin von Cripple Peaks, und ihrem Kater Victuals, der eines Tages verschwindet. Als er wieder auftaucht, kann er sprechen und geht auf den Hinterbeinen.\nDieses Projekt ist eine Herzensangelegenheit f\u00fcr mich, denn ich halte reMIND f\u00fcr einen der besten grafischen Romane der letzten Jahre. Ich w\u00fcrde ihn gerne mit meinen drei T\u00f6chtern teilen, die aber (noch) kein Englisch k\u00f6nnen. Mit Deiner Unterst\u00fctzung k\u00f6nnen Will und ich dieses Ziel erreichen. Hier gibt es \u00fcbrigens eine kleine Leseprobe.\nWer sind wir?\nEigentlich bin ich, Katharina, studierte F\u00f6rsterin... ich wei\u00df, das klingt nicht nach der idealen Voraussetzung, eine Geschichte aus dem Englischen zu \u00fcbersetzen. Aber ich habe eine schottische Zweitfamilie (lange Geschichte), bei der ich die Sprache sehr gut gelernt habe.\nVor etwa 1 \u00bd Jahren machte ich mich dann als Indie Autorin selbst\u00e4ndig, und zwar in beiden Sprachen. Seither sind von mir sieben Romane (zwei historische und f\u00fcnf phantastische) und einige Kurzgeschichten erschienen. Ich bin zwar (noch) nicht so bekannt wie J.K. Rowling, aber ganz gut im Rennen und habe auch schon einige Preise eingeheimst (Indie Book of the Day, B.R.A.G. Medallion, Qindie). Was mich am Indie-Dasein so begeistert, ist die M\u00f6glichkeit, Feedback der LeserInnen innerhalb kurzer Zeit umzusetzen und sogar bereits ver\u00f6ffentlichte Romane noch besser zu machen. Vor einiger Zeit nahm ich mir einen Partner, dessen erster Teil seiner epischen Fantasy Serie \"Judgement's Tale\" demn\u00e4chst in unserem Verlag erscheinen wird. Will ist zust\u00e4ndig f\u00fcr die Codierung einer druckf\u00e4higen pdf-Datei.\nWer hat's erfunden?\nJason Brubaker mag vielleicht nicht weltbekannt sein, doch die Filme, an denen er mitgearbeitet hat, sind es. Er arbeitete am Look von Kung Fu Panda 1&2, Riddick und Blade mit, um nur einige zu nennen. Mit reMIND hat er einen langj\u00e4hrigen Traum umgesetzt. Er hat das Buch sehr erfolgreich in zwei B\u00e4nden mit Festeinband ver\u00f6ffentlicht (auf Englisch nat\u00fcrlich). Die Geschichte wurde bisher mit zahlreichen Preisen ausgezeichnet (wie ich finde wohlverdient), darunter The Xeric Award 2010, the Top 10 Graphic Novels Star Tribune 2011 Award, and the GGNT List 2012 and LitPick 5 Star Award 2014.\nWof\u00fcr wird das Geld benutzt?\nDer gr\u00f6\u00dfte Teil des Geldes flie\u00dft in den Druck der B\u00fccher und in die Beschaffung der von Dir gew\u00e4hlten Belohnungen. Das Buch wird mit einem embossierten Leinencover gebunden. Dabei werden die Seiten nicht einfach geklebt, sondern gen\u00e4ht, so wie es bei guten B\u00fcchern \u00fcblich ist.\nEin weitaus kleinerer Teil des Geldes, der aber nicht zu untersch\u00e4tzen ist, geht f\u00fcr das Porto drauf. Auch Kickstarter und die Kreditkartenfirma wollen je einen Anteil, was etwa 10% des Endbetrags ausmacht. Zu guter Letzt verlangt Vater Staat seinen Teil. F\u00fcr die Einfuhr der gedruckten B\u00fccher (ein Druck in Deutschland w\u00e4re viel zu teuer) muss ich 7% Mwst. zahlen. Immerhin sind B\u00fccher wenigstens zollfrei.\nWas gibt's zur Belohnung?\nDanke f\u00fcr die Frage. Hier ist ein \u00dcberblick \u00fcber Deine Wahlm\u00f6glichkeiten:\nRisiken und Herausforderungen\nNat\u00fcrlich gibt es immer Risiken (z.B. k\u00f6nnte das Schiff sinken, das die fertig gedruckten B\u00fccher zu mir schippert), aber die gr\u00f6\u00dften H\u00fcrden sind bereits genommen. Die Geschichte ist bereits komplett \u00fcbersetzt, und der Text befindet sich in den von Jason daf\u00fcr vorgesehenen Sprechblasen. Will ist bereits dabei, die fertigen Seiten zusammenzustellen. Der Rest (Korrekturlesen, finaler Satz und Druck) ist nur eine Frage der Zeit. Aber die sollten wir uns auch nehmen und nichts \u00fcberst\u00fcrzen, damit am Ende ein Buch dabei herauskommt, auf das wir stolz sein k\u00f6nnen. Trotzdem werden wir nat\u00fcrlich nicht tr\u00f6deln.\n_______________________________________________________\nEnglish Explanations\nPLAY\n\n(at the end of the video I meant \"the rewards on your right\" not left. Sorry)\nImho, Jason Brubaker's graphic novel reMIND is pure genius. His characters and plot have been developed with great care and the artwork resembles lovingly detailed oil paintings. When I discovered the online-version a few years back, I instantly knew I had to translate it into German. I never dreamt that Jason would allow me to do this. Should this campaign be successful, a dream will come true for me (one my partner Will Hahn and I worked really hard for).\nWhat is the goal?\nWill Hahn's and my goal is to publish the German translation of reMIND in a single hardcover volume of the same high quality as the original. That means nearly 400 full color pages with beautiful pictures and a clever story.\nreMIND contains many intelligent subtleties for grown up readers but also funny gags for kids. It tells the story of the friendship between Sonja, the lighthouse keeper of Cripple Peaks, and her tomcat Victuals who vanishes one day. When he returns, he can talk and walks on his hind legs.\nThis project is close to my heart, because I think reMIND is one of the best graphic novels in recent years. I would love to share it with my three daughters who cannot read English (yet). With your support, Will's and my dream will come true. BTW, here is a link to a reading sample of the German version.\nWho are we?\nOriginally, I\u2019m a studied forester\u2026 I know that doesn\u2019t sound like the ideal premise to translate a novel. However, I\u2019ve got a spare family in Scotland (long story) where I learned the language quite well.\nI'm also an author. About 1 \u00bd years ago, I decided to go Indie in both languages, German and English. Since then, I have published seven novels (two historical and five speculative fiction) and several short stories. I might not (yet) be as famous as J.K. Rowling but I'm well up in the field and also won a few awards (Indie Book of the Day, B.R.A.G. Medallion, Qindie). What I like best about being an Indie is the possibility to listen to my readers\u2019 comments to improve my books, even published ones.\nA little while ago, I partnered with Will Hahn, whose first part of his Epic Fantasy series \"Judgement's Tale\" will be published by our small publishing company on July 4th. Will is in charge of coding a printable pdf.\nWho invented the story?\nJason Brubaker is not world famous, but the films he worked on are. He helped to shape Kung Fu Panda 1&2, Riddick and Blade, to name a few. With reMIND, he made his longtime dream come true. He published the novel in two beautiful hardcover volumes. Since he started the project, it\u2019s been honored with many well earned rewards including The Xeric Award 2010, the Top 10 Graphic Novels Star Tribune 2011 Award, and the GGNT List 2012 and LitPick 5 Star Award 2014.\nWhat will we use the money for?\nMost of the money will be used to fund printing and the fulfillment of the reward tiers. The book will be printed with a linen cover, and the spine will be stitched not glued (it's like any good hardcover should be).\nA much smaller part, but one that shouldn't be underestimated, is used for postage and packing. Also Kickstarter and the credit card company take their share, together roughly 10% of the final sum. Finally, I'll have to pay 7% sales tax for importing the printed books to Germany (printing them here would be way too expensive). At least I won't have to pay duty on books.\nWhat\u2019s in it for you?\nGlad you asked. See the picture for a graphical overview of what you can choose from (or read the reward tiers on your right).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNat\u00fcrlich gibt es immer Risiken (z.B. k\u00f6nnte das Schiff sinken, das die fertig gedruckten B\u00fccher zu mir schippert), aber die gr\u00f6\u00dften H\u00fcrden sind bereits genommen.

Naturally, we should take not rush things to make sure that in the end, we'll get a book we can be proud of.

Thank You All!\nCheck back often and keep an eye on Emperor's New Clothes.\nHello! I'm Jonathan Liu, and I'd like to introduce you to my first Kickstarter game, Emperor's New Clothes.\nI've been reviewing board games and writing about Kickstarter on GeekDad.com for a while now, and I've been fascinated with the way that Kickstarter has changed the board game industry, for better or worse. I'm constantly writing about best practices in running a campaign, but it's easy to talk when I haven't actually done anything. So this is my way of diving into an actual Kickstarter campaign to see how accurate my observations really are.\nIn case you've never used Kickstarter before and you're wondering what this is all about, here's my short explanation of Kickstarter in under 3 minutes.\nOne of the things I love most about board games is how they immerse you in a story\u2014when a game's mechanics mesh with the theme, you feel transported. Instead of drawing cards or rolling dice, you become a hero on a quest, or a monster stalking tasty heroes. That's what I'm striving for in my game: that moment when your imagination takes over and you're not just playing the game, but in the game.\nWhen I was thinking about a game idea, the classic story of The Emperor's New Clothes came to mind. It's a familiar tale that still has relevance in today's world of Ponzi schemes and fake girlfriends and Internet scams. \nI imagined the players taking on the roles of characters from the story, scheming to outwit the others or, if they've been duped, trying to salvage a few scraps of dignity.\nI've borrowed a lot of mechanics from my own favorite games, and in my opinion they blend together really well. Chances are, whatever type of game you like to play, I've included something of that sort in Emperor's New Clothes. Well, except for zombies. Yet.\nIf I've learned anything about Kickstarter it's that you should never underestimate how much work it is and how much help you're going to need to pull it off. The fine folks at Game Salute will be running the campaign and in charge of fulfillment. Fortunately, you don't need to rely on my expertise in getting this game printed and shipped. I've written about enough Kickstarter projects to know that I'm not interested in filling up my living room with boxes.\nOn top of that, I've enlisted some great artists for the project. I'm an artist myself, but I didn't think it would be feasible to run a Kickstarter campaign and create all the artwork without delaying the delivery of the finished game. I'm really excited to be working with all of these amazing folks: for some, this is their first board game project, and I can't wait for you to see the results! Check out our growing list of artists down below.\n\nOne of the cool advantages of writing for GeekDad is the chance to find out about new companies and technology, but it's not often that I actually get to be directly involved. I discovered Wysiayg Press when I first started working on Emperor's New Clothes, and their new technology seemed perfectly tailored for my game.\nHere's Mac Barnett of Wysiayg Press to tell you a little bit more about Regulated Operator Optical Screening. I'm sure you'll be as impressed by the result as I was when I first laid eyes on my prototype.\nI've backed too many Kickstarter board games just based on the idea even though the rules were still in development, the art was incomplete, or the components hadn't yet been finalized. Often that's turned out just fine and I enjoyed the finished product. But at other times, I've experienced a bit of buyer's remorse, knowing that I overpaid for a game I probably would have passed over in a game store.\nBecause of that, I'm making this commitment: in this section, you'll be able to download the most current rulebook, plus a print-and-play so that you can try the game out yourself. Obviously, we know you don't have the same ROOS capabilities as Wysiayg Press, but we've found a way to approximate it in a PDF file that will have similar results for most people.\nPlease note these key differences between the print-and-play and the final game: The print-and-play will include cut-out tokens for the resources, but in the actual game they will be wooden bits instead. You will also need to substitute your own six-sided dice, preferably of a few different colors. (See the print-and-play file for more details on these substitutions.) Also, since the game does include cards and tokens, the file will require many sheets of paper and a good deal of cutting. Depending on the paper you use, you may find it helpful to sleeve the cards to make them easier to shuffle.\nI want to ensure that every backer of this project can see exactly what they're getting for their money, and if that means some people will simply play the free version rather than choosing to pledge to this campaign, so be it. I'd much rather have lost a few potential backers than having a disappointed backer down the road after the game has been delivered. This way, you can have full confidence in the project before you pledge.\nClick here for the rulebook.\nClick here for the print and play files.\nI teach a lot of games, so I forget that not everyone is as comfortable reading a rulebook and walking new players through a game. For those of you using the print and play, I thought I'd provide this walk-through for those who would like an easy way to teach Emperor's New Clothes to their friends. \nFor Emperor's New Clothes, the easiest way to get started is to watch the game play video shown below. That should give you a good idea of what the game looks like when it's set up and it provides a sample round of play.\nClick here for the print and play tutorial.\nThanks for taking a look at Emperor's New Clothes! I hope you enjoy it. What you see here on the site is still a pre-production version and final components and art may change slightly, but I think we're about 85% done with art and design. I know that you're eager to see a \"How To Play\" video, so here it is.\nThere are some other components I would love to add if we get enough funding, but it's a solid game even as it is now. I'm proud of the work I've done on Emperor's New Clothes and I hope you'll consider backing the project.\nJonathan H. Liu, March 2013\nJonathan spoke with many artists while designing Emperor's New Clothes. Most of them, like John Kovalic of Dork Tower and Munchkin fame, took to the idea immediately and were excited about providing artwork for the project. In order to ensure a card design that is easy to read, with a clean layout and intuitive icons, we worked closely with Darrell Louder, the designer of Compounded: Better Gaming Through Chemistry. As you can see by the pictures above, we have a great team of artists and designers on board to ensure that Emperor's New Clothes looks just the way you'd imagine it. \nWhile some of the artists are old hands at board game art, some have never worked on a board game before now; you'll be surprised at how harmonious the whole turned out to be. We'll be introducing each of the artists over the course of the campaign, so be sure to check back or follow the updates! \nWhen art and mechanics and theme come together like they do in Emperor's New Clothes, you'll see a whole new dimension in gaming. \nHere's the list of artists we've revealed so far.

Team members can also be present for conventions and event appearances with a timely invitation and appropriate travel and lodging expense allowances. Please contact David MacKenzie at Springboard@GameSalute.com to discuss any of these media support opportunities.\nProjects that are tracked from the very beginning have more accurate data than the ones that start tracking later in a project's life, Day-1 Project tracking can help assure your backers that you're on track to reach your goal throughout the life of your project.\nAs somebody who has backed many Kickstarter projects, I know the importance of being involved in the Kickstarter community before you launch your own project\u2014it helps you understand the potential pitfalls that can occur when you run a campaign. Showing that you've followed a project from fundraising to delivery offers your backers confidence that you've been through this process as a backer, that you'll understand their concerns and frustrations at missed delivery dates and unkept promises.\nTo that end, I'm establishing a new program I'm calling Kicking Back. With Kicking Back, a project creator pledges to have already pledged 5% of their expected profits to other Kickstarter campaigns before they even launch their own. You may, of course, commit even more than 5% if you wish.\nAs proof of my commitment to Kicking Back, here's a photo of some of the crowd-funded board game projects I've received over the past few years. (Note that this photo doesn't include all of the non-board game projects I've backed.) Rest assured that if Emperor's New Clothes reaches its funding level, I am committed to Kicking Back with a portion of my profits.\n-- Jonathan H.

I'm in the process of working on the final chapter which will complete the full 300 page story.\nWhat is reMIND?\nreMIND is an all ages sci-fi about faith, underwater lizard-men and brain transplantation. I was inspired by comic artists in the 90's when I refined my drawing style and then was influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling over the last decade.\nFeel free to read through as many pages as you want on my website here. I post new pages every Monday online and will continue to post pages until they are all live towards the end of 2013. \nThe first printing of volume 1 was printed in spring of 2011 and is currently sold out but you can see some customer reviews of it on Amazon here.\nreMIND has already won a few awards which include:\n2010 Xeric Grant Winner\n2012 Great Graphic Novels for Teens List (GGNT)\nBook Specs.\nreMIND Volume 1 (second printing) is 152 full color pages and hardcover that includes Chapters 1 - 3 of reMIND. The interiors will be exactly the same as the first printing. The cover will have an alternate coloring job so it will look different than the first printing but with the exact same cloth binding. The retail price is $24.95.\nreMIND Volume 2 (first printing) will be 176 full color pages and hardbound with a cloth binding. Vol 2 concludes the story of reMIND containing Chapters 4 - 7. All limited Kickstarter copies will be signed and numbered. The retail price will probably be $29.95.\nWhat is Phobos?\nPlease see update #5 for a detailed description of Phobos.\nPublication Date\nreMIND Volume 2 and the reprinting of Volume 1 is scheduled to go to the printer in October if everything goes according to plan. The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping to happen. This means I'll probably be getting the books around January or maybe February if the holidays get in the way (which I assume they will)\nI put April as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario if I can't get the printing started when planned. But I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by January so I can start shipping them out soon after.\nWhy Self-Publish?\nPeople ask me why I chose to self-publish remind. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting my pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first kickstarter back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print the first volume. Now I HAD to self-publish as well as learn to distribute and sell my books. My original kickstarter campaign has been essential in getting reMIND where it is now and it has opened up doors that I never thought possible.\n\nThe funny thing is now that I have a beautiful book published I am approached by big publishers regularly as well as distributors. I could easily sign a contract with a good publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of a publisher who is mainly focused on the bottom line. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn about things like distribution and marketing but overall I love self-publishing as well as owning all the rights to my stories.\n\nMy business plan is to get to the point where I can make a living off of my self-publishing by always printing high quality first printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind once I figure that part out a little better.\n\nI hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see it on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.\nMoney\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. Since the first Volume of reMIND is out-of-print, I need to reprint it at the same time that I print the new Volume 2. The first Volume cost me a little over $11,000 to print 2500 copies. On top of reprinting Volume 1, I will need to raise an additional $13,000 to print Volume 2 which costs more because it has more pages. I want to print both books with a nice cloth binding again exactly like the first printing of Volume 1. So to add it all up, I need a bare minimum of $24,000 to print both books and I think it's attainable now that Kickstarter has gained popularity.  \nI have about $5000 saved but that will all end up going to kickstarter fees, taxes and shipping. Actually, $5000 won't even cover it all but I'm hoping to raise enough to take care of the extra unseen bills.\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nIf this campaign goes over it's funding goal, I already have lots of ideas for additional rewards for everyone who backs it so please help me spread the word if possible.\nPledge Options\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\nBe sure to check back because I plan on adding new rewards regularly!\nInternational Shipping Chart\nPlease add the additional shipping if your books will be sent outside of North America.

I'll need $6,000 to make a nice hardcover full color book, so I'm coming to Kickstarter to get the funds to pay for this. Thanks for your time and please consider pledging to help fund this project. If you'd like to keep up with this project and my work I'll be posting updates here:\nTwitter: @mrjakeparker\nBlog: www.mrjakeparker.com\nWant to know more? Keep reading...\nFor the last 13 years I\u2019ve been working as an artist on everything from toy commercials to feature films. For 5 years I worked in feature animation on the films Horton Hears a Who, Ice Age III, and Rio. I've also written and drawn my own graphic novel series, Missile Mouse, published by Scholastic imprint, Graphix. In between all that I've drawn several short stories which I want to collect in a book.\nMy book is called The Antler Boy and Other Stories and all of the stories were previously published in other comic anthologies like Flight or Out of Picture. Some are out of print and it'd be hard to track them all down so I thought it\u2019d be great to collect them all in one book.\nHere are the 9 stories in the book:\nHugo Earhart - One of the first comic stories I did. It's about a boy taking on responsibilities that are a bit over his head and his rising to the task and proving himself worthy. It\u2019s got a flying whale and cool airships; what more could you want?\nThe Robot and the Sparrow - A tale about the unlikely friendship of a sparrow and a robot. At its core though, it\u2019s about losing someone you love and dealing with that.\nLucy Nova Space Explorer - Lucy gets herself in and out of trouble in two (two!) stories on strange alien worlds. These stories are also peppered with some impressive cutaway drawings of the creatures she encounters and technology she uses.\nMissile Mouse: The Guardian Prophecy - Missile Mouse crash lands on a planet to find he's just the guy to help save a small village from a monster...or is he?\nThe Star Thrower - My irreverent take on the inspirational story of the same name.\nThe Antler Boy - The title story about a boy who finds out his curse might actually be more of a blessing.\nCheckers - A story about a girl who just wants to play a game of checkers.\nSecret of the Space Cave - Lastly I\u2019m doing a brand new 18 page comic just for this book about a curious space explorer and a pilot-for-hire who discover a space cave that holds nothing less than the answers to life. Oh, and those answers are nothing like what our explorers expect.\nSketchbook Section - The book will also have a healthy section of sketches and notes about the stories in the back. You'll see the ideas that didn't make the cut and ideas that evolved into the finished stories.\nAll new color - A handful of these stories have never seen color so I\u2019ll be giving them the proper coloring treatment for the book. It\u2019s been a lot of fun to breathe some new life into them this way.\nSize - All of the stories, plus the sketchbook section, plus all the miscellaneous other pages should bring this book to the 140-150 page range. It will be 10.2 inches tall by 6.6 inches wide, roughly your average graphic novel dimensions.\nLet's talk money - I need $6,000. I want this to be a nice, full color, hardcover book. I found a reasonably priced printer who does some beautifully printed books. That amount will cover all printing expenses, proofs, shipping overseas, and miscellaneous expenses like software to build the book, shipping it out to buyers, and the fees associated with Kickstarter.\nEDIT: As of Tuesday April 24, I added the Antler Boy eBook to every pledge of $25 and up. I talk about that here.\nHere's what you get:\n     __________________________________________________________\n     __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\nMore info about the SPACECAVE ONE sketchbook here.\n      __________________________________________________________\nThey look nice, here's one framed for my daughter's room.\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\n      __________________________________________________________\nThanks for taking a moment to check out my Kickstarter project.

This is why the iPad would make an ideal platform for people to experience the creative aspects of letterpress and typography.\nA growing interest in letterpress\u2014but difficult to access\nIn fact, letterpress has had a growing interest over the past decade amongst designers, artists, and printmakers. Call it a reaction to the \u201cperfect\u201d look of laser-printing. Letterpress\u2014especially wood type\u2014evokes a handcrafted appearance that accompanies thoughtful, visual, and literal expression.\nBut unfortunately, much of the letterpress\u2019s traditional technology was sold for scrap metal and replaced with computers over the last 30 years. Wood type was burned, thrown in a landfill, or divided up as knick-knacks in antique and craft shops. The destruction of manual presses and thousands of type collections has made the tools of letterpress a scarce resource these days. What\u2019s left of traditional letterpress machines, wood type, and printing paraphernalia now fetch premium collector prices because of the growing interest in this art. And complete sets of wood type are rare\u2014bidding wars drive up the prices to several hundreds of dollars.\nOur goal: Our goal is to give designers, artists, students, lovers of type\u2014anyone\u2014the ability to produce their own authentic letterpress designs and artwork. And that\u2019s where this project starts and where we need your help!\nCurrent feedback: We\u2019ve shown our prototype to letterpress printers, designers, and artists, and they are just as excited as we are about this project!\nNEEDED: Beautiful wood type\u2014for everyone\nBut to make LetterMpress truly beneficial to a creative audience, we need to offer an outstanding collection of authentic wood type and vintage \u201ccuts.\u201d We have a supporter who\u2019s willing to part with a substantial portion of a historic collection purchased from type foundries and print shops when they closed in the \u201970s and \u201980s.\nThe amount we need and how we will use the funds: To acquire this collection, we need to raise at least $15,000. Along with these rare, complete collections of wood type, additional funds will also allow us to get help creating the high-resolution photos and scans of the wood type and their corresponding impressions.\nThe type that we aquire will be housed at a new letterpress co-op called the \"Living Letter Press.\" This co-op will be a resource to designers, artists, students, and anyone interested in learning letterpress.\nThe end product is just the start\nPricing LetterMpress: We want to make LetterMpress accessible to all, and plan to price it at $5.99 for the base iPad version. We plan to include at least 12 typefaces, and about 50 art \"cuts,\" to which we will add to as we update the app. Pricing for other platforms will be determined by the amount of functionality and size of files generated. Why we need the physical type: Having access to the physical types is a critical part of a later stage* of the LetterMpress venture, which will be to offer authentic letterpress prints from the designs submitted by LetterMpress users. Think about it: Wouldn't it be great to get -real- letterpress prints from your own designs?\nHelp us make this happen!\nWith your support, we hope to make LetterMpress a creative resource for designers, artists, students, and anyone who wants to experience the art, craft, and tradition of letterpress.\nWhat you get in return: To show our appreciation for your pledge, we\u2019re offering some great rewards including participation in our beta program, limited edition letterpress art prints, wood type, and the opportunity to name your own typeface in the LetterMpress App.\nCheck out the list of rewards to see what best suits you.

We're so excited about this process of making and designing products and we want to share it. Not only do we want to offer you a great product, but we also want you to join us in writing the next chapter of our story. We hope that others are inspired by us just as we have been by the multitude of creative projects here on this site. Bernie and I envision a world of small, connected partnerships that fuel design and creativity. Together we can share and make great things.\nThe Plan - The great news is we've been working with a manufacturer who's been helping us along with our final design. It took a lot of work to engineer all the parts into their optimal form for production, but that is behind us now. They are literally gathering digital dust waiting to be released. So once our funding goal is reached we'll hit GO and start making those molds so our parts can be ready in April.\nIn the meantime we'll be working on the final details of the packaging, microfiber bag, and tether strap. These items have been sourced, but not finalized. You can help! We'll be uploading images of our progress here on KickStarter and on our webpage. Stay tuned; we would love your input.\nThe Money - In order to make PadPivot\u2122 durable, high quality, and cost-effective we need to injection mold the parts. This means expensive molds that have to fit together very precisely \u2013 cha ching! Add a couple hinges and pheeew, that's hard work! Up until this point Bernie and I have been flipping the bill on design and prototypes, but now we've come to the place where we need your help.

THANKS EVERYONE FOR BEING SO AWESOME!\n-----------\nMy name is Jason Brubaker and I've been working on a graphic novel for almost 4 years in my free time. It's 136 pages for the first volume and who knows how many pages the second Volume will be. But for now I'm just trying to finish the first one and get it printed and sold. My vision has always been to make a nice sturdy hard cover book similar to the European comics. Something that can be compared and left next to a beautiful coffee table book.\nThis whole thing started out as an animated project almost 10 years ago but that took way to long so I switched gears and decided to make it a book instead. I've been posting new pages every Monday on my blog and talking about the process and what I'm learning. I have about 6 months before I am finished with everything and I was hoping to print it overseas early 2011 when the first volume is complete.\nI've invested so much time into this project already that I can't even begin to calculate the total hours and it's kinda embarrassing. But my main concern is finding the funds to make this final step possible and finding the right audience to share it with.\nThe 136 page, full color book is estimated to cost about $7,500 to print in China as well as some set up fees. Luckily in June I was awarded $5000 from the Xeric Foundation to help with the printing. Now I just need to collect the rest and anything over my $3000 goal will go towards making the books even better quality with a cloth bound hard-cover.\nPlease visit my blog to see the entire first two chapters online.\nI post new pages every Monday and will continue to do so until the book is printed.\nhttp://remindblog.com/\nFor those of you interested in pledging over $39 to get your name in the acknowledgements, here is a link to a fake page in the book to demonstrate how and where it may go.\nhttp://www.remindblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Made-Possible-By.jpg\nThanks for your support in making reMIND the best graphic novel it can be!\n- Jason", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Sithrah 3: Last 50 Hours!
