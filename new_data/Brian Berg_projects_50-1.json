[{"backer": "Brian Berg", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What This Is\nPolyhedral dice specifically designed and packaged for rolling damage in Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition. These unique dice supplement your standard polyhedral set with defined damage in each roll during battle. Available in Metal and Acrylic. Plus, uniquely functional and stylish dice for spells, saves, sneak attacks and class features.\nTins for the metal dice sets\nWhy We Want This\nOne thing was clear after the completion of our original Damage Dice campaign for magical damage types; folks wanted to get physical. With these dice you can roll a war hammer smite with a bludgeoning die and radiant die at once and know which damage is what. Different colorways for each design allow for rolling multi-attacks all at once and knowing which attack roll goes with which damage roll. Why should only casters get the fun of rolling big hand fulls of dice!  Mostly, this is about style. D&D is a game of color and theme after all, so it's nice to have a special set of metal piercing dice for your favorite rogue.\nMetal?! Yes metal. We want our damage dice to embody each type to the fullest so  metal seemed the obvious choice. The material allows for each design to further represent slashing, piercing and bludgeoning. Additionally, we\u2019ve created acrylic sets for a more accessible cost option (and we know metal isn\u2019t for everyone).\n Damage Dice Sets are special: \nJust like our magic sets, these sets are specifically designed for damage rolls.\nSets include what you need for attacks with standard D&D weapons \u2013 1d4, 2d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12 and a 1d20 (dice quantity doubled in acrylic sets). \nD10s are d10s, not half of a percentile set. You roll 1\u201310 damage, not 0\u20139 or 00\u201399.\nStylish custom molds with damage type in the design and edge\nTins for metal and embroidered bags for acrylic with the damage type.\nWhat else?\nSome of the stretch goals in our last campaign were dice that could have been their own campaigns, such as the bardic inspiration set. This time, we considered going a more traditional route; keeping the stretch goals to simple accessories \u2026 but seeing as a ultra-specific purpose-built, surprise dice sets are kind of our brand now, we figured why not! This is about bringing as many dice into the world as we can.\nHow We\u2019re going to do this\nWe\u2019re using everything we learned from our first project creating the magical damage types to make these even better. We\u2019ve already created some prototype molds and we\u2019ll need to make so many more molds. Each design requires a unique mold, and minimum order, so we need the community\u2019s help to bring these dice into the world, and onto our tables.\nWho is doing this?\nGyld is a small company in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Gordie, Al and James have pooled their free-time and free-cash into this and a few other projects in the name of creating items for table-top that we want to exist (and use).\nShipping Rates & VAT\nShipping and VAT costs are not included in your pledge. We\u2019ll be using Pledge Manager after the campaign which will calculate shipping based on your location. Estimated shipping costs are below, and may change based on location, rates and whatever weird stuff happens between now and the ship date (2020, as you may remember, was a little bananas).\nWe have arranged for UK, EU and Australian distribution this time so VAT will be handled in Pledge Manager as well so you won\u2019t have to worry about paying on delivery. NOTE: EU and UK are changing VAT rules for 2021 so we\u2019ll update this section once we know specifics.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe designs and prototypes are complete for this campaign which reduces our risk further from the last campaign. However, as we learned in 2020, anything can happen. The delivery estimate here is what we were able to deliver within even with a global-pandemic shutdown so we\u2019re very confident that we can make it happen, but then again \u2013 who knows.\n\nOne of the things we learned from the last campaign is that the best part of Kickstarter is working with the community to create something that doesn\u2019t exist, and that we wouldn\u2019t be able to make by ourselves, or at a big company. We can make weird, ultra-specific, dice that only work for one spell, like Chaos Bolt. We can take input from the community during the campaign and include it in the final designs \u2013 y\u2019all really got behind matte finish so we pushed it up - and that\u2019s what we love. So please remember that this is a pledge not a pre-order. We may change designs, finishes, ink colors or details based on the campaign and community input. We\u2019d love to have you on board as a backer, to help us bring these dice to life and be part of the process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nMetal dice and even acrylic will last for decades. We still have ours from high school (which was a very, very long time ago).\nReusability and recyclability\nPackaging is designed to be kept with your items, stacked neatly and shown off. Every bit is designed to be nice enough that you won't want to throw it away.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 17 or more", "title": "One Acrylic Set", "descp": "One set of acrylic dice of your choice, from any of the unlocked designs or colorways.

You can find out more about our artists, including links to their portfolios, in the team section at the end!\nThe border of the old empire\nWithin the Age of Antiquity campaign setting you will find: \n\nEight Ancient Cultures: From across the east and west.\n\n Rome - Currently the most powerful single state, Rome has risen to great heights at a blistering pace. Though still a Republic in name, the powers of the Senate and Consuls have begun to wane in recent decades with the position of Dictator having become a permanent one. Though wary of slipping back into tyranny, the Senate is cautious in moving against the Dictator, who, as with Rome's former leaders, was personally blessed by Jupiter himself.\n\n The Greek States - A land of myth and legend, the Greek cities are still favored by the Olympic Gods even as Rome eclipses them. Though nominally under the protection of Rome their close religious ties have allowed them to avoid full annexation and enjoy relative autonomy. Outsiders (the Romans included) consider the Greeks one people, though they seldom see themselves this way. The artistic and fashionable southern cities often reject the notion that they are one people with the more martial northern states who in turn are loathe to be compared to their less militaristic cousins. \n\n Greco-Occupied Egypt - When Ra stood down from the mantle of the Egyptian Pantheon a power struggle broke out among the gods. Rome and her Greek allies saw this as an opportunity to permanently weaken a rival Pantheon. With their Gods warring among themselves, the Pharaoh and his armies were caught unprepared by the Greek invasion. Today the north of Egypt is ruled by a Greek-born Queen who finds herself playing a delicate game of balance between her ruling Hellenistic and far more populous Egyptian subjects.\n\n The Kushite Kingdom - Loyal sons and daughters to the Egyptian Pantheon, the Kushite Kingdom, led by the sorcerer Queen Amanirenas, continues the fight against the Greco-Roman conquerors that control much of what had historically been the domain of Ra.\n\n The Parthian Empire - The crossroads of civilization. Made rich by wealth and trade flowing across the known world, yet ever wary of being caught between a once more united China and a quickly rising Rome, the Parthians' unique position has allowed multiple disparate religions to coexist and flourish within their boundaries.\n\n The Warring States of China - Formerly the pre-eminent power of the world, China was recently thrown into chaos by the death of the last Emperor. Two dozen warlords with armies of varying strength and size now fight for control of this vast and ancient territory.\n\nStretch Goal - Unlocked\n\n The Celtic Tribes - Considered mysterious and primitive by the Mediterranean powers, the Celtic tribes, united under the warrior Queen of the Iceni, fight to repel the Roman advance through the isles. Dark rumors swirl about the Druidic rituals they perform deep within the untamed forests. More than one Legatus, finding his soldiers impaled and sacrificed, has declared the isles a cursed place. The Celts view the Romans with equal contempt, seeing them as heralds of foreign gods bringing only death and thralldom.\n\n The Illyrian Kingdom: The Illyrians of Dalmatae find  themselves in a precarious position. Placed between Rome and the Greek states they have long caught the eye of Jupiter who sees them as obstacle between his two domains. This was not helped by the Illyrian deity Deipaturos declaring himself the true Sky Father, a title Jupiter sees reserved only for himself. The Greeks, though openly supportive of Rome, often view the Illyrians as a buffer state preventing a land border that many fear would lead to full annexation by Rome. Some even say they've even helped the Illyrians against Rome with supplies and information, though these are still just rumors. The Illyrian King for his part has tries to foster this and keeps friendly relations with several of the northern Greek rulers.\n\n\n\n 12 New Archetypes: One for each of the base classes. \n\n\n\n\n 15 New Backgrounds: To give your characters more specific connections to the world. \n\n\n  52 Gods: From five ancient pantheons. \n\n\n 150 Magic Items: Drawn from and inspired by the ancient world.\n\n\nDozens of feats, spells and mythical creatures. \n\n\n We are aware that sometimes projects go overboard with stretch goal creep which can impact the release schedule. This is our first project and we want to make sure we don't take on more than we can deliver in a reasonable time frame, as such should we reach all of our stretch goals we do not intend to include anymore that add additional content to the book.\n\nCreated by: Stephen Delucchi & Marcus Lundin\nArtists - \nNikita Cherkasov - Artist Artstation \nSarah Delucchi - Graphic Design IMDB \nKurt Ian Ferrer - Environment Artist Artstation \nGaston Garcia - Artist Artstation \nTadas Sidlauskas - Artist, Cover Art Artstation \nRen Tu - Artist Artstation \nRachael Wong - Concept Artist, Logo Design Deviant Art \nShipping\nShipping will be collected after the campaign through Backerkit. \nShipping estimates are as follows.\nUS - $7.50\nCanada and Mexico - $22.50\nRest of the world - $27.50 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe don't see any significant risks outside a slight delay if all of the art is not finished on time, but we have given ourselves enough padding with the release date that we don't see this as being an issue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Centurion", "descp": "Get the full-color PDF of Age of Antiquity!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["806 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Primus Pilus", "descp": "A full-color hardcover copy of Age of Antiquity!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["1,302 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "Legatus", "descp": "The Limited Edition hardcover & PDF of Age of Antiquity.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["1,037 backers", "Limited (63 left of 1100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Pontif Maximus", "descp": "We will have a character named and modeled for you or your OC with a full color portrait included in the book.\nA full-color hardcover copy of Age of Antiquity!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "20 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Update - Address changes, Maps and Gods!", "update_content": "Hello everyone!\n\nHope you're all doing well and that you enjoyed the preview PDF 2 from last months update.

So, the creators stated that as they are injecting the symbol into their historical fiction and use the two headed eagle to represent the state and their belief in their right to spread both East and West (which is why the Byzantine's adopted it).

Or a Church! A Thieves\u2019 Guild! A Bard\u2019s College! Whichever you choose, it\u2019s your Domain. Your domain can take actions, raise armies, conduct espionage, and wage war!\nDifferent kinds of Domains have access to different actions. A Thieves\u2019 Guild is quite good at espionage, not so good at raising armies. So you may need allies! Because you will certainly have enemies!\nCharacters are still adventurers! But now the stakes are higher. Now the dragon threatens your people! And the dungeon contains the power you need to stop your enemies\u2019 schemes!\nWhile you\u2019re away; your Lieutenant runs your domain (by your command) allowing you to continue adventuring as normal. Or as normal as anything is in this game. :D\nThese new rules are broken down into three broad categories, described after the graphics below.\nThe Kickstater Exclusive Edition will have gold trim!\nThe text you see here will only be available for the  Kickstarter-exclusive shirt! We may make a future shirt with no back text, but for the Kickstarter, you get the exclusive Tour Shirt.\nAlso available as a $25 add-on in the pledge manager.\nAnd it comes in a red variant!\n Kingdoms, duchies, baronies, earldoms, any territory with people living on it can be your Domain. Domains can be a small province with a single town, or a sprawling kingdom with many cities. This book contains rules for starting with a single province and growing your domain, or starting the game at 1st level by inheriting an entire kingdom!\nThe system assumes that, regardless of how many different domains your campaign world might have, we\u2019re only worried about one Enemy Domain, one Allied Domain, and one Neutral Domain who could go either way. This constrains the number of things the GM needs to worry about so we don\u2019t need a computer to track all the different actors in our play. Of course, an ambitious GM could track more Kingdoms!\nDomain actions allow you to muster new units for your army, develop your land to get more resources out of it, build roads to make it easier to get around for people and armies, spy on your enemies, and ally with your neighbors.\nThe book includes rules and advice for running campaigns where only one player is a regent, all players are regents, or even how to use these rules to track the high-level politics in a game where no players are regents, and you just want the feel of large-scale political powers maneuvering against each other.\nNot every player wants to run a duchy or an earldom, but these rules give you many more kinds of Domains! Existing within, alongside, and sometimes at odds with a Kingdom, are Organizations like Churches, Thieves\u2019 Guilds, Wizard Orders, Bardic Colleges and more. All of them get special Domain Actions that affect the outcome of The Great Game.\nPaladin Order: The Green\nWizard's Order: The Arcanum Camerata\nAssassins College: Nine Silver\nOne player might run a thieves\u2019 guild, but sometimes the entire group wishes they could play a thieves\u2019 guild! Or an order of Monks! But while \u201clet\u2019s all play monks!\u201d sounds cool, once you sit down and think about it you realize that would mean no healing, no tank, no tracker, no one to pick locks or disarm traps or read arcane scrolls unless someone multiclasses, and was not as good at being a monk as everyone else, or played a different class and pretty soon you\u2019re back to playing a normal adventuring partzzzz\u2026..\nMaybe there\u2019s a better way.\nKingdoms and Warfare expands on the rules presented in the Chain of Acheron livestream with Titles for several different organizations.\nTitles give your characters new, limited abilities and proficiencies that let them shore up the deficiencies of a limited-class party.\nA thieves\u2019 guild might have a Godbotherer, a thief who gains proficiency with Religion and limited healing and possibly limited access to prayers. Not as powerful or useful or versatile as a cleric, but it gets the job done.\nAn order of Monks might have an Acolyte of Mystery, who gains proficiency with Arcana and access to limited spells. Or an Acolyte of Stone with increased AC and HP!\nOf course, some titles cannot be conferred during character creation, and must be earned like the Master of Ravens, the Master of Locusts, and the rest of the Monk Masters.\nExpanded rules for Warfare allowing faster, more balanced battles, more and different kinds of units. Pikemen who thwart Cavalry charges! Sappers who undermine fortifications! And more and better rules for Battle Magic; spells that affect units and the entire battlefield.\nNew Maneuvers allow characters to directly command their units, executing daring ploys that can change the course of war!\nNew rules for the Tide of Battle create a connection between the Encounter your characters are fighting and the Battle your units are waging. Doing well in the Encounter gives your army a boost! Doing well in Battle gives your characters an advantage! Of course, doing poorly has similarly predictable results\u2026.\nNew rules for using PCs and monsters as units, as well as more advice for building an army and waging war. The rules for Warfare in Strongholds & Followers are only the beginning of a more robust system.\nStrongholds & Followers  does not require the use of Kingdoms and Warfare; both strongholds and followers give players cool new abilities and allies all by themselves. But combining the two products produces a deeper system for running a world where characters can become Dukes or start their own Church, or run their own Thieves\u2019 Guild.\nWe listened to folks who bought Strongholds & Followers and made sure to put more of what they liked into Kingdoms & Warfare.\nNew Gemstone dragons! New servitors from each of the Courts presented in S&F and three new courts! The Court of Seven Cities (Devils), the Court of Blood (Demons) and the Court of Rot (Undead!) More better things to augment your concordance roll!\nThe monster design from S&F was pretty popular and we\u2019re super excited to do more. \nPLAY\n\nPeople loved the codicies from the first book, so we\u2019re doing more! The Codex Granatine! The Codex Adamant! The Codex Tempestatus! These legendary artifacts will change, or break, your game. Use at your peril!\nIncluding the legendary Codex Bellorum...the BOOK OF WAR.\nAny book of new rules as big as this requires an adventure to show you how to use it. The Regent of Bedegar acts as a sequel to the Siege of Castle Rend and introduces players to Domain Level play. The heroes manage their new domain, putting out fires in Gravesford and other local towns while encountering various organizations in Aendrim, some friendly, some not so much.\nOf course, there will be a battle at the end! Lord Saxton must pay for what he\u2019s done!\nLike Strongholds & Followers, this book uses my setting\u2019s background and lore, so you\u2019ll learn more about the Timescape, the lore of demons, devils, and undead, and more fiction featuring the young adventurers from the first book.\nAnd a Dragon!\nFolks really liked the gemstone dragons from the first kickstarter, so we're doing another one. The Ancient Onyx Dragon Cthrion Uroniziir!\nThis mini is BIG and only available to folks who back this Kickstarter. It will be available as an add-on in our Pledge Manager, but only to folks who pledge!\nIt\u2019s not \u201cCiv.\u201d It doesn\u2019t simulate an elaborate 4X game, it doesn\u2019t worry about stuff like...how much Iron you produce vs how much Wheat you need. Provinces produce \u201cresources.\u201d Alliances just boost those resources.\nIn general these rules focus on high-level play, heavily abstracted, married to crunchy rules that give your characters real mechanical benefits. If you\u2019re looking for a simulation this is not it.\nThe goal is; you\u2019re still playing Fifth Edition, but now your campaign has an extra dimension.\nIf we manage to reach our funding goal, we have a whole bunch of stretch goals planned. The book stays the same, but we unlock new play aids like a GM's Screen and a deck of unique unit cards for your fantasy warfare needs. \n The MCDM Screen\nA 4-panel screen for the discerning game master to fudge die rolls behind. Without a screen, you\u2019re just another random person at the table. With the screen, you become THE MASTER!\nOur screen gives you easy access to tables from Strongholds, Followers, Kingdoms, and Warfare including the list of Domain Actions, Random Domain Events, as well as the full list of actions that adjust your Concordance, making it easier to track.\nThe Unit Deck\nDozens of unique units with custom special abilities to use in your epic battles! Centaur shock troops! Goblin sappers! Beholder units! Dragon units! All printed on high-quality cards ready to be used immediately at your table.\n Dope Minis\nWe have a bunch of new monsters planned for Kingdoms & Warfare and we'd love to make minis out of all of them! Each stretch goal pays for the 3D model and the manufacturing mold. As we unlock new ones...IF we unlock new ones...you'll get to see the art and lore and how big the mini will be an how much it will cost. You'll be able to upgrade your pledge in our pledge manager to add any of the minis you like to your pledge.\nCheck back to see what (if anything!) gets unlocked!\n\nWe\u2019ll charge for shipping after the Kickstarter is over. We will collect this in the pledge manager.\nWe\u2019ll ship your rewards from one of the four Blackbox warehouses we work with. This project is US, Canada, and Australia friendly. Under current trade agreements, we are EU friendly. This may change pending future Brexit negotiations.\nBelow is a list of estimated shipping costs for the K&W Hardcover, PDF + Sticker pledge. Keep in mind that these are estimates and that the accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager according to your address, pledge level, and potential add-ons.\nWe don\u2019t ship to the following countries:\nAfghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Cote d\u2019Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Guam, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine :(", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many fewer risks associated with this product compared to Strongholds & Followers. We no longer print our books in China, so there\u2019s no danger of tariffs or trade interfering with our production. We have been through the Import Duty gauntlet so we have all the paperwork you need to ship your product around the world. We have good partners now, we know great artists, we have a great relationship with Trenchworx the folks who make our minis. \n\nLike Strongholds & Followers, these rules are based on rules I\u2019ve already designed before, so we\u2019re not creating an entire ruleset from whole cloth.\n\nI think probably the biggest risk is the fact that all of this revolves around me and my writing and design. Something happens to me, there could be a delay. But one of our goals with this project and the Player\u2019s Guide To Capital is finding other freelance writers and designers to work with under my direction so the product isn\u2019t wholly reliant on my labor.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Kingdoms & Warfare PDF", "descp": "Kingdoms & Warfare in an indexed, searchable PDF.

In PunkApocalyptic: The Roleplaying Game, based on the wild and irreverent miniatures game of the same name by Bad Roll Games, you and your friends assume the roles of mercenaries who roam the Wasteland. In this bleak and radioactive land, you fight to survive, explore the ruins of what came before, and trade blood, sweat, and tears for the precious bullets that have become the land's currency. Explore the radioactive ruins, fight battle-crazed mutants, negotiate with bizarre cultists, bargain with junkers and scavengers, and unearth fantastic relics from the past. Brutal and filthy, PunkApocalyptic: The RPG offers thrilling adventures steeped in the carnage of a bleak and devastated future.    \n\n As a huge thank you to everyone who has supported so far, all backers of Scavenger and higher get FOUR bonus missions!     \nArt by Matteo Spirito\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG uses a variant of the Demon Lord Engine, introduced first in the horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord. Designed for a short-burst campaign of eleven adventures, with flexible character development, and no-nonsense, streamlined rules, you can bang out a character in no time and get down to the business of kicking ass.\nYou start the game as a fragile survivor, choosing from a list of eight backgrounds such as Muscle or Face. Once you complete your first mission, you assemble a team, and choose a novice path to guide your character's development. Novice paths include the mutated freaks, killers, and scum. The more missions you complete, the more choices you make, picking up an expert path and eventually a master path.\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG includes some variations on the Demon Lord Engine, such as using eight attributes instead of four, with Grit as a healing resource, along with a few other changes. If you know how to play Shadow of the Demon Lord, you'll have no trouble playing this game. And if you don't yet know Shadow of the Demon Lord, well, it's easy, using familiar dice rolling conventions to make it easier for folks familiar with some of the other well-known roleplaying games currently being played today. \nArt by Matteo Spirito; This could be you!\nWant to learn more?

Once the campaign ends and has funded, your card gets charged and I use the money to pay for the remaining assets and production costs. It\u2019s simple. You\u2019ve done this before.

Through the industrial revolution of magic, to the rebuilding of cities, there has been no lack of work for the people of Eryphir. That includes, in most recent years, the colonization of the long lost continent of Daelus. \nOur adventurers find themselves in the great colonial town of Meresburg - perhaps seeking fame and fortune, or maybe on assignment. When word reaches the adventurers of a murder in a small, remote hamlet, they are tasked with uncovering the truth behind the unusual event. Their investigation leads them down a desperate road of horror and sorrow as they chase the culprit across the colonies, attempting to bring them to justice. \nNot everything is as it seems (naturally) and before the adventurers can bring the murderer to justice, they will have to struggle through a quagmire of lies and conspiracies; battle through treacherous traps and cutthroat creations.\nCharacter card for \"Perinold the Pious - Knight of Rynmark\" (in ceremonial garb) - Iconic Paladin for the Eryphir S118 Series! Artwork by Ben Worrell\nOur partners in gaming - World Anvil [https://worldanvil.com ]\nOfficial World Anvil Partners!\nWizco Games has teamed with World Anvil, the #1 world-building platform, in order to bring ALL of our content, including this Adventure Series to you in an easily accessible, digital format.\nIn addition to PDF format, select tiers will receive access to all of the content for this series on their FREE World Anvil account!\nA break-down of a sample page from our World Anvil catalog!\nHere is a quick tour of the World Anvil application:\nThe Anatomy of an Adventure Series\nEach of our Adventure Series modules (or episodes) is designed to be played in a single, 4-hour gaming session. Designing the adventures in this episodic manner allows us to start and complete an entire game, with a satisfying conclusion, inside a standard gaming convention time slot. \nEach Adventure Series has four episodes, for over 20 hours of gaming goodness. You, as the player, get the satisfaction of seeing a character grow from 2nd to 9th level over the course of a weekend (or several sessions at your own gaming table).\nEach Adventure Series contains a number of components we'd like to share with you now!\n Episodic Adventures - Four Adventures, each with 30+ pages of content for four or more hours of gaming goodness!\n 8 Iconic, Creative Characters - Eight pre-generated characters available for play - but not required - follow them as they progress through all four episodes of the Adventure Series, complete with amazing character art and rich character backgrounds - each unveiling information about their campaign setting.\n 56 New Magic Items - Each Adventure Series episode comes complete with 14 loot cards you can use to outfit your characters, whether during Organized Play, or in your home game. These \"loot cards\"  are magic items and gear unique to each Adventure Series and entirely new. Players attending an Organized Play event receive ONE random card after each 4-hour session - YOU can get all 56 just by backing this Kickstarter! \n 12 Boon Coins - Each Adventure Series episode also comes with three of its own Boon coins that can be used to customize your Iconic character or incorporate into your home session! Boons are powerful abilities and attributes (that can be used in place of feats) that provide you with new and exciting ways to interact with the game you are playing. \n 12 New and Unique Monsters - Our Adventure Series are designed to take you and your gaming group to new, fascinating locations in new, undiscovered worlds. Naturally, you are going to discover new creatures to battle and new adversaries to outwit! Each episode  includes stats and ecology for at least three new creatures themed for the series. \n56 Loot Cards - new magic items, new gear, and new tricks included!\nNo need for pre-gens!\nYou do NOT have to play this with the pre-generated characters. They are only there to help you with the campaign setting itself. This is 100% compatible with standard Dungeons & Dragons 5e rules!\nAs a game master, you could also insert these adventures into your campaign for a story line that lasts across 1st to 10th level!\nThe Land of Eryphir \nA neo-arcane* setting for 5th Edition, and a variety of additional game systems!\nEryphir is action and adventure in the Neo-Arcane Age. You inhabit a world where magic is tempered by science, and your daily life is shaped by incredible magically-engineered inventions.\nCaptains of industry and The Sovereign compete for the hearts and souls of the people, while you and your fellow agents work in the shadows to defend and serve the Commonwealth...or sell your skills to the highest bidder. \n From agriculture, to the war machine; from trade, to modern medicine, magic - or more specifically, the creation of a demi-plane referred to as \"aetherspace\", has done more to \"civilize\" society than at any other time in history.\nThe Aether, originally envisioned to serve as a barrier to protect people of the Prime from the incursions of the Outer Planes, has proven to be far more valuable to the people of Eryphir than ever imagined. Used to communicate, store information, investigate crimes, spy on adversaries, and even travel from place to place, Aetherspace has dramatically changed society for the better over the last several decades. \nThe major government on the continent of Eryphir, The Commonwealth, has brought peace through mastery of the Aether, but at potentially great cost. With the end of the War of Kings just two decades old, dissidents foment in the shadows, while calls for civil war echo in the far reaches of the land. You are adventurers - colloquially called \"Ravens\" within the Blackwood Society - or simply \"Agents\" - who are called upon time and again to be problem solvers - forever behind the scenes, aiding those in need of their services. Will they answer the call of the Commonwealth, or will they aid those who would see it fall?\nIt's your move - but take action quickly before someone else makes that move for you....\nThe Rynmarki naval corvette - \"Stitched Together\" - Artwork by Anthony Cournoyer\nAethertech\nWhether it's the volt pistol on your hip or the slate you're using to communicate with your comrades, aethertech is everywhere in Eryphir. Devices such as these are designed by those with expert knowledge of the predictable science behind the flow of magic - and how it can be manipulated in such a way as to provide reliable and sustainable effects. \nAethertech has been used to create things as small as hand-held devices, to as large as flying fortresses, and almost anything imaginable in between. \nThe Morlock Contraption - a device used to interact with the Aether demi-plane. Artwork by Rick Hershey\nBehind the Scenes\nEryphir is set in what you might imagine as the Industrial Revolution of the early 1900s here on Earth. \nGone are many of the fantasy tropes you might normally find in many RPG settings. Gone are the elves and dwarves and halflings of any Tolkien-esque RPG setting. In their stead are the imposing dwearh, the ingenuitive daonn, the militant bwogan, and the reclusive aos'si. Each race serves their own interests, constantly at odds with each other as they struggle to forge the world of Baennor in their own idyllic image. \nSociety on the continent of Eryphir is emerging from a great war that saw kingdoms and dictators crushed under the boot of technology mastered by what today is now known as the Commonweatlh of Ustren. Peace is nearly two-decades old, but not everyone is content with the arrangement. \nThe players take on the role of agents, working behind the scenes to  help (or hinder) the various consortiums, companies, hegemonies, guilds, and government that make up the Commonwealth. \nThe world is cutthroat and dangerous, but the notes are good if you find yourself on the right side of the fight. \nEryphir is the brainchild of Matt \"KC Rift\" Everhart with massive support from friends and others in the gaming industry over the last 3 years. Thoroughly play-tested at major conventions across the country, Eryphir has proven exciting and entertaining for all those who have sat at the tables!\nThe Races of Eryphir \nThe Aos'Si Queen of Haleathemyr - Artwork by Rick Hershey\n Aos'Si (Eh-shay) - Fey transplants from The Dreaming - the outer plane of the Seelie (and Unseelie) Courts, the aos'si are unlike most of the native inhabitants of Baennor. While they have lived there longer than either of the dominant races, they rarely procreate and constantly work to expand their dominion over Baennor in an effort to make it more resemble the life they once knew on their native plane. \nThe aos'si typically (and vehemently) eschew modern aethertech, seeing the manipulation of magic on such a level an abuse of the gift afforded them by the Seelie Lords.\nAetoom Who Walks With Lions - Bwogan Druid Iconic - Artwork by Rick Hershey\nBwogan (B-wo-gan) - When Nihor, the Plane of Chaos, passed through the Inner Planes, the armies of chaos poured into the Prime. Orcs, hobgoblins, ogres, and other goblinoids of all types ran roughshod over the lands of Baennor, and were the first to conquer nearly all the planet. \nWhen the Eternals of Chaos were driven back by the Fey thousands of years later, the armies of goblinoids were culled and pushed back, making way for the aos'si. The bwogan, residing on the other side of Reinhelm mountains of Eryphir were largely untouched, however, and thrived without the enslavement of the Chaos Eternals; without the constant war shrinking their numbers. \nQuellis Avernath - Veteran Daonn Soldier and Iconic Fighter for the \"Corruption in Daelus\" Adventure Series! - Artwork by Ben Worrell\nDaonn (Day-own; humans) - The Daonn are the collective \"tribe\" of humans who originally banded together and broke free of slavery under the elemental lords of Air and Water. While other humans exist on Baennor, the vast majority refer to themselves as \"The People\" in the old tongue, or Daonn. \nNatural titans of industry and organization, the daonn have been exceedingly successful at uniting the continent of Eryphir under the banner of the Commonwealth - despite the bloody trail to get there. \nRaeker - Dwearh heavy infantry soldier - Artwork by Rick Hershey\nDwearh (Dew-wear) - Giants among the people of Eryphir, the dwearh are larger and far more muscular than their daonn cousins. Their progenitors were the elemental lords of Fire and Earth - destined for a life of slavery deep in the mines beneath Baennor, the dwearh were the first to rise up and overthrow their masters. \nToday, they have been displaced from their mountain homes and, instead co-habitate amid the daonn cities, having lost their ancestral mountain kingdom to the earth elemental lord long ago. Of all the races, the dwearh and daonn manage to live in large numbers together in relative peace. \nThe dwearh excel at engineering and manufacturing, making them highly sought after in the Commonwealth - \"very rare is the dwearh who is wont for idle time\", as the saying goes.  \nThe Classes - while not included in full for this adventure series, here are a few of the character classes that are under development by WizCo Games for the Eryphir Campaign Setting!\nAetherist - Asute Scientists of Magic - there are those who study the physical sciences and then there are those who have taken to the scientific study of magic. Aetherists are not practioners of magic (like a wizard or sorcerer), but rather those who use the fundamentals of magic to create, improve, and enrich society. \nAviator - Fearless Racers of the Skies - Soldiers and fighters comb the ground during combat, but pilots race across the skies, securing the battlefield through speed and firepower. The pilot is a dexterity-style warrior who excels at tactics and speed.\nChymist - Brilliant Tinkers of the Elements - many spellcasters memorize their magic through the study of scroll or book. Chymists take their understanding of magic and apply it to the primary elements - Ion, Philogiston, Apiom, Sulphuria, and Aether - to fantastical effect. \nDwimmersmith - Cunning Engineers of Magic - Where aetherists study magic, and chymists tinker with the elements, dwimmersmiths craft with both. Engineers of the age, dwimmersmiths craft amazing devices, machines, and weapons through their knowledge and use of magic.   \n...and FOUR MORE will be included in the setting. You can find out more information if you can uncover the link to our World Anvil page hidden here in this Kickstarter!  \nEpisode Breakdown - \n Episode One - Rumblings in Ravens Barrow (2nd - 3rd Level) - The agents respond to a gruesome murder in the remote hamlet of Ravens Barrow, only to discover the mystery is far more  complex than they would have expected. Misdirection, lies, and magic \nMap designed and drawn by Erik Frankhouse\nEpisode Two - A Knight's Terror - (5th - 6th Level) A celebration in Ravens Barrow is interrupted by an attacked on the small hamlet by the dead. The agents must not only save the villagers from these walking corpses, but also uncover who is behind the attack!\nConcept Art for the Illiac Chateaux in Episode 2 - A Knight's Terror\nEpisode Three - Missteps in Meresburg (7th - 8th Level) -The agents are closing in on their quarry and the trail leads all the way back to the coastal city of Meresburg. There, the party must stop the villain from any further mayhem!\nEpisode Four - Reckoning at Ravens Barrow (9th - 10th Level)The operation has been dismantled, the culprit uncovered. There is a reckoning coming as the villain makes their final stand against the agents of the Blackwood Society!\n Reward Tier Specifics\nWhat is a kickstarter without rewards? Well....not a kickstarter for starters. Part of the way we can bring something tangible to you as a backer is to provide content. We do that in a number of ways, but we also provide you with some pretty sweet membership bennies as well including a higher level character when you play our games! Discounts in our online store!

I cant wait to send these out to everyone.  The Divination book is next!\nPLAY\n\nEt fac quod vis, et totius legis.\nFinger of Death\nFalse Life\nPLAY\n\nBelow is how the book came to be.....\n\nA small forward on how this book has gotten into your hands. \nMention the name Lire Goest to any stranger inhabiting the town of Eastbourne, and you will be met with a leering eye of distrust and loathing.   It is a name only uttered off drunken lips and only then in the deepest recesses of dimly lit corners of the local taverns.  The name Lire Goest if spoken at night, will give one gooseflesh, the kind one would get if someone stepped absentmindedly over a grave.  Or if mentioned during the day in passing conversation, would cause one to stop abruptly and divert their eyes downward to ask the gods for forgiveness.   \nI first heard the name Lire Goest while on one of my excursions just South of the towne of Eastbourne.  I was at a tavern late one night with my maps deciding the best route to take to my final destination.  Where I was heading is of no use to this story of course, the name of that particular place was removed altogether from my head the moment I learned of the Necromancer Lire Goest whom resided to the North. \nThe man I was speaking to at my small wooden table had a miasma of cheap wine on his breath.  It wafted off his clacking tongue from time to time with the utterance of certain vowels during his speech.  How he came to join me at my solitary table was by sheer circumstance.   \nRandolph Beaubien was his name, and from the sight of his appearance, it looked as though old Randolph had been at this tavern drinking for a week.  I placated his insistence that he join me for a drink, I needed a break from my studies of the landscape anyway.  Randolph started as any local drunk would when sitting down with a foreigner for the first time.  The history of the town, what the tavern we were sitting in used to be, and so on and so forth.  But when it was revealed to Randolph that I was a dealer in antiquities, and specialized in the kind that dealt with the practice of alchemy and magic, his tone turned somewhat excited. \nMr. Beaubien was a wanderer of sorts as he explained to me.  His wandering feet claimed to own the land unto which they travelled, everyone else was just a visitor in his eyes.  He had watched first hand outlying towns grow with an immigrating populace, peoples who really had no roots in the places that they settled.  He claimed to be the only true local, and that the towns owed him that, most likely in cheap wine, free of charge of course.  There was only one other local that could make the claim that he had, and the was Lire Goest. \nThere was a castle in Eastbourne upon a hill, albeit small according to Randolph, but a castle no less.  In that castle resided a Necromancer by the name of Lire Goest.  Beubien ordered another wine at this point of his story and kept his head low to the table as if to make himself invisible.  He claimed that there were \u201cghoulies\u201d in the walls that could hear a man\u2019s words.  One had to whisper when talking about their master.  Evidently these \u201cghoulies\u201d had very poor hearing abilities. \nAccording to the account given to me, Lire Goest resided in a castle in which no \u201clocal\u201d could ever remember being built.  He would be seen at times in the market buying strange an unconnected items of food and odd trinkets of no worth to the average citizen.  The only ones who knew his name were the merchants since some of the items had to be ordered or shipped in, which required a signature of course.  Lire had a flourishing signature, that of a nobleman or aristocrat.  It stood out, and the mystery created gossip amongst the shop keepers, which eventually trickled down in to the common inhabitants of Eastbourne.   \nSome of the merchants attempted small conversations with him as they were preparing his order, but nothing fruitful came of it.  Goest was a quiet man, garbed in deep robes, even in the warmer seasons.  Other than the market Randolph continued, Lire was nowhere to be seen, and the rumors grew in the taverns amongst wagging tongues of bored men and women.  It was common ground for idle conversations, just as one would talk about the weather with a total stranger.  Lire Goest, the strange man from the marketplace.   \nAnd then the body was discovered.  A putrid, rotted corpse lay at the middle of the hill before the castle.  It was discovered by two boys playing outside of the area that was deemed safe by their parents.  They ran back to town and told the nearest resident who gathered a few more men to investigate the finding.   \nSure enough as Randolph continued, there was a body for sure.  The decay was so severe, it was almost as if someone had dug up an old corpse and tossed it hundreds of feet down the hill and let it roll.  Bits of grass and dirt had been accumulated on the body, fresh dirt and grass.  Immediately the small band of townsfolk headed to the town to gather more participants to create a small mob.  Randolph was one of those collected to confront the resident of the small castle.   \nWhen the pounding on the large wooden double door to the castle proved to be fruitless, strength and violence took over the mob.  They burst through the door and stormed the castle.  Randolph at this point was frothing a bit at the mouth, I could tell that this was his favorite part of the story.  He had always wanted to storm a castle, and he had gotten his chance. \nThe mob flooded every room in search of Lire Goest.  It wasn\u2019t until they reached a tower on the North side that they found his body, and the bodies of others as well.  Lire was lying face down in the middle of a hand drawn circle on the flagstone flooring.   Surrounding him were bodies in various stages of decomposition.  Each with their arms outstretched toward the circle.  The circle was encompassed with various symbols and etchings that no one could decipher, or wanted to.  The room in the tower was cluttered with objects of curiosity and wonder.  The majority of these items were foreign in nature.   \nRandolph described the silence of the mob to be almost as terrible as the scene before them.  Some saw their relatives strewn about the floor, naked and deformed, reaching in anguish towards the body of Lire.  Some of the townspeople wretched at the sight and left immediately, others stood gaping in amazement of the scene, trying to put together in their minds what had happened in this terrible room.  But Randolph had other ideas as a long smile crept across his face.  There were things of value for sure in this room, and could be fetched at a nice price too.  It would be a shame if what had happened here went for naught and nothing come about of it.   \nRandolph told me of the lectern next to the circle.  On it was an old book that stood out to his wandering eyes in search of the most valuable thing.  He claimed it had the most worth because it was not lumped all together with the other items, no, this book was special.  It had been singled out on the stand as something of importance to Lire.  Something he had used often by the looks of it.  And so, as the remainder of the residents stood idly by not noticing, Randolph stole the book and placed it under his shirt.   \nThe rest of the tale he told me is of no use.  The people left and boarded up the castle, his name was never to be mentioned again.  Eventually it was burned by the local clergy, but the rock and mortar shell still stands as a reminder to all of what horrors had occurred there.  \nIt was at this point of the story that Randolph produced the book and gently slid it towards my hands on the table.  Where he had it the whole time I will never know, but there it was at my fingertips.  There was a price attached of course, and Randolph allowed me to savor the moment first before letting me know it. \nI paid it of course, which is why you are holding it now in your hands.  Myself and a few handpicked scribes copied the original hundreds of times, knowing that if anyone were to find the original, they would burn it.  This book could not leave this world, it had to be preserved.  It is every spell that the Necromancer Lire Goest painstakingly scribed and illustrated in his own hand to create the work that he had done for years in that castle on the hill of Eastbourne.   \nBe warned though reader, to practice this type of necromancy could cause harm to you and to others.  Keep it in a safe place, memorize the work herein, and go forth in life with it on the tip of your tongue for both protection and defense. \nPhil Stone \nT- Shirt BACK from the rewards\nT- Shirt front from rewards\nImage from the book\nAnother image from the book", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risk is not being funded.

Perched on his massive throne, the Sea King dreams of his massive jaws bathing in runnels of fresh land-dweller blood. He dreams of the ecstasy of rending air-breather flesh. His hate-filled dreams suffuse him with visions of presiding over a glorious and bloody feast where his despised enemies, those both above and below the waves, drown in a tide of their own blood, torn apart by his fierce warriors. In this sprawling adventure the characters will come face to face with this terrible menace.\nSea King\u2019s Malice is a full color and lavishly illustrated 5e adventure for the world\u2019s most popular role-playing game that takes characters on a sweeping adventure across the ocean, to previously uncharted lands, and finally down under the waves to the very depths of the sea. It is also available for the 0E Swords & Wizardry system for those preferring old-school rulesets.\nOn the East Coast of the Crescent Sea sits the vital city of Bridgeport, where the merchant company of Zephyr Assimilated has mysteriously lost a ship. Not just any ship, either, but  their flagship, a well-outfitted, well-provisioned merchant vessel with a veteran captain \u2014 who also happens to be the eldest child of Zephyr Assimilated\u2019s owner, Jaxon Brand.\nBrand is now assembling an expedition to search for and rescue the lost ship... \nOnly the most stalwart and bravest of heroes will have any chance of surviving the hazards of the open sea and the perils of other strange and yet unknown lands, both above and below the waves, as they search for clues surrounding the disappearance of the missing ship.  For in the sea-green depths a brooding menace awaits them, filled with  inhuman hatred of all things of the surface world. The adventurers\u2019 journey will end, one way or the other, in the Court of the terrifying Sea King. This edge-of-your seat 5e adventure takes characters to level 10, and is also available for Swords & Wizardry (0e) The Swords & Wizardry version will begin at higher level and cover fewer level advancements.\n\n Do you have the courage, fortitude, and lack of self-preservation to challenge the terror of the seas \u2013 the terrible and brooding menace of the Sea King? Surely only the foolhardy or the truly desperate would actually seek out this horror in the abyssal depths and confront him in his court, his very seat of power!  For the sea is an unforgiving place, the natural realm of the Sea King, and the characters are merely intruders in his realm. And yet \u2026 perhaps they will turn out to be very deadly intruders indeed\u2026 \n\nThe Treasure from Beadle & Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse.\nFrog God Games is very proud to announce our partnership with Beadle & Grimm\u2019s Pandemonium Warehouse. They are the premier creator of high-end tools for tabletop game masters and players worldwide. The Map Vault: Sea King's Malice is the first of a planned series of limited edition maps for gamers everywhere.\nDear friends,\nAs grizzled veterans of the original AD&D, Alex\u2019s tale of the Sea King really spoke to us here at Beadle & Grimm\u2019s. The rules may be 5th Edition, but the vibe is old school in the best possible way \u2013 it strikes the perfect balance between heady role-playing, tense dungeon-crawling  and visceral, gory combat. We\u2019ve been looking for an opportunity to try something new, so we\u2019re very grateful to Alex and Frog God for inviting us to create a special enhancement for the Sea King\u2019s Malice adventure \u2013 our first-ever selection from the B&G Map Vault.\n\nThe Sea King\u2019s Edition of the Map Vault focuses on one of the most exciting and unique elements of Alex\u2019s story \u2013 the sailing ships. Three different ships are presented here, each on its own two-sided 24x30 map with art created exclusively for Beadle & Grimm\u2019s. One side has the full-color detail of a ship from the adventure, while the other has blank interiors and a dry erase surface so that you, the Dungeon Master, can use it to create future adventures from your own imagination. All six battle maps are scaled and gridded for your minis, and they come rolled in a custom cartographer\u2019s tube to keep them protected for years of future use.\nPrototype of the Map Vault: Sea King's Malice Cartographer's case.\nBeadle & Grimm\u2019s Pandemonium Warehouse was founded in 2018 by five old friends with more decades of gaming between them than they\u2019d like to admit.

Now with our new Map Vault, we get to reach out to the vibrant extended community of 5th Edition gamers.\nOne last thing \u2013 like our Platinum boxes, the Sea King\u2019s maps are a limited edition only \u2013 once they\u2019re sold out, they\u2019re gone forever.

At this event, we will pay for your:\nConvention badge \nHotel room \nMeals and beverages\nAll you pay is your transportation to and from the convention! Shipping is also FREE, anywhere in the world! This is where you get to hang out with us behind the scenes, eat dinners with us, play in our games during the day, and generally stay up late without your parents telling you that it's bedtime. Ask any of our fans that have bought this pledge before, it\u2019s truly a wonderful experience! This reward also includes automatic entry into a game game run by Alex Kammer at North Texas RPG Con or at Gamehole Con in 2019 or 2020! Plus a VIP invitation to Bill Webb's Tegel Manor Halloween Game at Gamehole Con (2019 Only)!\nBook Quality\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way).  PLEASE NOTE! The POD option for this books is a softcover book and is NOT library bound. That being said, it is significantly less expensive to ship if you live in the UK, EU or Australia.\nBackerKit\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward! \nDigital Reward Shipping\nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\nWhen the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds\nIf for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter, Backerkit and Paypal. \nOverseas Shipping\nThis hardcover book likely will cost around $60 to $80 to ship to non-US customers. We continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out.We actually have considered not even selling books overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart. Due to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70 or even $100 to reship. We discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service. We will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books--and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all overseas shipments. T We hate to do this--but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (24!) Kickstarter programs in the past. As with any crowdfunding program, the time-lapse between payment and delivery of a final product is subject to various risks, including the failure of a supplier, damage in shipment, disruptions within a company, invasions by carnivorous space rabbits and changes in the prices of materials and shipping. Experience gained over a number of projects makes us confident that we have contingency plans for the ordinary, foreseeable issues that might arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Chicken of the Sea", "descp": "No reward, but we thank you kindly for your support!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Digital Sahuagin Warrior", "descp": "PDF Copy of the Sea KIng's Malice in either Swords and Wizardry of 5th Edition\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy of the Sea King's Malice\nAll free digital stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["85 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Digital Sahuagin Chief", "descp": "PDF Copies of the Sea KIng's Malice, The Ecology of the Sahuagin, the Monster Appendix and the Introductory Module in your choice of Swords and Wizardry or 5th Edition\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy of Ecology of the Sahuagin\nPDF Copy of the Sea King's Malice\nPDF Copy of Rocky Cove\nPDF Copy of the Monster Reference\nAll free digital stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["280 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Sahuagin Warrior", "descp": "Hardcover book in your choice of Swords and Wizardry or 5th Edition\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical Copy of the Hardcover Sea King's Malice\nPDF Copy of the Sea King's Malice\nShipping not included,All Non-US Customers PLEASE READ SHIPPING\nAll free digital stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["188 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 41 or more", "title": "International POD Sahuagin Warrior", "descp": "POD Softcover book in your choice of Swords and Wizardry or 5th Edition\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy of the Sea King's Malice\nPOD Physical Copy of the Sea King's Malice\nShipping not included,All Non-US Customers PLEASE READ SHIPPING\nAll free digital stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Beadle & Grimm's Sea King's Ship Maps", "descp": "Get the Beadle & Grimm's Map Vault: Sea King's Malice Limited Edition!

After that individual book titles will be listed at their full retail price.\nHere's what we're doing to help everyone upgrade to the latest version of the rules:\n1) Previous PDFs of the three core Savage Rifts\u00ae books, whether purchased through Kickstarter, DriveThru, or our site, will be updated automatically. (If you want to keep the older files, save them off and rename them, or contact us at site.admin at peginc.com.)\n2) Print copies (now all in hardback) are bundled below at the lowest price we ever plan to offer them. Once the Kickstarter and pledge manager are closed, they'll be listed at their full retail price.\n3) Our primary Stretch Goal is The Tomorrow Legion Field Guide. Within, we'll be updating original Savage Rifts\u00ae supplements AND adding new material as well (see Stretch Goals, below). Every backer at the Digital Core level and above gets this collected PDF for FREE. It will be available for general sale to others afterwards, and since we hit the Stretch Goal it will be given to every physical backer in print too!\nAny Questions? Email Pinnacle customer service at site.admin@peginc.com\nJust Want Individual Books?\nIndividual titles will be available as Add-Ons to physical reward levels in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. You may also pledge at a digital reward level and upgrade to a physical reward level in the pledge manager. These books will be priced at their regular retail prices, however. If you want the best deal, the reward tiers listed above offer the best savings.\nIf you only want one of the books in this line, we recommend you preorder from a retailer and pledge here for a digital reward level. You may also wait to order from the PEGinc.com website after the pledge manager closes. \nAny Questions?

In the south, the Vampire Kingdoms plot. In the east, mutant tribes stalk Dinosaur Swamp and ghost-haunted Madhaven. In the north, the alien Xiticix and the demonic Kingdom of Monsters threaten all life on Rifts\u00ae Earth!\nExtensive faction descriptions, new Savage Tales, and over 40 new creatures help Game Masters bring these other new threats to life, while the Plot Point Campaign Into the Desert Night plunges the Legionnaires into a deadly duel with the Vampire Kingdoms!\nHope blooms anew!\nRifts\u00ae North America: Blood & Banes contains options for players to bring new allies to life as auxiliary Legionnaires. Reid\u2019s Rangers, the Knights of the White Rose, the Deathbringer Tribe, and the Tundra Rangers stand ready to fight against these banes.\nInside you will find new Iconic Frameworks such as the ethical Necromancer and Secondary Vampire, M.A.R.S. packages like the Barbarian and Dinosaur Hunter, new races including the Centaur and Werecat, and plenty of gear and vehicles to help your heroes take the fight to the worst North America offers.\nRifts\u00ae North America: Arcana & Mysticism\nTranscend your limits!\nAll Legionnaires know of the vile Federation of Magic and its vendetta against the Coalition States, but few comprehend the eldritch powers found further abroad\u2026\nWhat do your Legionnaires know of the Spirit West\u2014the Techno-Wizards of Arzno, the Native American Preserves, or the glory of Tryth-Sal? What do they understand of Lazlo and the territories it defends? What do they truly know about the political machinations splitting the Magic Zone apart?\nUnleash your power.\nRifts\u00ae North America: Arcana & Mysticism gives players the tools to dive deep into the magical side of Rifts\u00ae. New Iconic Frameworks and M.A.R.S.

The Plot Point Campaign Souls of Darkness integrates mysterious Psyscape into Castle Refuge\u2019s alliances and rivalries. This epic adventure reshapes the Tomorrow Legion\u2019s role on Rifts\u00ae Earth!\nRifts\u00ae North America: Empires of Humanity\nFight for the future of humanity!\nThe Rifts\u00ae shattered the golden age of technology.\nThe Coalition\u2019s Emperor prosecutes his Crusade for Humanity\u2014seeking to absorb non-arcane human societies and purge all others\u2014encroaching on both the Tomorrow Legion\u2019s potential allies and enemies, accelerating the pace of events set in motion by the Fall of Tolkeen. Corporate states, despotisms, and wild barter towns all employ unbelievably high-tech might.\nThreats such as the Coalition States, Free Quebec, and Pecos Empire abound as do potential allies in places like the New West, Great Lakes Kingdoms, and Texas Free Lands; then there are the enigmatic forces of Archie Three, the Shemarrian Nation, and the Republicans to contend with.\nNow humanity strikes back!\nRifts\u00ae North America: Empires of Humanity shines the spotlight on the sci-fi aspects of Rifts\u00ae. New Mutant Animal races expand beyond Dog Boys while a new Iconic Framework allows players to design their own robot characters from scratch. Treatment Edges offer state-of-the-art possibilities for Juicers while expanded Combat and Professional Edges give gunfighters and mercenaries their day in the sun.\nExtensive new gear options and rules\u2014for power armor, vehicles, guns, explosives, cybernetics, bots, and more\u2014give players and Game Masters more toys than they can handle. The intrigue-laden Plot Point Campaign Ex Machina reveals the hidden history of the Great Cataclysm to the players, while new Savage Tales and over 20 new foes give Game Masters more technological threats to unleash on the Tomorrow Legion.\n Any Questions?

After every campaign, we get a ton of emails from people who didn't know it was happening, so we greatly appreciate your help spreading the word!\n As with the original Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Kickstarter, the Stretch Goals we unlock will be additional material in PDF form, compiled together to form The Tomorrow Legion Field Manual. This collection will be provided free to all backers who pledge at the Digital Core level or higher. Some of this material will be new versions of existing PDFs, revised and updated for the new edition of Savage Worlds, and some will be all-new information and adventures created specifically for this campaign. \n\n\nSocial Media Goals\nHelp us spread the word to Rifters far and wide. In return, we'll unlock additional Social Media Goals: like bonus stretch goals but unlocked by activity on social media. The more we spread the word, the more goals we unlock.\nEvery share and reaction moves toward the next Social Media Goal. Please help us reach as many Rifts\u00ae players as possible by following us on Twitter and/or Facebook and boost the signal.\nNote: Add-Ons may incur additional shipping. Only physical reward backers may pledge for Add-Ons. Shipping will be collected after the Kickstarter during the survey (see below).\nThe pledge manager survey is sent after the Kickstarter ends. You may either pledge for Add-On items *now* or during the *survey*. There is no preference given to those who pledge during the Kickstarter on limited items. You will need to watch your email for Kickstarter Updates to know when the pledge manager survey is sent.\nTo Add-On items now, click on the pledge level you want. It should show you the total reward level. Add funds equal to the Add-On item price to your total pledge. There is no special button or function for this--Add-Ons are not part of the Kickstarter website software. Just a tradition. :)\nPlease note you may be charged additional shipping for those Add-On items during the pledge manager (it's the same shipping price whether you Add-On now or later). You will likely pay *something* during the pledge manager\u2014even if you Add-On the shipping estimates shown below\u2014or be left with a credit which cannot be refunded or used. While we appreciate that you want to pay for everything now, it's really best to wait until the pledge manager to pay for shipping. \nTo Add-On items during the survey, do nothing now. When we open the pledge manager, you can choose what Add-Ons you want and your total including shipping will be calculated for you.  You will pay via credit card.\nIf you have any questions, email site.admin@peginc.com.\nAdd-On items will include...\nRevised and Updated Core Books\nSince the original Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Kickstarter, we have revised and updated the core Savage Worlds rules with the Adventure Edition. We took the opportunity to clean up and update the three books from the original Kickstarter and provide them as optional add-ons for this campaign.\nThese books are revised to bring them into line with the new Savage Worlds Adventure Edition rules. We will be providing a conversion guide that covers the changes and additions, but if you prefer to have the latest version, you can add the books to your pledge. \nLimited Kickstarter Exclusive Offer\nFor the duration of this Kickstarter campaign only, we are offering substantial savings on both the new and revised books. Once the Kickstarter ends, these books will again be returned to their regular prices. \nThe new Worldbooks will retail at $39.99 each, or $20 each in pdf format.

The Trial of Heroes follows the tradition of RPG magazines of offering up level-agnostic challenges for characters of any level.\nOne-Shot Adventure by Dave Hamrick. A one-shot adventure in the vein of the old \"Side Treks\" articles that'll work as a nice little side quest. Theme and plot too-be-determined, although it will be centered around 2nd-level characters.\nArticles\nHow to Keep Your Players Engaged by Dave Hamrick. You know the situation: you're explaining an awesome landscape or a tense battle and for whatever reason you can't seem to get your players' attention. Either they're looking at their phones, chatting it up, or just off in la-la-land. Dave Hamrick explains how he keeps his characters engaged in his games and shares some tips on how you can get your players engaged, too.\nRules Supplements\n10 New Cantrips by Dave Hamrick. Everyone has that one or two favorite cantrip that they love to use frequently. But in the end, there isn't a whole lot of variety when it comes to cantrip. Dave Hamrick offers up 10 more cantrips for characters to use.\nMass Combat Basics by Dave Hamrick. To accompany the Battle of Draggard Mine adventure, Dave Hamrick's crafted a full set of easy-to-use mass combat rules that capture the feel of Fifth Edition and lets characters be heroes on wider level.\nNew Playable Race: Laicosts (Mousefolk) by Dave Hamrick. A DMDave classic, laicosts are scallywag mouselike humanoids that stay in tight knit communities. The article will expand on their world and introduce the playable mousefolk.\nTraps & Puzzles Featurette by Dave Hamrick. Need some non-combat challenges for your dungeon encounters? The Traps & Puzzles featurette helps you do just that. \n3 New Arcane Subclasses by Dave Hamrick. The first stretch goal hit for the project was opening up three new subclasses. These subclasses are Wizard Teacher Arcane Tradition, Madness Sorcererous Origin, and Warlock Patron of Forbidden Lore.\n2 New Subclasses by Dave Hamrick. Another stretch goal opened up two new subclasses. These are as-of-yet undetermined, but will probably be related to Forsaken Peak.\n3 Mass Combat Feats by Dave Hamrick. The second stretch goal hit opens up new feats for mass combat campaigns. These will coincide with the mass combat rules.\nMonsters by Jack by Jack Hamrick & TBD. My son Jack draws a monster and artists bring it to life.\n7 New Uncommon Magic Items by Dave Hamrick. This was a bonus stretch goal--I'll be creating 7 uncommon magic items for you to put into your campaign.\n10 New Monsters by Dave Hamrick. More monsters! Already, I have a library of hundreds of monsters on DMDave. What's 10 more?\nRandom Wilderness Tables by Dave Hamrick. Need some ideas for wilderness dressing? This chart of 100 random wilderness encounter will help spice up your adventures.\nDouble-Sided Poster by Justin David Russell. The front cover art and the map for Dragard Mine will be featured on this amazing, high-quality double-sided poster.\nAnd more...\nWith each stretch goal, more content will be added to this already-awesome list. Keep an eye out here on the Kickstarter page as well as communications to see what's coming down the pipe for the first issue of BroadSword Magazine. \nThe best part? The first adventure is already penned and ready to go and the other three adventures are in final draft stages. You can read the original draft on DMDave's website.\nThe Goblin Mine, the first part of The Secret of Forsaken Peak.\nThat means that as soon as you sign on to this Kickstarter, you can get a digital copy of the first adventure, The Secret of Forsaken Peak: The Goblin Mine by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. It's the first part of a HUGE megadelve adventure path that will be included in the magazine.\nWe're nuts for the classic RPG 'zines of the '80s and '90s. \nHowever,  it costs quite a bit to create a high-quality magazine, thick with original art and solid, playtested rules, all compatible with 5th edition. \nPrinting a magazine like this takes some serious capital. That's why we're Kickstarting it. We want to make sure we have the funding necessary for print runs tiny to gargantuan.\nAnd we don't want to cheapen it. While the magazine will intentionally have an old-school-vibe to it (black-and-white interior, pen/ink illustrations, etc.) it will still be printed on the highest quality paper available with perfect binding. \n\"So what's up with BroadSword magazine beyond the first issue? And why should I be excited about it (aka, why should I pay for 12-months of issues?)\"\nGreat question! Here's what you should look forward to with the magazine:\n1) Issues #2 - #6 are already mostly planned out. While we've still got a few nitty gritty details to plan on, here is the \"themes\" for the issues following #1:\n Issue #2 - Horror. To coincide with Halloween, BroadSword will have adventures, articles, and supplements geared around horror stories and monsters.\n Issue #3 - Science fiction. New rules for science fiction along with an accompanying adventure.\n Issue #4 - Winter. Winter based adventures, holidays, and more.\n Issue #5 - Downtime+. Downtime is a cool feature of Fifth Edition, but kinda falls apart at higher levels. The adventures and articles in this issue will address this problem.\n Issue #6 - Gear. Looking for cool, new items for your characters or NPCs? This issue will feature cool weapons, magic items, and more and adventures to compliment them.\n2) We're taking submissions for issues #2 and up. As much as I love creating content, to ensure that we can work on a tight schedule, we will be taking submissions from other creators in the community. This includes artists, adventure-crafted, article-writers, and even homebrewers. And we're paying for the content!\n3) DMDave has 500,000+ words worth of content to fall back on. Worst case scenario (somehow, no one on earth submits anything), we still have 7 months worth of content to fall back on with DMDave.com. That's nearly 600 articles and 500,000+ words worth of original Fifth Edition content.\n4) Multiple Printer Sources. We have three different printers ready to go (include, two of which are associated directly with the business) to print issues in advance. There will be no logistical snafus to slow down printing. And even if there are, we'll be sure to communicate.\n5) Total transparency. Subscribers of the magazine will have full transparency of all the forthcoming content. You'll be able to see what's going on and even offer input either on DMDave.com, our social media accounts, the official BroadSword discord channel and more.\n6) Experience & Research. I have been in ecommerce for nearly a decade. In addition to experience serving customers online, I have done plenty of research and worked closely with other publishers to ensure that any issue that could come up is addressed ahead of time.\nWe're 100% invested in this project and want to make sure that it succeeds.  \nNow it wouldn't be a fun Kickstarter if we didn't have a whole mess of Stretch Goals to offer, too, now would it?\nHere is what you can expect to get along with the magazine should we match these goals: \nMore to come!\nWe know that not everyone is a \"grognard\" like JD and I. That's why this book is not only available in Print format, but Digital format (PDF) as well.\nAs we noted above, the adventure is already completed and ready as both a FREE \"blog\" version which you can read now and a \"preview\" version which you'll receive after the Kickstarter ends. However, the finalized PDF for the magazine will have all new art, get a thorough playtesting analysis, and come with a lot more bonus content. \nPlus we'll partner with other companies and use their experience in digital production to make sure that the finished products are 100% perfecto.\nOne of the most exciting things about BroadSword magazine is that it features the outstanding art of world-class old-school artist Justin David Russell (Epic Werkes Studio). JD is a traditional illustrator, using pen/ink and oil paints to make his creations. \nCheck out some of his art below:\nThe cover art to BroadSword #1/The Secret of Forsaken Peak\nDid I mention that there might be some DRAGONS in DUNGEONS? ;)\n\"Sorry, laddie, but yeh won't be a-tossin' THIS dwarf!\"\nA recent image by JDR, a warrior stumbles upon something... scaly.\nWhat's this pigman? That's how JDR draws goblins!\nThis time, we're offering both preview and playtest material for those who want to try the content out before its official launch.\n What's the difference between the two? \nA playtest involves running at least one of the adventures. Playtesters are acknowledged in the magazine's credits, and have a real say in the difficulty, balance, and playability of the final creation. We'll send backers information on how to sign up.\nA preview just means an early look, without providing any formal feedback and without a listing in the credits. No signup or reports required.\nEveryone who pledges at the $10 level or more gets a FREE copy of Broadsword Magazine preview.\nHere is what you can expect from each of the pledge levels.\n Supporter - You just love us and want to show your support. Awwwww, thanks! :)\n Broadsword #1 PDF only - You just want to read it and print the magazine at your leisure. This pledge level is only $10 and includes all the cool DMDave/JDRussell content.\n Broadsword #1 Print and PDF - You want to get the first issue of Broadsword in a print-ready PDF format as well as the printed collector's copy. This pledge level is only $15 and will include all stretch goals.\n Broadsword 3-Month Subscription (Print & PDF) - You want to see what's up with the first three issues of Broadsword magazine in both printed and PDF format. This pledge level is only $42 (you save $1 per issue) and includes all stretch goals.\n Broadsword 6-Month Subscription (Print & PDF) - You're down with Broadsword and want to see the first six issues of this milestone series in both printed and PDF format.

This pledge level is $144 and includes all stretch goals (you save $3 per issue).\nWe're launching Broadsword Magazine with options for advertisers, too!\nJust like the old RPG magazines, we plan on doing some throwback ads both on the rear and interior covers, as well as four pages at the rear of the magazine, and a center insert with smaller ads (kinda like a \"trading post\").\nWhat's a throwback ad?\nBlack-and-white, artwork of questionable integrity, etc. You may even reference your fancy, new fangled world-wide-web webpage on the interwebs. \nEven though these \"website\" things sound like a fad. Obviously.\nWhat do ads cost?\nAd prices are fixed right now, meaning no matter how many people jump on this Kickstarter, we're going to keep the rate the same for the first issue. \nThat means your ad could be seen by thousands of qualified shoppers for an extremely low rate (cheaper than newspaper ads, but with a more targeted marketing).\nFor those who are worried about too many ads, don't worry. These ads are mostly for fun to add to the old school vibe. The kitschier, the better! Plus, we're only giving up 5% of the entire magazine for this ad space.\nHere are the current ad tiers:\n Full-page/full-color advertisement (only 3 available). These advertisements will be printed on the back of the magazine cover and on the interior covers just like in the old school magazines. Starts at $300. Plus, you get one month of advertising on DMDave.com (100,000 impressions per month), newsletter mentions, plus Instagram and Facebook shoutouts.\n Full-page/black-and-white advertisement (only 4 available). These advertisements will appear in the back of the magazine on the last 4 pages. Starts at $225. Plus, you get one month of advertising on DMDave.com (100,000 impressions per month), newsletter mentions, plus Instagram and Facebook shoutouts.\n 2.5\" by 4.75\" advertisement (Black/White) (only 40 available). These small ads will appear throughout the magazine, again adding to the \"old school vibe\" of Broadsword. Starts at $40. Plus, you get 8,000 impressions on DMDave.com.\n\nPlus, all advertisers get a PDF copy and physical of Broadsword #1!\nEven if you don't have a business, you can use the ad to say thanks! Or give a shoutout to somebody you love, or even propose to JD Russell.\nAd-Ons for Additional Issues\nSome of you have expressed interest in getting both an add and the full subscription plan. Here's how you can do it:\n1) Select the advertising plan that you want to do.\n2) Adjust your pledge amount up by one of the following subscription plans (it already includes the first issue):\n3-month subscription: +$36 (includes shipping, US only)\n6-month subscription: +$87 (includes shipping, US only)\n12-month subscription: +$165 (includes shipping, US only)\n3) Email me at hamrickbrands@gmail.com or contact me via Instagram to confirm your intention.\nFor details on how to do all this, here's a guide for add-ons: How to Do Add-Ons\nSo who are the creative nut jobs behind this incredible project? Here are the folks involved in the creation of Broadsword Magazine: \nJustin David Russell (Epic Werkes Studios), Artist and Creator is also a grognard roleplayer, having played just as long (if not longer). He's the creator of the The Forsaken Peak adventure path's setting, the illustrator of all the maps, interior artwork, and cover illustrations for Broadsword magazine. He's one of the hardest working illustrators in the roleplaying world today.  You can see his artwork above.\nDave Hamrick, Designer and Publisher has been a roleplayer and GM for nearly 28 years. He's also a full time writer and author, business owner, and game designer. He's the guy that maintains DMDave.com and writes most of the material for it (over 500 articles with nearly 1,000,000 words of original Fifth Edition content), including all adventures in the first issue of Broadsword magazine. This isn't his first rodeo, either. He's owned an Amazon business for four years as well as multiple digital media sites and has countless contacts in both the game and product fulfillment industry.\nStill not sold? Check out what folks have to say about our content:\n\"Amazing content and takes into careful consideration all mechanics and lore surrounding not just 5e but prior editions.\" - Facebook fan\n\"Great Content. Good ideas and monster creation.\" - Facebook fan\n\"Keep up the great work, DMDave, really enjoy all your creations!\" - Patreon fan\nRegarding the launch of BroadSword magazine:\n\"Cool! This sounds awesome and I\u2019m looking forward to checking it out when it goes live. Always looking for 5e adventures done in the vein of old Dungeon Magazine.\" - Kickstarter Follower\n\"Yes, and yes. Did I say yes? Yes I did.\" - Kickstarter Follower\n\"I\u2019m super pumped for this can\u2019t wait I\u2019ll definitely be get the year subscription on launch.\" - Kickstarter Follower\nFrom Kickstarter Backers:\n\"I have a 0% chance to be able to write/edit/make something like this happen but for the last year or so I have been hoping that SOMEONE would make a magazine similar to Dungeon. I am just a print kind of guy, PDFs don't do it for me.\" - Kickstarter Backer\n\"Thank you and I'm excited about this. I was a very long-time subscriber to Dragon, Dungeon, and Kobold Quarterly so this is exactly what I've been waiting for!\" - Kickstarter Backer\n20,500 + Followers on Instagam (with a 20%+ engagement rate)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe entire magazine is drafted and ready. We've sourced the costs with manufacturers and they're just waiting for our final art. The only thing missing are the commissions and backer elements as well as any necessary adjustments from playtesting. All of the interior cartography is completed as well as is the cover art and most of the interior art. However, there's still a little work to do in art, adding in any extra details, playtesting, editing, and development, not to mention layouts and final designs.\n\nHowever, Dave Hamrick, the lead designer has been a professional game and product designer and fulfillment specialist for four years. He already owns his own Amazon business and has an extremely popular website with 150,000+ monthly viewers. Plus, he has multiple contacts in the book industry and China and a printer is already lined up with deposits pre-placed. In addition, he's working closely with veterans of Kickstarter projects, with over 5 projects between them. Finally, he writes for a company that specializes in product development and design with over 100 employees. All of these experts are assisting in consultation on the product to ensure success of the Kickstarter itself and its subsequent fulfillment.\n\nFor future issues, submissions will be accepted to ensure regular content and DMDave has nearly 600+ original articles on his site to pull from if need be (including a ton of previously unreleased articles). \n\nPlus, we're giving ourselves 4-5 months before the first issue to create the first six issues' worth of content. Our printers are already prepared for monthly editions and will have proofs/artwork/etc in their hands 2-3 months in advance of printing. Any hiccups in transport, content creation, etc. will be communicated to all subscribers in advance so if there are any problems subscribers will have plenty of advance notice. If the magazine ends for any reason, any outstanding fees will be returned to subscribers in a pro-rated format.\n\nThere are no additional projects on the table. This is it. Nothing to get in the way or screw up logistics.\n\nWe require no external review or approval from other companies to make this magazine happen, and we've been working on it long enough to see it is coming together well.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Support the Project", "descp": "You get the project news and updates, and your name gets mentioned in our acknowledgements section.

Prior to using the material contained within please be sure to discuss with your group what you plan to include in your game. \nLamp\u2019s Light was written for mature audiences. It is designed to portray a gritty, unsettling, and evocative setting so you and your players can delve into aspects of the game that are not typically explored. Our intent is not to shock, offend, or demean anyone. That said, this supplement explores many behaviors and situations that may not be suitable for all audiences. \nThe classic tropes and creatures of horror are widely used within the 5th edition of the world\u2019s most famous roleplaying game and yet few would consider it a \u201chorror\u201d game. Why is that? The heroes are larger than life, their actions do not generally have long-term consequences, and a horde of flesh-eating ghouls is little more than a momentary distraction. Clearly copious amounts of blood, violence, and gore do not make a game a horror game. To instill a sense of horror \u2014 or more accurately, dread \u2014 in a 5th edition game, other modalities should be explored.\nLamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium\nLamp\u2019s Light as a setting focuses primarily on two things: the horrors that are inflicted upon others, in particular the mentally ill, disadvantaged, and forgotten; and the slow loss of control of oneself as psychic, intellectual, and emotional scars accumulate over a lifetime of conflict. \nWithin the walls of Lamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium, you will find all manner of medical marvels. The sick will be healed, the lame made to walk again, the mute will regain their voices, and miracles are seemingly an everyday occurrence. The facility\u2019s reputation amongst the wealthy is spotless. The staff is educated, knows their place, and most importantly are discreet. The academic elite view Lucien Prosper\u2019s legacy as the pinnacle of research and cutting-edge treatments for maladies that cannot be cured by other means. The poor know that Lamp\u2019s Light helps them when it is able, taking in ailing children and afflicted adults who have nowhere else to turn. The religious orders of the city publicly praise Lamp\u2019s Light for their philanthropy, while privately condemning them for their reliance on the arcane arts of science and technology. \nThese wonders come at a price, one that Dr. Orson Renwick has paid countless times over his tenure. Dr. Renwick has been experimenting on his patients since shortly after the asylum opened its doors. All in the name of science, progress, and the greater good. With each success, and failure, his perception of acceptable evolved, twisted, and expanded to until no depredation was too taboo. The horrors he\u2019s inflicted upon countless patients all began with the best intentions.  \nIn the course of a lifetime of adventure, intrigue, and exploration our heroes face challenges that would break a normal man or woman. Luckily, they are made of sterner stuff and weather the storm to fight another day. The heroes have been a part of countless battles, exposed to effects that cause direct injury to their mind, met creatures whose very presence instills primal terror, and are targets of mind-affecting magic. Like anything exposed to the elements the small chips, cracks, and erosion wears away the outer shell until all that\u2019s left is the exposed, raw core. The psychic scars left behind change a character. \nThe Book\nLamp\u2019s Light is a fully realized horror sourcebook for the 5th edition of the world\u2019s most famous roleplaying game. This black and white campaign guide has an expected page count of 130+ pages. As stretch goals are met additional content will be added and the book expanded to accommodate. \nLamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium is a sprawling estate beautifully detailed in hand drawn maps by Toby Lancaster of Dark Realm Maps. The asylum is charted with six individual maps each of which has dozens of fully described rooms. The asylum is equally at home as an oasis in an urban environment or as an idyllic country estate. The characters, themes, and setting are distinctly Victorian with Gothic and steampunk elements.\nMap excerpt from Dark Realm Maps\nLamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium is, above all else, a framework that can generate dozens of adventures, full campaigns, and countless hours of roleplaying. Adventure hooks are included throughout the book to fire the imagination of DMs and players. Sections include:\n Lamp's Light in Your Campaign: How to incorporate Lamp's Light into an existing campaign such as those available Wizards of the Coast, Kobold Press, and other publishers.\n New adventures: Discordant Scriptures (a Lamp's Light adventure for mid-level PCs). An alien intelligence has been drawn to the confluence of dissonant minds contained within Lamp\u2019s Light. Administrator Rose, at the behest of her patron, has urged the residents of the facility to record their mad dreams within the pages of a dream journal. Rose believes that the collected journals contain within them the knowledge needed to release her patron from its imprisonment on another plane. Tabula Rosa (a Lamp's Light adventure for low level PCs) begins with the players as unwilling patients and subjects of test experiments. They are quickly drawn into the intrigues of the asylum and must make difficult decisions if they are to escape.\n Story frameworks: In additional to Discordant Scriptures there will be half a dozen 2-3 page story frameworks ready for you to customize and build upon for your individual campaigns. \nPatient 11 and Dr. Orson Renwick by Matt Ray\nKey staff, patients and other inhabitants of Lamp\u2019s Light are detailed with statblocks, backgrounds, illustrations, and everything needed to incorporate them into your sessions. Dr. Renwick, Administrator Rose, and the man known as Patient 11 are but a few of the NPCs walking the halls of Lamp\u2019s Light. Orderlies, Patients, and other creatures are covered in the same level of detail.  \n New Rules for Managing Sanity \nart by Samantha Darcy\nThe sanity and madness rules presented enhance role-playing, create challenges for the players, and bring more color to your game. 5th edition characters are, above all else, exceptional. They are capable of winning virtually any fight, overcoming epic challenges, and creating miracles. These rules keep that spirit in mind. \nThe 20 pages of new rules build upon the framework provided by the DMG. There are expansive tables for transient, short-term, long-term, and indefinite madness, with nearly 50 different entries describing the narrative and mechanical effects on the character. \nFor DMs looking for more color without the added mechanical crunch the narrative descriptions provide ample fodder for you and your players to role-play.\nLast, but not least, there will be a custom form-fillable PDF character sheet fully compatible with the sanity rules. \nThe Pledge Levels\n$1 \u2013 Visitor\u2019s Pass: Thank you and access to backer only updates\nDM Screen Insert of New Sanity Rules (PDF)\n$5 \u2013 Curious Observer: You get a copy of the Sanity Rules written for Lamp\u2019s Light and a custom form-fillable PDF character sheet for 5e\nLamp\u2019s Light Custom Character Sheet\nSanity and Madness Rules\n DM Screen Insert of New Sanity Rules (PDF)\n$15 \u2013 Frenetic Patient: as above, you also get a PDF of Lamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium, and your name in the book\nDM Screen Insert of New Sanity Rules (PDF)\nYour name will appear in the book\nLamp\u2019s Light PDF; DRM-free and indexed\nLamp\u2019s Light Custom Character Sheet\nSanity and Madness Rules\n DM Screen Insert of New Sanity Rules (PDF)\n$21 \u2013 Devoted Alienist: as above, and POD (backer pays for print cost + shipping) through DriveThruRPG\nPhysical book (POD, backer pays print and shipping costs)\nYour name will appear in the book\nLamp\u2019s Light PDF; DRM-free and indexed\nLamp\u2019s Light Custom Character Sheet\nSanity and Madness Rules\n DM Screen Insert of New Sanity Rules (PDF)\n$40 \u2013 Faculty Consultation:  As above, and Dr. Renwick will write a psychiatric evaluation for you on one of your characters or one of your player's character.

My goal is a timely and efficient turn-around after successful funding. To accomplish this contracts and collaborations with other creators have already been initiated and in many cases completed. This is where we\u2019re at now:\nThe manuscript is in editing. \nThe cover is complete. \nCartography for the three main floors of the asylum is complete. \nStory art is completed. \nPortraits and NPC art are 50% complete.\nAll artists have been identified and are ready to begin their commissions.\nLayout has been contracted and is ready to go.\nShipping: Print Book Fulfilled by DTRPG\nThe backer tier price is low for the print version because you will be paying DTRPG directly for base print cost and shipping. DriveThru RPG can ship to you from a nearby distribution center, which equals better shipping costs for you, especially outside of the United States.\nWhen you back the print version of Lamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium you will receive a redemption code that gets you the complete book; you only pay the cost of printing and shipping through DriveThru RPG.\nHow Much Will the Print Book Cost?\nWe won't know until the final version is submitted to DriveThru RPG for approval, but their cost calculator says a 130 page softcover (large, black & white) comes to ~$4.50 USD. https://www.drivethrurpg.com/pub_pod_cost.php\nHow Much Will Shipping Cost?\nThis will vary by country, the final page count, and the final weight of the book. Their shipping estimates indicate ~$5 USD for standard shipping within the US. https://support.drivethrurpg.com/hc/en-us/articles/209936893-Estimated-Shipping-Costs-For-Printed-Products", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium is Saturday Morning Scenarios\u2019 first Kickstarter.

(Add +$10 for engraving) \nThis project is in its pre-production phase - we have a manufacturer and are ready to go!

The DICE are the lifeblood of any tabletop game and have been both my friend and foe since I was a kid - bringing the first adventures of the famous Red Box to life for my burgeoning imagination.  \n--------------------------\nStretch Goals:\nLet's see how the initial push goes and we'll talk :)  \nI do have several ideas for stretch goals, including adding a couple of by-request classes - Paladin? Ranger? Warlock?\n-----------------------------EXTRAS AND OPTIONS!--------------------------------\nAll options will be available in the backerkit!\nPersonalized Engraving \"Your Name Here\" (Add +$10) \nPersonalize your dice stick with your own custom engraving!\n-----------------------\nHere are some of the other boxes I make and sell through my Etsy store -KBOX Imp (Sale! $20.00)\nThe KBOX \"Imp\"\nKBOX Tome (Sale! $65.00): \nThe KBOX Tome\nKBOX Grand Vizier (Sale! $85.00): \nThe Grand Vizier\nKBOX GM Screen (Sale! $85.00):  \nThe GM Screen", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has it's potential pitfalls and this one is no exception. \n\nThe boxes are designed and ready to make, but the dice are yet to be stamped. If you are ever in the market, custom dice are EXPENSIVE. \n\nSo WHY the $10,000 price tag? The dice alone are going to eat up about 80% of that cost to get the custom stamp on the high-side face of each die - across four classes - that's a lot of work for the manufacturer and it doesn't come cheap. \n\nWhile they are ready to go, there could always be problems with the stamp, with the dice color, with any number of things that are different than my expectations. \n\nBUT FRET NOT FRIEND - for YOU, the backer will be with us the whole way along this journey and we will continuously update you both here and on our Facebook page as to the status of this project. \n\nLastly, as I learned from my last Kickstarter, shipping is the true killer of any new endeavor - as a result, I'm asking for you, the backer, to meet me in the middle and help out with shipping.\n\nWe know this will work and we KNOW it will be awesome for all our backers.

Alessia casts off the traditional fantasy assumptions and introduces players to a wider world with a host of new species, technology, powers, and places to explore - for both Starfinder and 5e.\nA terran monk and his allies battle a summoned servant of the Cult of Galgar\u00e6. ~Illustration by Septimius Ferdian\nThe World of Alessia is a high-fantasy campaign setting that combines Wuxia, science fiction, and magic-driven technology. It is a massive world where magic and technology coexist peacefully, impacting every aspect of life, from the Healing Houses of Sillias to the Great Towers of Xin. It is a land where Fyrean Genies meet with Asrian Wardens and The Gangs of Khatu push their Drifters across the desert sands, seeking resources and victims of every kind.\nMockup image of the Campaign Primer\nThe World of Alessia Campaign Primer is a comprehensive introduction to Alessia. The primer includes details on the world of Alessia, its threats, the factions that drive its politics, and the many people who walk Alessia's streets.\nA host of new familiars grace the pages of the primer.\nBeautifully illustrated with full-color art, the World of Alessia Campaign Primer will inspire GMs while providing players with a host of new options to take their 5e or Starfinder game to the next level.\nThe World of Alessia Campaign Primer brings you:\n11 new races (and more with each stretch goal we achieve).\n4 new classes - the Marauder, the Psion, the Seer, and the Tecker.\nA system of Stunts and Resolve (for 5e play).\nA garage full of new gear, vehicles, armor, and weapons for your 5e and Starfinder games.\nNew rules for attaining unique familiars.\nAnd lots more awesome options for your game!\nTake a peek at the four new classes.\nMarauders are trained to bring the pain.\nA modern-day gunslinger with a penchant for heavy weapons, the marauder specializes in energy and kinetic missile weapons of all sorts; whether using energy rifles or high-powered ballistics, these individuals bring the pain - often from far away.\nTeckers make it happen!\n A step above mere \u201ctinkerers,\u201d teckers represent the inquisitive mind turned outward, specifically toward some of Alessia\u2019s dangerous elements; at 3rd level, most teckers choose a specialty, becoming breachers (magical hackers and intrusion specialists), devs (device hackers and magitech specialists), or speeders (vehicle experts).\n\nA gnole psion enhances his weapons.\nFairly common among the Elathi, the psion is a master of the mind. Psions spend their lives navigating the inner spaces; as a class, psions focus on making excellent use of their natural psychic abilities to solve problems and defend their allies.\n\nAn elven seer plays with the local kaima.\n Seers operate on the other end of the spectrum, working in tandem with Alessia\u2019s spirits, specifically the Kaima. Common among the Celestia, as well as the Elath, Seers spend their days whispering the unseen, either to help or to harm.\n\nAre you ready to learn more about Alessia?\nZhang Wei, Imperial Peacekeeper\nTake a look at Alessia through the eyes of Seirye Qin, Captain of the Skyship Amethyst Myst. When you're done learning about her, take a look at Xei, Dragonsworn Ghost Monk, the honorable Zhang Wei, Human Peacekeeper, or even one of the mysterious Elathi.\nWho are the Ish'ra?\nWhile many of the traditional fantasy races exist in Alessia, some do not. Moreover, the humans of Alessia are not the dominant species on the planet. The humans share that position with their cousins, the Djinnkin, and Terrans. Compared to the Y\u00f6kai and all their lines, the humans are a small line indeed.\nThe Treah are one of Alessia's core races.\n Creatures born to defend the Trees of Life, the Treah are a race of bipedal, humanoids with bark-like skin and fibrous frames. Because of their natural connection to the Trees of Life, Treah frequently become druids and rangers. The Treah have traditions, as well. These traditions encourage the Treah to take up several Sacred Paths, eventually turning these seedlings into Dream Wardens and Envoys of the Green.\nVelestrian elves work hand in hand with the Treah to protect the fabled Trees of Life\n The dominant people of the continent of Velestra, elves have a complex, sometimes confusing social hierarchy that many outsiders find off-putting. Although elves see themselves as a single people, much of Alessia classifies them according to their homeland; Fyreani (widely known as desert elves) roam much of Alessia\u2019s eastern lands, while the Velestrians (also known as green or wood elves) stand sentry for the fabled Trees of Life. The Un\u2019Seeliaha (commonly known as dark elves) are the final group of elves. Rejected by the Trees of Life for reasons known only to the elves, this group of outcasts \u2013 their skins marked with arcane sigils for their crimes \u2013 wanders the southern coasts of Galgar\u00e6, living along the coastlines.\nThe Celestia first appeared after the Old Gods disappeared.\n Beings infused with The Light, the very first Celestia rose from the ashes of the War of Sovereigns like saints among men, taking on the holy charge of The Light and helping to carve out what would later become the Holy Kingdom of Asrai. Naturally biased toward the light, the Celestia resemble Humans or Terrans, often with soft and symmetrical features. Naturally beautiful, these beings have no problem attuning to the Light. Some Celestia (although not all) are born with large, angel-like wings.\nAfter several millennia on Alessia, the Ish'ra now call this pale blue dot home.\n One of Alessia\u2019s oldest races, the Ish\u2019ra were refugees when the Y\u00f6kai were still young; fleeing from the dark spaces beyond the void, the Ish\u2019ra voidship The Enduring Dream breached Alessia\u2019s atmosphere when the Y\u00f6kai Warlords were still in power, crashing into central Elysia and depositing her survivors all along Elysian coasts. Having naturalized to Alessia over their millennia-long stay, the Ish\u2019ra now proudly identify as natives to their new home. Natural psychics with several technical aptitudes, the Ish\u2019ra have contributed to much of Alessia\u2019s progress.\nXei, like all Ghost Blade Monks, stands guard against evil Kaima\n A people torn between two times, the Dragonsworn of ancient Alessia have a developed and evolved culture that betrays all of the outside stereotypes with glee. From their colorful festivals to their colorful scales, Truescales can trace their clutches back to the very first celestial dragons. Their lesser brethren, which shallow individuals call Dullscales, bear no patterns of lineage, nor \u201cany true history of scale or struggle.\u201d Instead, these persons have transformed themselves through alchemy, magic, or science; sometimes all three.\nAn Elathi seer prepares a spell.\nOne of Alessia\u2019s evolved peoples, the Elathi enjoy some of the visual markers of their elven ancestry, though they are not elves. Today, the Elathi divide themselves into two ancestral lines. The Telathians regard themselves as the natural evolution of elves and have crystalized horns through which they focus their psionic powers. The Illathi lack crystalized horns, but instead enjoy a natural aptitude for \u201clight-shaping\u201d and celestial skills.\nA Terran Cleric of the Light\nStanding slightly taller than your average human, Terrans evolved beside side-by-side with their human and Djinnkin cousins in the heart of Fyrea. Expanding rapidly beside their human cousins and enjoying a slight evolutionary advantage, the Terrans of Alessia now occupy every corner of the planet. Slightly stronger than humans on average, Terrans are also adept climbers, as well as wrestlers \u2013 easy tasks for individuals with an extra set of arms!\nA Fengu Ninja draws her blade.\n Native to the lands that existed before The Great Beast Galgar\u00e6 crashed into cold, dark earth, the Fengu are a broken people. Denied flight by evolution, the Fengu have become a wandering people, traveling the broken coastline of their former homeland, battling for resources while actively engaging the Spawn of Galgar\u00e6.\nA Pandren monk readies his weapon.\n One of the few races that might consider being called Onikuma a compliment, Pandrens are large, muscular warriors evolved from Alessia\u2019s native pandas. Prominent members of the Council of Yerwin, the Pandrens sought sanctuary in Pyrrin Isles and remained there until embracing the Empire of Xian.\nThe Weaslings are exceptionally talented, especially when it comes to tech.\nHaving evolved on the eastern plains of Yerwin, the Weaslings are a race of hyper-intelligent polecats whose agility and charm makes them popular entertainers throughout the Empire of Xian. Talented pilots with a natural affinity for technology, the quickest way to encourage violence is to mention its pelt.\nA Djinnkinn warrior leaps into battle.\nThe offspring of the great Lords of Brass and their human servants, the Djinnkin are also known as Djinnkinn or simply \u2018Kin (and informal, casual greeting shared between aligned houses). Born with all the heat, sun, and motivation someone traveling the deserts of Fyrea could want, the Djinnkin are a resourceful people whose magical gifts and love of transforming cultures and places adds guides their slow expansion throughout Alessia.\nThe World of Alessia is a Wuxia-inspired campaign setting with over two-dozen intelligent, bipedal species united together against the encroaching darkness - which Alessia now faces on multiple fronts. On the planet itself, heroes battle extremists, cultists, and stand watch against incursions from the Spawn of Galgar\u00e6.\n In the skies above Alessia, brave Skyship Captains and Imperial Marines work in tandem to keep the Ring of Heaven functioning, so that Alessia remains shielded from the void beyond.\nA terran seer and her Ish'ra ally look down on the gates of the Holy City of Asrai. ~Illustration by Le Minh Hoai Quoc\nWith more advanced magic and technology, the people of Alessia must confront old problems in new ways.\nWhen the last of the Sovereigns departed, they left Alessia with two gifts - the Ring of Heaven and The Light. The ring is a celestial artifact that works in tandem with the light, defending Alessia against her external threats. \nThe Light is a story. \nIn the wake of the War of the Sovereigns, the people of Alessia looked upward and found, for a time, only silence. When the surviving Sovereigns announced their departure from Alessia, they an entity is known only as The Light.\nIn Alessia, the light manifests through younger adults, manifesting in their early teens and empowering them each in unique ways. Deep in the Holy Kingdom of Asrai, the Holy Prophet of Light watches over world events, considering how best to act for her people.\nKickstarter continues to provide us with the best platform for funding and delivering great projects to gamers the world over. This year, we're launching our most ambitious project to date, one we've been working on for nearly a year now. While we've purchased enough art to make this our most beautiful book yet, we're also bringing back some of our favorite game designers to expand the primer, so we can pack it with all the awesome you'd demand from a great gaming book.\nXei, monk of the Ghost Blade leads a team against a Spawn of Galgar\u00e6 in the caverns below the Fields of Neph in eastern Shiran. ~Illustration by Septimius Ferdian.\nFor this Kickstarter, Storm Bunny Studios will be working directly with DriveThru RPG to deliver a print-on-demand version of the World of Alessia Campaign Primer to ensure delivery to our European backers is as affordable as possible by allowing us to print in the U.K. and ship to you directly. This also lowers the initial pledge costs for backers by eliminating shipping costs at the onset of pledging. So, how does this work? (You pay shipping when you're ready to order the book).\nThis graph explains the process!\n Storm Bunny Studios has learned from its previous Kickstarters. While shipping books to South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, and throughout Europe in 2015-2016, that shipping costs can often exceed the cost of the book. Using this print on demand model, we can lower costs and ensure that our backers get the best possible deal for the money!\nThe Starfinder mockup cover for the World of Alessia Campaign Primer.\n Our Schedule Through 2020\nThe following graphic covers our schedule of planned products through the end of 2020.\nA look at our schedule thru 2020.\nHere are our Pledge Levels, we'll be adding more as they are unlocked.

In the aftermath of World War III, which they started, VENOM's clear goal is world domination, and they will stop at nothing to achieve it.\nThe world's response? Choose the greatest hero of the war, General Abraham Steel, and charge him to recruit an elite fighting force to oppose VENOM and protect liberty for all. That force, comprised of the best-of-the-best from all over the globe, is Freedom Squadron!  \nPlayers take on the role of those who've heeded the call to action. They are new Recruits who must first earn their stripes to become Commandos. Eventually, if they live up to the expectations of trainers like Sandbar, Corporal Carnage, Preedatore, and Blindsight, they may earn their Code Names and carry the fight to VENOM anywhere in the world... and beyond!  \n\"Savage Worlds was created to handle the kinds of games I often like to play and run, where you can be a badass fighter or wizard or whatever, but you can also be a leader. A planner. I'm proud of how the game accommodates that, and my friend Sean Patrick Fannon has added even more to it in Freedom Squadron.\nI had a blast in the Plans & Operations phase riffing off the other players, figuring out how best to use our individual characters' skills, and then watching it all come together in the adventures that followed. Sean isn't afraid of big games and big ideas, and this may be his best yet. I can't wait to back, buy, and run it myself!\"\n-Shane Lacy Hensley (Code Name: BUBBLES), veteran author and game designer, creator of Savage Worlds\u00ae, CEO Pinnacle Entertainment Group\nFreedom Squadron has many new features for Savage Worlds\u00ae fans. Written and designed by Sean Patrick Fannon (Shaintar, Savage Rifts\u00ae), these are special rules both inspired by his previous work and brand new for this setting. These include:  \nPlans & Operations: A unique combination of core Savage Worlds\u00ae game play elements that allows players to engage in multiple missions and actions in an \"action cinema montage\" style. Intelligence gathering, tactical positioning, investigations, covert insertions, computer hacking\u2014anything and everything special ops Commandos might do between their epic battles with VENOM and other enemies. Fast-paced, inclusive, and designed to feature all of a hero's skills, the Plans & Operations rules are sure to enhance any Savage Worlds\u00ae game.\n\nVocation Frameworks and Specializations: Inspired and adapted from the character creation rules of Savage Rifts\u00ae, these allow the player to choose a starting package of skills and abilities that reflect their primary role in the team, while also gaining cool extra abilities rolled randomly from various interesting charts. This is all on top of the usual core Savage Worlds\u00ae character building process.\nNew Edges: like Fighting Style, Operational Planning, Qi Focus, Strange DNA, and the innovative Zone Specialist (allowing heroes to truly shine in various environments like Arctic, Mountain, or Sea Zones). \nSkill Focuses, Gear Points, and much, much more!\nPsi War Big Epic Game at Ghengis Con\nFreedom Squadron for Savage Worlds\u00ae, is based on VENOM Assault\u00ae, the board game created by SpyGlass Games. Evil Beagle Games has worked with World Designer Michael Knight to not only bring the world to life, but to expand on it as well.\nSupplemental gaming accessories not included. Final design subject to change.\n While VENOM Assault\u00ae is not required at all in order to immerse yourself in the world of Freedom Squadron, you can check out SpyGlass Games' website to view many character bios and even purchase the game!\nPinnacle Entertainment Group has created one of the most popular game systems in the world with Savage Worlds\u00ae, specifically oriented towards pulp and cinema action experiences. Sean Patrick Fannon of Evil Beagle Games has worked with them for years, and is the mastermind behind Savage Rifts\u00ae. Creating Freedom Squadron for Savage Worlds\u00ae was never a question.\nWith Pinnacle's new release of Flash Gordon\u2122 the Roleplaying Game, featuring many new rules updates, Freedom Squadron\u00ae is completely up-to-date and represents the state-of-the-art for Savage Worlds\u00ae fans.\nNew To Savage Worlds?\nIf you're new to the Savage Worlds\u00ae rules system, Freedom Squadron\u00ae does require the core rulebook to play. You can get it in print and PDF from Pinnacle's website. Pinnacle Entertainment Group publishes and manufactures the Savage Worlds\u00ae rules book, and maintains this website.\n\"Freedom Squadron offers an RPG experience like no other. This game is bursting with nostalgic tropes and themes, added to the rock-solid gameplay of the Savage Worlds system. The Plans & Operations rules are an innovative mechanic that focuses the action right where it belongs: on your characters facing down VENOM. Freedom Squadron is the perfect way to take on the roles of an elite, highly-trained special mission force and go on exciting adventures in this fully-realized setting!\" - Ross Watson (Code Name: SKIPPER), Product Line Manager Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay: Wrath & Glory; Lead Developer, Savage Rifts; Lead Writer/Designer, Accursed\n\u2022 The Freedom Squadron Commando's Manual:\nThis essential manual is used to create characters in the Freedom Squadron world that will be tough enough and strong enough to pit themselves against VENOM's evil forces. Freedom Squadron brings only the very best into its ranks, which means that every Recruit comes from a background of extensive education, training, and practical field experience. Many are veterans of World War III, other military conflicts, or are otherwise noted experts in their fields.\nPlayers will choose from a large list of Vocation Frameworks, make rolls on one or more Hero's Journey: Freedom Squadron Specialization charts, and either choose or randomly determine a Narrative Hook to design a robust character.\nSimilar to the Iconic Frameworks of Savage Rifts\u00ae, Vocation Frameworks represent a package of Edges, Skills, and special abilities that reflect the training and experience of a Recruit before they joined Freedom Squadron. Expect to find Frameworks such as Driver, Medic, Sailor, Soldier, Tech Specialist, and whole lot more!\nThe Hero's Journey tables are reminiscent of those found in other Savage Worlds\u00ae settings, such as Savage Rifts\u00ae. Each character will gain a number of rolls on select charts based on the player's choice of Vocation Framework. You can gain even more rolls by taking the Squadron Branch Training Edge later during character development. Example charts include Black Ops, Close Quarters Combat, Combat Medicine, Infantry, Logistics, and more.\nThe Narrative Hooks allow a possible connection with other players, as well as the establishing reasons for the hero to become part of Freedom Squadron.\nNew Edges, such as Operational Planning and Zone Specialist, bring new diversity and strengths into Savage Worlds\u00ae. The former enhances the leadership role for any hero who goes that route, while the latter lets characters that are adept at operating within a particular type of terrain really shine in those circumstances.\nBeyond character creation, the Commando's Manual contains essential background history of the world, it's current geo-political status, and the full structure of the Freedom Squadron: Global Operations Force. There's also an arsenal of weapons, equipment, and vehicles (and a Gear Points system for managing who can carry what into the field, and how they can customize their gear). Armed with everything within this book, a well rounded character will be ready to bring down VENOM's plans once and for all!\nFinal design subject to change.\n\u2022 The Freedom Squadron Plans & Operations Manual:\nMore than just a Game Master's handbook, this revolutionary manual contains the tools necessary to run the Plans & Operations phases for campaigns that will make Freedom Squadron\u00ae such a powerful and player-driven experience for fans. As well, the information in this book can easily be adapted to run P&O style sessions in any Savage Worlds\u00ae setting\u2014high fantasy adventurers trying to solve a royal murder; investigators into eldritch horrors tracking down cult activities and ancient artifacts; modern-day mission specialists breaking into enemy strongholds; cyberpunk-style data stealing runs; and much more!\nThis special set of rules is designed to integrate the planning stage of a mission with actual game play. What often used to be a tedious, drawn-out part of many games has now been transformed into something fun and playable as a series of \"mini-games\".\nThis system also brings out the skills and talents of heroes that aren't always as combat-intensive in nature, such as technical abilities and social skills.\nEntire intelligence gathering missions, preemptive battles, social interactions, data hacks, and more quickly become a part of the game session with detailed stories that do not sacrifice hours of game-play.\nSupplimental gaming accessories not included. Final design subject to change.\nThe Plans & Operations Manual works in conjunction with a special set of cards, known as The Plans & Operations Deck. This deck allows for the randomization of mission parameters to be set forth, while still leaving the specifics of the mission vague enough to be able to be integrated into any situation. The result is immersive, fun, and fast.\nFinal design subject to change.\nCheck out this tutorial video where the designer himself, Sean Patrick Fannon, tells you how it works and shows you a sample round of game play with some of his friends.\nThe Freedom Squadron Plans & Operations Manual also contains valuable Game Master information, including a Random Mission Generator system; GM-specific information about VENOM and other antagonists; basic stats for VENOM and other likely foes; and more!\nAdd-On's are optional, additional items that can be added to any Backer Level by increasing your Pledge Level, or by using JetBacker after the Kickstarter ends. As Add-on's are unlocked via Stretch Goals, we will list them here for an easy-view list!\n\u2022 The Freedom Squadron Commando Manual: $25.00\n\u2022 The Freedom Squadron Plans & Operations Manual: $25.00\n\u2022 The Plans & Operations Deck: $15.00\nNote: Additional Shipping may apply.\nAfter multiple requests and great suggestions, we at Evil Beagle Games and SpyGlass Games realize we are best served paying attention to our great fans and backers. Thus, we're announcing a few Backer Goals that will unlock a little differently than standard Stretch Goals. On the Stretch Goal list, we've carefully crafted everything to reflect amazing additions that will unlock as fast as we can, while making sure that we can confidently bring them to you within the budget we've strategically worked out.

I tighten my bandanna as a smirk curls my lips. The moment is right, and my grenade lands perfectly next to the fuel tanks. They didn't have a chance.

The Plans & Operations system is a player driven system that not only rewards clever thinking, careful planning, and teamwork, but makes these things fun and the seed for great roleplaying opportunities.\" - John Atkinson (Code Name: IRON), early supporter, military historian, and instructor in military tactics and planning.\n\"The Planning & Operations deck really brings the game to life! Everybody in the group gets to participate, regardless of their skills and focuses. The cards truly make you feel like a team actively working together to achieve the mission; no one gets left behind. And that is a Freedom fact!\" - Nestor Rodriguez (Code Name: DANCER), longtime Champions fan and highly respected GM and player.\nEvil Beagle Games has worked very closely with a number of FLGS locations in order to offer an amazing Kickstarter experience!\nPlease visit the Retail Backer Level website for terms and conditions: Retail Backers.\nPlease remember to check back often to see if new Retail-only Stretch Goals have been unlocked for you to benefit from!\nFor Retail Backers Only\nAll shipping will be charged after the campaign via JetBacker, our Pledge Manager.

No matter who you are... \nRPG DESIGN CAMP is here for you! \nThis time we are taking an older adventure, the Silver Box, and letting you adapt, change and add to it to make it awesome! \nIn the Silver Box a thrilling encounter with highwaymen uncovers a missing artifact that hurls the PCs into an amazing adventure. The chase leads them on a woodland pursuit into a cave complex where the mystery only increases with the discovery of a pile of dead highwaymen. Who killed the thieves? And where is the Silver Box? From there the PCs follow clues to a nearby city and a series of thrilling urban encounters. Finally, in the conclusion, the heroes face off against the real thieves of the Silver Box in a dramatic shipboard battle in the city harbor. \nOr does it? Your decisions can and probably will alter the adventure toward new directions. \nPerhaps the whole adventure will take place in the cave complex\nPerhaps the city will turn out to be under siege by a vampire hoard\nPerhaps the conclusion will be atop a floating tower rather than a ship? \nThe options are limitless and the deciding factor is you! Don\u2019t just run the adventure be part of the design process and choose the adventure! \nWhat is Design Camp?\nDesign Camp is a collaborative experience where game designers and interested individuals share the process of RPG content creation-- sometimes that means writing a supplement, or an adventure, or setting material, or, like this project, converting a manuscript from one game system to another.\nThe adventure we're planning to convert is The Silver Box, formerly placed in the Iron Kingdoms setting, and covering a number of urban and wilderness locations with a variety of NPCs. We'll discuss it more in updates.\nHow does Design Camp work?\nWe interact with backers through a Basecamp site on the internet (basecamp.com), using that site's infrastructure to chat, email, host files and communicate. We also post here on Kickstarter to provide redundant communication for the project. \nYou'll have a chance to pitch your own design elements during the process, and vote on submitted elements. If your element wins, you can work with designers to implement it, if you want, or you can leave it to us to make those proverbial donuts.\n\nWe work hard to make sure our process is fairly transparent and responsive to backers and their questions. In the end, we want you to understand and feel comfortable with the process of RPG design.\nOur philosophy?\nYou can do this. We know, because we got our start sitting where you're sitting, and ten years later, we're still designing, publishing, and winning awards. RPGs are for everyone. Designing them can be, too. Hold my dice, I got this. ;)\nFirst, we get together.\nThe brainstorming and discussion portions can be very active, as backers all add their thoughts and ideas to the start of a project. But they're just the beginning. We want you to ride this out to the end, and that means participating as we continue...\nThen, we plan out some stuff...\nOnce the outline is created, the base idea is decided, we start pitching specific ideas-- \"What about a cult? How should we present this material? What do we need to make this as useful as possible at the table? Do you need more detail? Less detail? Some weird details?\" This process is also pretty intense, and a lot of fun. Learning how to pitch and formulate ideas can be very rewarding.\nThen we light the fire and get to work!\nOur roots...\nWe all met and began working together as patrons of Kobold Press' Open Design projects, way back in 2007 and the Empire of the Ghouls. It's been gangbusters ever since, closing down Indianapolis bars and burning down orc encampments while cracking open planar portals to Yggdrasil.\n\nWe've written for Ars Magica, Pathfinder, and Dungeons & Dragons from Third Edition all the way to Fifth. We're familiar with a wide variety of systems and games.\nPledges....\nSo what are the levels you can choose to support? I'm glad you asked...\n  We appreciate everyone's support!\nYour name in glorious, glorious text. Well, maybe just one \"glorious.\"\nNow that's a smart move.\nThese are the goods-- maybe you don't have the time for all that interaction, but you want the final result. This is how you make that happen.\nIf you've got the time, taking a 20 is always the safest bet!\nYou like your games and your options. This is how you can compare the adventure in two systems while crushing the bad guys and looting their stuff.\nThis is the full experience.\nJoin us at basecamp, participate in the experience and get a PDF! This is the primary option, and we're going to work hard to make sure you get your money's worth.\nCohorts; letting GMs play the game since 1974!\nYou want to leave a little bit more of a mark on the project and this is how you're going to do it. At this level, you'll work with us to revise an NPC in the adventure to meet your descriptions. Or you can bring us your iconic player character and we'll include it as a pregen! This can be as hands-on intensive as you want, from saying \"I want a human fighter,\" to having a whole backstory to help us craft the details.\nSo, you want to call the shots?\nChallenge us! We're professionals! We can take it! At this level, you can challenge the designers with your encounter design idea. Bring us your combination of elements such as monster, terrain, location type...etc. and we will make it work! Conversely, you can throw in your idea as one of the Pitch Rounds to challenge all of the backers!\nLet's take a peek behind the screen, shall we?\nWe're always happy to lend our thoughts and considerations about a personal project, or to run an online game for you, and at this level, you'll get that benefit along with your Design Camp experience.\nWhat happens if the community is super generous and we get the opportunity to work with a bunch of you? Stretch goals, that's what!\n  Goals!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've run Design Camp before, and Ben, Brian, and Jaye are veterans of nearly a dozen other patron-based RPG projects. This is all about the experience, and so the risks here are minimal. \n\nWe're going to walk you through this process and get you that PDF at the end of things; hopefully, you're going to learn a bit about converting an adventure from one system to another along the way.\n\nWhat could happen? Well, one of us could get hit by the milk truck. Unlikely, but possible. Space debris could impact us. Again, might happen. With three of us working on this conversion, it should be able to handle events even as catastrophic as either of these. This manuscript is written and prepared for conversion. As long as one of us survives, you'll get your adventure, it just might take us a little longer.

Check out the sample magical item, Abhorrent Naginata, available for free only during this KS campaign.  It's 10 pages of lavishly-detailed goodness, all dedicated to a single, nifty magic weapon.  It's a good example of what to expect... times dozens of items!\nIllustration credit Kim van Deun\nThis product is a massive, 200+ page full-color PDF and hardcover roleplaying supplement that will enhance any Pathfinder or 5E campaign in any setting.\nArtifacts & Artifice will be a richly detailed hardcover gaming sourcebook, and companion to one of the most ambitious and massive indie RPG adventures in recent memory.  \nAA2 Unlocked!\nAs of 16-May, we've unlocked the Stretch Goal of a second book: Artifacts & Artifice 2.  This will be \"more of the same\" goodness that is in AA1, plus more focus on integration with the mythology of Dark Obelisk and the campaign setting of the Realm of Aquilae.\nBackground & Overview  \nDark Obelisk 1 was planned to be a 64-page softcover urban adventure. After a successful Kickstarter campaign, and months of development, it evolved into a 1,000-page mega adventure with more than 50 NPCs, delivered in the form of two massive hardcover books.  \nDark Obelisk 2 was planned to be a modest continuation of the adventure path. In the course of its KS campaign, it saw a tenfold increase in funding, and more than a dozen Stretch Goals.\nOne of these Stretch Goals was \"Artifacts & Artifice\", initially intended as a 32-64-page softcover, that introduces some rare and exceedingly cool and unique magical items from the Realm of Aquilae, the campaign setting of Dark Obelisk.  \nIt was offered as an add-on for backers of Dark Obelisk 2.  In all honesty, it was created mainly as an excuse to collaborate with another successful and insanely creative indie RPG author.\nThis campaign seeks to make it more awesome, and to offer it to folks who didn't get a chance to get on board with it initially.\nIllustration credit Jack Kaiser\nContext & Project Goals\nThe world of Dark Obelisk is rich and deep, and yet the products published thus far have only scratched the surface of what will be an enormous mythology, spanning countless worlds.  Although products like the Extended Pregenerated Characters and Dark Obelisk 1 have enormous amounts of useful crunch and NPC / monster content, the world of Aquilae has not yet added a great deal of content to your campaign in the way of magical items, weapons, arms and armor.\nArtifacts & Artifice is a book intended to achieve many goals:\nAdd unique, interesting, and useful magical items (weapons, armor, spells, artifacts, wands, rods, rings, potions, and much more) to any RPG campaign.\nServe as a sourcebook of quick and easy-to-insert Quests and NPCs featuring the new items, that can be used in any RPG campaign or adventure.\nBe more than simply a \"list of items and stats\", making it easy for any GM to integrate the items into any campaign.\nIntegration\nThat second goal above, to make it easy for GMs to integrate items into a campaign, is important.  Most GMs have seen PDF after PDF, or book after book, of compendiums or sourcebooks that list out or include magical items.  Though many of these are high quality, most of them amount to \"here's the item, here's what it does\", and maybe if you're lucky there's a sentence or two of description.\nThat's not what Artifacts & Artifice is about.\nEach and every magical item will have a feel, a weight to it, imbued by 2-10 pages of dedicated content that supports more than just the ho-hum stats.  Each item will have the following:\nDescription and crunch effect, cost, etc. with example statblock(s) \nHistory and background \nRumors and lore \nOne or more quad-statted NPCs, who uses the item as part of their gear\nHooks to integrate the item into any campaign or adventure \nAt least one Quest featuring the item, its effects, its history, or the NPC example.\nIntegration With Dark Obelisk\nEvery item will not only be fleshed out and ready to easily insert into any RPG campaign, but will become part of the broader mythology introduced in Dark Obelisk, and the campaign setting of Aquilae.\nFuture books may reference these items, NPCs may wield or recognize them, or they may have a pivotal or minor plot role in a Quest or main storyline.\nIn Summary...\nThis is far, far beyond a simple list of magical items!\nCurrent Contents\nAs of this writing, Artifacts & Artifice will contain the following content.  Each item listed will have ~10 pages of lavishly-detailed content dedicated to it, as well as full-color artwork.  Some items, such as powerful Artifacts, may even end up having mini adventure modules dedicated to them in the book!\nNote that since we have unlocked a SECOND book, the counts below will be spread across the two books.  Which ones go where, and whether one or both books have a theme as such, is dependent upon what we end up with in terms of Stretch Goals and overall counts.\n56 Total Items:\n6x Magic Armor\n3x Amulets\n15x Magic Weapons\n8x Potions\n4x Magic Rings\n4x Magic Rod / Device\n2x Runes\n4x Magic Shields\n4x Wondrous Items\n6x Spells\nStretch Goals\nHuzzah, we're funded!  Time to reach for the stars and make everyone's end result even better.\nIn the list below, \"Standalone Adventures\" are just that: a chapter in the book that is dedicated to a one-off adventure, easily insertable into any campaign setting or context, that involves one or more magic items and/or NPCs from the book's content.  Some of these may be published or available outside of the Artifacts & Artifice book, but some will be exclusive to the book only.  Some of these could merely be slightly-more-elaborate Quests, and others might be 20+ page multiple-gaming-session behemoths.  (Titles subject to finalization.)\n\"+X items\" means the books grow: more items, more artwork, more Quests, more NPCs, more adventure hooks... more content!  Additional Stretch Goals that add items will do so to the \"pool\" of all items (see above), which will be spread across both books.\nAs with other Infinium Game Studio Kickstarters, each time one Stretch Goal falls, another will be announced!\nBacker Count Stretch Goal:\nUNLOCKED!  114th Backer: If (seemingly WHEN!) this project's backer count surpasses my previously-most-successful Kickstarter campaign, I will award a free NPC design and/or magic item design to the backer whose pledge brings us over that threshold.  This is a $75 value, and comes with a full-color illustration assigned to the character or item that that backer helps design.\nFinancial Stretch Goals:\nUNLOCKED!  $1,750: Unlock additional Master Artificer pledge level slot; +4 items.\nUNLOCKED! $2,000: Standalone Adventure: \"Twilight Durance\".\nUNLOCKED! $2,250: Unlock additional Master Artificer pledge level slot; +4 items.\nUNLOCKED!  $2,500: Second Book: A second Artifacts & Artifice tome will be produced, with new pledge levels to take advantage of this opportunity!\nUNLOCKED!  $3,000: AA1 will have at least 25 items.  AA2 will also have at least 25 items.  50 items total if you pledge to get both.  At least 400 pages of richly-detailed arcane content.\nUNLOCKED!  $3,250: +4 items, all of which will be in a single Set of gear with synergy bonuses.  With kick-butt dedicated art.\nUNLOCKED! $3,500: Standalone Adventure: \"Side Jobs and Second Chances\".\nUNLOCKED!  $3,750: +1 Artifact with several associated NPCs and Quests.\nUNLOCKED! $4,000: Standalone Adventure: \"Crucible of Shadow\".\nUNLOCKED! $4,250: Free Map Pack for all non-Lurker pledges!  Every pledge will receive a free Map Pack, containing ultra-hi-resolution images for each and every Quest-related map in BOTH AA books.  These map files are great for DMs who want to print their own battlemaps, or for those wishing to integrate them into a VTT kind of gaming approach.\nUNLOCKED! $4,500: Dedicated chapter for Clothing, including new clothing types such as Badges and Cravats.  Also includes a number of new magical items for whichever book ends up \"getting\" the chapter.\nUNLOCKED! $5,000: Dedicated chapter for Jewelry, including new types such as Torcs, Diadems, and Earrings.  Also includes a number of new magical items for whichever book ends up \"getting\" the chapter.\nUNLOCKED! $5,500: Dedicated chapter for Spells, including new magical items that are related to them.  Includes a number of new magical items for whichever book ends up \"getting\" the chapter.\nUNLOCKED!  $6,000: Dedicated chapter for Cursed Items.  Includes a number of new magical items for whichever book ends up \"getting\" the chapter.\nUNLOCKED!  $6,500: Dedicated chapter for alchemical items and concoctions related to Obelisk materials.\nUNLOCKED!  $7,000: Dedicated chapter for a themed set of items.  Exact theme TBD, but one example is Courtesan's Gear, comprised of items for beguiling, enchanting, illusion, and escape.\nUNLOCKED! $7,500: KS Exclusive Versions: If we hit this goal, both volumes will be delivered in a Kickstarter Exclusive version.  These versions will only be released to Kickstarter backers of this campaign, and will not be available through normal publication afterwards or as part of subsequent KS campaigns.  In addition to an exclusive KS-only cover, these editions will feature an introduction by the authors and a KS-exclusive magical item that will not be available in the published AA1 and AA2 books.\nUNLOCKED! $8,000: Additional Themed Set.  Could be a set of coordinated items crafted by a renowned Healer, for example, complete with Lore, Quests, and detailed NPC breakdowns for the legendary alchemist in question...\nUNLOCKED! $8,500: Additional Themed Set.  Fortune-Teller's Tricks?  Farm-Hand's Prize?  The trough of ideas runs deep...\nUNLOCKED! $9,000: Additional Themed Set, with dedicated chapter.  Blacksmith's Forgeworks?  Mise en Place of Manna: Food-Crafting Tools of the Eateries of the Gods?  \nUNLOCKED! $9,500: Additional Themed Set.  Spells and tools from the Direcaster's Journal.\nUNLOCKED! $10,000: Additional Themed Set, with dedicated chapter: Enchantments from the Brothel Regalia.\n$10,500: Crowdsourced Artifact.  Backers get to vote on the direction of a powerful magical artifact during development!\nAdd-Ons\nAdd-ons will be available in BackerKit shortly following the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign.\nIf you are interested in any Add-Ons, the best thing to do is to increase your pledge amount accordingly; that way, the total gets considered against Stretch Goal milestones.\n$5: Multiformat PDF: Most pledge levels include the book in your choice of rules system formats: Pathfinder or 5E.  This add-on grants you the PDF in the other rules system format.\n~$25: Upgrade to Premium Color: This release will feature full-color artwork.  Although the standard print used by RPGnow is perfectly fine, some backers may wish to upgrade to premium color for even crisper colors.  Perhaps obviously, this Add-On only applies to pledge levels that already include a hardcover.\n$75: Item Design: Help design an item (weapon, armor, rod, staff, spell, etc.) in the collection.  Includes a full-color artwork dedicated to the item you help design.  Note that this capability is included in some of the elite pledge levels; this add-on can be used to add another custom item if you wish.\n$75: NPC Design: Help design an NPC in the collection who is associated with an item, and/or a Quest related to the stories herein. Includes a full-color artwork dedicated to the NPC you help design and/or name.  Note that this capability is included in some of the elite pledge levels; this add-on can be used to add another custom item if you wish.\nThis Campaign\nThis Kickstarter campaign is an opportunity to enhance the content of Artifacts & Artifice, making it more useful and interesting.  \nInstead of a 32-64 page softcover, the resulting sourcebook will be a 150+ page, full-color hardcover, with dedicated full-color artwork for each item.  \nThe Product  \nIt's a magical-items sourcebook that describes several dozen magical items intended for a broad range of character levels. \nIt's intended as a companion to the Dark Obelisk Adventure Path.  But it easily, and seamlessly, integrates with any roleplaying campaign.\nAll Infinium Game Studio products feature the following:\nGM- and Player-Friendly Formats: Every single map comes in a GM version with full annotation, and a \"redacted\" Players version that hides secrets and references and is just more of a battlemap. In addition, each version of each map is included as a separate, ultra-high-resolution image file, for use with DTT/VTT gaming tools or just to print out at larger size. \nPrint, Mobile, and Print Friendly: Every PDF comes in a print-friendly version with a full-color parchment watermark background, and a smaller-filesize mobile-friendly version with a white background. Check out some examples below.\n  Who Gets What  \nSome DO2 project backers will already automatically receive the results based on their existing pledge commitments. \nBecause they're all awesome, and believed in me early on. In other words, those backers currently set to receive the Artifacts & Artifice PDF and/or softcover will instead receive the expanded Artifacts & Artifice PDF and/or hardcover book at no extra cost. (Conversely, if you've backed a project of mine, but for whatever reason don't qualify for a copy of AA, then you won't automatically get a copy of the expanded book.

Just PM me and I'll be happy to look it up.)\nFulfillment Timing & Hardcopy Shipping  \nShipping for hardcopy and PDF fulfillment will take place immediately upon completion and publication of the finished book.\nIGS products are typically developed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules system.  Following completion, the content is converted to the 5E system; this usually takes a few weeks to a month depending on the size and nature of the conversion required.  It's anticipated that with this project, we may be in a position to develop content for both rules systems simultaneously; that's the ideal because then 5E backers won't have to wait to get their results. \nAll product fulfillment will take place via DriveThruRPG / RPGnow; if you're backing and don't already have an account, I recommend creating one. It's free.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNone, really. Man, I hope that doesn't jinx anything. I guess more accurately, time.

There it discovers a wondrous land of adventure and opportunity: \nFrom the exploration of the nexus, the party saw hints and rumors of lost treasures. \nNegotiation with the Formene Elves will be a challenge. They are skilled orators, and most of them have been practicing negotiation longer than the party has been alive. \nThe dangers of the Formene are many, powerful, and unforgiving. \nThe riches are nearly beyond imagination. For example, the Formene is the only source of mithril weapons and armor. \nSomewhere in the Talos libraries lie the secrets to why Hastur wants the elves for his master plan. \nThe Duchy of Meawold would relish the opportunity to restore trade, or perhaps even reopen the nexus. \nThe first heroes to enter Talos will be known throughout the lands and become the stuff of legend. \nThe Formene Elves welcome an opportunity to sample the delights they know only through legends, cuts of beef, lamb, pork and chicken, not tasted for nearly two millennia. \nPotential Cover for The City of Talos\n  Who is Dark Naga Adventures? Why should you trust me? \nI am Kevin Watson, and Dark Naga Adventures is my company. It exists to create and publish adventures that are a combination of the classic sandbox adventures of the early days of the hobby combined with modern features. I have probably written 30 adventures and designed about a dozen fantasy worlds in my life as a Game Master. \nThis project is the third adventure for commercial release and my third Kickstarter Project. Several others are planned, including two more sequels to complete the Haunting of Hastur series. As a young company, I am motivated to produce quality products and intend to leverage the experience gained from several Kickstarter campaigns to mitigate potential complications in production.\nPrevious Kickstarter Projects from Dark Naga:\nThe Lost Temple of Forgotten Evil\nThe Buried Zikurat\nAs a one person shop, the buck stops with me. Art, cartography, and editing are all being done by top notch freelancers. Expect regular updates and as much transparency as we all can handle. \nFreelance Artists\nRick Hershey, Cover Art\nJustin Andrew Mason, Cartography\nBrandice Bos, Interior Art\nAdam Schmidt, Interior Art\nZ.

Only the shipping cost will be invoiced. Transparency is important to me. We have opted to charge separately for shipping as part of our effort to provide individual backers with the best value. Every package WILL have the final postage fee printed on the label for verification. A tracking number will be provided when the reward ships. Estimated shipping costs are exactly that--estimates. The final weight of the product is undetermined, but most rewards are expected to weigh less than 1 lb. \nUsing this method, you pay for actual shipping costs only. I pay for materials and labor. If I included shipping in the project, I would have to estimate shipping for each country, and cannot factor in shipping to Chicago is cheaper than shipping to LA from where I live. Additionally, I would need to pad that shipping to account for project fees. By moving the shipping to a separate transaction, I lower my costs, not eliminate them, can offer more shipping options, and the project funding reflects the goods, not the goods plus shipping. \nInternational: International orders will be invoiced at actual postage cost as well. International postage requires customs forms. We are required by law to disclose the pledge amount on these forms. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate. \nOn the previous projects, the domestic shipping averaged about $5.50, and the International Shipping averaged about $18. I am going to collect shipping via Backerkit when I am ready to ship and will invoice for the actual shipping costs. Parcels will be sent once the shipping invoice is settled. BackerKit makes fulfillment more organized and consistent. \n$4000 - Funded! \nThe project is a go. \n$5000 - Custom Talos Dice, d6  \nFor The City of Talos, I made a new custom d6. This one will have a color/ink combination that represents the Formene Elves and Talos. The logo will be updated to include the website. Due to this change, the d10 is discontinued.  \nThe original color/ink combination dice, Blue Scarab Blood with Gold Ink or the Hastur dice, are available as an add-on.  \nAll backers at the Physical Naga level, or higher, will now receive two custom Talos d6 with the naga head logo on the '6' side. Additional dice can be added to the pledge for $2 per die, as listed in the Add-ons section.\n$6000 - More Art\nWe'll add another page of art. One full page or 2 half pages or 4 quarter pages, probably a full page. \n$7000 - OSR and Pathfinder Digital Editions of The City of Talos\nAn OSR and Pathfinder version will be made in PDF.\n$8000 - More Talos Dice\n All backers at the Physical Naga level, or higher, will receive a total of three custom d6 with the naga head logo on the '6' side in addtion to any added on. \n$9000 - More Art \nWe'll add another page of art. One full page or 2 half pages or 4 quarter pages, probably some mixture. \n$10000 - OSR and Pathfinder Old School Print of The City of Talos\nAs a $30 per copy add-on, you can add an OSR print, a Pathfinder print, or both--same as the 5e version, detached cover, color maps on the interior of the cover. This version is only available via Kickstarter. \nHastur Dice\nTalos Die\n Other goals will be detailed later, including more art, additional adventures in and near Talos, etc. \nFrequently Asked Questions  \nI am here to answer your questions. There are no dumb questions. If you don't know and can't find the answer, please ask. I'll respond as fast as my sleep and meeting cycles allow. Always within a day. \nQ: Why should I buy the PDF as part of the Kickstarter when they are a little cheaper on DriveThruRPG/RPG Now?  \nA: What is sold on the OneBookShelf (DriveThru and RPGNow are storefronts for OBS), are the individual versions for 5e, OSR, and PathFinder. And they are $1.5 cheaper there.  \n The add-on or the PDF rewards through this project include all versions. So are a greater value, assuming you have an interest the PDF versions for 5e, OSR, and PathFinder. One might be a better choice for you than the other. Pick the one that works for you. Dark Naga Adventures strives for flexibility in the adventures and in their delivery.\nQ: You say 13 adventures in one part of the video and 12 in another. What gives? \nA: The adventure book has 13 adventures. One of them is a quest aimed at those who are new to the Haunting of Hastur series and want to jump right it. This quest replaces the party playing through DNH2 \u2013 The Buried Zikurat. However, the GM is welcome to use this little adventure in any way they can imagine. \nQ: Can I add a copy of the first two adventures, The Lost Temple of Forgotten Evil and/or The Buried Zikurat, print or pdf? \nA: Yes, you can. Please see the Add-on\u2019s section \nQ: Will there be an OSR Edition, a Pathfinder Edition, and what about insert system here Edition? \nA: I am committed to an OSR Edition in PDF and Print on Demand. A detached cover print will be a stretch goal. I am on the fence about a Pathfinder edition in PDF/PoD; that will be a stretch goal. I am open to an edition compatible with other systems if there is enough of a customer base to justify the work. Options would extend to language editions beyond English. I am looking for feedback on what people want to see regarding systems and languages. These editions might miss the current estimate for delivery. If that happens, I will communicate a list of milestones and estimated dates so that everyone feels they know what is going on and how close we are to reaching those milestones.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have a full-time job, and this is my other business. My work commitments are largely confined to 8 am to 5 pm, leaving nights and weekends to manage Dark Naga. I take projects seriously and respect my backers. Any delay will be disclosed in a status update with a revised estimate for all remaining steps.\n\nThis is my third Kickstarter. To mitigate typical risks, I am continuing the practice of starting this campaign with the adventure fully written. With the adventure fully written, and in a final round of playtesting at launch, most of the risks associated with me as a single point of failure are mitigated, specifically, the risk that I could fail to get the adventure written in the published time frame.\n\nI have advanced the funds for the cover, maps, and most of the interior art (except for the stretch goals). I have some of the art in hand and will be showing some of the art and the maps off as we progress through the campaign. The cartography is done. As stretch goals are unlocked, I will get them underway and update the master schedule. My goals are to control the risks, minimize the delays, and deliver ahead of schedule.\n\nTo provide an additional layer of confidence, I will provide backers a project status update weekly until fulfillment is completed. Additionally, I pledge not to work on the next project until fulfillment exceeds 90% Proof of Delivery. I want to earn your trust and plan to do so by delivering a quality product with solid communication and a high level of open dialog.\n\nI am glad you are taking a look at the project and hope you become one of my backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Support Naga", "descp": "Support Naga\nYou want to keep an eye on things, and you want to be in the loop.

Additionally, a small army of volunteers stand ready to make this convention a success. We will be vigilant, and we will adapt, and we will endeavor to keep our backers and registered attendees informed of any complications that may affect their convention experience. We are building several new relationships with vendors and manufacturers, and we will similarly be vigilant should those relationships prove unsuccessful and require us to change our plans mid-stream.

It's being released as a series of story arcs providing players with thrilling narratives and opportunities to have a deep impact on the world.\nThe first installment, Crashing Chaos, was launched last year, as a very successful Kickstarter project. \nCrashing Chaos Story Arc - Campaign Guide, Player's Guide & 8 Adventures\nNow, we're back, with the second installment of the campaign - Darkness Surges. \nUnder orders from their liege-lord, the King of the Windsome Chain, players must make the treacherous journey west. They will travel through lands thrown into turmoil, to the great dwarven capital of Hammermuir. \nThey are to negotiate a treaty with the dwarves to safeguard both kingdoms from the army of brutal savages which has invaded from across the sea.\nIt won't be easy - war is raging in the land that they must traverse - and all is not what it seems. Ancient secrets will be exposed, hidden powers revealed, and new mysteries unveiled.\nThe always busy Hammermuir Bazaar. War has increased prices and tensions.\nLike Crashing Chaos, this story arc features high quality writing, original art, complex NPCs, and themes for mature gamers to really sink their teeth into. There's combat aplenty, but players are expected to have more than just a hammer in their bag of tricks. Negotiating, creative problem solving, and sometimes just living to fight another day - all are going to be needed to survive the challenges of Darkness Surges.\nAt the end of Crashing Chaos, characters should have achieved level 6. Darkness Surges will see them through the start of level 8.\n$20 - Darkness Surges PDF\nDownloadable PDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\n$35 - PDF Catch Up \nDownloadable PDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\nDownloadable PDF copy of the 182 page Crashing Chaos Complete Edition.\n$40 - Darkness Surges Soft Cover Book + PDF\nPrinted full-color softcover of Darkness Surges. \nDownloadable PDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\n$60 - Printed Catch Up \nPrinted full-color softcover of Darkness Surges. \nPrinted full-color softcover of the 182 page Crashing Chaos Complete Edition. \nDownloadable PDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\nDownloadable PDF copy of the 182 page Crashing Chaos Complete Edition.\n$80 - Printed Party Adventure Pack\nPrinted full-color softcover of Darkness Surges. \n4 printed full-color softcover copies of the Asatania Player's Guide.

We use DriveThruRPG/RPGNow book printing and fulfillment service and printed books will ship from their distributors located around the world.   \n  We love stretch goals - they are a great way for us to give added value to backers. In our first Kickstarter project for Crashing Chaos, backers picked up an additional 3 adventures, a player's guide, and more artwork at no additional cost.  \nStretch goals for Darkness Surges will unlock one at a time. Each time we pass a stretch goal, we'll unlock another one. Backers at all levels receive all stretch goals.\n$2,000 - Artwork Completion - REACHED\nDarkness Surges has been funded out of my own pocket, which means I've had to be clever about art. I've commissioned mostly concept art sketches and partially completed pieces to show our vision for the adventures and the Asatania campaign world. At $2000, we can commission artists to complete two of the partially done works.\nBackers will vote on their favorite pieces and we'll commission the top 2.\n\"Argenta's Discovery\" - One of many pieces we'd love to finish, with your help.\n$3,500 - Additional Artwork - REACHED\nLet's continue to bring Asatania and Darkness Surges to life! I will commission an additional piece of artwork from one of the artists that's been working on the project. \n$5,000 - Expansion of the Old #7 Mine - REACHED\nThe Old #7 Mine, located outside the town of Ostholme, has more than its share of problems. The war is close by and traders have stopped bringing in much needed supplies. Refugees are coming in though, in droves, and that's putting more pressure on the already limited resources.\n\nA recent discovery at the mine was going to fix all the town's problems, but now, demons are pouring out of the old mine and the few miners that have escaped are telling horrific tales of what's hiding down in the depths. Our adventurers must find out where the demons are coming from and cleanse the mine. \n\nI originally designed the mine to be a short mini-adventure about halfway through the Darkness Surges arc, but, I realized that it could be expanded to be much more than that. If we hit the $5,000 stretch goal, it will be. I'll be able to hire a talented writer to work with me on expanding the area and the depth of its story. \n\nPlayers will need their wits about them to overcome the demonic presence lurking at the bottom of the Old #7.\n$7,500 - Description Unlocks at $5,000 level\n$10000 - Description Unlocks at $7,500 level\n  Darkness Surges is about more than just great storytelling and writing. It is also about great art, great maps, great layout, great editing, and great attention to detail.\nTo launch this project, I commissioned five remarkable fantasy artists: Harito Costas, Tiziana Ruiu, Tenda Spencer, Samuel Amar, and Lada Shustova. Some of them are well known names in the fantasy space, and some of them are just getting their start in the industry.\nDesign sketches from Samuel Amar that we'd love to turn into a complete piece.\nI want them to be able to finish the numerous sketches and partially complete artworks that they've created. I want to commission additional pieces and maps for the book. I want each person working on it to be able to give it their full attention. For all of us, this is a labor of love - but even love can be expensive.\nWe're story tellers and world builders. We believe that the best role playing games are immersive. Worlds should feel vibrant, alive, and real. They should be fantastic, and magical, and unique, but the actors that players will meet and the situations that they encounter should never feel random.  \nWe never want players to feel like the game master is just rolling dice on tables of encounters (even if he is). Every encounter and situation should feel organically like a part of a living world. The more the game master understands about the nature of the world, the more effective he or she will be at guiding the game. \nWe aspire to create layers in our games that will appeal to different types of players. Hack and slash types can go a long way just hacking and slashing their way through conflict. But, we also want to provide clues to the \"whys\" and \"hows\" of events. \nInsightful and curious players will discover backstory and motivational elements which may not be completely obvious. Those insights may help them more cleanly navigate the challenges in front of them.\nFundamentally, our worlds and adventures are about pitting a group of players against their environment. We love nothing more than seeing a random group of players set aside their differences and forge an alliance toward a common goal.  \nIf you share our vision of immersive game play in living fantasy worlds, then please show your passion for table-top roleplaying games by supporting this Kickstarter campaign.  \nHappy Adventuring!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter project comes with risks. We've tried to reduce those as much as possible by developing as much content as possible prior to launching the project.\n\nPlotting is done, playtesting is done, and we've even paid artists and cartographers to get started now rather than waiting for the Kickstarter to complete.\n\nThis is our second Kickstarter project - both set in Asatania - and we've got a veteran group who have been working on it since the beginning.\n\nBut, even with all that, sometimes things go wrong or get delayed. I promise that I'll never allow schedule to pressure us to release an inferior product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Darkness Surges PDF", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "PDF Catch Up", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\nPDF copy of the 182-page Crashing Chaos Complete Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["32 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Darkness Surges Softcover + PDF", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nPrinted full-color softcover of Darkness Surges.\nPDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Printed Catch Up", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nPrinted full-color softcover of Darkness Surges.\nPrinted full-color softcover of Crashing Chaos Complete Edition\nPDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\nPDF copy of the 182-page Crashing Chaos Complete Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["30 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Printed Party Adventure Pack", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nPrinted full-color softcover of Darkness Surges.\nPDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\n4\u00d7 Printed full-color softcover of the Asatania Player's Guide", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Printed Pack Catch Up", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nPrinted full-color softcover of Darkness Surges.\nPrinted full-color softcover of Crashing Chaos Complete Edition\nPDF copy of the 182-page Crashing Chaos Complete Edition\nPDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\n4\u00d7 Printed full-color softcover of the Asatania Player's Guide", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "A Quick Update", "update_content": "If you have filled in your BackerKit survey information, you should have already received your Darkness Surges PDF links.

DiPesa, Erik Frankhouse, Ben McFarland, Jaye Sonia, and Brian Suskind, Bloodlines & Black Magic is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible supernatural campaign setting that takes place in our modern world. Bloodlines & Black Magic pits rich political elites, desperate cultists, supernatural horrors, celestial powers, secret magical orders, G\u00f6etic spirits, and ancient bloodlines in a deadly war against one another over a reality that nearly all of humanity can neither see nor comprehend.\nBloodlines & Black Magic is Pathfinder compatible!\nHidden from the mundane world, only a rare few individuals ever gain a glimpse of this dimension of supernatural horrors, this realm of human tragedy and desperation, learning secrets that - if spoken in public - would mark them as broken. Aligned with secret organizations or working as individual agents, Bloodlines & Black Magic gives these modern heroes a dark universe to explore, a canvas that is even dimmer, painted in a darker, decayed grey than the colors already coating it.\nEnter a world where seven distinct magical bloodlines - each with its own ties to the supernatural world, positioning themselves in places of power, working from behind the scenes to shape the world in their image. These bloodlines dominate certain hereditary lines, but might otherwise manifest in secret within any area, or any unaware individual. Although these bloodlines only make up a very small part of the global population, they dominate nearly 72% of the globe, secretly running everything from global trade routes to entire countries.\nAn infernal blooded cultist prepares for a ritual...\nThese bloodlines maneuver the shadows of the secret parts of the world:\nFey blooded Delicate and lively, individuals who carry the blood of the fey display strange insights; some even claim to suffer from otherworldly visions of both the future and past. Prominent throughout the Old World, fey blooded individuals often display interests in nature, environmentalism, and history - especially history related to Ireland, Scotland, Gaul, and even some of the Nordic lands.\nInfernal Blooded Cunning and strong, individuals with ties to this bloodline rarely discover the power of their blood until late into their teens, although some don\u2019t manifest their abilities until their mid-twenties. Naturally intelligent, these individuals combine their wit with their strength, outwitting or strong-arming others into following their directions, regardless of their will.\nDragon Blooded Born cold, calculating, and prone to dreams of conquest others can barely comprehend, the dragon blooded are a supremely confident line. Some whisper their heritage is as old as the serpent that encircles the cosmic egg, and although many chuckle at the idea of sleeping dragons, these individuals know all too well their blood is as cold as it is ancient.\nJinn Blooded As passionate and dedicated as any modern dervish, jinn blooded humans have ties that predate the modern Middle East. Their heritage rises from the Assyrian, Sumerian, and Babylonian conquerors who, under a bright, burning sun, worked ancient magic in the earliest dawn of man. Wise and tenacious, these individuals display a resilience rarely found in the modern world.\nSeraphic Blooded Nearly as famous as their infernal siblings, seraphic blooded humans are wise and comely. Many of these seraphic blooded descendants display a natural charisma that reveals their angelic roots, attracting others who simply want to bask in the presence. Attractive to a fault, these individuals display their bloodline in a number of physical ways: bright eyes, angular features, and silky hair that range from the dark of a raven\u2019s feathers to the golden hues of the Valkyries themselves.\nShadow Blooded Of all the bloodlines, those who carry shadow-touched blood are perhaps the strangest. These rare individuals openly display a love of the dark, and many take great pains to avoid the daylight; some of these shadow-blooded suffer from minor medical conditions that discourage daytime activities.\nSpirit Blooded Attuned to a world visited almost exclusively by dreamers, spirit blooded humans have a heritage older than that of any other bloodline. Many claim that their very bodies are the world\u2019s ancient spirits made flesh, while others believe they are the children of the dreaming realms, readily pointing to the Astral Plane as their original home.\nA spirit blooded investigator calls on a favor...\nBloodlines & Black Magic draws liberally from the lore of our day-to-day world, weaving historical facts, modern myths, urban legends, and popular conspiracies into a supernatural world that could be our own \u2013 but only if we had the eyes and patience to pierce the neon-stained billboards which so carefully hides it from our view. Steeped in esoteric lore, popular culture, current events, and empowered by a connected, global community, Bloodlines & Black Magic pushes the boundaries of what we think we know, crashing through the mirror and diving into the deeper parts of the human abyss...\n            A modification of the unofficial Pathfinder E6 system championed by the eccentric and odd minds of Clinton Boomer and Jaye Sonia (with a lot of help from their friends), Occult 7 (or O7 for short) is a new adaptation of that system that combines elements from Occult Adventures, the Advanced Class Guide, Pathfinder Unchained, and dD20 Modern (with a proper nod to White Wolf's original World of Darkness and the games it inspired), combining everything into a simple, streamlined system that eases play and focuses on that gritty, dark modern feel.\nUsing O7 as its base, Bloodlines & Black Magic introduces Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (and 3.5) fans to a darker world heavily influenced by some of the genre's best fiction and media. Mechanically, it gives players a whole new set of tools to play with, including new and updated skills for the modern world, unique character abilities, seven updated character classes (based on classes from Occult Adventures and The Advanced Class Guide), new feats and traits, an expanded library of modern magical items, and a host of new NPCs and locations for GMs to adapt to the world they already know. \nA boy and his dog? Or a Jinn-bound street magician and its familiar?\nBloodlines & Black Magic also introduces players and GMs to several new mechanics, including:\n\n\u2022 Encounter Arcana: Each character begins play with a single trait aligned to an Arcana (a concept). Every encounter in Bloodlines & Black Magic is ruled by an Arcana of its own. When a player's character aligns with that Arcana, they gain a significant boost during that encounter. Bloodlines & Black Magic will introduce 40 Arcana for players and GMs to pick from.\n\n\u2022 Breaking Point: Bloodlines & Black Magic uses a new, unique tracking system to track mental fatigue and stress caused from exposure to the supernatural\u2026 and to unlock new, hidden inner abilities!\n\n\u2022 Bloodlines: Instead of using static racial builds, Bloodlines & Black Magic uses a fully modular point-buy system, allowing players to build individual characters who - even when they share the same lineage - are entirely unique.\n\n\nWhile Bloodlines & Black Magic will be familiar to fans of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, it changes the way adventures are played, and how each play session is executed.\n\nThese differences can be summarized below:\n\u2022 Whispers & Rumors: Bloodlines & Black Magic will introduce a season full of shorter companion PDFs (each between 7 and 11 pages in length), each of which includes new NPCs, new monsters, new locations, new secrets, and new encounters. These will launch in October of 2017 and will last a full year. Each new season will begin the following October (more info below).\n\u2022 O7 Episodes: Each season of Bloodlines & Black Magic will introduce a full season of short, 4-5 hour long adventures designed to feel like episodes of your favorite supernatural or horror television show. Designed to complement Whispers & Rumors, each of these episodes will slowly peel back the veil, giving both players and GMs a better look at the world beyond.\n\u2022 Player Impact! If we do well enough on this Kickstarter, we may implementing a player feedback/support metric, which allows individual groups to slowly change the way the world unfolds between each season!\nAn occultist works his dark magic...\nBloodlines & Black Magic is not for the faint of heart: encounters in Bloodlines & Black Magic are designed to be challenging, making situations that do turn violent that much more deadly - but also making each victory so much sweeter. Your enemies may look familiar, but they\u2019ve been drastically altered, shaped to fit the myths of this new world\u2026 a world that is eerily similar to the one you know right now!\n                                       Whispers & Rumors will be a new, unique way in which participants in the world can influence it (and later on, even shape it)! Designed as a cooperative online/offline play experience, each issue will include the designers\u2019 notes and insights, and will include new monsters, NPCs, locations, gear, haunts, spells, and more! Every other month, one of the designers will dispatch a new O7 Episode (a mini-adventure with 7-11 pages of content), tailored to suit the current Season. Every other month, designers will send out clues, stories, codes, cyphers, and other material intended to help players unlock the first year's major villain. Players can champion one of the seven bloodlines, or if it suits them, align to a particular organization or even specific kingdoms!\nThis is a production mock up of the new book!\nBloodlines & Black Magic is nearing completion. Although we're not completely finished with the manuscript for Bloodlines & Black Magic, we've written nearly 70% of the main book and expect to be going into layout by the end of this summer. We're running this Kickstarter to help add more art to the book, as well as to potentially add more content to it. If we hit some of our stretch goals, we'd like to move it from a B&W project to a full color, comic-style hardcover - with more great art from some of the industry's best names. If you've followed our other projects, you already know Storm Bunny Studios prides itself on its production quality - this project will be no different.\n  Matt Banach has been a freelance writer and game designer ever since he entered the fray by making the Top 16 in Paizo's RPG Superstar 2009, realizing the possibilities of contributing to the gaming hobbies he'd enjoyed all his life. Working extensively with Rite Publishing for most of the last eight years, Matt has authored several serial RPG projects which have become big beautiful compilations, including the high-octane Faces of the Tarnished Souk: An NPC Collection for Rite Publishing's Coliseum Morpheuon, and the Gossamer Worlds Compendium \u2013 a series of alternate realities for use in the mind-bending multiverse of Lords of Gossamer & Shadow (Diceless). Matt especially loves writing prose and fiction; he authored his first full-length novel, Lost in Dream, for Rite Publishing, and is hoping he can do something similar for Bloodlines & Black Magic. Over the years Matt has also contributed to Darkness Without Form: Secrets of the Mimic, Kobold Ecologies, Adventure Quarterly, multiple short works of fiction, and some soon-to-be-released stuff for Rogue Genius Games. Matt's wide-ranging roleplaying experience and inspirations include D&D's Planescape, White Wolf's World of Darkness and Mind's Eye Theater, Unknown Armies, d20 Modern, and Pathfinder. Matt is extremely interested in the O7 system and the Bloodlines & Black Magic setting because they will combine deliciously dark noir, gritty street-level action, and both post-modern and traditional supernatural horror. This is Matt's chance to join old friends and new to help design the game he has always wanted to play.\nClinton J. Boomer is a playwright, screenwriter, short-story author, novelist and ENnie-award-winning game-designer who began writing professionally after placing in the Top 4 of Paizo Publishing\u2019s inaugural RPG Superstar competition in 2008. He has worked on a great number of books in the last near-decade, beginning with the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting and including his novel, The Hole Behind Midnight: a darkly comic, postmodern urban-fantasy crime / mystery-noir / pulp-action tale-of-suspense-and-cursing. More recently, Boomer served as an author for the Horror Adventures & Ultimate Intrigue books from Paizo Publishing; he is the creator of Splintered Godhood from Legendary Games and the Coliseum Morpheuon setting from Rite Publishing. He has also written essays for Kobold Press and created material for both the Rhune: Dawn of Twilight setting from Storm Bunny Studios and the NeoExodus setting from Louis Porter Jr. Design. Boomer spent two-&-a-half years Storytelling & Narrating a 30-50 person Vampire: the Masquerade LARP (part of the 50-chronicle One World by Night organization); his other urban fantasy work includes Hellcrashers and his work at ThatBoomerKid.Tumblr.

DiPesa has been working on RPGs and game-related fiction for close to 20 years, now, having written (and periodically developed and play tested) for such lines as Mage: The Ascension, Mage: The Awakening, Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, Changeling: The Lost, Hunter: The Vigil, Mummy: The Curse, Dark Ages, Aberrant, Curse the Darkness, as well as several others that he\u2019s not allowed to talk about, just yet. He\u2019s excited to be working on Bloodlines and Black Magic \u2013 in no small part because it lets him finally get back to doing something with that collection of books on the occult, world religions, mythology, history, and conspiracy theories that\u2019s otherwise been gathering dust on his shelves for a while \u2013 and looking forward to exploring a new vision of a world touched by ancient secrets and eldritch forces.\nErik Frankhouse has been a freelance game designer since 2003.

I failed miserably, so I formed an alliance with my artist friend Aage and turned my efforts to what I do know - designing and programming applications.\nWe've been slowly developing the application in our free time for years, but now that Dungeon Builder is nearing its completion, we hope that you will help us find the funds needed to take time off from our day jobs, in order to finally finish our map maker.\nDungeon Builder lets anyone, regardless of their art skills, make beautiful, isometric, high resolution maps that look hand drawn.\nAdditionally, if you want to add your own drawings to your maps, all you have to do is drop your drawing and a file with a bit of extra information into Dungeon Builder's Custom folder and you're good to go.\n See it in Action\nIf you're curious, we really recommend downloading our demo and giving it a try. Even though all the features are not in yet, we think you'll be able to see just how amazing Dungeon Builder could be with just a few months of further work.\nIf you don't feel like downloading the demo, you can check out the the video below for a demonstration of Dungeon Builder.\n Project Goal\nIf you back this project, your pledge will go towards doubling the number of art assets available in Dungeon Builder (compared to the demo), as well as completing the all basic functionality in the application.\nIn terms of functionality, that covers:\nSaving and loading maps\nExporting maps as images\nText placement and editing for notes and descriptions on your maps\nChanging map size and orientation\nChanging map background textures\nAdditional selection modes for better editing\nDragging map items to re-position them\nAs for doubling the amount of art available in Dungeon Builder, here's what we intend to add:\nCaves\nCage walls & doors\nBeds and other furniture \nMore building features\nLoads of smaller items to make your dungeons look inhabited and unique\nA look at what's available in Dungeon Builder's demo\n Please note: The floor symbol below the tables in the image above is a reference to the brilliant game series The Longest Journey. To avoid any potential copyright issues, this symbol will be replaced by another similar asset as soon as possible.\n Stretch Goals\nOur vision goes far beyond the initial funding goal. We want to add much more art, make the editor even better, and add a Play mode to Dungeon Builder as well.\nTo make all that possible, we have a lot of stretch goals. For each goal met, your map maker will become even better.\nWe want you to be able to build many different looking dungeons, so when we reach our first stretch goal, we'll add an additional wall type, an additional floor type, and three new door types.\nOur current walls are cool, but wouldn't it be great if you could stack walls to create multi storey buildings? If we reach this goal, we'll add at least two wall types that can be stacked.\nWe'd love to have really cool options for water on our maps, so if we reach this goal, we'll find a way to add \"watercolour\" rivers and streams to Dungeon Builder's palette. The watercolour effect will be reminiscent of the coloured portals available in the demo.\nMaybe we're biased from playing too much Baldur's Gate, but we think it would be awesome to be able to add train tracks, mine carts and large rock faces to Dungeon Builder's art collection.\nWhen we reach this goal, we're going to have a lot of art in Dungeon Builder, so it makes a lot of sense to start adding features that make it easier to find exactly what you want. Adding a way to specify precisely what colour map you want is also a priority, along with adding more background textures.\nThere are certain dangers in placing all our art in its original form right there in the application folder, for everyone to view and edit. However, if we reach this goal, we'll do just that. In order to give anyone who wants to add their own art to Dungeon Builder as good a foundation as possible, we'll include all the art made for this campaign as \"mods\" instead of \"baking\" it into the application.\nDungeons are cool, but dungeons with neat entrances are even better. At this level, we'll add trees, grass, and building roofs to the art collection. \nHaving a map centrepiece, where the big boss or the amazing treasure is, sounds pretty good. So at this level, we'll add three huge \"watercolour\" set pieces, including a waterfall for use with our rivers and streams.\nWhat if we could play our games right there in the application? That would be amazing! At this level we'll add a feature to reveal areas as your players explore them. We'll also add ten adventurer tokens and ten monster tokens to the art collection, add a dice rolling function, and allow the game master to hide certain map notes while printing or playing.\nIf we make it to this level, we'll implement some kind of \"fog of war\" feature, so only revealed tiles within your adventurer tokens' range of view is visible during Play mode. We'll also add 20 more monster tokens and make token movement more fluent by adding a sliding animation.\nAt this level, the simple adventurer and monster tokens are replaced by actual drawings. Do you prefer tokens? We'll find a way to add a configurable token that can be used with your own images. Finally, we'll add multi screen support, so players see a completely different screen than the DM. This will effectively allow the DM to change the map mid-game.\nFor those groups that can't meet in person to play, we really want to add a network multiplayer mode, enabling all the unlocked Play Mode features to be used over the internet.\nYou spoke and we listened: if we reach 750.000 DKK, we'll add a feature to export your maps to a Top Down View, allowing you to print battle ready top down maps for use with miniatures or tokens. Please note that this stretch goal was added after delivery was estimated, so to ensure that we do not delay the entire project if we reach this goal, work on the top down view will not start until we have delivered everything else from the Kickstarter campaign. If unlocked, the Top Down View feature will be added gradually during the two to three months after the release of version 1.0.\nProject Rewards\nCredit\nWe like to give credit where it's due, so if you help us in any way, we'd like to include you in our application credits. If you're the Batman of Kickstarter and would prefer to remain anonymous, you can opt to have an alias listed instead of your full name (or to not be listed at all).\nDungeon Builder\nAll pledge levels apart from \"A helping hand\" include Dungeon Builder, available from our website in May 2017. Dungeon Builder will include everything described in the Project Goal section above, and for every stretch goal we reach, Dungeon Builder will be improved for everyone.\nBeta Access\nCan't wait to start building Dungeons? All pledges from the Beta Builder level and up includes Beta Access. Backers at these levels will get a login to a special page on our website where they'll be able to download the latest Dungeon Builder releases throughout the development process. \nTechnically speaking, the beta phase starts when an application is feature complete, so by that definition you'll also get Alpha Access.\nThe first build available after the demo is planned to release two weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\nSpecify a Map Item\nIf you have a great idea for an art asset, and want to make sure it makes it into Dungeon Builder, the Dungeon Carpenter, Stonemason, Planner, Engineer and Architect levels are for you. At these levels you get to specify a map decoration, piece of furniture, building piece or similar. Items made in this way adds to everyone's art collection, so we'll give you credit in the item's tool tip and in the status bar when the item is selected.\nTool tip and status bar credits for backer items\n  The size of the item depends on the pledge level. To give you an idea of the item sizes, we've made a little illustration.\nAn illustration of the different sizes of map items\nCarpenter (Small): 1 tile\nStonemason (Medium): 2x2 tiles or similar\nEngineer (Large): 3x3 tiles or similar\nPlanner (Huge): 4x4 tiles or similar\nArchitect (Gigantic): 5x5 tiles or similar\nSpecify a Creature\nHeroes, villains and monsters are similar to ordinary map items, but require a lot more work and attention to detail. Therefore, the pledge amount to size ratio is a bit higher for these types of drawings. As with Map Items, the size of the item depends on the pledge level.\nGuard (Small): 1 tile\nCommander (Medium): 2x2 tiles or similar\nLady/Lord (Large): 3x3 tiles or similar\nIndie and Pro Licences\nIndie and Pro versions of Dungeon Builder are identical in to Personal versions in terms of functionality and art. But with these versions, you are allowed to use maps exported from Dungeon Builder in published (print/e-book) material, royalty and attribution free.\nMultiple Rewards\nIf you would like multiple Dungeon Builder licenses, just add the amount listed at the reward level to your pledge amount, and we'll make sure you get your extra copies on release.\nTo ensure that one rich backer doesn't completely dictate the art direction, the \"Specify-rewards\" are limited to one per person.\n About the currency...\nBecause we're based in Denmark, we have to define our goals and pledge levels in Danish krone (DKK).This can get a little bit confusing if you're not up to date on conversion rates, so to make things a little easier for you, we've included the price of things in US Dollars, Euro, and British Pounds in our stretch goals and pledge descriptions. Note that the pledge amount in dollars is automatically converted by Kickstarter (and is therefore not included in the descriptions like euro and pound prices are). Also note that stretch goal amounts have been rounded to the nearest hundred.\nThe converted amounts were all updated right before going live with this campaign, but please note that they may not be accurate at the end of the campaign.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs visible from our demo, the core of Dungeon Builder is already implemented, so the risk of the project failing altogether is virtually non-existent - as long as none of us get hit by a bus, that is. Having a team of two, makes the project vulnerable to unexpected deaths. \n\nAnother risk is missing the deadline. As any developer will tell you, estimating a programming task is difficult, so after estimating the programming completion date (including all stretch goals), we've added two months for pledge extras and stretch goal art, just to be sure we're not underestimating.\n\nHowever, if we reach many of our ambitious stretch goals and then run into unexpected and very time consuming challenges e.g. with networking, there is risk that everything will not be finished by the end of May 2017. In that case, we'll give all backers beta access from the 1st of June until the beta closes and we release Dungeon Builder version 1.0.\n\nFinally, if we reach all art related stretch goals and have a lot of Specify-rewards to fulfil, there is a risk that the art side of the project will not be completely done by the end of May 2017. Should this be the case, Dungeon Builder will release as scheduled, and the remaining art will be included in updates as soon as it is ready.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge DKK 25 or more", "title": "A Helping Hand (\u20ac3 / \u00a33)", "descp": "Our thanks for helping Dungeon Builder become a reality.

Each of the backers will actually receive a slight discount off MSRP for backing this project. We have accounted for this discount in our totals and costs. This pricing also allows us to introduce wholesale and distribution pricing to ensure the terrain can get into as many hands as possible after successful fulfillment of this project.\nWe want to continue bringing our products to the world, not just part of it and in support of that, our Kickstarter is open to all those that would want to back us. We have figured out the weights associated with our products ahead of time and you will be charged shipping accordingly. Due to prior experiences where shipping can hurt a Kickstarter, we will err on the side of caution and round shipping costs up; however, we will refund any shipping overages via Paypal when the actual costs are calculated. We do not want to make any money on the shipping costs, nor do we want to be buried in the costs of shipping. For US residence (any state), we will include any applicable sales tax; however, countries outside the US, please keep in mind any tariffs or VATs you may need to pay on inbound products.\nFor this project, we put special consideration into the timing and have come up with a plan that we hope to be sufficient to meet or exceed expectations. With the exception of circumstances outside outside our control, the molding, manufacturing, production, painting, packaging, and shipping are within our control. All of the pieces are made within the US with US material sources and labor within our own manufacturing facility under our supervision. That being said, we have estimated the amount of time we need based on ramp up and labor capacity, which scales with the project final numbers. Therefore our project will be broken into two distinct parts, initial ramp up and production fulfillment.  \nThe initial ramp up will begin immediately following the conclusion of the Kickstarter where we will create the molds necessary to begin production on the first wave of the Kickstarter. This will be 15 weeks, during which time, we will be creating the molds, securing labor, production, and storage facilities and purchasing the raw materials necessary to fulfill the pledges. \nThe production fulfillment will begin immediately following the ramp up period and will continue until all pledges have been fulfilled. The pledges will be fulfilled based on the wave in which you pledged. As the project progresses, we will post updates along with approximate dates associated with each wave so you will understand where your pledge falls in the timeline.\nDuring production, we will continue to create molds necessary for additional fulfillments and duplicates to speed production, in other words we may actually get faster as we go, just don\u2019t quote us on that. We are; however, about 80% confident on our scheduling, which means ramp up can be anywhere from 13 weeks on the low end to 18 weeks on the high end. As we get comfortable with all the arrangements, we will be able to raise the confidence level. \nThis is our project, simply stated, and we are asking you to help support our process of expanding and growing Legendary Realms Terrain from where we are today to a terrain company that can continue to provide new and exciting terrain to better your gaming experience. We want to bring you new terrain and we have a long list of terrain that we want to create. The Ice Cavern project is the first of what we hope will be many more to come. As with all our endeavors, our success can only be realized through your support and I want to thank you in advance for backing and confidence in us.\nIce Cavern Project Description Over the past few years we, as a company, have been working on learning the intricacies of our processes and what it takes to bring our products to life from the beginnings of an idea to the detail painting and packaging. Now that we have a better understanding of each aspect of our process and we are comfortable with our ability to produce and fulfill, we are ready to move forward to bring more accessories and terrain pieces to your game. We have been cautious and tentative, moving forward slowly, to ensure that our processes are in place and now we are ready to introduce our new line of terrain accessories and Ice Terrain for our first new venture as we look to expand our product line and bring your games to life!\nOur new project is looking to introduce two new lines of terrain to our existing product list, Accessories and Ice Terrain. As always, our main focus is to bring new accessories to the market to allow you to bring your game to life, regardless of your tabletop. Our accessories can be used with your existing 3D terrain or even with your current graph paper and markers to give your game depth and enhance game play. Who knows what your players will think of when they \u201csee\u201d the fountain or statue in the room. In addition to our accessories, we have a long list of new terrain lines to bring to market, the first of which is our Ice Terrain. Our Ice Terrain will bring your imagination to a new world and set your players into the cold reaches that have only been spoken about with awe in passing. Now you can go. This project will also introduce accessories to be cast in Ice to enhance the terrain.\nThis project will help us acquire the start up costs associated with bringing these new terrain pieces to the market efficiently. The accessories are completely new and custom sculpted specifically for Legendary Realms Terrain by our sculptor friend Colin Wessel. The new Ice Terrain will be a combination of custom sculpts and Hirst Arts pieces, as we continue to expand our partnership with Hirst Arts.\nThe initial products being offered in this project will include the first Ice Terrain themed room, a set of five Ice Accessories, and a set of five non-ice accessories. Having learned from past experiences, we are limiting our initial offerings to focus on the goal of bringing product to the market for you. However, this does not mean we did not think ahead. Instead, we have lined up many more accessory add-ons that can be purchased and will be revealed at every $25k mark. If you help us hit those marks, we will bring more accessories to market. Oh and don\u2019t worry, it will be very difficult to make us run out of new accessories, we have been accumulating potential new products for the last two years\u2026\nThe design of this project has put us in a position to be efficient without putting a strain on the individuals involved or undue stress on you, the backers of this project. We have carefully considered our pricing, costs, shipping, and timing for this project to ensure that we will be successful in delivering our promises to you.\nCosts: The costs involved with this project include the costs of material and labor so that we, as a company, can continue to produce our existing terrain accessories without compromising fulfillment of this Kickstarter. Our costs also include the one-time fees associated with creating molds, storage facility of molds, expanding our current workspace to accommodate the larger line of products. Finally, we have accounted for and calculated the costs so that the costs will scale with the hopeful success of the project. This means if we need to maintain a larger workforce, create more molds, move to a larger production facility, secure more material, or order more header tags, we will not be caught off guard with the additional expense. We have even included a catch all miscellaneous expense that also scales with the project, just in case we missed something. We are not perfect but we did try to account for whatever we may need.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1) Success\nSuccess is a risk and a challenge. Although we want this to be as successful as possible, our planning is not unlimited and it is possible that an overly successful project will challenge our preparedness. We have thought of this possibility and would readily accept this challenge. However, this challenge poses risks in the form of shipping delays. Since Kickstarter is generally an open ended success model, we have done our best at determining the time frame of delivery based on reaching our goal projection. In addition, we have planned for success up to 10x our goal projection. Anything beyond that we will attempt to make up time with additional labor but there is a limit we can increase labor within the physical constraints of our facility. Due to physical constraints as well as the unknown factor of each individual\u2019s pledge level, upon successful conclusion of this Kickstarter, we will re-project all timelines and communicate to everyone. We will attempt to hold to our original promise if we can meet the demand with labor, if not, we will communicate an updated timeline of deliveries for everyone. We may even give some people options of splitting up an order, where feasible.\n\n2) Materials\nAs soon as the Kickstarter ends, we will place our order for materials; however, due to the relatively short shelf-life of some of our materials, we cannot take delivery until we are very close to using the material. This can lead to potential out of stock situations when we need material, which can cause delays. Since raw materials are not directly within our control, the only way to mitigate this risk is to ensure we order on time and communicate to you of any delays.\n\n3) Labor\nDepending on the success of the Kickstarter, we have budgeted for additional labor. We cannot begin hiring this additional labor until after the Kickstarter ends, which leaves us about eight weeks to post ads, interview, and train new employees. We feel confident that the allotted time is sufficient; however, any delays in hiring or training employees may lead to delivery delays. \n\nIn addition, there is a risk that employees may quit in the middle of production. This may also cause delays in production and delivery times.\n\nTo address these risks, we do have some time for unexpected occurrences within our schedule but not so much that we could go without employees. In either case, we will communicate any such issues to you immediately, along with an assessment on potential issues due to the issues.\n\n4) Communication\nCommunication is always a challenge. Everyone goes into a project like this with the expectation that they will communicate appropriately and timely to all the backers but sometimes expectations, intentions, and hopes fall short. We recognize this as a potential risk due to the timeline necessary to produce and ship our product. To help mitigate this risk we want to take two approaches. First, we will assign a project manager after the project is successful. This project manager will be responsible to communicate statuses on a weekly and/or frequent basis as necessary, even if it is to say that we are currently on schedule. The other approach to maintaining communication is you. We want to state it here so you understand that communication does not have to come from us to you. Instead, you have the power at any time to reach out to us and ask us what is going on. Our project manager, along with all of us have the ability to monitor the message board and the emails associated with this project and we have set up weekly status meetings to capture these call outs.\n\n5) Shipping Costs\nThe ability to track shipping costs accurately, separate from pledges will be a challenge. Shipping costs are a necessary evil of our product and, due to the weight, shipping can become expensive. So as to not repeat mistakes of the past and lose money on shipping, we have attempted to calculate the most accurate shipping costs for the pledges and the add-ons. We want to make it clear, we are not looking to make any money on your shipping costs and we will track pledge money separate from shipping money. If we can ship your package cheaper, without compromising the integrity of your package, we will refund your over payment of shipping charges back to you, via Paypal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Richard Parla\n2 created \u00b7 6 backed\nWe are Legendary Realms Terrain but we did not start there.

Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde is not another A-Z of monsters. Instead, we have focused on some of the commonly encountered monstrous races like goblins, gnolls, and orcs, detailing their cultures, environments, and attitudes, as well as introducing a wide variety of stat blocks to suit a range of challenge levels, each with their own unique artwork.     \nBugbears - Ruled by augury and ritual superstition, bugbears are lead by a mixture of mystics and warriors. They excel at silently hunting their quarry, be it deer, troll, or man.  \n\"Tell a tale enough times and the details are sure to change. Somewhere in the thousands of years of telling children not to wander past sundown, or play with fire, or suck their thumbs, folk took to threatening them with bugaboos, or boogiemen, and forgot altogether that the original terror of the night was the, sadly very real, bugbear.\" -Ansel Greer, linguist \nGnolls - Scavengers or hunters, whatever niche gnolls fill, they undertake their role with remorseless savagery. The 3 most common types are the powerful and aggressive plains gnoll, the cowardly and opportunistic gutter gnoll, and the cunning and elusive rock gnoll. \n \"If you see one gutter gnoll, there are two. If you see two, pack your bags and find a new town.\" -Urban words of wisdom \nGoblins - Cowardly and sadistic bullies, goblins are divided into 3 distinct subgroups; forest goblins, stealthy guerrilla hunters and trappers; hill goblins, the most organized and martial variety; and cave goblins, a degenerate and twisted breed living deep underground. \n \u201c\u2018Goblin ambush?\u2019 What next? You may as well tell me to fear an ambush of rabbits!\u201d -Last recorded words of Alric Anaut VI \nHobgoblins - Utterly focused on waging war with other races, hobgoblins are not to be trifled with. Like a plague of insects, their great hosts will consume all a land has to offer, and march its former occupants off in chains. \n \"We shall triumph because we are strong, you shall fail because you are weak. While you idle, we train. While you drink, we drill. While you sleep, we march. You are a rabble, we are a legion. You are flesh, we are steel.\u201d -Warlord Koskar\u2019s speech at the gates of Borselle \nKobolds - Kobolds divide neatly into 2 distinct subtypes. Warren kobolds are kobolds left to their own devices; simple miners and trap builders. When a colony discovers, or seeks out a dragon egg or wyrmling, their society entirely changes to that of the more grandiose and self-important dragon kobolds. ***Content contributor Wolfgang Baur of Kobold Press!*** \n \"So they're dragons, right? But they can't fly, they can't breathe fire, they're not that clever, and they're tiny. By that logic, my terrier's a direwolf.\" -Overheard in the Drake and Griffin tavern \nOgres - Ogres are defined by their violent cruelty, immense strength, and monumental stupidity. They are inordinately proud of all these things. \n \"If you's so smart, how come you's dead and I's not?!\" -Longest ogre sentence ever recorded \nOkiti - Usually a mischievous nuisance in port towns, okiti can prove deadly if pushed, with huge numbers at their disposal and a knowledge of deadly poisons.\n \u201cHuman say okiti stupid, because okiti speak nonsense in circles. Okiti say it is the human who stops to listen, no? So who is the fool?\u201d -\u2018Fights-with-tongue\u2019, okiti ringleader \nOrcs - Orcs revel in chaos and destruction, and their violent warrior culture allows for no weakness. \n \"The trick to fighting orcs is to remember they don't expect to make a second blow. Of course, surviving the first blow is easier said than done.\" -Jana, mercenary, former hobgoblin slave \nTrolls - Immensely adaptable, trolls are shaped by their environment into perfect ambush predators. \n \u201cSay what you will, I liked The Grumpy Old Stone. He gave us something to talk about, a sense of identity, you know? And he kept orcs away. As for him eating that old lady, well, that was never proved.\u201d - Brogdan, miller \n  All stretch goals unlocked from the 5th Edition Revenge of the Horde Kickstarter campaign. Here is what's been added to the book: \nBeasts of the Horde - Two legs good, four legs better! We will add an appendix of beasts associated with the races of the book presented at a challenge ratings, such as worgs, hyaenids. reptilian mounts, and more, including artwork. \nFull Color Artwork - The book looks good, but we can make it even prettier!

We've got you covered. We will include the necessary information to build a playable character as the races in the book, roleplaying information to suggest why you may have chosen the adventuring life, and sketch artwork. \nEncounter Tables - We know you all like your tables. Each chapter will contain a selection of encounter groups for a variety of challenge ratings. \nLair Tables - Let's talk home decor. Each chapter will include a table to determine culturally appropriate details to add flavor to a settlement controlled by the race. \nLoot Drop Tables - Tasty, tasty loot! Each chapter will include tables for challenge appropriate loot which would logically be carried by the monsters. \nAdditional Artwork - Even more pretty pictures! We will add extra pieces of accent artwork highlighting particular items and objects of importance. \nTrinket Tables - What's it got in its pocketses? Each chapter will include a table with trinkets and intriguing but worthless treasures a creature might have on their person. \nTools of the Horde - What foul craft is this?! We will add a variety of items including weapons, armor, and potions (which do not exactly adhere to manufacturer's specifications. Drinking said potions may result in side effects. You've been warned).  \nLair Maps - Which way leads out of this accursed place?! We will add maps of various lairs for the appropriate monstrous races like cave goblins, rock gnolls, trolls, kobolds, etc. These maps will be in the book, PLUS you'll receive a digital version of every map no matter what your pledge level!\nDIGITAL (these add ons require a pledge of at least $15) \n$5 Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde PDF \n$15 Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde (d20pro) \n$15 Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde (Fantasy Grounds)\nPHYSICAL (these add ons require a pledge of at least $40)\n$40 Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde HARDCOVER \n$25 Revenge of the Horde PAWNS - This pack of solid cardstock pawns contains 258 monsters featured in Revenge of the Horde.

It's as simple as that. \n$12 Encounter Deck #1 - Goblins! 52 cards including all three goblin sub races as well as the goblin king! \n$12 Encounter Deck #2 - Orcs & Hobgoblins! 52 cards including a huge variety of orcs and hobgoblins to fill your battlefields! \n$12 Encounter Deck #3 - Gnolls! 52 Cards Including all three gnoll sub races to terrorize the countrysides and city sewers! \n$12 Encounter Deck #4 - Bugbears, Trolls & Ogres! 52 Cards Including some of the most monstrous creatures of all! \n$12 Encounter Deck #5 - Kobolds & Okiti! 52 Cards Including the smallest and most numerous of the hordish races! \nAs shipping fees continue to climb it's becoming more and more difficult to fulfil physical products. Underestimations of shipping fees can seriously impact projects like this, so we are waiting until we are closer to the delivery date to collect those fees.

From their blood rose the scions of power and the minions who would do their bidding. Some were born of gods' blood, noble and perfect. Others were born from titans' blood, twisted and malevolent. A third was born an abomination of the two \u2014 half god, half titan: the bloodless gorgons.\nBut the storm is coming. The time of ascendancy is at hand. The kingdom can have but one ruler \u2014 the king of storms. Which child of heaven shall take their place upon the throne?\nAnd who will be consumed by the storm?\nKing of Storms is filled with rules and advice. And godlike beings...\n  King of Storms utilizes an innovative game system called Praxis. In Praxis, players take on the roles of characters and authors of the story, but with one twist. Praxis characters want what's best for them, allowing for semi-competitive play in a GMless game.\nPlayers creates scenes for the characters to push their own agendas. The core mechanics revolve around three things: dice, milestones, and trepidation. Dice determine the outcome of dramatic conflict, in a way that may surprise everyone. Milestones and goals shape the story. Trepidation is all the bad things that can happen when a character fails. Each character has a list of five milestones and trepidations that are specific enough to provide flavor, but vague enough to not pigeon-hole play.\nCharacters are the heart of Praxis. Every piece of the story grows from the successes and failures of the players\u2019 actions. Unlike traditional roleplaying games, where characters are insular until they interact with the environment, Praxis characters are are the environment, protagonists, and story, all wrapped into one. Everything needed to write a story is on the character sheets.\nPraxis comes with six character roles and each role has a unique combination of objectives, quirks, powers, milestones, and so on. These combinations make Praxis stories different every time.\nEach Praxis game is 80 pages long, complete with all the rules, advice, and character sheets needed to play.\nThere are three completed games, with art, ready to print. There is no risk.\nAll Praxis games use the same core mechanic. Players takes turns being director, framing scenes based on their goals and milestones. While game play is semi-competitive, there's also the cooperative need to write coherent stories.\nSo in some ways, Praxis is easier to play than other GMless games. And in some cases it's more complicated. The scene framing rules are the most straight-forward and clearly defined out there. But the character goals and milestones mean that the players need to be creative and think on their feet. In the end, the game experience is familiar, dramatic, and a perfect evolutionary step in the GMless game parade.\nBecause of the nature of the system, new plots and stories can be explored that can't be under other systems. Praxis allows for more stories that point inward in a meaningful way, as well as outward, against the world.\nCharacters, not setting, are the heart of Praxis. Nearly everything you need to play can be found on the character sheet. Role. Powers. Objectives. Relationships. Quirks. World Building. Milestones. Trepidation. No two sheets are the same.\nEach sheet guides you to an unknown finish line, as more and more finale options dwindle away. But only one player can write the finale.\n70 pages of rules and advice guide you through every step of play.\nThree games are done. Art. Editing. Everything. As soon as the project ends, I hit the print book button and ship your game. Don't expect any long-winded updates about the project being delayed. Because it's done. The day the project ends, I hit send and your book gets printed and shipped.\nYou are buying a finished game. A progressive step in GMless games. A project that I'm really proud of.\nI love playing these games.\nDisclaimer: Praxis games contain some mature subject matter. While most Post World Games products aren\u2019t for kids, the material contained in these pages is for adult readers and gamers. No attempt has been made to be overtly offensive, but these games tackle themes requiring a deeper sense of the world.\nThe Lambs is available only through kickstarter. Never to be offered again. It is only available as a book.\n  King of Storms comes with a unique cover for backers. There is no other way to get this image for your copy of the game.\nUnique characters make each game highly replayable.\nAll softcover and hardcover rewards come with PDFs, except for the Lambs.\nEach game will be explained in greater detail in the updates.\nThe Lambs. This game is only available through this kickstarter and only as a print book. A PDF will never exist. Though, PDFs of the character sheets are available. I reserve the right to keep one copy of the game for myself. See below for more on this game.\nYou read that correctly. The Lambs will never be available again.\nFor every $2500, backers will receive one free PDF (of my choice) from my online store. Most likely a Protocol game. But if we go far enough with this, who knows what I'll give away.\nIn addition, backers will receive a backer-only pdf character for King of Storms \u2014 the Guardian \u2014 unavailable anywhere else. So. Unless someone sends them all over the internet, only you will have this character.\nAt $5000, I release a third Praxis game, Odin's Eye \u2014 a scifi search and rescue story. This game will not be kickstarter only, though backers can purchase it early through this kickstarter (ensuring it has top-notch art). It is complete now and will not delay the project.\nThe Odin's Eye Search and Rescue Vessel\nIn addition, backers will receive a backer-only pdf character for Lambs \u2014 Homeless \u2014 unavailable anywhere else.\nAt $7500, I release a fourth Praxis game, Of the Flesh \u2014 a game of zombies trying to become human once more. This game will not be kickstarter only, though backers can purchase it early through this kickstarter. It is complete now and will not delay the project.\nIn addition, backers will receive a backer-only pdf character for Odin's Eye \u2014 The Biologist \u2014 unavailable anywhere else.\nAt $10,000, I release a fifth Praxis game, The Black Monk \u2014 a strange fantasy game about immortality.\nThe Belltower Watcher awaits signs of the Black Monk's return\nIn addition, backers will receive a backer-only pdf character for Of the Flesh \u2014 The Pariah \u2014 unavailable anywhere else.\nPlayers vote for the next game in the series, chosen from a list of 5 possible titles. I will write and kickstart this game at another time.\nIn addition, backers will receive a backer-only pdf character for The Black Monk \u2014 The Lamplighter \u2014 unavailable anywhere else.\nTBD.\nIn The Lambs, the characters are people who believe their god speaks to them through signs and portents. Everything around them is a message telling them to \u201cdo his bidding.\u201d And each Lamb has the power and hunger to make change, if only until they are released.\nThe Lambs are passionate and see the world\u2019s sickness for what it is \u2014 humankind slipping into the hands of evil forces. The only road to salvation is in god\u2019s work and making the world over in a new image.\nPlayers take on the roles of these Lambs, working to reshape the world, while avoiding the corruptive influences of power. As the story inches closer to its inevitable conclusion, one must ask, \u201cwas it worth it?\u201d\nWas the kingdom worth all this?\nThis is just one of many games in the line.\nIn Odin\u2019s Eye, the characters are search and rescue specialists aboard a galaxy-spanning spaceship. They\u2019re dedicated, highly-trained, and often sent into impossibly hostile places. Their motto \u2014 No Star Unturned \u2014 serves as a reminder that they never give up, even when that could spell their doom.\nOrbiting an alien planet, the crew of Odin\u2019s Eye intercepts a distress beacon of unknown origin, squawking from the planet\u2019s surface. Geological instability and fluctuating weather patterns make it difficult to pinpoint the origin. One thing is certain, the beacon\u2019s rhythmic signature is unlike any in the Federation.\nSomething down there is either alien\u2026 or confused.\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the planet\u2019s toxicity kills whoever is sending the signal\u2026\nI intend for Praxis to be a 10-game series. Maybe more. But, I won't force it. Two more games are in development. I will only release new Praxis games when I have an idea for one that works. I won't rush these.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThese games are done and ready to print. As soon as the project ends, I tell the printer to make your books and send them off.

This means we\u2019ll be able to re-edit the manuscript and republish it beginning in November 2016. Check out our new Advanced Scout and Advanced Awakened tiers if you\u2019re interested in getting both books. For those with a higher tier, you can add \u2018The Awakened I\u2019 as an addon for $5 (eBook) or $15 (soft cover and eBook).\nAd-purchasers, your purchase of a 1/4 page (Brief Interlude) or 1 page (Interlude) ad will go into both books automatically for the price listed to the side (sorry, we can\u2019t change the description).\nAre you a fan of Pathfinder or 5th Edition D&D? Check out our final, $50 addon below to include your character as an NPC in the Awakened RPG, coming 2017. (Also, potentially 13th Age)\nOn the world of Grimaton, turning nineteen is more than just a rite of passage into adulthood. When the two moons cross, it can also change your life forever. As awakened, the men and women of Grimaton are possessed of magic in the form of a special bond with an animal or a knack for manipulating the underlying energies of the land. They throw rainbow fire, swim beside alligators, or shape the blood of their enemies into weapons.\nJoin us for a second time as book, RPG, and game publisher Samurai Sheepdog works independently to bring together seventeen amazing authors. In our latest anthology you'll find tales of triumph, failure, fear, and acceptance set once again in the fantasy world of Grimaton. Enjoy new stories with the heroes and villains from Book I. Meet entirely new characters as interesting and dynamic as the rest. Return to the fictional realm of the awakened and watch as its remarkable history continues to grow. When the moons cross, anything can happen.\nEvery backer will automatically receive The Awakened: The Pursuit mini-comic, created by Hal Greenberg with CAE productions, story by Dustin Holifer, penciled by Dee Fish and inked by Martin Dunn. The comic is finished and you will have access to it immediately after pledging, so check the backer update for the link.

The funds are to pay for the print run and compensate the talented authors and artists that brought this world to life. The book is 100% complete and just needs a boost to get it out the door and into your hands.\n\nPraise for 'The Awakened':\nIf you hunt around, you can still find something fresh in the worlds of magic - something different - and the stories in The Awakened can prove it.\n-Matt Forbeck (Marvel Publishing; Deadlands, Guild Wars, and Eberron novelist)\nThe Awakened anthology is a fantastic romp brought to you by writers both new and those you already know. The magic underlying the world of the Awakened is unlike anything you've seen before, and the stories in this volume only whet the appetite for more.\n-Bruce R. Cordell (author of Sword of the Gods, the Strange RPG & novels, and Plague of Spells)\nBecoming awakened is the culmination of all of your moments of consciousness focused into a life purpose. It's time to sit back and dream as new and veteran authors weave a tapestry of awakening through your consciousness.\n-Jim Butler (Former Brand Manager of D&D Worlds at Wizards of the Coast)\n  Please like us on Facebook during the Kickstarter campaign.

After years of hard work, we\u2019ve created a supplementary system for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that allows anyone to quickly and easily create balanced monsters from the ground up! While rigorously play-testing the system, we\u2019ve produced hundreds of new monsters inspired by all the Bestiary classics and are excited to share both the system and our creations with our fans!\nThe book and 230 monsters are already written and nearly ready to publish, but we want to see this project given the finishing touches it deserves. That means paying for beautiful original artwork, careful editing, and expanded content galore. We can\u2019t do that without your help!\n Want to know how we do it? We've created a \"pay what you want\" PDF that includes  an example of monster creation, and five sample monsters!\nBalanced monster creation can be a challenging and convoluted process for even experienced designers. In the theme of the popular Rogue Genius GamesTalented series, the Talented Bestiary presents new rules for monster construction\u2014taking it out of the realm of guess and check, and making every monster easily customizable. The simple streamlined process allows virtually anyone to produce full monster stat-blocks completely compatible with the Pathfinder system.\n The Talented Bestiary divorces creature type from basic statistics, so you can make a barbaric bloodthirsty fey as easily as an arcane spellcasting ooze. In addition, we\u2019ve broken down every universal monster ability and unique monster ability found in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary to create an intuitive point-buy system based on challenge rating. With this system, you can quickly and easily create any monster you dream of; from Fine-size CR \u00bd to a Colossal-sized CR 34. \n \u201cI once read a piece of advice that completely altered how I run games. It was in a horror setting, and the idea was simple. Players are a jaded lot that have seen it all. The idea of fighting a troll isn\u2019t scary anymore. As soon as the word troll comes out of your mouth, they roll their eyes and ask who has fire and acid handy. The same goes for hundreds of other monsters from aboleths to yeti. So, do you just throw them away and always look for the next book? \n Of course not!\n If you rebrand the troll, give it a different description and appearance, you can use the exact same statistics. Don\u2019t say \u201ctroll\u201d; say \u201cit\u2019s a hulking reptile monster with bloody saliva oozing from a gaping maw\u201d. The players are now confronted with something completely new, to them. They have no idea that behind the screen you are rolling for a troll. When their weapons can\u2019t kill the beast, they have to rediscover the troll\u2019s weakness all over again. They get the thrill, and the fear, of the unknown. They experience the feeling they had the first time they ever fought a troll. \nYou could even take it a step further! Instead of fire and acid, the mysterious beast can only be killed by cold and electricity. Or as an alternative to rending with claws, it has the ability to swallow whole. Replace scent with tremorsense and it senses vibrations in the water. Throw a template on there! A red half-dragon troll is pretty terrifying. Now we have a completely new monster slapped onto the troll chassis. And the best part is, no one has to know! A monster is a tool used to tell your story. You should never feel limited by the creatures you have at your disposal or be required to scour through multiple source books to find the perfect stat-block. Antagonists should be as mutable and custom-crafted as player characters. If you don\u2019t like something about a monster, you should be able to change it. If you have an amazing idea for a creature, it should only take a few minutes to throw something together from scratch. \nThe Talented Bestiary was created with these principles in mind, and we are proud of the result! We hope that this book lets you scare the pants off your players, and that no two trolls are ever the same again.\u201d -Stephen Rowe\nInstead of having base statistics determined by creature type, we have monster creation based on role (similar to player character classes). So, you can make a sneaky skilled ooze or arcane caster construct. There is one referenced table containing all base statistics (ability scores, base saves, recommended attacks, etc.) for a Medium-sized creature of any given CR.    \nThese values are all based on the Bestiary Monster Statistics by CR table, so everything balances out with minimal book work. Then there is a second table with adjustments to those statistics if you want to alter the creature's size. We've also created a spreadsheet tool that basically does all the calculations for you!\nAll creature types, subtypes, universal monster rules, and Bestiary 1 unique monster abilities are broken down into a point-buy system. The higher the creature's CR, the more points they receive, and the more points they can spend on an individual ability (monsters with combat roles get better base statistics but less ability points). Each ability is modular with enhancements and flaws, so any can be custom-crafted to suit the monster. Creature types/subtypes then offer ability suites for a lump-sum cost, and also serve as prerequisites for creature-type specific abilities. - Stephen Rowe\n Naturally, a system like this required a lot of playtesting\u2026 to the tune of 230 Bestiary variant monsters created by the Four Horsemen (Steven Helt, Dan Dillon, Stephen Rowe, and Tim Hitchcock) and guest designers including Victoria Jaczko, Clay Clouser, and Daniel Marshall. Each and every one of those monsters is included as a part of the Talented Bestiary!\nEvery single backer gets access to the google document with the book's first chapter, a summary of every monster featured in the book, and a free downloadable spreadsheet tool for making monsters lightning fast! While each of these monsters is nearly ready for publication, we are so proud of these crazy critters that we want to give them all the appropriate artwork and presentation they deserve!\n The Four Horsemen are Steven T. Helt (Famine), Stephen Rowe (Pestilence), Dan Dillon (Death), and Tim Hitchcock (War). We believe in providing fun crunch and engaging fluff for players and GMs alike. We are all veterans in the industry, having produced content for Paizo, Kobold Press, and many other top names in the industry. \nThe Four Horsemen Presents line has produced dozens of weekly products and blog posts with our partners, Rogue Genius Games and d20pfsrd.com. The Horsemen have brought together monster creation play-testers from varied designers, like Victoria Jaczko, Clay Clouser, and Daniel Marshall. \n On top of that, we've convinced the amazing BJ Hensley of Playground Adventures to act as our editor!\nWhat does access to print on demand at cost mean?  \n When the book is done, you will receive a link to the print on demand copy at cost. Then you can pay DriveThruRPG roughly $19.00 + shipping to your location and they will print and ship to you directly a 400+ page Full-Color 8.5x11 beautiful hardcover copy of the book.\n This means 100% of backer money goes toward creating this project, and we don't have to charge additional money upfront or increase the goal to cover the costs of printing and shipping. This project's #1 goal is to finish the book and get into your hands!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Four Horsemen and Rogue Genius Games are no strangers to crowdfunding or publishing. Our creative team is experienced. We've produced dozens of books in the last year as well as played a part in nearly every successful Pathfinder Kickstarter project. \n\nThe primary risk for the Talented Bestiary is one of our key partners being struck by some major illness or injury that prevents them from completing editing, layout, or art in a timely manner. Fortunately, we have access to numerous individuals available for each of those categories should such an event occur. \n\nThe bulk of the writing is complete for the Talented Bestiary. It is currently in editing, and getting ready for layout. We simply want to make sure we get the best artists we can commission, to fill this book with beautiful illustrations and give YOU the best book we can! \n\nThe only outside challenge may be in gathering, developing, and editing monster text from a few backers. Backers who pledge at those levels must deliver text promptly, and it will be developed and edited as quickly as possible.

The tribal leader is dead, the community in tatters, and the future a mystery. What will become of you in this barren wasteland? Who will emerge as both savior and tyrant?\nThis is not a safe game. Characters will die.\nLet's be honest. No one is going anywhere. The world is a shitty place. The sunset over the horizon doesn't make it any less shitty. We can't just pick up and leave here and hope the world is better on the other side.\nIt's still the world.\nIn other words, \"How could Hell get any worse?\"\nThe 'Exodus' is everywhere. Every tribe is on the verge of collapse. Every part of the world is about to fall. But why?\nHow did the worst conditions of human existence get worse?\nAnd what is next?\nThis version of The Carcass cleans up the previous edition. All of the expansion notes and classes are in one place. While the core principles are there, the rules, advice, and structure are stronger. In addition, the rules are being updated to the 5-10-20 in-house game system of Post World Games, including rules for play with and without a game master.\nIn the first edition of The Carcass, the game used a 2d6 system, with charts that reflected the powerlessness of people at the end of the world.\nThe powerlessness remains, but the system is adapting to the 5-10-20 game system, because I personally like it better. It's vastly more dangerous for everyone involved. The Carcass: Exodus takes a second look at the ways we prop up this dying world through powerful effects (and side-effects) of the things we do when we defy the odds. This is best highlighted by the powers in the 5-10-20 system, first designed here for Exodus.\nDisfigurements, mutations, and experience are also more concrete in this edition. You can play with or without them, but the rules for each can have a bigger impact on play. The character questions are better organized and I've added relationship mapping that will look familiar to Protocol players.\nThis edition deals more closely with the Exodus, the Fall of humanity in what might be the final age of mankind. In the previous edition, the Fall is hinted at. No longer. The Fall plays a major role in this edition. Do we try to rebuild? Or do we cut and run?\nThe Fall is not coming\u2026 its here!\nSample Page Spread from The Carcass: Exodus\nSample Page Spreads from The Carcass: Exodus\nThis game is 75% finished. It needs art, editing, and time to put some finishing touches on the writing. It is around 120 pages at the moment, but that's without pagination and all that.\nThere\u2019s something wrong with the world. Not the obvious wrong. We\u2019ve all heard our grandparents talk about the \u2018before time,\u2019 when food was plentiful, people didn\u2019t fight everyday, and there were permanent structures to live under. And there was fuel, too.\nNo. It\u2019s something else.\nI\u2019ve heard rumors from the other tribes. Some suffer from a lack of reliable food and clean water. In some places of the world fewer children are born. Radiation is so thick that people get sick and die within a matter of hours once exposed. Mutations are rampant.\nHope is a distant memory.\nI\u2019ve heard of tribes rising up against their own kind and killing their leaders. And then what? Without a plan, the tribe is cast into chaos almost immediately. Power vacuums create wars. And wars lead to more chaos and death. Some are calling it \u2018the Fall,\u2019 that definable moment in a tribe when everything turns sideways and upside down.\nEveryone is suffering from some kind of Fall. Every tribe, in every corner of the world. At least, as far as anyone can tell. Not that we were ever peaceful beings, but the fall has brought out the worst in us. And it\u2019s growing.\nSome blame the mutants, psychics, and witches. Others speak of outsiders who bring curses with them. Some think there are haunts living among them that brought the fall. None can say for sure what the real cause is, only that nothing is the same.\nIt's only a matter of time before we pack up and leave. Who knows what the exodus holds?\n$10. Scavenger.

Plus, you create a character class for the game. Plus, jim pinto comes and visits you and plays a full day of games at your house/game store/basement. 100 miles radius limit. See the sidebar for details.\nInformation about all the character classes (called roles) stretch goals will be revealed in the upcoming project updates. At the moment, there are over 20 classes designed. But the roles that make the final cut are contingent upon how well the kickstarter does.\nThe Carcass: Exodus uses a simplified version of the 5-10-20 system that is coming later this year. In this system, players roll between 1 and 5 dice (depending on proficiency and drama points expended) and tabulate the results. Each chart has a value listed for rolling a 0 (below 5), 5, 10, or 20. For each value, an effect is listed. That effect has a result on another chart, explaining how the foil (or GM) will interpret the result. Like so:\nSome results are concrete, and others are grey. The more common the result, the less swing-y the result. Rolling low can result in some really bad stuff with lasting impact for the tribe. In this instance, the Hatchet who rolls less than a 5 is in some deep shit.\nObviously you can't roll a '20' on 3d6, so there must be rules in the game for rolling more dice.\nAnd there are.\nIn addition to their own problems, players need to keep track of their fatigue, wounds, trepidation \u2014 which is a measure of how the community feels about the characters \u2014 and even the community's fear level. Some characters even start with trepidation.\nAdd $25 to your order. This includes shipping. Only available in the US.\nA fistful of dice. I won't count them. I'm just going to cram my hand into a bag and stuff the dice in the mail. Dice come in five colors, with a stylized X for the '6.'\nI can't guarantee you'll get all five colors, but I can fit about 15-20 dice in my hand. So your odds are good.\nIf you want me to take a hammer and spray paint to them to make them ever more \"post-apoc\" looking, I will. But you'll get fewer dice out of it. Just because.\nAs stretch goals, I would like to do the following four decks for the Carcass. These would not be free, but would be available as print-on-demand.\nWorld Building Deck\nA quick-start deck of 30 cards, with random world setup information, including community names, character names, NPCs, conflicts, and even some starting projects. This deck would cut setup time by about 30 minutes. Art forthcoming.\nToolcards: The Carcass\nToolcards are a powerful tool for gamemasters to generate quick encounters and scenarios, in addition to making fast NPCs and effects (like sights and sounds). The deck comes with 30 double-sided cards for nearly endless game options.\nFor more information on Toolcards, see this page.\nCondition/Result Cards\nPerhaps the most important deck of the three, this deck includes all the game effects and conditions for ease of play. The back of the cards will have the game result term in BIG BOLD LETTERS, so it's easy to find. And the other side will have the condition and description for that effect, so players can hold onto it.\nThe deck isn't designed yet, but this is an example of how easy the cards will be to read. This is NOT a final design of the card.\nCarcass Poker Deck\nUsing the art from the game, I will make a poker deck with the carcass logo on the back. Very post-apocalyptic. This will be a print on demand deck of cards, so the material won't be the waxy bicycle plastic cards people are used to.\nAnyone who knows my work, knows that I make games because I love making games. I do not make a living doing this. I do this out of love. Even when those games are about hate.\nThis project is a lite version of the 5-10-20 rules and the beginning of an era of new roleplaying games from Post World Games. This rule system has been brewing in my mind for years. No counting modifiers and arguing about whether or not traits apply to your bonuses. No memorizing \"forward-moving threads\" or working from a spreadsheet to know everything your character can do.\nRoll dice. Look at chart. Play.\nIt's that f***ing simple.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI wrote the first edition of this game in two weeks.

We call this new series \"SMArt\" Playing Cards... which is short for \"SIMPLY MINIMALIST ART\" playing cards.\nWe have always loved the look of the Minimalist art style and what you can convey with simple lines, black and whites and solid bold coloring.\nSo what is SMArt Series Playing Cards?\nTo put it simply... it is an ongoing series of \"Themed\" playing card poker decks that will always have that minimalist art style. We plan on releasing approximately 4 decks (or series) a year and each of these decks could have a different theme, but will always have brand new exciting artwork.\nThis campaign (Mighty Super(b) Heroes) is our first release in this SMArt series and it is based on one of our favorite topics here in the office... Super(b) Heroes. From comic books to graphic novels to all the recent great films, there is no denying that super heroes are here in a big way and everyone loves them.\nWe hope you enjoy our vision of super(b) heroes with... \n                                                   Concept by: Steven Fields\nDesign & Art by: Steven Fields & Greg \"Jazzy Bear\" Brown\nReleased by: TwoGeeksGaming\nPrinting & Distribution by: Legends Playing Card Company (LPCC)\n100% custom face cards, aces, pips, jokers, and coloring\nAll 54 cards have their own individual artwork\nEach deck has 2 distinct art styles, Figures & Elements\nCards designed for both right and left handed game play\nCustom Tuck Box\n310 GSM (Black Core) card stock with Linen Finish\nLimited production run\nThe first deck in a continuing series of themed minimalist playing cards\nMighty Super(b) Heroes - Series 1.1 will be produced and fulfilled by Legends Playing Card Company (LPCC), using casino grade black core imported paper stock. \nLPCC produces the highest class of playing cards due to their innovation and attention to detail with exceptional durability, and the \u2018glass like\u2019 edges of their signature \u2018Diamond Cut\u2019 process.\nTwo new decks, Bicycle (left), Legends (right)\nThere have been some great Super(b) Heroes (& Villains), both past and present, that have inspired us along the way in making this deck.\nSo... special thanks goes out to both Marvel & DC... and to all the other companies out there for giving us all these awesome characters over the years. It has been an honor and a privilege to have them in our lives. \nThis campaign is just our small tribute to them for giving us the inspirations you see here.\nOur face cards are the 10's, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces, and Jokers. These have what we refer to as \"Figure Art\". \n Our pip cards are the 2-9 and have what we refer to as \"Element Art\". \n We spent a lot of time and went through several versions when developing the card back. This ultimately was the one we decided to use. It works on several visual levels. \nOne of our all time favorite tuck boxes is the Heretic set by Stockholm 17. It is a thing of beauty in its nearly all black design.\nRight from the start, we knew we wanted to keep that minimalist look throughout everything and it made sense to make our tuck box very stark. Bits of color, mostly blacks and greys, and with just enough information on it so you knew what deck you had in your hands.\nTuck Box Prototype v1\nTuck Box Prototype v2\nAll the above pictures are near final conceptual images and represent what the final product may possibly look like. Every effort will be made to ensure that the final produced product matches the conceptual images as close as possible. The art placement onto specific numbers/suits will change for a better overall design. All images/designs are subject to change though.\n Uncut Sheet\nMighty Super(b) Heroes T-Shirt\nAdd-On Pricing List\nPrices include S&H costs. If you have any questions or special requests, please Private Message us.\nWhat do you mean \u201cSMArt Series\u201d theme decks?\nOur goal is to try and release a new deck of themed playing cards every 3 months or so\u2026 as long as there is demand for it. The first one out of the gate is based on Super(b) Heroes. The next one could be something like Sci Fi Movies or even Action Heroes. The skies the limit on these. We might even ask what you, the backers, would like to see in a new deck.\nI noticed that Mighty Super(b) Heroes has a Series 1.1. What does that 1.1 mean?\nQuite simply it means that this is Series 1/Deck 1. So, series 1 will always be the Mighty Super(b) Heroes. In the future, when we do a second deck of all new super(b) heroes, it would be Mighty Super(b) Heroes \u2013 Series 1.2 or Series 1/Deck 2. That way you always know what you have in your hands.\nWhat are Figures and Elements that you refer to on the cards?\nOn the 10\u2019s, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces, and Jokers\u2026 we have Figure art. These are super heroes that sort of have the look of mini detailed stick figures. Now on the 2-9 cards\u2026 we have Element art. These are cards that have various elements & attributes of a super hero or the overall feel and look of a super hero.\nWhen there is more than one deck in a series, can I mix the decks together?\nYes. The card backs in a particular series will always have the same back. So you could take Mighty Super(b) Heroes 1.1 and 1.2 and mix them all together. You could even build your own style deck of super(b) heroes that could \u201cAvenge\u201d the planet if needed\u2026 or have a \u201cLeague\u201d of super(b) heroes that deal out \u201cJustice\u201d.\nWhat does Limited Production Run mean?\nWe will only make Mighty Super(b) Heroes - Series 1.1 this one time. It will NEVER be re-printed. The final amount of decks we make will be determined by this campaign. Once they are gone, that is it. \nI see there is a $75.00 tier that has a \u201cLimited Edition\u201d Mighty Super(b) Heroes 1.1 LE deck. What is that?\nIt is truly a unique deck of cards. It uses MPC\u2019s new High Gloss technique for printing. So far there have been about 5 or so decks on the market that use it. But, when you see them, you will be blown away. I was stunned on how beautiful and different they are than anything else out there. Check out this video to see what we are talking about.\nPLAY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWlwOhTWQ9g\nThe art in the two decks (standard edition vs. limited edition) are the same, but in the limited edition version the High Gloss makes the deck totally different looking. The LE version almost looks like water pooled on the cards. Very cool, very different, very unique.\nWhy is Mighty Super(b) Heroes \u2013 Series 1.2 a whole new campaign and not just an add-on? \nThat is a great question and there are several reasons why we did it this way.\n1. Currently we only have roughly 70% of the art done for this next deck. The extra month or so will give us enough time to finish all the art without being rushed.\n2. If it were an add-on and we were going to ship both together, it would have pushed the delivery time to get it all to you. We felt everyone would like to get things as quickly as possible. You would get the first deck in November and the second in December.\n3. Since were running two separate campaigns, the production houses are giving us a slight discount for repeat business. We are able to pass along those savings to you.\n4. Since it is its own campaign, it gives us another 30 days for funding. The more funds we get, the more cool things we can offer for the cards and deck.\n5. Gives you something to look forward to in the future. When the 2nd deck does arrive in the mail\u2026 you will be like Gollum and the new deck is your Precious.\nHere is what 2GG has scheduled for the remainder of 2015.\n TwoGeeksGaming01@gmail.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe artwork, design, planning, and budgeting has already been completed.

Which I honestly don't see happening, as we are only using reputable companies in the card industry. We also padded in an extra month just to make sure we would meet our deadline.\n\nI will post regular updates, so you can keep track of every stage of Mighty Super Heroes and see it come to life.\n\nOnce again, thanks for all the support Kickstarter!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "TwoGeeksGaming\n8 created \u00b7 68 backed\nTwoGeeksGaming was formed several years ago with the idea that all games can be fun.

Inside you'll find details on Cullen Bunn and Brian Hurtt's incredible world, new Edges and Hindrances, guns and gear, Setting Rules, rules for sorcery and voodoo, an Adventure Generator, and a host of nefarious rogues, gadflies, and scoundrels, for one of the wildest Westerns in all of comics! \nThis book requires the Savage Worlds core rules to play.\n\u201cThe Sixth Gun is so fun it feels like it was discovered, not created.\u201d - Kelly Sue DeConnick, Bitch Planet, Captain Marvel\nThe Sixth Gun: The Winding Way Adventure + Game Master Screen\nThe Winding Way is an epic adventure presented in Six (!) installments. Our gunslingers, houngans, and other heroes will get a taste of all the world of The Sixth Gun has to offer, including encounters with strange beasts and unusual characters, experience with the legendary guns themselves, and even a not-so-leisurely stroll through the spirit realm. Eventually they will be faced with choices that could reshape the West itself, maybe even the entire world.  \nFor the curious, The Winding Way is effectively a prequel to the events presented in the main comic book series.\nThe Sixth Gun RPG Game Master screen is a tri-fold, landscape screen featuring gorgeous full-color artwork on one side and all the important charts and tables for the game on the other.\n\"More mystery and wonder and adventure in the first six pages than some comics have in their whole lives. Say hello to your new favorite comic.\" - Matt Fraction, Hawkeye, Sex Criminals\nYou GOTTA Watch This Video!\n\"A rollicking supernatural adventure filled with twists and turns, I couldn't put it down. This is not your father's Wild West.\" - Cliff Bleszinski, CEO, Boss Key Productions \n\"The Sixth Gun is totally unique, beautiful to look at, and an all-around terrific read.\u201d - Rick Remender, Low, Deadly Class, Fear Agent \nThe Creative Team at Oni Press \nCullen Bunn and Brian Hurtt first worked together on The Damned from Oni Press. They followed this series with The Sixth Gun, the Eisner and Harvey nominated epic fantasy set in the Old West. Brian has also illustrated Queen & Country (Oni Press) and Hard Time (DC). Cullen has also written Hellbreak, Helheim, and Terrible Lizard (Oni Press); Magneto (Marvel); and Sinestro (DC). Cullen has played roleplaying games since he was a kid. A kid at heart, Brian has recently picked up the gaming habit.\nHere's what people usually ask about first\u2014the level that includes \"one of everything.\" That would be the True Fan of the Weird West (or the most elite experience, the epic True Fan of The Sixth Gun scheduled for Thursday, July 31st beginning at 5pm at Gen Con in Indianapolis), and it's everything at a discount over adding everything on to a base level separately. Heck, we even throw in a Deadlands Marshal's Handbook and Player's Guide to round out the Weird in your West. PLUS you get the first two volumes of the deluxe, oversized, and limited \"Gunslinger\" editions, collecting issues 1-11 and 12-24 of the ongoing series, jam-packed with tons of bonus material! \nIf you already have The Sixth Gun complete set and just need the RPG line, plus all the miniatures, dice, and Bennies, you want one of the Sword of Abraham rewards. \nJust want digital copies? The Gunslinger reward level is what you want. There are other levels between Preacher and True Fan of The Sixth Gun, but we think that gives you the basic gist of it\u2014see the reward descriptions to the right for all the details. \nShipping\nTo see the shipping costs for your country, select the reward level, and after pledging check to see the additional shipping cost.

We offer a versatile broad array of alternatives and options for players and Game Masters. The setting focuses on defeating ancient evils, rediscovering of the world of Exodus and geopolitical intrigue based in a magical setting. NeoExodus brings to players and GMs new races and with unique alternative racial options and highly advanced magics that are almost impossible to differentiate from advanced technologies.\nNeoExodus has been described by its creator, Louis Porter Jr, as his fantasy love letter to the science fiction masterpiece, Babylon 5. Others have compared the mixture of fantasy and science fiction elements to be similar to those found in cult classic cartoon series like He-Man and the Master of the Universe to Thundercats and CrossGen comic books Scion and Sojourn. Some of the realistic aspects and feelings of the setting of NeoExodus are based off of real world events while embracing the possibilities for fantasy.\nLouis Porter Jr. Design\nNeoExodus was created, implemented, expanded and developed by many of the most well know Pathfinder Role Playing Game developers including Neal Bailey, Thomas Baumbach, JP Chapleau, Joshua Cole, Richard Farrese, Lee Hammock, Jeff Lee, Jonathan Palmer, David Ross, Amber Scott, Owen K.C. Stephens, Adam Wells, Benjamin Wenham, Linda Weygant-Robison and myself, Louis Porter, Jr.\nWhat is your money going to?\nWhat we have created, at the most basic of levels, is an update and revision of our NeoExodus Campaign setting. This new book will be at least 175 pages in length for this unique setting. The money that we raise will go for the additional cost of generating art, new written material and editing, and the general updated quality of production of the product. Louis Porter Jr. Design\u2019s goal is to present you with a complete and unique world for NeoExodus in the similar tradition of TSR and Wizard of the Coast's fan favorite campaign settings like Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms and even the more unique setting of Ebberon. As we reach our currently planned stretch goals, we will be attaching all new ones to this project to bring on even more excitement and prestige.\nAs we reach our currently planned stretch goals we will be attaching all new ones to this project to bring on even more excitement and prestige to this project.

Tell us what you think in the comments!!\nHigh-precision tools will allow for a high-precision cut!\nUpdate 2.0!\nWe're receiving a LOT of good feedback on our Facebook page! Here's the newest addition to the project - COMMON RPG STATS engraved onto the box itself!! What a great idea from Autumn P.\nWorking on the KBOX Mobile GM Table with engraved RPG stats!\n Here's the final prototype for the KBOX Mobile GM Table. 10 lucky $50 backers gets this bad boy!\nThe engraved image is rendered, but the KBOX Mobile GM Table is ready to go!\n Update 1.0!\n       Adding some concept artwork here to get the backers thinking about what they'd like on their KBOX!!\nKBOX with Celtic Dragons. What would you have on yours?\nWhat we need:\nWhat we need to make this project a reality are the tools and capacity to fulfill the orders and accurately reproduce the product:\n1) Professional routing table and bits required to cut the grooves\n   - This will allow for rapid production and more precise cuts!\n2) Desktop CNC machine \n   - The CNC machine will allow us to customize each box with a little bit of inspiration from you! Want your name? Done. Want your favorite pic? Send it over!\nDesktop CNC Machine\n History:\nWhile I was at GenCon this year, I noticed there were a lot of people...duh. What I also noticed that VERY OFTEN people would take any space available to play a game and most of the time those games involved dice. \nVersion 1.0\nWhen you're talking about dice in a cramped environment, it can get pretty difficult to keep your dice under control and on the board. Not to mention keeping them separate from the rest of the players in the game. Of course, then there's also the inevitable dice-rolling-off-the-table-and-awkwardly-rolling-under-someone's-seat-where-you-have-to-climb-under-and-look-like-a-perv-whilst-retrieving-them moments of which no one is a fan.\nEnter the KBOX short (very short) for Kobold Company Dice Box. My idea was to take advantage of that limited space by essentially making a small table you could both carry your dice IN and roll your dice ON in order to avoid those embarrassing, dice-dropping moments. \nMy first version of the KBOX KBOXwas an open-topped box with a whiteboard in it. Players simply roll the dice inside the box, no fuss, no muss...with the SUPER CONVENIENT whiteboard backing, players can also keep track of variables in the game they are playing.\nNo more of this write and erase on a single sheet of paper...NO, NO! The KBOX allows you keep all of this in a compact location. But what happens when you're done with the game? Version 1 of the KBOX essentially becomes another (albeit very light) obstruction in your backpack. Dice couldn't actually be stored in there, because of its open top.\nEnter Version 2.0!!\nVer 2.0 adds a slide-out top to the box! Which, incidentally, adds a SECOND whiteboard to the box as well. Keep track of stats, maps, notes, anything you want without wasting paper. When you're done with your game, slide the lid back into the box and keep your dice stored when you're on the go!!\nTwo of the possible color schemes for the K-Box\nThe events leading up to designing this box have been memorable to say the least. Travelling out to GenCon was freaking awesome! I do some freelance writing for Total Party Kill Games and was out visiting with those guys when the idea struck me. Also, I chopped up my thumb pretty good on the tablesaw - you can probably catch a glimpse of my bandage in the video - My wife has been very supportive up to this point, but in order to move forward, this Kickstarter has to be successful or it'll most likely be a no-go for her!\nSo there you have it! Thank you again for checking out this Kickstarter and I really look forward to chatting with you as this project moves forward!\nSTRETCH GOAL!\n$2000 - We'll upgrade the CNC mill to a Laser CNC for extreme precision and cuts!\nLaser Engraver at the $2000 stretch goal!\n$4000 - A larger, faster production mill is available at this backer level! We'll be able to construct KBOX extremely fast (and accurate)\nCan we even THINK about making it to $4000?\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge I have right now is repeatability on the individual boxes. While each product is professionally cut and assembled, I do not have a very good method of mass production which is where this project comes into play! \n\nI am looking to YOU, the awesome Kickstarter base to help me surmount that hurdle with a few new pieces of equipment in my shop. \n\nOnce I have some of these pieces, I'll be in a much better position to crank out the K-Box on a larger scale and get them to you much faster!\n\nA successful Kickstarter Campaign here means that production output becomes a reality!\n\nAs with many KS campaigns, what would really be the biggest problem would be too much funding - As it stands now, I would be unable, for example, to meet the demand in my little shop if I were to sell 1,000 k-boxes. I would have to outsource the idea and that would add to the delivery timeline. \n\nI don't anticipate that being problem, but you never know.

Simplicity.  Morningstar.\nWe live in a magical age.  The technology to build Morningstar didn't exist two years ago.  Now, we can integrate all the components of a complex role-playing game into a single application that can be run on your tablet, laptop or phone. \nEverything about the game is at your fingertips from rulebooks, adventures, characters, and maps to the most specific character customization - even a hard-earned badge from an epic homebrew campaign.  Tracking campaigns and compiling logbooks are no longer chores, but an integrated, shareable experience. And game night is streamlined.  Rules lookups are instantaneous - the right information is at your fingertips.  Sharing of content, maps and secret notes is a single tap away.  Spend more time role-playing and less time rules-playing.\nWe firmly believe that the best adventures are sitting on the shelves and in the minds of passionate players and game masters like you.  We are publishers by trade.  Morningstar is designed to allow writers to publish and get paid for their creativity and imagination.\nSince the beginning, our design has been fueled by your feedback.  Morningstar will continue to grow and evolve based on what our community most desires.  Our commitment is to integration, simplicity and creativity.  To accomplish this, the initial release of Morningstar includes 7 closely-integrated modules as described below.\nThe First Six Modules.\nThe first release of Morningstar, launching in April 2015, will feature six modules that unlock the potential of tabletop roleplaying by immersing players in the storytelling aspects rather than in bookkeeping and rules checking.\nPlayers will be able to quickly create and manage characters, track the progress of their adventures, send secret messages, roll virtual dice and more.  GM\u2019s will be able to manage adventures, track encounters, share maps and notes as well as organize large scale campaigns all through a cleverly designed mobile interface.\nMost importantly, our Library will be packed full of purchasable content written and submitted by homebrew and indie authors.\nThe Seventh Module.\nBut this only scratches the surface of what we have planned for Codename Morningstar.  In July 2015, we will release our seventh module, which we call \u201cThe Forge\u201d.  Through the Forge, Game Designers can create adventures and campaigns, share them with their friends or publish them in our Library for the entire world to enjoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMorningstar brings the power of mobile devices to preparing and playing traditional RPG games. While this change is exciting, it is also challenging. The most significant risks to the project are delays brought about by our commitment to an open design policy. During the initial 12 months of development, our alpha and beta users proved invaluable in improving the game play features of Morningstar. This process produces the highest-quality product. However, it also introduces the possibilities of delays as we incorporate new features for a better overall experience. We have built our development schedule to handle these events, but with over 20,000+ users having tested Morningstar to date, we know that improvements (and the corresponding delays) can come at any time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Trapdoor Technologies\n2 created \u00b7 9 backed\nTrapdoor Technologies is a Boulder, CO-based, software company.

In the end, we believe the fun of roleplaying is storytelling and RPG tools should enhance that experience. \nWe are extremely passionate and we are not going to give up. The adventure will continue albeit at a different pace. Our current plan is to release Morningstar 1.0 focused on the characters, adventures, campaigns, parties and library modules already developed. The initial release will support iOS - with Android and web versions to follow. Pathfinder PRD is the current rule set of choice, although we are exploring other options. While we can't commit to an exact release date, our goal is to release Morningstar 1.0 quickly.

First, we don't really know what we get with the forge, and paying a monthly fee to create adventures isn't really interresting.

Second reason is that Morningstar now looks like to be a Pathfinder tool, and I'm sure it disapointed a lot of fans, me included. Going officially system agnostic would have make Morningstar more than just another PFRD tool. I do understand that you guys plan to include other game systems, but for now it's branded as another d20 thing, and d20 is getting old.

It takes a world you think you\u2019ve read about before and turns it into something new and totally different.\nThis is the finest time to be a tabletop roleplayer since the dawn of the industry. With so many great choices on the market, your imagination has nearly infinite paths for which to choose and expand upon. With the recent release of the newest version of Dungeons & Dragons, players are chomping at the bit to exercise their imaginations and spread their ideas wide. With the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting and future sourcebook line, you can do just that. Seventh Crown is a narrative setting and sourcebook that can be used with the rules found within many popular roleplaying game systems.\nCover of Seventh Crown Setting Book\nWelcome to Seventh Crown\nBased initially within the heavily populated continent of Kanis, Seventh Crown is a setting that places the players in the middle of an epic time of change in a world controlled by a select few. What was once a powerful dwarven empire now stands as broken racial kingdoms not defined by borders or territories, but by the ironclad magical control bestowed upon them by the crowns upon their brow.\nIn Seventh Crown, six golden artifacts of unfathomable power \u2013 the Crowns of Leadership \u2013 give almost ultimate and untested influence over those of the same race. While wearing the Crown, they cannot help but be king or queen of their people. This has led to a world of kingdoms that are not defined on maps or in war rooms, but instead by the blood that runs in a people\u2019s veins. Authority enforced by magic across countless miles creates alliances, enemies and conflicts unlike those found anywhere else. When the reason for going to war is as simple as the will of who wears the Crown and the battlefield could be as complex as anywhere its people tread, life is a complex thing.\nThese six Crowns are the most powerful and important pieces of antiquity found anywhere in this world, and are watched and sought after by most of the people in Kanis. The dealings of the Crowns and the choices made by those who wear them are the talk of every town and city, and entire lifetimes have been spent trying to place a Crown on someone\u2019s head \u2013 or remove the head currently wearing one. Territorial governments, the constabulary, organized crime and other local powerhouses rule their corners of civilization for the most part, but everyone feels the pull of the Crown bearers\u2019 schemes and machinations.\nIt is the rumored existence of a seventh Crown of Leadership, the namesake of the game setting itself, which drives some people to scour the world for the mythic artifact. There have been six ruling forces on Kanis for thousands of years, many of which changing hands (heads?) over and over again, but the fact that there have always been six has been a constant for as long as the Crowns have existed. The discovery and donning of a seventh Crown of Leadership would change the world in an instant\u2026 or the discovery that it has already been found, and by what.\nThe continent of Kanis is large and varied in respect to the peoples that inhabit it, the history they have survived, and all of the interactions in between. Depending on the where someone is from, which King or Queen they serve willingly or otherwise, and how they plan to fill their purses or bellies day to day \u2013 that is where adventure will spring from in Seventh Crown.\nThe Surface of Kanis\nWhat is Different?\nAnyone can read through the newest game system and see what each creature, species or deity means to a \u201cnormal\u201d campaign setting. Seventh Crown takes a lot of these standard ideas found in several rulebooks and turns them into brand new ideas that come together to create a new and unique world where players can portray characters like they never have before. There are plotlines and narrative hooks found within Seventh Crown that will put players in unique new roles as well as give them interactions with the world not commonly possible in other settings.\nJust to give a number of good examples, the following are all samples of what makes Seventh Crown unique, interesting and a great deal of fun in which to roleplay.\nThe current King of the Elves is a sadistic dark elf warlock with the long term plan of breeding out the surface elves by forcing hospitality between the Surface World and the Great Beneath. Over the centuries dark elves have become a much more accepted sight on the surface, and travel to the depths of the Great Beneath is more commonplace despite its inherent dangers.\nThe halfling people suffered massive losses during a horrible war that forced their people into nomadic, extended families that travel Kanis in search of joy, profit and adventure. Their stories and culinary crafts are welcomed almost universally in Kanisi civilization.\nIcon of Vimbre Po; Laughing God of Halfling Nomads\nThe dragonborn of Kanis are primarily mercenaries and seafarers, with those of chromatic heritage leaning toward life as sell swords or pirates; metallic dragonborn finding more favor as professional soldiers and trading corsairs. The two sects of dragonborn are constantly at odds, and many conflicts have begun based solely on \u201cscale color.\u201d\nOne corner of the continent is currently dealing with a large scale guerilla war between the goblinoids and the kobolds, putting some local civilizations in strange circumstances for unlikely social situations and alliances.\nThere is a militant sect within the dwarves that harken to the days when their bloodlines ruled the entire continent as a royal Dynasty. These dwarves are old-minded, somewhat racist toward certain peoples, and belligerently aimed at returning the dwarves to former glory.\nThe gnomes of Kanis are willingly subservient to dwarves and have been for thousands of years. Their acceptance of a lower station in life is a key element to a larger meta-mathematical equation that their ancient scholars believe will finalize with the gnomish people ruling the entire world. Effectively, the gnomes believe they have discovered the formula for complete domination of Kanis; it only requires a few more centuries of servitude to come to fruition.\nAnd much, much more!\nSymbol of Foeslen, God of Thieves and Muggers\nWhat will be in the Seventh Crown core book?\nThe Seventh Crown core book, the goal of this Kickstarter, when published will be a hardcover tome of roughly 150 pages written, designed, illustrated and laid out by industry professionals to create a complete sourcebook for the continent of Kanis and the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting. While it will contain some rules information specific to the Seventh Crown setting, it will NOT include a core system of rules. Instead it relies upon the player(s) to use it alongside obviously compatible rules systems.\nThe Seventh Crown Core Setting Book will include:\nA detailed History of the continent of Kanis, its many Cultures and its current Rulers\nA detailed Pantheon of Kanisi deities, including their effect upon Clerics, Paladins and Druids in Seventh Crown\nA detailed look at the Geography and Civilizations of Kanis\nNew Kanisi Backgrounds, Feats and Spells\nFull Color Unique Illustrations throughout\nFull Color Maps of the Kanis surface world and the subterranean Great Beneath\nNarrative Stories set in the world of Seventh Crown (some starring characters from higher-level Backers!)\nPlot Hooks and Adventure Ideas; including two detailed 1st-level Campaign Starters\nA Glossary of Seventh Crown terms to help with pronunciation and explanation\nWhat do you get for your backing?\nAside from being a part of the launch of a great new game setting, hopefully giving it enough fan backing to begin a full Seventh Crown line of sourcebooks and such in the near future, you faithful backers can get some really awesome rewards for helping us get off the ground!\nThe Copper Piece Level \u2013 For just $2 or more you throw in your attentions to the campaign and help keep the Kickstarter \u201cHot Picks\u201d eyes peeled on our little project here. Not only does this help us out, but it also allows you to ask questions in the Comments section, or purchase some of the additional Add-ons when the campaign succeeds.\nThe Silver Piece Level \u2013 For a $20 campaign pledge, this is just the electronic PDF copy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book, special thanks in the final product and access to purchasing Add-ons.\nThe Electrum Piece Level \u2013 At $35, this is aimed at the normal MSRP of the printed publication and would be considered the \u201caverage\u201d backer level. At this level you will receive not only the electronic PDF copy offered at the Silver Piece level, special thanks in the final product and have access to Add-ons, but you will also receive one printed hardcopy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book.

During these events we will be taking charitable food donations (Canned and sealed-boxed items only) from the players AND bystanders to be given to the local Food Finders Food Bank (http://food-finders.org/) to serve as points of Inspiration to modify the game in progress. The catch is that while the players can donate their food products to play as Inspiration for their own characters during the game, bystanders can donate food products to either help out the Player Characters OR give Inspiration for the rolls made by the DM! No matter who is getting the Inspiration played for them, Food Finders will be the true winners in the event.\nThe Platinum Piece Level \u2013 If you are one of the limited backers at the $100 level, you receive an electronic PDF copy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book, special thanks in the final product, access to Add-ons, all unlocked Stretch Goal Bonus Products, and a printed hardcopy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book signed and personalized by the author and lead artiste.

So, if you want the favorite of your unique and interesting characters to be a part of something official and in the limelight for thousands of readers and players to interact with\u2026 this is the Backer Level for you!\nThe Crown Level \u2013 At $500 and limited to only possibly 8 backers, this is the ultimate backer level. you receive an electronic PDF copy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book, special thanks in the final product, access to Add-ons, all unlocked Stretch Goal Bonus Products, and a printed hardcopy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book signed and personalized by the author and lead artiste. Also, like with the Gold Piece Level, you will not only work with Bryan to have your character immortalized in the pages of the setting\u2026 but also to have it transformed into a physical representation by way of a 30mm scale resin miniature! Perfect for map-based encounters or simply to show off to your fellow gamers, you will work with Bryan to describe the character well enough to have it professionally sculpted and take its place as one of the first products in the Seventh Crown RPG Miniatures line! (Expect some slight delay after regular products ship for the miniatures to be released due to time, talent and resources needed.)\nIMPORTANT NOTE: All shipping costs within the continental USA are included with the backer levels, with additional US shipping showing under each Add-on. For backers/purchasers outside the continental USA, there is an additional $15 shipping charge to handle international postage.\nPre-Miniature \"Green\" for Shrevak, Copper Dragonborn Bosun\nThe Future of Seventh Crown\nOur hopes with this Kickstarter are not just to create a single publication to release Seventh Crown \u2013 we have much, much more in the works for this setting. Should this campaign go well enough to show us a solid fan base in the works, we plan on getting Seventh Crown print runs into common distribution and hopefully into game stores all over the world.\nAdditionally, we have plans to write a series of Seventh Crown setting products that will better flesh out the world, its many plotlines and some major events that take place in the overarching story and expanding world setting.\nSome of the products we have planned are as follows:\nvarious Adventure Modules that cover specific plot arcs important to the Seventh Crown storyline\nBestiary of Kanis Sourcebook; introducing numerous native species of creatures to encounter\nFarsteader\u2019s Atlas Sourcebook; a guide to the lands beyond the primary continent of Kanis\nSeventh Crown novellas surrounding epic events within the world\nEssentially, we want this Kickstarter campaign to go well enough to warrant making Seventh Crown into a larger roleplaying setting capable of launching more products through future Kickstarters and eventually on their own merit. We need your help, support and some good old fashioned word-of-mouth advertising for that to happen!\nAdd-Ons\nThe following are all Add-on products that Seventh Crown backers may purchase using the Campaign Manager Backer Kit.\nSeventh Crown Tee Shirt ($15 and $5 shipping) \u2013 A simple, high quality black tee shirt with the Seventh Crown logo printed upon it.

In a randomly generated world, players assume the role of Microbes and attempt to achieve victory either by proliferation (first to 5 Units) or by eradication (first to eliminate an opposing species).  To do so, every turn  players will make strategic decisions including:\nHunting & Gathering (moving, eating, and/or attacking),\nEvolving (selecting abilities),\nMutating (increasing attributes), and\nSubdividing (cloning for additional lives, options, and as a path to victory). \nMost of the abilities and concepts were derived straight from a microbiology text book, so the game is educational and intuitive, as well as entertaining.\nPLAY\n\nExtra Miniatures:\n1x Miniature*: Add $6.00 each. (Choice - Message Me)\n4x (or more) Miniatures*: Add $5.50 each. (Choice - Message Me)\n*Includes U.S. Shipping if you also pledge for at least one Collectors Edition or Standard Edition copy of Microvores, and you want them shipped together.  Otherwise, if you just want Extra Miniatures, or want them to ship separately (Estimated Delivery is June 2015), please add an additional $6 for U.S. shipping and handling of the Miniatures. \nNote: The Miniatures are too big to use with the Micro-Edition Game Board, but they will work with the Print and Play versions.\n10 Inch Tall Collectible Virus Model Kit:\nAdd $65.00 each.(Includes US Shipping - Ships Separately from other rewards). Estimated Delivery is Feb. 2015. \nThis is for an unpainted and unassembled Virus Model Kit (with Instructions) cast with Smooth Cast 300.\nSculptor's Recommendations: Soapy wash to remove casting release spray, dry, assemble with super glue (or epoxy), let dry, grey prime, let dry, and then paint with enamel or acrylic paints.\n www.facebook.com/WendigoPublishing (\"LIKE\" it STRETCH GOAL)\nhttp://www.microvores.com/Microvores.html\nA PDF of the Rules can be downloaded at the link above. \nWhy only a $3,500 Goal?\nWhy Limited Quantities?\nWhy quick Estimated Delivery Times?\nUnlike many games on Kickstarter, we will actually be \"self-manufacturing\" copies of Microvores in the United States rather than overseas.\nWe will be using the patented system, Insert Imagination (TM), in order to do our self-manufacturing.Insert Imagination allows us to essentially \"print on demand,\" so there is no huge minimum order required (1,500 to 2,500 copies), which is usually the reason other games on Kickstarter have much higher funding goals (usually in the $15,000 to $40,000 range).As such, we are able to set our funding goal at only $3,500 which will allow us to take advantage of economics of scale in acquiring our materials.\nRemember, as you start acquiring your Insert Imagination (TM) components, they will be re-usable towards other Insert Imagination compatible games.  Ideally, you will be able to purchase print and play versions of such games, print the media, and then insert such media into your Insert Imagination components to quickly and easily assemble a physical copy of the game. \nPlease check out www.InsertImagination.net for more information and additional components available for purchase.\nTraditional overseas manufacturing usually takes at least 90 days to turn around a production order before the product is even ready to begin distribution to backers.However, since we are self-manufacturing domestically in the United States, we will be able to deliver our games much sooner.\nThat said, our games will be produced in smaller batches and distributed as they are completed.To be conservative and not to over-extended our production capabilities, we have limited the quantity for each production batch to 50 copies per edition for a particular Estimated Delivery Time.As reward level quantities are exhausted, we will simply add another identical reward level, and merely adjust the Estimated Delivery Time.For example, once the Standard Edition 50 Quantity is exhausted for Estimated Delivery of January 2015, we would add another Standard Edition 50 Quantity Reward Level with an Estimated Delivery of February 2015, and so on.Of course we don't want to overpromise, but we will make every effort to deliver our first batch of Standard Edition in December 2014.\nEssentially, the earlier you order, the sooner you will receive your copy of Microvores.\nOne exception though is for our Collectors Edition of Microvores.Since it contains miniatures produced by a third party, we have to allow for their production time.\nAS Seen on Fox35 Orlando's News:\nhttp://www.myfoxorlando.com/clip/10899500/microvores-a-game-of-parasites\nAs seen on the Dice Tower 2014 Convention Coverage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZApNogJWcBA\nAs seen on The Meeple Mechanic's Foxhole Fiver by Daniel Zayas:\nhttp://meeplemechanic.com/foxhole-fiver/brian-fiore/\nAs seen on The Vacuous Grimoire blog by Brian Berg:\nhttp://www.vacuous-grimoire.com/2014/11/why-kickstarter-is-so-important-and.html\nAs seen on the Table for Two Show:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDGk2RO3Yqs\nAs seen on the King One Eye Blog:\nhttp://king1eye.blogspot.com/2014/07/dice-tower-game-on.html", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter which means we have already successfully navigated the Kickstarter process and met our funding goal once before.

As such, this project is more involved and has different risks and challenges than our first. The most probable risk involves delays in distribution of the reward levels due to suppliers delivering their products in an untimely fashion. Additionally, there is the ever present risk of market price fluctuation between now and fulfillment. Much of the market risk, however, will be mitigated by our limiting reward level quantities to 50 at a time. Close monitoring of market prices will allow us to make adjustments as necessary to avoid disruption in reward fulfillment. \n\nMoreover, there are also the normal boiler plate risks which include, but are not limited to: Acts of God, Natural Disasters, Acts of Terrorism, War, Political Revolution, and injury or death of key persons (Me - Yikes) associated with this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "(New Game Launch) Christmas Tree: The Decorating", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Collector Editions Have Shipped!", "update_content": "The minis have arrived!We are putting together the Collector Edition copies now!I will be sending out the last backer survey to get your latest address too, so stay tuned!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Production of Collector Editions is Underway!", "update_content": "Hello Everyone.I have been busy producing and shipping out the Micro-Edition Copies of Microvores.If you backed for Micro-Edition copies of Microvores, please check your email for USPS tracking numbers (and your mail boxes this week).Also check out our production album on our FB page:https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1587687564778006.1073741832.1428792127334218&type=1\nNow, we are working on producing the Collector Editions, and of course waiting on the Miniatures.Will keep you updated.Thanks!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Micro Editions: Produced and Shipping Out.", "update_content": " https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1570405219839574.1073741831.1428792127334218&type=1\nSee the process; click the link above.

The world of Relistan came to life in the form of a 256 page 8 \u00bd\u201d x 11\u201d hardcover book full of wondrous locations, amazing magic, character options, and legends from the ancient past. Two full printings of the campaign sold out as gamers around the world began to delve into the Realms of Twilight, but that was just the beginning.\nThe Twilight Wood\nNow we are gearing up for another print run, but trying to raise funds just to re-print something that already exists would be a little... underwhelming, so we decided to rebuild the world we love entirely! Delving deeper into its mysteries, detailing new areas, and giving it a fresh face by updating almost every art piece in the book. There will be statistics blocks of every settlement as an aid to Game Masters, new playable races for player characters, increased magical repertoires, numerous alchemical recipes for combat alchemists, and so much more!\nTo accomplish these lofty pursuits we've pulled together a great team of gamers with the skills we need to pull it off.\nThe original author Daniel Marshall has begun adding material (in both the fluff and crunch categories) alongside his incredible partner in creativity, BJ Hensley!\nAs an added bonus the amazingly talented Ed Greenwood has agreed to contribute a tale of his own and brand new location to be included in the revised print!\nA professional editor is reviewing the book in its entirety and giving it a level of polish it has not yet seen!\nJocelyn Sarvida has already updated several art pieces and the talented Jen Page is working on the cover art for our Kickstarter exclusive adventure Winter's Queen.\nOur cartographer, also Jen Page, has started to shed some light on the shadowed lands with a new rendition of the world and continent maps.\nOther artists are preparing their pallets and sharpening their incredible talent as well!\nYou can see many of the latest art reveals on our Facebook page and download a sample of the new book here. Or check out the the podcast about the Realms of Twilight project from our friends at THE ESTABLiSHED FACTS! \nMore amazing artwork from Jocelyn Sarvida!\nWe've budgeted for approximately 50 additional pages of content, and there is little doubt that we can fill that space, and more, with character options, creatures, tales, and regional detailing.  Here are some of the additions you can expect to see in the new book:\nAt least 2 new player races (one decided by the backers of this kickstarter!)\nSettlement Statistics Blocks for over 30 cities and nations!\nAdditional area details for many places across the world.\nAt least 1 new monster for Game Masters to use and players to fear.\nMore illumination on the settings epic history, giving GMs and players alike numerous possibilities for adventures to come. \nAt least 2 new tales (one written by Ed Greenwood)\nRedesigned artwork as well as all new pieces in full color by Jen Page, Jocelyn Sarvida and more!\nA dozen new spells and alchemical mixtures for casters and alchemists!\nAnd so much more is possible!\nThe full sample is available on DrivethruRPG!\n Plus all the amazing content that\u2019s already there revised and re calibrated!\n5 continents\nOver 80 locations of interest including cities, nations, oceans, and landmarks.\n1 Base class, The Combat Alchemist\n6 Prestige Classes\n4 new player races\n9 pages of feats, including crafting and background feats\n10 pages of new spells\nMore than 30 regional deities organized by pantheon\n9 new monsters\n9 legends detailing remarkable periods of the world's incredible history\nNew Map Concept by Jen Page\n-- Excerpts from G*M*S Magazine's review of the original campaign setting:\n\"Chapter 10 offers us new equipment and magic (34 pages). We get two new materials, Umbristine and Waterwood, with the former being a shadow-related metal mined via both alchemy and conventional techniques by the Umbral and the latter being wood that is infused with the power of elemental water. \nOn the conventional side of weapons, a new monk weapon is introduced that actually doubles as a music instrument, while alchemists get their own pouch and everyone who loves throwing daggers gets a cool harness that works as a substitute for the quick draw-feat for the 6 throwing daggers it can hold. Nice idea.\n After that, we get a plethora of alchemical mixtures for the new combat alchemist class \u2013 dusts, grenades, oils, potions, salves and vapors. At least one of a kind for each level is provided.\n Clerics also get some love in the form of 7 new domains: Endurance, Ice, Pain, Pestilence, Shadowborn, Spirit and Undead. I especially liked the shadowborn domain \u2013 individual domains for deities rock.\nWe of course also get new spells, 23 to be precise \u2013 the spells are quite nice and I didn\u2019t consider any to be problematic.\nChapter 11 (25 pages) features a lot of different new gods for the pantheons of Relistan \u2013 The deity-write-ups contain information on relationships with other deities \u2013 great idea that should be standard!\"\nNew cover by Jocelyn Sarvida\nAll of the building blocks are in the right place, all of the materials gathered, the labor has already commenced, and we're so excited we've already started on stretch goals! The newly updated and edited Realms of Twilight Campaign Setting has the potential to aid gamers around the world in crafting their own stories and legends in this shadowy realm of eternal night, and with the support of our fellow gamers (that\u2019s you!) we can pull out the parchment and quills and begin re-writing this already remarkable setting, giving you a wondrous foundation for limitless hours of adventure to come.   \nNew player character race: The Sai-Heth!\nAside from the visually stunning campaign setting, here are a few bonus items you can earn by backing our Kickstarter!\nWinter's Queen PDF\nAlong with the revisions and improvements in the campaign setting itself, we will be putting together a KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE PREQUEL ADVENTURE just for our backers! Have you ever wanted to help shape the paths of the adventures you and other players throughout the world are experiencing? Perhaps you have wondered what it would be like to visit the events that led to the current age. Or to see for yourselves the truth or deceit written in the history books. Here is your chance to do just that! \nWinter's Queen, set 1,000 years before the upcoming adventure path begins, will be designed around one of the most important events in the path\u2019s history. Everyone who purchases the prequel will have a chance to participate in not only the events of history, but to shape the future of upcoming adventures as well. We will be creating a special forum on our website (accessible only by those who have earned access to the prequel). There we will discuss how events played out for your adventuring party, who lived, who died, and the results of your party\u2019s actions. All of that information will be collected and used to help shape the course our adventure path will take!\nThe Malefactor Base Class\nThe Malefactor is a new sourcebook available for most backer levels as bonus content for this Kickstarter!  Produced by TPK Games this fun PDF features a class designed around taking the reigns of unfortunate Fates and learning to command and manipulate the destructive spirits that have haunted them since birth! \nHorsemen PDF\nOur friends the Four Horsemen will be crafting special content to be released as a PDF for our Kickstarter!  What is included will depend on whether or not you are a player or a GM, and the contents will be decided by general discussion on our Facebook page! \nClaws of Pelazin (Print & PDF)\nAn adventure designed for four to six characters of 1st to 3rd level. For more than a decade the small village of Kuras has survived on the borders of the Trackless Jungle. They grew their crops and tended their livestock in peace, trusting that their annual sacrifice to the jungle deity, Pelazin, would protect them from the dangers that inhabit the wilds so near to their homes. But something has changed. Citizens are dying, murdered in the darkness. Is it the wrath of a jungle god, unsatisfied with their recent sacrifice or a sadistic murderer praying on the residents of this small village? Perhaps the source is something else entirely. The characters must delve into the depths of this mystery and determine the truth before more innocent blood is shed upon the farmlands of Kuras.  See a review here!\nLycan's Bane (Print & PDF)\nAn adventure designed for four to six characters of 5th-7th level.  The tensions between the Illurian Empire and the nature worshipping nation of Valin are high, and growing with every cycle of the moons. The lycanthropes of Valin grow stronger as the red moon Alhara begins to rise and an attack is eminent, Illurian commanders are certain of it. Now, the mages of the Empire have created a weapon to rob the Valinites of the their strength. This weapon, the Lycan's Bane, must be couriered to the border, but Valinite spies are everywhere. Its power prevents it from being transported by the arts of magic, and all military action is being watched. This responsibility now falls on the player characters, to do with as they will.\nCustom Adventure\nA special few backers will garner the right for Silver Crescent Publishing to craft a custom adventure for YOUR OWN gaming group!  You will get to choose the location, theme, and style of the adventure, and perhaps even major NPCs that play a key role in the adventure itself!

( For more in depth descriptions of all our extras see the content beneath stretch goals)\nThe largest part of the budget that we're requesting is to cover printing costs. We want to be able to produce a high quality product printed in full color. Our Facebook page shows some of the new artwork already completed by Jocelyn Sarvida and a new map by Jen Page. To put those wondrous pieces in black and white would be nothing short of a crime and with new artwork comes the cost of paying our artists. We also budgeted for a professional editing of an estimated 300 pages of text and the shipping of physical rewards, as well as the fees charged by Kickstarter and Amazon of course. In support of this awesome setting, the writers are donating their time and passion to its success!  For an easy approximate breakdown: 65% for printing, 20% artwork, 5% to cover shipping of physical rewards, 10% fees.\n Summaries of each reward follow the spectacular graphics!\nWarm Fuzzies!!\nYour

SCP team as only the Twilight Dragon deserves for your generous contribution\nRibbon Dancer and Shadow Weaver Archetypes ($13,000) Locked The performer twirled and leapt, her lithe form intertwining with two flaming streamers in a sensual dance of unity. Blazing ribbons teasingly caressed her bronzed flesh, drawing gasps of amazement from the audience before her. The flames embraced her frame, yet did not burn, for the element came from within. Toned muscles in calves and thighs rippled and tightened as she moved to the intricate steps of her own design. A complete blending of element and woman, fire and flesh in perfect harmony with one another.\nImagine this being you, conquering the elements of fire or ice, earth or wind, taming them in an artistic and beautiful dance of the elements, understanding them so completely that they can also be deadly and dangerous to your foes. This is the Elemental Ribbon Dancer\u2026  \nThe Elemental Dancer is a series of four archetypes for the bard core class that focus on performances centering around intricate dance skills as well as the art of infusing those routines with the power of the elements, creating a beautiful and dangerous fighting style. Each archetype will focus on one particular element, and the abilities and spells will be drawn from its nature.\nNow clear your mind, wiping away all but the black field of your mind\u2019s vision and the scarce hint of light illuminating just enough for your imagination to play tricks with your sight and senses. From that darkness, wisps of iridescent shadow begin to slowly glide in your direction and you can feel the arcane power rising as the dusky tendrils come together and coalesce into a dim figure. It is a man, a mage cloaked in the shadows of his art. They are his weapons, and his armor. He calls upon the night and creatures from the plane between mortal realms answer to his whim. Suddenly, with a grim smile, he pulls the very fabric of shadows around himself and is gone once more leaving you cold, shaken, and battling with your own dark imaginings\u2026  \nThe Shadow Weaver is an archetype for the Wizard core class that focuses on the use and manipulation of darkness and shadows as both tools and weapons. It includes many of the shadow-related illusion spells in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook, but is far from limited to such incantations. Among other things the weaver can reach into the Plane of Shadow, and pull upon its very essence to fuel his spells and call forth aid.\nHero Lab Data File Locked\nAnyone contributing at the Respected Peasant level or higher will receive a Hero Lab data file for the campaign setting, including all of the character options, monsters, deities and spells from the book.\nShadow Magic Locked\nIt began with the Shadow Weaver, and now the shadow's reach will continue to encompass ever more with a new chapter dedicated to Shadow Magic! New shadow spells will be added to the Campaign Setting, as well as character options, to include optional character abilities, feats and more!\nTournament of Souls PDF Locked\nThe annual Tournament of Souls is a contest in which creators from across the Illurian Empire craft undead creatures and constucts in order to pit them against one another in single combat, until only one remains.  This year's competition was fierce!  For this stretch goal we will assemble a PDF of the terrain maps in which the combatants fought, statistics for the creatures (and perhaps some of the Creators as well) and the transcripts of each incredible battle!  We may even throw in a few additional surprises just for fun!\nPrint edition of Winter's Queen Locked  \nFor those of you who have achieved the rank of Illurian City Mage or higher, you are already able to experience the prequel adventure and exclusive forum access; reaching this stretch goal allows us to expand that experience significantly. Those who would normally receive only a PDF copy of the prequel to our upcoming adventure path will instead receive a full-color print of the adventure. Additionally, the PDF will be provided to anyone that has joined the church of Steelight (as a Cleric of Steelight) or attained a higher rank in Illurian Society. All of those in this group will now receive exclusive access to a section of our forums specifically set up to allow us to hear about your groups\u2019 trials and experiences as you fight through this adventure, and use that information to shape the adventure path itself as we look forward.\nWarm Fuzzy!: A feeling of warmth and good cheer for supporting fellow gamers in pursuit of something incredible.\nInclusion on the Backer List: There will be various sections on our list of gracious backers.

We will also take you out to dinner at the finest place in town so we can tell you all manner of positive things that you may never have known about you!  (go ahead, BE the Twilight Dragon, your ego is calling!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery publishing project risks delays as deadlines approach. Writers are scrambling to ensure they have all of their tasks completed even as the editors are being overwhelmed by what they've accomplished already. Artists paint amazing tapestries of color\u2026 that can sometimes turn out to be not at all what they were intended to be, while the layout guy is begging everyone to get everything in order so they can begin the final design of the book. We have already tried to address as many of these potential issues as possible, even before the Kickstarter began, by starting early. This isn't just a concept, or a rough idea, the ground work is already there, established by coordination and team work, and the rest is in process as we type. Here is what we have accomplished so far:\n\nOur artists began the daunting task of re-imagining the world and showing it to the rest of us more than 8 months ago. This should give them a good head start on deadlines, and compensate for snags that may occur when we get closer to final production.\n\nNow we turn to the literary aspects, including game mechanics and player options as well as flavor, legends and locations. Some of the writer\u2019s new content has already been completed and is in the hands of our editor. Though there is more yet to be done, this too should give us some breathing room if the writing falls behind schedule.\n\nFinally we address the polishing steps, namely editing and layout. As we mentioned previously, much of the editing work is already underway and the author and editor are working closely to hammer out language inconsistencies and the flow of the text. Our layout specialist is very nearly done creating templates that will make pulling all of the additional content together, and blending it with the newly edited revision of what previously existed, a much faster process.\n\nWe have tried to examine each aspect of production, and set each specialist on the path to completion well before the Kickstarter began. By doing this, we hope to ensure that we meet our deadlines despite any unforeseen complications we may encounter, and get the Realms completed and in the hands of our backers in a timely manner.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Silver Crescent Publishing\n2 created \u00b7 55 backed"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "With stalwart perseverance...

The Cross of Fire Saga adventure path is the first adventure path for Obsidian Apocalypse, which was released in 2013, as the premiere setting for the post-apocalyptic survival horror genre for Pathfinder. The reason that we are having this Kickstarter project is to generate the funds we need to pay for the cost of development, writing, artwork and printing this adventure path and getting it out to the premiere retail gaming stores.\nThe Cross of Fire Saga Adventure Path Contributors:\nSteven T. Helt (Developer, Paizo\u2019s 2013 RPG Superstar & Tears at Bitter Manor)\nVictoria Jaczko (Paizo's RPG Superstar 2014)\nJeff Lee (Deep Magic, NeoExodus: A House Divided & Obsidian Apocalypse)\nScott Fernandez (RPG Superstar 2013 Top 4 contestant)\nStephen Rowe (Rogue Genius Guide to Gruesome Giants, Construct Companion, Flesh Golem Variants)\nDan Dillon (Rogue Genius Guide to Gruesome Giants, Construct Companion, Flesh Golem Variants)\nAnd many more!!!\nThis project is Steven T Helt\u2019s first as full developer, and published by Louis Porter, Jr. Games. Louis Porter, Jr. is a pioneer among third party publishers, having released more than 600 RPG products in print and PDF over the last 15 years. Louis Porter, Jr. is no stranger to delivering timely products to his loyal Kickstarter backers. He\u2019s produced material for backers of the Obsidian Apocalypse setting\nWhat is the next threshold goals with this kickstarter:\nThe Cross of Fire Saga adventure path consists of the following adventures:\nPart 0: Long Way Home - Estimated Page Count: 8 Pages\nHURLED INTO ENDLESS NIGHT\nSeeking potent magic in the hands of an insane entity, accomplished adventurers find themselves transported to the bleak wasteland of Abaddon. As they explore their new surroundings, they must encounter a host of new terrors and determine whether to save a desperate caravan of nomads. Can adventurers save them, and can their weary new allies help them find a reliable way home?\nThe Long Way Home is an adventure for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The story and encounters are the first episode of the Cross of Fire Saga, but can also be played as a stand\u00adalone adventure with light modification. The module includes a brief history of the Cross of Fire, an introduction to the world of Abaddon, and a powerful new curse. Characters should take up the adventure approximately half\u00adway through 8th level. If they survive their first nights on Abaddon, they should reach 9th level by the adventure\u2019s conclusion.\nWho is Cassandra Papacis? More importantly....can she be trusted?\nPart 1: Havoc of the Mind\u2019s Eye  - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages\nBLOOD AND TERROR AWAIT\nNothing is as it seems in the blasted countryside surrounding the insular fortress\u00adtown of Lockgate. For weeks, the people there \u00ad\u00adlocals and outsiders alike\u00ad \u00adhave been terrorized by a creature they only know as the Beast. It strikes fast and vanishes, leaving behind mutilated corpses to find. The town\u2019s lord has issued a reward for the death of the beast and a band of monster hunters have answered. The seer traveling with the PCs leads them straight into the heart of this mystery where it becomes quickly evident there is more at work than a simple ravaging monster. Can the PCs unearth the true source of Lockgate\u2019s horror?\n\nHavoc of the Mind\u2019s Eye is an investigative horror adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The scenario is designed for four 9th level PCs, and is suitable as a single horror tale or as the second episode of the Cross of Fire Saga. By the end of the adventure, the PCs will either die screaming or reach 10th level.\n\nPart 2: Ravagers of the Shadow Black - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages \nFALL TO SHADOWS\nTwo lost Osirian civilizations fell deep within the earth during the Cataclysm. They struggle to survive at the expense of fey calling the subterranean tunnels home. When a strange plague of poisoned light corrupts the land, the desperate people starve and turn upon one another. Can a small group of heroes return the peace and cleanse the blight, or are they doomed to die in the lands of endless shadow?\nRavagers of the Shadowfall is an adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It can be played as a unique scenario for 10th level characters, or as the third episode of the Cross of Fire Saga. The adventure includes 32 action\u00adpacked pages filled with dark artifacts, gremlins, survivalist adventuring, and a challenging new underground setting! Players can expect to reach 12th level or a shallow grave by the time they complete this adventure. \nWill the PCs be pawns in Baltazar's deadly game?\nPart 3: Raiders of the Cataclysm - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages \nAS BELOW, SO ABOVE  \n\nHigh atop the Amaranth Glacier lie the ruins of long\u00ad abandoned Qhazlor . A band of sorely tested travelers seeks a unique path home, away from the strange mountains and salted valleys of Abaddon. Equipped with half of the ancient tools they need to escape this hell on earth, they encounter another party much like themselves. The adventurers must survive on the harsh plateau long enough to overcome a wrecked band of crosstraders who also seek a way home, or convince them to share the power that they themselves are only beginning to understand.\n\nRaiders of the Cataclysm is a scenario for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and the penultimate adventure in the Cross of Fire Saga. It includes several dangerous encounters, a description of the mutinous crew of the Endurance, and a pair of climactic battles that will test the PCs\u2019 outer limits. Those who survive are likely to reach 14th level.\n\nIs this kaylethon mercenary friend? or foe?\nPart 4: Crusaders of the Cross of Fire - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages\nLEAVE ALL HOPE OUTSIDE\n\nArmed with four mighty relics, a beleaguered band of adventurers arrives at the doors to a place known only as the Crucible\u2014an abandoned adamantine mine once worked by disciplined, benevolent monks. None doubt that terror and death wait within, but the path home requires the PCs to take up sword and spell once more and face the dark truth concealed within an ancient monastery. Who can withstand the shocking truth, or the vessels of evil that lay it bare?\n\nCrusaders of the Cross of Fire concludes the disturbing story of the Cross of Fire Saga. Within its pages are more than a dozen traps, haunts, and monstrous encounters devised with the express intent of keeping the PCs\u2019 corpses trapped within the Crucible forever. Though the depraved powers will more than likely claim their souls, characters who survive should reach 15th level before the final encounters.\n\nThis man saved the world from a tyrant once. Will you pay the price he requires to return home?\nThe Cross of Fire itself!\nBackground: Since 2000, the d20 System gaming license and the Open Game License (OGL) have allowed publishers to share a common framework for creating roleplaying games using the System Reference Document (SRD), which contains the same core mechanics as those found in Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition. Under the OGL, third-party publishers use the SRD as the basis of many different games. Paizo Publishing expanded the concept of the OGL with their creation and development of the Pathfinder Resource Document (PRD), and in turn made a successful open gaming system.\nPatronage and Funding: Our project initially funds at the $8,000 level. We intend to achieve this goal in a little over 40 days\u2014from 25 September to 4 November. This amount covers the costs to write and produce the product for the backers, and gives us a head start on backing the retail level. Of course, the project is impossible without our backers, so backer levels allow an impressive amount of retail product for much less than the expected retail cost for the adventures and their support product.\n\nProcesses: Louis Porter Jr has produced fantasy roleplaying games and support for those games for 15 years. Our commitment to our backers, in addition to high quality and impressive value, is to have the materials we publish to you finished and shipped on time. We are grateful for our backers and will continue our commitment to timely delivery of a unique professional product.\n\nThe Pathfinder community has loyal fans and creative designers. Backers at certain levels earn the right to also submit professional designs for publication in an advanced stretch goal. Becoming a patron on this project is a great way to gain a design credit on the book, which in turn is a great way to gain experience and build a resume for those interested in pursuing a career in game publishing!\n\nWhat are you backing?The funds form the kickstarter campaign allow us to produce high-quality professional products, including materials to provide to retail vendors. At the successful funding level of $8,000, each backer receives the product their backer level implies, but the funds only pay for the printing of the first adventure. Beyond that point, the addition of several exciting stretch goals allow us to finance the retail expense for the remaining products.\n\nWhere is the money going?\n Back it for a Buck (B4$) Challenge\nAre you a fan of LPJ Design and want to see this kickstarter succeed?

Production is all ready to go. All we need now is the funding. The decals will also reflect these same images and will be four inch in diameter and will be weather resistant. These are all ready for production. Now all we need is the help of the great gaming community!\nDice III\nOur goal is $1,500.00 to produce all of the pins and stickers. We are also offering some great stretch goals in an attempt to make this design truly pop as an accessory.\nStretch Goal - $4,000.00 - We will convert the design into a bronze set of pins.  \nStretch Goal - $6,000 - We will convert the pin series into a gold set of pins.  \nStretch Goal - 8,000 - We will convert the pin series into a gold set of pins and will encrust it with red ruby rhinestones.  \nOur campaign lasts for 14 days so the quicker we get the word out the better.

MERCENARIES. \nCoin is their master, and their trade, more often than not, is blood. Something about these nefarious types appeals to the fantasy reader. Perhaps it is that they have abandoned the moral set that dictates what is socially acceptable in our world. In these tales, we live vicariously, intrepidly, and by our blades or our wits or a culmination of both to some degree. These are BLACKGUARDS.\nWhat we at RAGNAROK PUBLICATIONS want to do is offer a premium collection of 20+ short stories by popular writers set in the worlds of their own making. The authors we've enlisted are all known for writing some roguish types in their respective series, and here we will be illuminating them just a bit more by dusky moonlight. We have Michael J. Sullivan's RIYRIA, Carol Berg's DUST AND LIGHT, David Dalglish's world of DEZREL where his SHADOWDANCE series is set, Mark Lawrence's BROKEN EMPIRE, and many more.\nThe great news is that I already have the first drafts of these stories in hand! And, even better, Ragnarok has already fronted some of the coin to pay for the cover art, so what we're seeking is the backing to pay the authors the professional rate they deserve\u2014that being the SFWA-suggested 7 cents per word\u2014and cover all the various costs of production and printing. We've produced a similar project before when we successfully funded and fulfilled the KAIJU RISING: AGE OF MONSTERS anthology, and the authors listed below have put their faith in us. We truly hope you will do the same!\nThe cover seen above is the actual cover, illustrated by concept artist ARMAN AKOPIAN, whose work you've likely seen on Square Enix and Eidos Montreal's THIEF Video Game.\nOn the inside, you will find a tour de force of authors known for penning tales of rogues in every lash scars and scab-red color:\nCAROL BERG, \"Seeds\"  \nRICHARD LEE BYERS, \"Troll Trouble\" \nDAVID DALGLISH, \"Take You Home\" \nJAMES ENGE, \"Thieves at the Gate\" \nJOHN GWYNNE, \"Better to Live than to Die\" \nLIAN HEARN, \"His Kikuta Hands\" \nSNORRI KRISTJANSSON, \"A Kingdom and a Horse\" \nJOSEPH LALLO, \"Seeking the Shadow\" \nMARK LAWRENCE, \"The Secret\" \nTIM MARQUITZ, \"A Taste of Agony\" \nPETER ORULLIAN, \"A Length of Cherrywood\" \nCAT RAMBO, \"The Subtler Art\" \nLAURA RESNICK, \"Friendship\" \nMARK SMYLIE, \"Manhunt\" \nKENNY SOWARD, \"Jancy's Justice\" \nSHAWN SPEAKMAN, \"The White Rose Thief\" \nJON SPRUNK, \"Sun and Steel\" \nANTON STROUT, \"Scream\" \nMICHAEL J.

Everyone listed has already contributed their tale. We've also paid the cover artist, so he's taken care of and we have World rights secured for everything. \n\nAdditionally, we went through the bulk of our growing pains during the production phase of a previous crowdfunded campaign, so we have contacts, accounts, and resources in place now to make a smooth transition from funding to fulfillment\u2014that means a much smaller delay in getting the book in your hands.\n\nThe only setbacks I foresee on my end would be unexpected health issues or some unforeseen act of theft or disaster.

Enjoy the streamlined, easy-to-learn rules. Create epic heroes limited only by your imagination.\nWhat is Ingenium?\nIngenium is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game. It has a culturally-rich setting, a simple set of rules, and an emphasis on telling great stories with your friends.\nArtwork by Eric Lofgren\nWhat makes it different?\nIt uses a simple \"Three Word\" mechanic to create characters, weapons, armor, and spells. That, combined with the freeform \"Talent\" progression system, lets you create the kind of hero you want to play without spending ages poring over rules.\nThe core mechanic is a simple matter of rolling a ten-sided die, adding some modifiers, and comparing to either a target number or an opposed roll.\nAll of the standard dice, excepting twenty-siders, are used in the game.\nWhat changed in the new edition?\nIngenium Second Edition is the culmination of three years of tweaking and experimenting with the Ingenium fantasy role-playing game. The \"Three Words\" character creation system that proved so popular has been expanded into equipment and spellcasting.\nWe added the Eiridia setting, which is a culturally-diverse world inspired by Robert E. Howard's Hyborea, J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, and Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar.\nWe added new professions and races, and tweaked the rules of character creation to make them easier to understand and more fun to play.\nA Myconid, one of the new races, by Johnnie Johnson\nWe incorporated three years of player feedback. The system is more balanced, cleaner, and even more polished than before.\nAnd the book is much bigger than it was before. With all the new content, the book is pushing 160 pages - and that's without artwork. We're looking at a 200 page book with all of the artwork we hope to include, which is TWICE the size of the original edition!\nWhy Kickstart a Second Edition?\nOne of the biggest issues people had with the first edition wasn't the game itself, but rather the lack of artwork. With such a unique and interesting game world, it was sometimes difficult to envision all of the awesome new concepts.\nWe want to fix that. We want to fix that in a BIG way.\nSo we need your help. We have a number of fantastic artists already signed up to fill the book with amazing artwork. The cost of artwork, though, is huge. We need forty pages of it, and that's not cheap.\nThis Kickstarter is more important than just getting artwork for the book, though. This Kickstarter will help us actually get into retail stores, something that up until now has been impossible due to our finances. See, we're entirely self-financed - we're strongly against taking out debt to fund the company, so our year-after-year growth as a company has been purely a result of profits going back into the company. Those profits are thanks to our awesome customers, and we couldn't have done this without you.\nSo, we're asking for just a bit of assistance to push past that final hurdle and break into the big leagues.\nTake a look\nWe have a special Quick Start guide that we pared down to 90 pages that is available exclusively at DriveThru RPG. It is a rough document but it will give you a good look at what is in the book mechanically!  Rules, spells, gear, and a free adventure await inside!  Go get it and see why we would love if you'd back this project!\n\nhttp://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/129064\nOK, so what are the rewards?\nWe wanted to do something really special for this Kickstarter. Most Kickstarted RPGs are content to just give backers the book that will eventually be in stores. We're going a couple steps further. Not only will every copy be signed by the author of Ingenium, but this is a special Kickstarter-ONLY version of the game. The unique cover will set your copy apart from the regular retail version - forever.\nPossible Kickstarter-only version cover design. Not final!\nWe are producing a set of Ingenium t-shirts that are also unique to this Kickstarter, and are not the same as the general-release Ingenium shirts we'll be offering later this year.\nOur generous backers helped us produce custom-etched Silver Gryphon Games dice in an earlier Kickstarter, and as an extra bonus, we'll be including FULL SETS of them for some of the pledge levels.\nThe talented Alyssa Faden, our cartographer, is producing a gorgeous full-color world map for the Eiridia setting. Some pledge levels will receive an enormous 3 foot by 2 foot poster of the map printed on high quality paper.\nAn example of cartography by Alyssa Faden\nFor the extremely generous backers, we have a very special reward - the ability to make a permanent mark on the Eiridia world with your very own deity added to the pantheon! We'll work with you to craft him, her, or it, and get artwork done for it that we'll put on a poster just for you and no one else.\nThose who pledge at that level also get access to the Ingenium Patrons' Circle, a web forum that only a very small group of people have access to. Members of the Circle will get input into future Ingenium products and sneak peaks at content as it's being worked on.\nMini-goals\nWe have the main goal, and that's fantastic, but part of participating in a Kickstarter is not only making our dream happen, but having a hand in guiding the project yourself! In that spirit, we are adding mini-goals to the Kickstarter.\nEvery Thousand Dollars...\nStarting at $2000, every thousand dollars that the Kickstarter achieves, we will add a new material for weapon and armor construction. Those are all listed below and are being added to the rule book as we hit them!\nAchieved April 24th!\nAchieved May 7th!\nAchieved May 7th!\nAchieved May 9th!\n Every 10 Backers...\nStarting at 70, every 10 backers that support us, we will add a new Miracle or Ritual to the spell list! These are incredibly powerful spells that cannot be constructed with the Three Word system used for standard spells!\nAchieved April 25th!\nAchieved April 27th!\nAchieved May 3rd!\nAchieved May 7th!\nHow about stretch goals?\nWe have some great stretch goals in mind. We're only going to show you the first two unless we reach them both, though!\nIf we reach $15,000, we'll add the Rune Magic system to the game. This system adds an additional level of customization to the game and another 20 pages of content!\nIf we hit $25,000, we'll make the entire book full color. That's right - ALL of the artwork will be beautiful color paintings!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risk is that all of the artists who've signed on to do artwork for the book back out. We've mitigated that by cultivating a large pool of artists over the years who consistently do good work on time and on budget. \n\nIn the absolute worst case scenario, where NONE of our artists can finish the project on time, then we will need to reach out into our (extensive) network and find new artists. This will delay the project by no more than three months at the most.\n\nAnother risk is if something happens to Ben Overmyer, the author/layout artist, that prevents him from finishing the layout and post-production work. In that event, co-founder of Silver Gryphon Games Kevin Rohan can finish the project. This shouldn't have an appreciable impact on delivery.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Silver Gryphon Games\n3 created \u00b7 14 backed\nSilver Gryphon Games started as a collaborative effort between Ben Overmyer and Kevin Rohan when both lived in Brookings, South Dakota.

The base RPG is compatible with Pathfinder, 13th Age, Fate, and Castles and Crusades (SIEGE)!\n* 11 new races and 11 new classes.\n* Combat tracking and character sheets ready to be copied...everything you need to start!\n* A starting adventure to let you jump right in and start playing.\n* A short story written by Richard Lee Byers based on the iconic Fall of Man characters on the cover!\nWhen the world was to end, inexplicably, it did not.\nThe year is 2061, 30 years since the meteor known as Satan\u2019s Maul slammed into the Atlantic Ocean, causing what scientists predicted should have been an extinction level event.\nHowever, Earth had ties beyond those known to man. When all our technology had failed us and our world was being torn asunder, it was magic which stitched and scabbed the world whole again. Today technology and magic fight a silent war for domination; the One God of Earth battles the many gods of Gothos; the magic world merged with earth to sustain it and humans fight for survival in a world now infested with orcs, dragons, elves and even more nightmarish creations.\nWelcome to the Fall of Man.\nClasses:\nIn Fall of Man there are 11 core (starting) classes to choose from that advance through 20th level. Each has its own unique set of skills and abilities.\nArcanist (ARC): A learned spell caster who studies the arcane arts in order to work magic in the fallen world.\nAsphalt Samurai (ASI): A street smart warrior who wields both blade and gun that follows a strange tradition of ancient Bushido codes.\nCleric of the Many Gods (CLR): A divinely charged spell caster and warrior who is a devout follower and prophet for the many gods that crossed over from Gothos.\nDreamwalker (DRM): A martial artist who has connected with Mindar: God of Dreams and is able to alter reality with their waking dream-state.\nFace (FCE): A gifted and charismatic wheeler dealer who is great at bartering as well as lying, cheating, etc.\nGifted, The (GIF): A strange mutant who is naturally gifted with the powers of the arcane.\nMechanist (MEC): A technology wizard who studies the old tech stuff from before the fall.\nPriest of the One God (PRE): The divinely powered followers of Earth's only God before the many Gods of Gothos arrived.\nScavenger: (SCV): A packrat and thief of the new fallen world. Stealthy and clever with an eye for the value of junk.\nSoldier (SLD): A well trained warrior who is adept at the fine art of modern combat.\nWasteland Barbarian: (WLB): Feral mutant savages who are ferocious warriors.\nThe Fall of Man corebook will introduce Advanced and Master classes, which will be available in future supplements. Both Advanced classes, available after 10th level, and Master classes, available after 20th level, will be able to advance past the normal 20th level of most characters.\nRaces:\nHumans: Humans are the surviving native race of Earth and once dominated the planet with powerful technology. Now, the race of man is in a steep decline and competing with the other newly arrived races for basic survival.\nCanite: The Canites are said to be a creation of the stuff of the dream world.  Anamorphic canines, the proud and loyal canite race now run in packs and are well known for their ability to hunt and track.\nDwarf: The Dwarves of Earth have secluded themselves away underground and only a few venture forth to adventure. Some speculate whether this is because of their desire to live alone or due to some other, darker secrets.\nElf: Many of the Elf race were the first to head the warnings of Midnar and take action to preserve their kind in the merging of Gothos and Earth. However some others either did not heed the call or were unable to prepare and now walk the earth \u201cblasted\u201d with foul spirit and intent.\nGnome (The Twisted): Gnomes were once considered to be a happy race. Similar to Halflings in stature, the gnomes were small but had big hearts. They are now cursed in the transition to Earth with something called \"the bent.\" This has gained gnomes the terrible name \u201cThe Twisted\u201d.\nHalflings: True to form, the Halflings seemed to avoid the various afflictions that occurred to most of the other races in the transition to Earth. In fact, halflings seem to now be able to affect the world itself with their stories and song.\nHalf-Elf: Like most half-breeds, the Half-Elf is a displaced creature, especially on Earth after the fall. Sharing both Elven and Human traits, they seem to not fit in with either race.\nHalf-Orc: The Half-Orc is generally thought of as a down trodden sub-race. They are not as smart as humans and not as strong or robust as pure orcs which seems to put them at a disadvantage but they make up for it in raw tenacity.\nHanites: Hanites are a new species of being which originated from man and who will be further previewed during the Kickstarter.\nMutant (Template): In a world where technology, magic, radiation, and toxic effects exist, mutation was inevitable.  Unlike the other races, mutant is a template which is added on top of another race\u2019s abilities.\nReborn: When the first reborn appeared shortly after all the devastation, no one knew what to make of them, instantly assuming they were zombies or something worse. Their ashen, dead, cold skin and their white dead eyes made them obvious targets for undead hunters. It was not for quite some time before someone figured out the reborn were not truly undead and were not always evil or good, being much like humans in this regard.\nWhat makes this setting different: \nIn Fall of Man, it is a fight for survival.\nThe world is warped, twisted and everyone is severely flawed and conflict abounds, even between players. And through that conflict, both roleplaying and tangible game effects engage the players to interact beyond simple camaraderie around the table; it is you vs. the world (GM) and each other.  \nTechnology vs. Magic; The One God vs the Pantheon; Real vs. Imagined; all of these things collide to make a world both familiar yet new.\nCombat is harsh and gritty, but still allows for long term progression and the capacity for heroic deeds.\nAnd everything is not what it seems...  Even among the characters themselves as they evolve not just in their classes, but in their racial and physical (mutant) features.\nFrom the world's pain, we gain a place in which GM's can explore their darkest nightmares and manifest them for their players while the players themselves have the opportunity to respond in kind.\nGothic Horror and Fantasy in a Post Apocalyptic setting. That's what sets Fall of Man apart. \nSystems: This setting is based on the Pathfinder system on steroids. If you have played in a d20 system you will be familiar with the basic rules. It will also be available for 13th Age, FATE and Castles & Crusades (SIEGE), with specialists in each system doing the conversions.\nInformational Videos\nHere is a video we made discussing the Barter and Trade system that is included in the Fall of Man:\nPLAY\n\nAll backers of + levels will receive a 32 page PDF of bonus player character content including new feats, alternate class and racial features, equipment and other goodies.

Please feel free to have a look through my portfolio and contact me for any further information or samples.\nI'll try and tell you a little about myself without taking up too much of your valuable time! I have always had an interest in drawing and as a result decided that an artistic career was for me. I graduated from the University of South Australia studying Visual Communication. After a brief stint working in graphic and web design I made the move into the entertainment art industry and worked as a professional Concept Artist, Creative Director, Art Director and Illustrator/Designer for a range of clients and companies.\nHerald of Thanato\nGill Pearce My name is Gillian Pearce although I do prefer to be called Gill. I tend to lurk around online using the nicknames Hellion or Kharnate. I divide my time between my day job working in a local school and illustrating on a freelance basis. I also help out as art director for Dark Quest Games. I have been illustrating professionally for approximately 12 years now and I have numerous publishing credits in various fields ranging from book cover and interior illustration, card game artwork, role-playing game illustration and cartography. My artwork is created using traditional methods and very little in the way of computer enhancement aside from map labels and the like. My colour work is produced using a heady mix of watercolour and acrylic paint with a hint of ink and pencil and my black and white work is primarily achieved using fine-liners, although I do occasionally indulge in black and white pencil work. I like to consider myself versatile when it comes to subject matter and will tackle sci-fi, horror, fantasy scenes, figures, monsters and maps with the same enthusiasm.\nCity of Pavis\nWar Dragon\nRoel Wielinga has been described as a \"DREAMER\", a description that suits almost every aspect of the artist.

When the two moons cross, it can also change your life forever. As awakened, the men and women of Grimaton are possessed of magic in the form of a special bond with an animal or a knack for manipulating the underlying energies of the land. They throw rainbow fire, swim beside alligators, or shape the blood of their enemies into weapons."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Man has Fallen!", "update_content": "Hello fellow survivors, I have wonderful news! \n The guide to our continued existence on what's left of this world, the Fall of Man RPG, is finally available for sale.\n Make sure to snag a copy from any of these awesome dealers, and good luck out there!\n  http://drivethrurpg.com/product/151392/Fall-of-Man?term=fall+of+man http://paizo.com/products/btpy9f6i/discuss?Fall-of-Man#tabs http://shop.d20pfsrd.com/products/fall-of-man"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "The Good Fight", "update_content": "Well, with about 48 hours to go in the Kickstarter, unless a pledge fairy materializes and bestows upon us a huge amount of money, the project is gonna fall short of the goal.

We're all hoping to see the rest of the Potion Tokens become funded.  Can't wait to see what this campaign brings. \nThere is a bit of a downer this time around though. You'll notice that the prices have gone up a little bit. Price hikes have been passed down the line to everyone in the chain of manufacturing, including us here at Potion Tokens central. :)\nIf your new to the Potion Token experience, you may ask yourself, what are Potion Tokens? \nA Potion Token is a unique RPG table-top gaming accessory that represents a great way for a table-top RPG player to keep track of his or her potion inventory during game-play. The Potion Token is given to a player by the DM (Dungeon Master) or GM (Game Master) when the player's character finds potions in an adventure. When a player uses (spends) a Potion Token, they can physically hand the Potion Token to the DM.\nNo need to erase a potion from inventory!! \nThe small spell description on the back of the potion token tells the player exactly what to do to resolve that spell. \nPotion Tokens are produced in both PLASTIC and METAL materials. Metal Potion Tokens are 1.75\" in size. (Plastic Potion Tokens are slightly smaller.)\nPotion Tokens are compatible with:\nPathfinder RPG   \n3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons    \nCastles & Crusades  \n And virtually any other D20-based Fantasy RPG.\n-- On the FRONT of the Potion Token is a potion bottle image and a title stating which Potion Token is represented.\n-- On the BACK of the Potion Token is a flowing scroll with a small spell description of what that particular potion's spell effect is.\nMetal Potion Tokens are 1.75\" in size. (Plastic POTION TOKENS are slightly smaller.)\nThis is an image of a finished METAL Potion Token next to a medium-sized RPG miniature.\nWe are going to use the \"Stretch Goal\" format again because it works great with our type of product.  \nWhen the dollar amount for a stretch goal is reached, it then becomes one of the available choices for fulfilling your pledge rewards.   \nPledge supporters can mix and match all of the FUNDED Potion Tokens stretch goals and previously funded Potion Tokens. (\"Cure Light Wounds\" and \"Potion of Invisibility\")\n Click the Link below to check out their website.\n** Include the price of any desired add-ons into your pledge and then after the Kickstarter campaign is complete we will contact you via e-mail to ask which add-on Potion Tokens you want.\n The original art for Potion Tokens was created by professional artist Mike S. Corley.  Mike was integral in making Potion Tokens a reality. Check out Mike\u2019s Deviantart.com gallery  here: http://mscorley.deviantart.com/gallery/\n In addition, more original art was created by Professional artist Ross A. Campbell.  Ross did a fantastic job creating the Potion of Bull Strength and Potion of Mage Armor Potion Tokens. His Deviant Art gallery can be found here: http://ross-a-campbell.deviantart.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne huge risk we have taken is paying for the commissioned artwork and copyrighting of the Potion Token concept up-front.

Our new manufacturer is from Hong Kong and does work for corporations like Mcdonalds, Disney, and ABC. They can deliver a good amount of our product in a decent time-frame. I tried to stay with an American manufacturer but after we crunched the numbers, we found that we would have actually owed money instead of make money.\n\nOnce I receive the finished product and the packaging, I'll need some time to get everything prepared and sent out.\n\nMy coin manufacturer said they can handle large quantities of product in a small amount of time so the delivery date is on the long side of estimating but that way you, as the customer,are pleasantly surprised when your Potion Tokens before the promised delivery date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Potion Tokens available at Noble Knight Games", "update_content": "Hey everyone.\nPotion Tokens are now available on Noble Knight Games online store.\nCheck it out:\nhttp://www.nobleknight.com/ViewProducts.asp_Q_ProductLineID_E_2137430651_A_ManufacturerID_E_2145087331_A_CategoryID_E_16"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "ALL rewards fulfilled....on to the next venture.", "update_content": "Hey Guys and Gals,  \nThanks everyone for all of your support and we hope your enjoying your new Potion Tokens.\nWe recently started our new Kickstarter for the Corpse Tokens and we're doing well but we could definitely use some pledge support from our previous supporters.

Imagine an experience that combines strategy, action, adventure, and RPG elements with the deep plotline of a massive single-player campaign and the 'fun' of multi-player co-op play! :D Yeah, it's pretty unique, we think so too :) \nInitially, we plan to release on PC and Mac platforms via Steam :)\n=============Gameplay=============\nIn Espionage, you don't just defend your castle with traps, units, and environmental hazards, you also have to attack other player's castles with your own troops, counter-traps and spells to make it through! This unique gameplay is the first of its kind that we know of...think of it as Tower Defense meets Tower Attacks in a real-time-strategy setting, but requiring FPS level flexibility and RPG level character development! Whew! \nLevel up your character and get cool powers, like the Ice Ring!\nPLAY\n\nAs you gain more land, your status goes up from a Serf to a Knight, to a Noble and so on, and you receive more tributes from your total owned land as well. \nWait wait it gets better yet :D You can play with other players in co-op mode to attack castles together with both of your band of units, complementary spells and gadgets and all sorts of different strategies! BUT, be careful, because if you lose a lot of units in a particular attack, your co-op partner might take the opportunity to now attack your undefended castle too!\nKeep barrels of money and goods secure in storage cellars\n=====Single Player Schmancyness!=====\nYou know the best part about Single Player campaigns? The fact that you can create amazing plot and storylines...unfortunately something we see less of that we'd like! Kingdom Espionage follows a beautiful plot that combines the the stories of 4 different characters in their 'righteous quest' to overthrow the current corrupt emperor. Full of twists and intriguing philosophical juxtapositions, the story is unlike what you're typically going to come across and is bound to make you think at a much deeper level about the world around us at economic, moral, and political levels!\nWhile that's all awesome, solo-play also offers a variety of fun modes to play in, including the 'Horde Mode', where you must survive against waves of incoming monsters to give enough time for your units to escape. Or the exact opposite, 'The Crunch' where you must attack as quickly as possible and take down all of the enemy's runners before they can leave the castle!\nAll in all, it's FUN!!\n=============Defense=============\nAs you grow, you will need to learn how to defend your land against other invaders. You do this by setting up defenses within your Castle using different traps, units, and environmental hazards.\nI'm setting up a burning coal pit next to the tar trap...not the most strategic of decisions :P\n=============Attack=============\nPlayers can attack each other to try and take over the land and money from other players. If you successfully invade another player's castle, make it past their defenses, and get your units into the inner chambers, you will be able to take over some of their land. However, you need to plan out your attacks and strategy to make an attack successful - any units you lose during an attack are lost permanently - you will need to buy new units to make up for the lost ones. And, you have a limited time in which you must make it past each castle.\nHere I just ordered a team of my archers to attack two werewolves blocking the path to my destination.\nGetting your units through the traps is challenging - you can issue commands to your units like Stop, Follow, Charge, or Retreat. Then you must time their movements while at the same time disabling different traps using your counter trap gadgets or similar strategies.\n\n\n\nListen to one of our attack themes below:\nHere I am about to use the water bucket to temporarily quench the burning coal trap.\n======EPIC BOSS FIGHTS!======\nWhat do you do when finally defeat a man-eating plant just to discover it's but a flower-bud on a MASSIVE all-consuming underground fungus? Well you KILL IT WITH FIRE of course :D Or when you've finally taken down the last of the baby dragons only to discover you've angered the mama?\nThe bosses in Kingdom Espionage are planned to be not just massive in size, but require realistic strategies and teams of units to defeat them! And if you're stuck, just team up with a buddy in co-op mode to get ahead (though we warn you it's still no walk in the park!).\n======The Future?======\nKingdom: Espionage is but the beginning of the 'Kingdom' universe, with 2 other installments planned based on the support and success we see with Espionage! So support us on Steam and Kickstarter with gusto if the ideas presented here carry the freshness with them that you've been longing for ;)\n======Oh My Gosh! It's an Ogre!!========\nWhat's a fantastical world without some awesomely fear inspiring creatures? Werewolves, HammerTusk Wolverine, Tank Ogres, Dragons (babies to teens!), Runefairies and other creatures roam the Lysterian woods, and are often tamed to provide protection to castles! Use your wits and the right strategies to take down these ominous creatures in time before they tear through your units when attack, or traps when defending!\n=============Units=============\nUnits make up the backbone of your offense. The number of units you can own are limited by the population slots you have available, which in turn are limited by your status - so as you gain land and ranks, the scale and nature of your attacks become bigger! \nConcept art for Archers\nArchers are strong against most infantry and fliers, especially when massed together. \nConcept art for infantry units\nInfantry units are strong against most units when up close, able to hold off dangerous units and expose them to archer fire.\nConcept art for Cavalry\nCavalry units are useful for large open castles as they travel fast, and are good at making it through slower traps.\nConcept art for Werewolf and Ogre beasts\nBeasts are only available at Noble and higher levels. While more expensive and requiring higher population slots, they can turn the tide of a battle very quickly. Werewolves are fast, and immune to magical effects. Ogres are slow but have massive health and take limited damage from projectiles.\nConcept art for baby dragon\nBaby dragons are available only at higher tiers of status (Duke and above). These fliers skip past most ground traps and are potent attack units as well! \nHelp us hit our Stretch goals to make beasts and dragons part of the initial Espionage release and to unlock even more units like the Dragonspawn, RuneFairy, HammerTusk, Legion Captain and more! \n=============Traps=============\nTraps are your primary means to defend against incoming invaders! The more creative and strategic you are with the placement of your traps, the better defended you will be! Like with Units, you may deploy a fixed number of traps in a given castle. \nBurning coal pits damage units that step on them. They need some time to recharge after some units being burned.\nBarricades can be used to block off pathways or to force invaders into narrow spaces. Barricades may not be used to completely block all paths.\nThe swinging mace packs a massive punch and can disable most units in a single hit!\nPush-pikes damage units that walk over them.\nTar traps do no damage but greatly slow down units that walk on them. These can be used to set up units for hits by swinging maces or archers.\nHelp us create even more traps by helping us hit our stretch goals like the Decoy, Levitation plates, rolling logs, Dragonbreath statues, Magnet distruptors and more! \n=============Stretch Goals==============\nStretch goals will enable us to take Kingdom Espionage from an awesome game, to a groundbreaking experience! \n$68,250 - We will be able to make beasts and dragons part of the initial Espionage release instead of a DLC pack!\nThis would include at least the ogre, the werewolf and the baby dragon.\n$96,700 - We will be able to include an additional counter-trap pack which will include the Decoy, the Levitation Plates, Magnet Disruptors and more! \n$107,100 - All of the above PLUS the ability to unlock more units, such as Dragonspawn! \n$117,500 - Unlock the RuneFairy unit! The RuneFairy can negate the damage from the first attack it sustains. This ability, in conjunction with its mana shield, which can be activated for a period of time, means the defender must have a series of traps that last for more than 5 seconds (for example) of speedy RuneFairy travel in order to defend against this unit.\n$127,900 - Unlock the HammerTusk Wolverine unit! The HammerTusk Wolverine is faster than other units, charging straight ahead and demolishing traps with its impervious, bony head. The HammerTusk must be attacked from the back or the sides, since the front is nearly impenetrable to attack!\n$138,300 - All the above, plus unlock the Legion Captain unit! The Legion Captain is slightly larger and stronger than the other human units, and makes other surrounding human units able to travel faster. He has a banner above his head, with a logo emblazoned on his armor.\n$139,100 - All of the above PLUS we will be able to include the Decoy Counter-trap. The decoy attracts enemy archer fire from longer distances. \n$148,250 - We will include the Levitation Plate Trap. This causes the attacker to float above the ground. This works well in combination with the arrow walls, as the attacker is temporarily rendered helplessly unable to move under fire. \n$158,100 - We will include the Mind Key Counter-trap. This is a small glass ball with the appearance of a pulsing brain shrouded in fog inside. With the mind key, the attacker can use levitation power, targeting any one of their units, to lift them and move them around. You can levitate your units over dangerous traps and to safety. The Mind Key can also be used to negate the power of the Levitation Plates! \n$167,150 - Get the Rolling Logs Trap! This trap can be set up on a wall (ideally at the end of a long corridor) and is manually activated by a pressure plate which must be placed in a separate location. Rolling logs kill nearly anything they hit. The only way to survive is for the attacking player to dodge...if possible! Rolling logs are hard to identify, but they are a one-time-use-only trap. \n$177,750 - We'll include the Dragonbreath Statue Trap, which can be placed in various strategic locations throughout the castle. These may appear to be harmless gargoyles, but similar to the arrow walls or the rolling logs, one wrong step from the attacker and this trap can damage their units severely! \n$188,000 - All the above, and get the Magnet Disruptor Trap included as well! The Magnet Disruptor pulls off attackers armor, causing units to take more damage. This trap also creates other ancillary advantages for defenders, for example the ogre's mace will be lost to him when he walks by the Magnet Disruptor.\n$200,000 - We want to create additional heroes with which the player can live their Lysterian experience. For this stretch goal, we will include the hero Menin: a 12-year-old girl with high mana reserves and lower hp. Menin takes very low damage from elemental traps like burning coals, poison, acid, lava etc. Potentially she may also have a cat-mode, where she can morph into a cat to hide and evade danger, as well as sneak into areas that others cannot. Menin is the only survivor (at age 5) of a civil conflict. The story is that a peaceful village was was ransacked by the emperors troops, and she was the only survivor, found later in the burning rubble. \n$212,000 - We will include another hero, Jos: He will be the fastest unit, able to double-jump, with decent mana and hp. He has blonde hair, medium build. Jos is a bit of a smart-alec, but his confidence is not unwarranted.\n$224,000 - In addition to the above, we will include the hero Gram: a hardy, hulking man who grew up in the mountain forests. He is physically the strongest of the heros, with melee attack and defense, high hp, and can take a lot of damage from traps and guards before dying.\n$236,000 - At this level, we will include the hero Din: a 17-year-old from Dinitri. Being from that island, he grew up around dragons, and can \"glide\" after a jump to cover larger distances (like a series of ground traps or a lava pit dug into a castle design). Din has slightly higher mana than hp.\n$280,550 - In addition to the above accomplishments, we will be able to build in a practice mode for survival/defense. In this mode, a player will be able to fight off hordes of attackers. With each new wave/level they defeat, they earn more in-game currency to build their kingdom. However, each level gets harder and one loss results in a loss of all their winnings from that time. This mode will serve two purposes: 1. A way to practice and to be prepared for the attacks of other players, and 2. Another means by which players can accumulate Daric (in-game money) to advance their kingdom! \n$330,000 - This next tier will allow us to also build in a co-op mode where players will be able to form an alliance between each other for specific attack or defense ventures (including working together to play the defense practice mode mentioned above). At least initially, the winnings will be split evenly between the two players, thus adding a layer of strategy when determining with which players you want to ally yourself. \n$450,000 - All the above, PLUS a level editor that will allow players to get building materials and build their own personalized castles and mazes (as opposed to building within the current pre-defined castle designs and other restraints). \n$570,000 - We will be able to build in a long, single-player campaign for different ranks on top of everything we have just outlined. Your character will follow a storyline where he/she must climb the ranks and overthrow and defend castles on their quest to defeat the evil Lysterian tyrant. Along the way, secrets are revealed, and the plot thickens at every turn! \n$600,000 - Beyond this stretch goal, we will build in as many additional maps as possible, increasing the bounds of the Lysterian universe. If this goal is hit, we will be able to include at least one more map but depending on your generosity, additional islands and continents may be made available and made accessible by ships/boats! \nWAY beyond? - We will continue building new characters, heroes, traps/counter-traps/spells, beasts, castles, castle building materials, etc. There is no limit to how massive this kingdom can become!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest obstacle we face right now is not in the production of the game, but rather in the amount of 'polish' we can apply to it. \nAs can be seen in our visual/technical prototype, concept art, and feature list, we have a LOT that we've already done in terms of the core functions of the game.\nHowever, the difference between a playable game and the GREAT game is the 'polished' attention to various aspects and details. \nIf we can reach some of our stretch goals, we will be able to turn Espionage into the masterpiece that we know it can become.\n\nAs can be seen, we have already developed far more than the concept art and gameplay. Kingdom Espionage is not just an idea at this point - we have funded this ourselves to make sure you know you are supporting something that will TRULY be released soon. The gameplay, unit models, animation and design - majority of this work is complete. \n\nAll in all, the risk taken by you as a supporter is minimal at this point, and yet you have the chance to be a part of something that redefines and creates a new genre of gaming! \n\n\nQues - What if the game just doesn't 'take' off and become really popular?\nAns - Well, for one we are working feverishly to make sure that it DOES become very popular, and if we are funded fully, then we will start out with an obvious advantage in form of the wonderful gamers like you who believe in our vision as well.\n\nHowever, with all that aside, we have 3 major installments planned in the 'Kingdom' series. We need just ONE of the 3 to succeed to bring massive success to the entire series since they will be tied seamlessly into a single universe. \n\n\nAll in all, we are all VERY familiar with running huge projects - in both the software, and the game world. We've faced and overcome many struggles before and we sure won't be stopping just due to some other minor issues this time either!

All original stretch goals unlocked!\nUpdate: Pledges of $20 or more will now also receive the Ultimate GM Screen II from our friends at Fat Dragon Games!\n\"Honestly, we wouldn't have been able to tell the stories we wanted to tell in Pathfinder without the Advanced Bestiary.\"\nF. Wesley Schneider\nEditor-in-Chief, Paizo Publishing\n\nIn 2005 Green Ronin Published the Advanced Bestiary for the d20 System. It was a monster book that took the idea of templates and ran with it. The Advanced Bestiary featured over 100 new templates and sample monsters built using them. It was a terrific toolkit and added value to every monster book GMs already owned. For years people have been asking us to do a Pathfinder version of the Advanced Bestiary and with your help, we are going to do it!\n  The rules revisions are already well under way. The question is, what will the book\u2019s final format be? We are starting with the assumption that the book will be a 264-page hardback with a black and white interior like the original, and that we\u2019ll keep the book\u2019s existing art. Really though, we want to give you a full color hardback with all new art! That\u2019s built into the stretch goals of this Kickstarter, so the final format is up to you all!\n\nUpdate: Full color printing and all new art are unlocked! \n\nYou Can\u2019t Eat Accolades! \nThe Advanced Bestiary got great reviews as soon as it was released. This was in the later days of the d20 era, when it was harder to impress people and much harder to have a hit book. The critics loved it and sales were solid. Mission accomplished, right? Well, no, as it turned out. The Advanced Bestiary and two other titles (The Black Company and Egyptian Adventures: Hamunaptra) had the misfortune of coming out when our fulfillment company (Osseum Entertainment) was dying and stealing money from our sales to stay afloat. Those three big, expensive-to-print products all sold pretty well\u2014and we saw not a dime of that money. We were, of course, still on the hook for all the associated bills: writing, editing, printing, art, etc. What should have been a triumph thus turned into a disaster. I remember figuring out at one point that for every dollar we paid the designer, Green Ronin lost three dollars. The \u201cOsseum Debacle,\u201d as we came to call it, nearly killed Green Ronin Publishing. We managed to survive though and slowly paid down all of our associated debts. \nThe fact that the Advanced Bestiary became a cornerstone book for Pathfinder development has thus always been bitter sweet. We were certainly flattered that Paizo used the Advanced Bestiary in so many of its own books and we were glad players and GMs got so much use out of it. You can\u2019t eat accolades though, so for years I had hoped we could bring this book back and actually turn a profit on it. \nEarlier this year we did a highly successful Pathfinder Kickstarter for our Freeport city setting. Last month I hired Owen K.C. Stephens to be our Pathfinder developer for Freeport and more. I believe now that the Stars are Right for the return of the Advanced Bestiary! Let\u2019s make it happen, Pathfinder fans! \nThe Stretch Goals \nAs I mentioned, we want this book to be full color and featuring all new art. We\u2019ve baked that into the stretch goals and we are revealing them all so you can see what we ultimately hope to achieve with this campaign. We are also keeping expansion of the book fairly limited by design because we want to have the finished product out to backers next July. The more we might add, the longer this would take, so we are capping the new material at 32 pages. Note, however, that there were originally five web enhancements to the Advanced Bestiary and we\u2019ll be including all of those in the new book. \nd20Pro Add-on\nd20Pro is a Virtual Table Top (VTT) program that allows pen-and-paper gaming groups to play online and now you can buy d20Pro files for the Advanced Bestiary for only $10. Simply add $10 to your pledge and you'll get the files when they are released. They will be available to the public later for $15, so this is a great deal for d20Pro Users.\nFantasy Grounds Add-on\nYou also have the option of Fantasy Grounds support for the Advanced Bestiary! Fantasy Grounds is an application acting as a virtual online gaming table. If you'd like Fantasy Grounds files with your Advanced Bestiary, just add $10 to your pledge!\nThe Rewards\nHere are the reward levels for the Advanced Bestiary!\n\nHISTORIC BEAST: You get a PDF of the original (3.5 d20 rules) Advanced Bestiary.

Owen will work with you to create an awesome creature/template combo and to name the resulting monster! You will be credited in the final book, of course. Choices are subject to our approval. You also get a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary and its Hero Lab files.

Our second Kickstarter, Freeport: The City of Adventure for the Pathfinder RPG, is well under way and should release of May of this year. The real risk for the Advanced Bestiary is that Freeport will take longer than finish than we anticipate and push this book back. The two projects share a developer (Owen Stephens) but have completely separate design teams. We thus believe that risk should be minimal.\n\nGreen Ronin has been in business since 2000 and in that time we've published over 150 books.
