[{"backer": "Aywren", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Coral Island is a re-imagined farm sim game inspired by classics. Grow crops, nurture animals, and befriend the islanders. Decide whether to revitalize not only the town but also the surrounding coral reefs.  \nPromising to keep intact what makes classic farm sim games fun, Coral Island aims to modernize and make the experience more inclusive. We feature a large cast of diverse characters and weave environmental awareness into the core game loop \u2014  all the while keeping it a wholesome good time.\n\n\nThere are over 50 islanders living on Coral Island. Coming from all walks of life, get to know these people by chatting them up \u2014 extra brownie points for gifts!\n\nTransform your overrun land into a lush and lively farm. Find your play style by deciding what crops to grow, which animals to nurture, or what structures to build.\nChoose from a variety of crops, flowers, fruit plants, and trees. There are over 75 plantables in the game, ranging from age-old classics to the exotic and obscure native to Asia.\nCrops are seasonal, which means they only grow in a specific season. However, some crops can be planted in multiple seasons and be re-harvested every several days. \nFruit plants take 11 days to mature. They are bi-seasonal, able to grow 2 seasons out of the year, and will wither offseason. Does not need to be watered after maturity.\nFruit Trees take 28 days to mature and will not wither off-season. They bear 1 fruit a day, every day for the season, and will continue to bear fruit every year.\n\nMake a living by caring for animals and raising livestock. Though you'll first need to build a coop or barn to house them! These farm animals can be left outside during the day and will return inside as night falls.\n\n\nPoultry are farm animals that live in a coop. If fed daily, mature poultry usually produces 1 egg, and sometimes, a feather.\n\nBarn-dwelling animals range from the traditional Sheep and Cow to Luwak and Llamas. They need to be brushed and fed daily to keep their produce flowing.\n\nDive into the ocean to restore the coral reefs! Select a diving spot around the island, and unlock deeper levels to explore. Unravel all that the ocean has to offer.\nClean up the sea bed to make a home for rare fish, and collect ocean kelp to hone the quality of livestock and crop.\nBring processed kelp to Ling's Lab to permanently upgrade the quality of your products. Decide which you'll upgrade first: seeds, saplings, seedlings, fodder, or bait.\n16 singles and ready to mingle. Sweep them off their feet and find the one. Find out what their personalities are like, take them on a date, and fall in love!\n Unlock various relationship scenes and when you're ready, build a life together at the farm \u2014 perhaps even have children. Yes, no, maybe?\nGo deep into the caverns to mine precious gemstones \u2014 use the loot to upgrade your tools and farm. But beware, monsters protect rare finds so bring a weapon or two!\nPacked with a variety of outfits, accessories, and options to choose from, you are armed with plenty of styles to express yourself.

Purchase furniture, collect paintings and display exclusive decorations. Welcome home, Farmer.\nCatch a variety of fish, starfish, and squid! There are also crabs at the beach. Fun fact! Several freshwater and saltwater fish can only be caught at specific seasons or certain times (i.e: at summer dawn, or rainy winters).\nCoral Island was once home to an expansive variety of aquatic life. As you restore the island's ecosystem, more types of fish will be available to catch. Perhaps, you'll even cross paths with something legendary?\nLevel up! As you make your way around the island, you will earn skill points that can be invested into skills. \nDecide on a path and create an experience unique to you. Along the way, you'll unlock new, exciting techniques that might come in handy on the farm!\nGet busy and immerse yourself in Coral Island! You can pick projects to work on or a fun skill to develop in your free time... or not. Your time, your choice. Here are some of the additional features in Coral Island worth noting.\nImprove the town: Take part in community projects to build and liven up the town. Spare some extra gold to add a community garden for the locals or build a brand new museum and more\u2026\nFestivals: Join the local community in a Cherry Blossom Festival, annual beach clean up, and many more. There are 2 festivals each season that you can participate in.\nPets: Choose a companion. Decide between a dog, cat, monkey, fox & more!

Coral Island also features a day and night cycle with dynamic lighting.  Set the pace by adjusting the passage of time with a time slider.\nCooking: Build a kitchen and start cooking. With over 70 recipes to learn, including Popiah, Lodeh, and Cauliflower Casserole. Gather all cooking utensils and try them all.\nQuests: Embark on adventures! There are elaborate quests that will give you cutscenes and storylines, and there are simple quests. Rack up relationship points and get paid!\n\n\nWelcome to your new home, a small town with big personalities called Starlet Town. It's located on the coast of Coral Island. This tropical island features a setting loosely influenced by Southeast Asia. You'll see this come across the lore, world-building, crops, animals, and more. Nestled in between the equator and northern tropic, Coral Island is graced by four seasons per year.\n\nThis is Coral Island. Segmented into 7 different areas, your farm is located on the left side of the map, just on the outskirts of town.\n Starlet Town is the heart of Coral Island. Not only is it roomy and features a butterfly garden, but this charming little town also has stories hidden behind its townies.\nThe Beach is rich with sparkly white sands, seashells, and seasonal fruits. On the pier sits a handsome old Inn and a gateway to ocean exploration, the Diving spot. \nThe Lake perhaps guards the most magical place in Coral Island. Find your way through the wooden bridge and discover the ancient temple. It\u2019s believed to be the main source of water and where the island's rich soil originates from.\nThe Forest is a mystic sanctuary for wildlife, filled with ruins and who-knows-what. Underneath the musky floor, it's a hoarding place for messages from the past, the Cavern.\nThe Lookout used to be a place where locals prepared for battles of old and whatnot. As time passed, the Lighthouse is now solely used for navigational aid. Come here and enjoy wicked sunsets and pick some wild fruits on your way home.\nThe Woodlands used to be part of the Forest, but since the arrival of humans, it is now tamed and family-friendly, without losing its green allure. Walk alongside the river to see the School, Taco Truck, and houses belong to those who prefer quiet nights over paved pathways of the town.\n Hillside, sandwiched between the Forest and Woodlands, is the perfect combination of green and privacy. Take a peek at the Vineyard and familiarize yourself with the local Carpenters.\n\nThe Coral Three were said to be the Goddess of Flowers, Merfolk, and Giants. Once upon a time, they worked together to maintain the balance of Coral Island. \nThe Goddess of Flowers was worshipped by both Merfolk and Giants. To this day, locals continue to believe that the Goddess is responsible for rejuvenating the island's water, soil, and well-being.\nSubmerged artifacts suggest The Merfolk Kingdom protected the oceans. It appears they were tasked with ruling the underwater world around Coral Island, making sure that order was maintained.\nLegend has it The Kingdom of Giants existed to cultivate the rich soil of Coral Island. Ruins around the island depict Giants, and what appear to be humans, farming alongside one another.\n\nPufferfish Drilling Corp. is a disgraced company whose goal is to drill oil on and around Coral Island. Set to open this Spring, they plan to lobby their way into the community and collect properties to secure voting rights.\n\n\nWe hope to color your days in Coral Island through music. Please listen to several key tracks that can already transport you to the shores of the island:\n\n\nThe image below displays the correct rewards for each tier.

Since we've passed our Console Stretch Goals, Coral Island will also be coming to Nintendo Switch, Playstation, and Xbox! \n\nWe understand that localization is very important. Coral Island will launch into early access with Bahasa Indonesia and English support. Shortly after, we will update the game to support the additional 8 languages seen below.\nBased in Indonesia, our team currently consists of 20 passionate talents. This includes both permanent crew members and remote collaborators. Although this is our first game as a studio, our team is comprised of veteran and junior game developers.\nYou can learn more about us on our website: www.stairwaygames.com\n\nOur goal is to release the best version of Coral Island. We believe the only way to achieve this is through community involvement. With Kickstarter, we hope to build a community of passionate backers and involve you all in the process of development. All in service of producing the best farming game we can create.  \nSo far, development has been entirely self-funded. Although we have enough funds to complete the game, there are several features we would love to add but don't have the resources to do so. It's always been our dream to play a farming game that features changing seasonal outfits for NPC's, or finally, having kids grow up! We hope Kickstarter helps us realize some of the stretch goals we have for Coral Island.\nAs backers, we invite you to join our Discord to see daily developer diaries and have a direct open line of communication with us. \n\nDevelopment began in October 2019. Initially, we focused on preproduction and coding core features that now serve as the foundation of Coral Island. Over the last 6 months, we've shifted gears into full production.  \nOur focus right now is finalizing and polishing content for the Alpha that will be released to Alpha Farmer tier backers and above. From there, we'll work alongside the community, releasing two content updates and iterating feedback into the game before eventually launching into Steam's early access.\n\n\n\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped 5,000+ creators make their projects a reality, raising over $300MM through crowdfunding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been working on Coral Island for close to 15 months now. \n\nThe two biggest challenges we see ahead for the project are developing alongside community feedback and, provided we reach the stretch goal, implementing the multiplayer component into the game. \n\nDepending on the amount and type of feedback we receive, the dates for milestones on the development timeline may shift.

Both of our previous games were successfully developed and released with the help of Kickstarter backers like you, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to tell you about our new project: The Wandering Village!\n\nThe Wandering Village is a city building simulation game. In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a group of people seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call \u2018Onbu\u2019.\nBecome their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with the creature to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world that now surrounds you.\nKey Features\nBuild a village on the back of a giant creature\nFarm various crops\nSend out foraging missions to gather rare resources\nSurvive a variety of different biomes and events\nBuild a relationship with a giant and influence its actions\nEcology/Biology inspired gameplay\nUnique blend of 3D and hand-drawn, hand-animated 2D graphics    \n\nAt its core, The Wandering Village is a city building and resource management game with rogue-like and survival elements. Farm various crops to keep your villagers fed, send out foraging missions to gather rare resources and scout the environment while constantly expanding the settlement. Of course, living on the back of a living, breathing beast comes with its own challenges, such as helping to maintain the creature\u2019s health and building trust. This might even lead to the beast paying attention to your requests as it wanders through a variety of different biomes, each with its own perks and challenges, always trying to outrun the threat of the toxic spores.\nIn-game Screenshot\nThe ultimate goal, for both the humans and the creature, is to find a place where they can settle down and live in peace again. And if they don\u2019t find this place, maybe they can figure out a way to fight back the plants and create it themselves.\n\nCore Mechanics\nSurvival - Escape from the toxic spores and keep your villagers and the creature alive against ever-changing threats.\nSymbiosis - Live both from and in harmony with the giant creature and form a relationship with it as you trek together through the post-apocalyptic world.\nBuilding - Build an infrastructure where your people can live together, work together and survive together.\nFarming - Plant, cultivate and harvest various crops to keep your villagers and the creature fed and healthy, or grow new kinds of resources.\nForaging - Send scouting parties to explore the different biomes surrounding you, discover rare resources and bring them back to your village, opening up new possibilities.\nHelp us grow our community and get noticed on Steam by wishlisting the game and following us on social media. We now reached 20'000 wishlists! An additional skin for Onbu, the giant creature, will be unlocked for everyone.\nAfter we came up with the concept for the game, we first started thinking about the general look and feel of the game\u2019s world and how it would affect gameplay. We quickly settled on a blend of painted 2D backgrounds and static assets and hand-animated 2D characters in a 3D world, since it combined the strengths of our team members, was easy to navigate in-game and just looked really charming in our opinion.\nInitial world sketch.\n\nThe creature, \u2018Onbu\u2019, was probably the most important part of the process as it is both the map where the game takes place and a character in itself. We started with concepts that were pretty close to existing animals, but moved away from this approach over time as we wanted something that you could more sensibly build a village on. Thus, the designs slowly but surely evolved into our very own earthen fantasy creature, the \u2018Onbu\u2019.\nConcept art of Onbu.\nProcess sketches of Onbu.\n\nOnbu wanders through a post-apocalyptic world, which was the next part of our art-design process. We wanted this world to be a stark contrast to Onbu to emphasize that it is toxic, wild and uninhabitable. Onbu on the other hand should feel like an island, an oasis, the only thing that makes survival possible for the humans building the settlement on its back.\nConcept art of the world.\nVarious sketches of the world.\n\nSpeaking of the humans, the first step in designing them was figuring out their scale, not only to make sense gameplay-wise, but also to be visible enough at any zoom level. As for the design itself, our goal was to make them look friendly, maybe even cute, but also to have them reflect that the world they live in is a dangerous one, which is why we gave them protective clothing.\nVillagers as they appear in-game.\nProcess sketches.\n\nNext were the buildings, which had to look functional while conveying both the original culture of the villagers and their adaptations to living in their new environment. They are constructed from simple materials, and since Onbu\u2019s back is so high up and winds are strong, many of them are powered by wind energy. Colorful flags can often be seen attached to them as they are used to communicate with other villagers.\nConcept art of farming buildings.\nProcess sketches of various buildings.\n\nVarious other species besides humans have survived the apocalypse. Most of these creatures are a mix between something familiar, like mammals, and something that seems alien, like giant insects. With this approach, we hope to achieve a result somewhere in the middle, ideally something that is weird, but kinda cute.\nFirst sketches of other creatures.\nInspiration\nOur main inspirations for the game were the evocative drawings of french artist Moebius and the works of Studio Ghibli, specifically Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke.\n\nThe World\nMysterious plants are spreading all over the world, turning the ground toxic and infertile and the air unbreathable. No one knows what caused this, but the source has to be somewhere out there, waiting to be discovered.\nThe Human Settlers\nIncreasingly polluted air and failing harvests caused by the spores have driven the humans from their village. Many have died from hunger and exposure until they crossed paths with the giant creature. The remaining few managed to climb onto its back and start a new settlement.\nIn order to sustain themselves, adapt to their environment and grow stronger and smarter, they\u2019ll need to harvest materials from the creatures\u2019 body and its surroundings, while also making sure that the creature itself survives and keeps on walking, away from the spores and, hopefully, towards a safer place.\nThe village on the back of the giant creature.\n\nThe Gigantic Creature, \u201cOnbu\u201d\nOnbu is the name given to the creature by the villagers.\n   Before the toxic spores started spreading, it was sleeping for hundreds of years, buried in the ground, looking like a mere hill. But when the soil around it became toxic, it awoke from its long slumber and started to walk, trying to find a safe spot where it can go to rest again.\n   But it is neither used nor adapted to travelling long distances, having gotten its nutrients from the ground for such a long time.\n\n   At first, it doesn\u2019t even notice the small creatures crawling around on its back. But soon, they start interacting with it, sometimes hurting it, but also providing it with food and keeping up its strength.\n   Maybe they are different from other parasites.\n   Maybe they can survive this together.\nOnbu, the giant creature.\nThe soundtrack is composed by NukeTan, an independent musician who has been composing for commercials and other games as a freelancer for years.\nFor the wandering village, he drew inspiration from various traditional folk music to bring the culture of the human settlers to life and immerse the player in the game\u2019s world.\nYou can listen to a sample of the soundtrack below:\n\n\n\nGames included:\nExplorer: Empires of the Undergrowth | Niche | Wingspan\nArchitect: Rise to Ruins |  Judgment: Apocalypse Survival Simulation |  Endzone\nFawn Club Member: Niche | Nimbatus | Retimed | + PC key for all future Stray Fawn games\nAlpinist: Airships | Devader | FAR | First Strike | Fishery | Kids | Morphies Law |  Niche | Nimbatus | Octahedron | Retimed | Slime-san | Transport Fever 2 | Towaga |  Unrailed\n\nAdd-ons\nWe are Stray Fawn Studio, an independent game studio based in Zurich, Switzerland, founded in 2016. So far, we have successfully kickstarted and shipped two simulation games: Niche - a genetics survival game and Nimbatus - The Space Drone Constructor. \nOur focus is on the development of PC games, but recently we started venturing into the console and mobile markets too.\nWe care very much about the personal development of our team members, trying our best to help each other grow, and our community, directly involving them in the development of our games.\nClaudio Beck - Sound Design & Music\nDenise Hohl - Graphic Design\nArno Justus - Game Design & Programming\nMarkus Ross\u00e9 - Art & Animation\nPhilomena Schwab - Game Design & Marketing\nDavid Stettler - Web Design\nMicha Stettler - Programming\nStephanie Stutz - Art\nRoger Winzeler -  Art\n\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe funded our first two games via Kickstarter and it has not only provided us with a portion of the funds necessary to bring our ideas to fruition, but also with a community that is interested in the project from the start and accompanies us throughout the entire development process.\nWe believe that the close collaboration with our community has benefitted us, our games and our community, and we hope to once again reach people who want to bring this idea to life and go on this journey together with us.\n\nThank You!\nThank you so much for considering to support The Wandering Village.

Now it\u2019s your turn to embark on an epic adventure and make those dreams come true.\nCatch new Temtem on Omninesia\u2019s floating islands, battle other tamers on the sandy beaches of Deniz or trade with your friends in Tucma\u2019s ash-covered fields. Defeat the ever-annoying Clan Belsoto and end its plot to rule over the Archipelago, beat all eight Dojo Leaders, and become the ultimate Temtem tamer!\nThe world of the Airborne Archipelago is filled with creatures, named by the locals as Temtem. Temtem have always been a part of day-to-day life on the islands. They live in harmony alongside humans, helping them with their chores or being loyal and faithful pets.\nThere's also a long tradition of taming wild Temtem and training them to fight in friendly battles against other tamers. In recent years, this has exploded in popularity due to a revolution in Temtem technology. Temtem scientists achieved the creation of the first Digital Temtem while studying new breeding techniques, and this has spurred the development of various commodities to help tamers on their adventures.\nEvery Temtem and every technique they know are assigned a specific type. Each type has strengths and weaknesses against other types so they are one of the most important things you need to think about when planning your Temtem squad. Each Temtem can have up to two types, but techniques can only have one type. There are 12 types in Temtem.\nTemtem battles are the form of competition between tamers in the Airborne Archipelago. Tamers can have up to six Temtem in their squad, but only two at a time will be able to battle. In Temtem, battles are turn-based, so tamers will take turns commanding their Temtem what to do in battle until all Temtem are exhausted and one of the tamers emerges as the winner.\nBattles are focused on 2v2 (although there will be some 2v1 battles against untamed Temtem or 1v1 battles with other players) and we\u2019re committed to keeping random factors out of battles. We\u2019ve seen the frustration that random elements cause, especially in the competitive scene, so we\u2019ve decided to remove them and have made the combat 100% skill and strategy based.\nBreeding is the method of creating new Eggs. Putting two compatible Temtem together will produce a new Egg, and from that Egg a new Temtem will be born! Breeding is the easiest way to create a Temtem with perfect stats, since they will inherit some of the stats of their parents. Breeding will also open the door to new movesets since some of the moves will be inherited, allowing a Temtem to know moves its species might not normally learn.\nBut don\u2019t overbreed your Temtem! Each Temtem will have a genetic degradation value that will lower each time a new Egg is produced, so you can only breed a specific amount of times. Genetic degradation will also be inherited by the new Temtem, so you\u2019ll need to plan beforehand how you\u2019re going to spend the cycles.\nTemtem features a fully fleshed-out story campaign. Journey across six vivid islands and embark on the adventure of becoming a Temtem tamer while fighting against the evil Clan Belsoto.\nOnline components of Temtem will be an addition to the adventure and will allow you to travel through the islands alongside other tamers and battle, trade, or talk with them.\nThe days of traveling solo are over; in Temtem the world is a massively multiplayer one. Tamers from around the world can join and you will be able to see them around you, living the adventure with you and fighting to become the best Temtem tamer. Chill with strangers, make new friends and battle them or trade your goodies; the dynamic online world is full of possibilities.\nTemtem\u2019s campaign will be fully co-op compatible. You will be able to join forces with a friend any time and work together towards your next goal. Catch new Temtem, complete a Route, or face off against a Temtem Leader; all while fighting alongside your friend in dual battles!\nYou\u2019ve traveled over all six islands, you\u2019ve caught every Temtem there is, you\u2019ve trained the perfect squad and defeated all the Dojo Leaders. It looks like you need a well-deserved rest! Buy your own house at Atoll Row and decorate it your way. Buy new furniture, color your walls and you\u2019ll be ready to invite your friends over!\nAtoll Row is divided into neighborhoods, acting as instances, with persistent houses from all the tamers in the game. You\u2019re going to be able to visit any house any time and inspire yourself with new ideas for your own house.\nCustomize your character to stand out from the crowd and get new cosmetics while you battle other tamers. Pick a silly hat, a comfy sweatshirt, some pants and you\u2019re ready to go! Or maybe you prefer to wear a full-on cosplay of your favorite Temtem?\nTemtem battles are the most important aspect of every new tamer\u2019s job. Competitive battles take it up a notch and let you battle other tamers with similar skill levels. Begin to plan your strategy even before the battle with pick and ban phases and escalate the ranked ladders.\nStart by choosing 10 Temtem and the pick and ban phase will begin. Take turns with your rival to pick your Temtem and ban theirs. When all the decisions are made and the turns are ended, you will end up with a squad of 4 Temtem and the battle will begin.\nWelcome to the Airborne Archipelago, novice tamers!\nThese are the floating islands where Temtem and humans coexist peacefully. Each island is a whole different world, but there is something we all have in common \u2013 our love for Temtem and Temtem fighting! Intrepid tamers like yourself travel on airships to the furthest reaches of the Archipelago to find the best Temtem. Every young tamer dreams of becoming the best\u2026\nBut not everything is fun and peace in the islands. Behind the scenes, Clan Belsoto is weaving a dastardly conspiracy against Temtem and humans alike. You will need all the friends and your best Temtem to defeat the wicked Clan Belsoto.\nDeniz is a Mediterranean paradise of glittering seas where Water and Wind Temtem abound. Walk the streets of Turquesa, explore the ruins of an ancient fort or just chill on the shores of Indigo Lake.\nArbury\u2019s pride is its University. The fierce dons of Lochburg swear by their Melee Temtem, against the sophisticated Properton academics, who favour Mind Temtem.\nOmninesia (\u201dthe Myrisles\u201d) is a cluster of tropical islets connected by rope bridges, home of Nature and Fire Temtem. Enjoy the luxury of Atoll Row and investigate the lava caves of the Anak volcano.\nCipanku dabbles in mysticism and well as technology. The labs of Nanto produce Digital Temtem, while the monks revere the Electric Temtem in remote hills among rice paddies.\nTucma, \u201cThe End of All Things\u201d \u2013 a vast desolation of ashes, noxious lakes and Toxic Temtem. Under the surface, the mining city of Quetzal is home to artisans, rock-hoppers and Crystal Temtem.\nKisiwa is a sun-drenched savanna. Eastern Kisiwa boasts an unrivalled variety of Neutral Temtem, while the western deserts are home to the best Earth Temtem.\nClan Belsoto is a shady and enigmatic organization. Nobody knows who its true leader might be, but some of its captains are well-known:\nLady Lottie is an arrogant Arburian aristocrat, with the aloof manners of an exiled queen. Her delusions of grandeur conceal her dangerous skill in Temtem battles.\nGeneral X is a stern Denizan officer, fond of strict discipline and blind obedience. He is using Clan Belsoto to realize his own dreams of conquest and domination.\nDr. Hamijo is a disgraced Cipanki scientist, who now applies his knowledge to the advancement of the wicked plans of Clan Belsoto, using genetically modified Temtem when challenged to a duel.\nCrema is a game studio based in Madrid, Spain. We\u2019ve been making videogames for almost six years now and we\u2019ve always been focused on delivering great gameplay experiences.\nOur previous productions include:\nInstant Buttons: Our first app, which to date has over 20 million downloads.\nOh My Goat: Featured by Apple and amassed over half a million downloads.\nRidiculous Triathlon: Also featured by Apple and publicly and critically acclaimed.\nImmortal Redneck: Our first foray into the PC and console market, with over 94% positive feedback on Steam.\nWe\u2019ll be working with the award-winning composer Damian Sanchez for all of the audio requirements of Temtem. Damian is an amazing composer who has worked on games like Rise & Shine, Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days, and Blues and Bullets, and has become one of the most renowned composers in the Spanish gamedev community.\nDamian has been working side-by-side with us on most of our games, and our collaboration with him goes back to 2015 when we were working on Ridiculous Triathlon. Since then he\u2019s been our music guy for every project we\u2019ve had, and most recently he\u2019s been responsible for the awesome Immortal Redneck soundtrack.\nAs an exclusive reveal, you can now listen to the first theme on Temtem\u2019s soundtrack:\nOur company has been self-funded for almost 6 years while making our previous games, and now we have most of the funding for Temtem already on our arks. The Kickstarter will help just a bit on the financial side, but we especially want it for the community creation aspect. We really want to develop the game around the community and open the development.\nWith our previous game, Immortal Redneck, it became clear that we should have involved the community early on in development and not have waited for the game\u2019s release to start receiving feedback. We made some assumptions that led to us not putting enough effort into certain areas of the game, and that ended up hurting the game\u2019s perception by the public and got us off to a not-so-great start.\nWe want to change that, and Kickstarter is the perfect way to do it. We want our backers to be involved in the development, watch our day-to-day updates and provide feedback along the way. We plan to maintain an open development through our Discord server, especially with our Alpha Hero backers (and above) that will be testing the game from a very early stage and will help us shape the future of Temtem.\nLastly, since Temtem is very influenced by a well-known franchise, we aren\u2019t really sure how positive the public reception is going to be. Kickstarter allows us to show the game to the public and gather feedback early on. We want to expand the well-known franchise and add features requested by its users for years, but we need to see if there\u2019s enough interest in that before embarking on this massive adventure.\nSince August 2017 when development began, we\u2019ve been focused on laying the foundation of every aspect of the game and creating content for the Kickstarter campaign. We\u2019ve been defining the pipeline for each area of development and we\u2019re now ready to begin full production and start creating the final content for the game.\nWe\u2019re currently focused on creating a first Alpha, and from there we plan to iterate with the community. The Alpha will feature the full first island, 30 Temtem, complete single-player mechanics (tamers, wild battles, catching and training Temtem, story, quests...), and basic multiplayer functionality (1v1 battles, chat, persistent online, seeing other players within the world\u2026).\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 475+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $225MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter ever, but we\u2019ve been developing games for over five years, and in that time we have delivered five games for different platforms with increasing scope and budget.

Remember to add $10 for shipping if your current tier doesn't have shipping included (except for the in-game pet and steam and console keys, they're digital items).\n  Welcome to My Time at Portia, a 3D sandbox RPG adventure inspired by the beautiful aesthetic of Castle in the Sky and Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind. My Time at Portia features gameplay elements inspired by the likes of Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, and the Animal Crossing series mixed with Dark Cloud 2 and Steambot Chronicles, while creating its own unique world set in the lush backdrop of what remains of an ancient civilization.\nThe team at Pathea has created an alpha demo which is free to download and includes 6-8 hours of gameplay. This is just a small taste of what we are looking to create for players who enter the land of Portia! \n                                          Steam        Itch.io        IndieDB        GameJolt\n                This game came about due to our love for simulation RPGs. When we were brainstorming for this project, we wanted to make something like Animal Crossing mixed with Dark Cloud 2 mixed with Steambot Chronicles, since the release of Stardew Valley, probably add that in as well. We want to incorporate a lot of what made these games fun but also keep our own identity.\nBy pledging to any Steam tiers from $25 and up, you'll get access to the exclusive closed beta build on Steam the week after the Kickstarter ends.\n  Setting sail for Portia, a town on the edge of civilization, you\u2019ll arrive to find a workshop left to you by your Pa \u2013 a place where you can begin to craft a new life, using the relics from the past to improve Portia.  \nGather materials from Portia\u2019s stunning open world: cut down trees, forage for herbs, mine in the ruins and even grow your own garden. There are many unique areas for you to explore including deserts, island, reefs, highlands, marshlands, mines and more! There are even two different types of dungeons including abandoned dungeons filled with important resources such as relics and ores for you to harvest or more hazardous dungeons where you\u2019ll be able to encounter and battle monsters!\n  The world at large is somewhat influenced by the likes of Castle in the Sky and Future Boy Conan. It\u2019s got a dark background, an age after the apocalypse, but it\u2019s a bright world, full of hope. There are enough bleak end of the world games out there already. We want this to be a family friendly game that anyone can play.  \nThe storyline will be deep and open. The player can choose which missions and commissions to take. There will be a lot that happens during the player\u2019s stay in Portia. Every event will deepen the player\u2019s understanding of the world as well as the town folks around him/her. The theme of the story is that people can overcome any adversity when they work together.  \nWe hope to give the player a truly memorable time in this game, of a warm and welcoming little town full of experiences.\n        The world of Portia will feel alive as the villagers have their own unique behaviors and will go to school, do their jobs, work out, have fun and have their own stories to share with you. You\u2019ll be able to befriend and romance the villagers within Portia.\n      Workshop - The player inherits a workshop at the start of the game and has to collect resources and complete commissions to grow the workshop into the best in Portia. The workshop is the home space of the player, and many parts of it can be upgraded. The homestead can also be customized through placement of different furnitures and different room upgrades. \nFarming - Unlike most other farming games where you have to take care of your crops everyday, consuming lots of time and energy, the farming in this game will try to be more industrialized, more modern, such as using a planter box or semi-automatic irrigation systems. We want to keep the essential part of farming, such as planting your own crops and watching it grow, while taking out much of the daily routine associated with it to give the player more time to explore the world.    \nRelationships - The player will able to befriend or romance most characters in the game. The relationships are tied together with the economy system. If a player has a good relationship with a certain NPC, there might be perks such as new missions, cheaper goods, or a willing hand. Going the romance route will allow the player to go on dates with the NPC, go through with a storyline for that NPC, and eventually marry that character.  \nCharacter Customization - The player gets to pick to be male or female, with an assortment of hairstyles, facial styles, and colors to choose from. The face can be tweaked as well. There's even a barber shop in the game to allow for hairstyle changes.\nBattle - The player will fight an assortment of monsters, robots, and baddies. Weapons and armor can be upgraded.\nSkills - There is leveling in the game, skill points gained can be distributed by the player.\nMarriage - When the player and NPC relationship reaches a certain threshold, marriage will become an option. After marrying, the NPC will become a helper in the workshop. There might also be some more storyline that happen after marriage. We\u2019d like to add children to this game, with your support, we hope it's possible.\nAbandoned Dungeons - procedural voxel based ruins where the player can dig up minerals and items from the ground. This uses smooth voxel technology to give the player a very seamless experience.  \nHazardous Dungeons - procedural based ruins with tough enemies inside. There might also be some platforming and puzzle solving involved. The Player will dig deeper and every few levels there will be a boss.  \nFishing - There are multiple spots to fish in this game, from the pristine rivers, to dark swamps, to tropical islands. The player will get to keep fish in a fish tank for viewing pleasure after a house upgrade. \nMini-games - We\u2019re trying to add in as many mini-games as possible. They will include darts, cross five, ranching, snow fight, etc. \nHolidays - There are several holidays and events that happens throughout the year in the game. From the Day of the Bright Sun where presents gets dropped from an airship; to the Day of Memories, where the town folks will set off lanterns and then play a game of hide and seek while dressed as ghosts; to the Martial Arts Tournament, where the player can show off some skills; and more.  \nStoryline - The storyline will be deep and open. The player can choose which missions and commissions to take. There will be a lot that happens during the player\u2019s stay in Portia. Every event will deepen the player\u2019s understanding of the world as well as the town folks around him/her. The theme of the story is that people can overcome any adversity when they work together.  \nWeather - The game has all the seasons as well as a full day night cycle with sunny days, rain, snow, cloudy, and overcast.  \nCooking - The game will have an elaborate setup for cooking. The player will be able to make many different recipes. The food can be sold, given as gifts, or eaten by the player.  \nAnimals - There are many different animals in the game world. Depending on time of day, weather, and seasons, different animals will appear. We'd like to add raising and riding animals to this game, with your support, we hope this is possible.\nNPCs - Each NPC is unique in the game world. Everyone has their own personality, backstory, and habits. They follow their own schedules throughout the day. \nSparring - The player is able to spar with most NPCs at any time. Some NPCs will love the fight while others will get sick of the sparring.\n      My Time at Portia will release on Steam Early Access in January 2018. We\u2019re aiming to release the full game during August of 2018. After that, it\u2019ll be released on GOG, WeGame, Itch, and GameJolt.

First, we want to expand our team a little to make the world of My Time at Portia more detailed, vibrant, and alive. We want to hire a few more artists and programmers. We want to do this as soon as possible. We could wait until we\u2019re in Early Access, but that would take several more months before we could get started on the process. The second point is that we want to use Kickstarter to bring in more awareness for our game. We don\u2019t have any marketing budget, the whole budget went into the game\u2019s production, so we need to be creative when it comes to getting the players and media to pay more attention to the game.\n    Pathea Games is an indie game studio based in Chongqing, China, made up of a team of individuals who want to make some fun games. We\u2019ve already successfully released our first Kickstarter game Planet Explorers on Steam. There are about 20 people working on the My Time at Portia, all passionate about making this game as great as it can be!\n  You can contact us by emailing: admin@pathea.net \nYou can visit the game's site: http://portia.pathea.net \nYou can follow us on Twitter: @MyTimeAtPortia \nYou can follow us on Facebook: Pathea Games \nYou can join us on Discord: My Time at Portia Channel \nOur music is created by Claude Ruelle\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPathea Games has been developing My Time at Portia for more than a year now.

We've been very open with the game's development.\n\nWe have delivered a Kickstarter before with the game Planet Explorers and we\u2019re using the experience gained on this project to pour our hearts into delivering against the vision we have set for My Time in Portia with confidence and passion!\n\nWe invite you to join us on this journey.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "A big thank you for helping us anyway you can, it's really appreciated.

However, you must first learn how to live on the island by cultivating the land, befriending villagers, expanding the village and raising your very own magical creatures known as Magnus. \nVenture around the land of Ethia where Vokka island resides to reclaim your memories, but this is no easy task as the world is filled with dangerous Magnus and threatening challenges. \nRe:Legend is heavily inspired by awesome games such as Rune Factory, Digimon World, Fantasy Life and Monster Rancher series. We love monster raising! <3\n                                                    Taming and Raising Magnus  \nMythical creatures known as Magnus roam the land of Ethia, and every single one of them is tamable. They will aid you in many ways such as during combat, farming, fishing, traveling and more. They will also grow and evolve depending on your care, so each of them has unique evolution conditions. Once the Magnus has grown enough and you have gain their trust, you can mount them and use their abilities at will. These abilities will be helpful in your adventure in many ways so make sure to take good care of them!  \n                                                                     Multiplayer\nYou can enjoy the game alone, but why not share the fun with your friends and family? Carry out the activities together and share precious memories!\nGameplay wise, there are plenty of activities that you can experience with your friends. One example would be farming, where you can split the workload between the players and everyone could master a specific part of the job. Different Magnus are better at different jobs, so each of the player can choose a different Magnus suited for different parts of farming. If having Magnus do your chores seems too cruel, you can always do it the traditional way by farming manually. Having friends will speed up the progress significantly.\nMost of the features in the game are built around multiplayer so you will able to enjoy your friend's company throughout the game.\nWe believe that games are meant to be played together so we\u2019re focusing on multiplayer since the early stages. These are just some of the features that have been confirmed and there\u2019s still plenty of room for improvement as we are still experimenting with different ideas. More will be added in the future.  \nNumber of Players: 1 - 4\n                                                                       Farming  \nVokka island\u2019s fertile ground is perfect for crop cultivation, be it on land or underwater. You can plant plenty of crops all year long with different species of plants to be cultivated with each coming season. Each crop can be sold for gold or used to improve your progression in the game. Beside crops, you can also keep and breed the fish that you have caught around the world in your farm. You can let them swim freely in your farm!  \n                                                                      Life Skills \nPractice makes perfect! You gain life skills as you practice them frequently. They level-up passively as you carry out the activities so it is crucial to practice the skill that you want to master as much as you can. Example of life skills: Mining, Fishing, Logging, Cooking, Crafting, Farming, Weaponry and much more! \n                                                                       Story\nWaking up with no memory of your past, you will start your adventure to discover fragments of your memories that were scattered across the land. Each fragment will reveal more about your past and allow you to understand the world a little better. \nYou will find more leads about your memories as you start to develop Vokka Village further throughout the game. People in the village will lend you a hand in uncovering your identity during your adventure so take your time to expand the village. Beside your memories, there's also more to discover as you explore the world!\n                                                             Character customization\nWe feel that it's important for everyone to bring their own uniqueness to Re:Legend, especially because multiplayer is such an important part of the game. To make sure that everyone is special in their own way, you will be able to customize the character to your liking during character creation. Customizable parts will include hair style, hair color, eyes, pupil color, skin color, clothes and so on.\nArmors can be used as vanity as well to mask over the current equipment that you are wearing. If you love how the armor looks but dislike the stats, just wear it as vanity and you will look exactly the way you want without affecting your stats. \n                                                  Building and Expanding Your Village \nVokka Village is where your new life begins! Befriend local villagers and celebrate exciting festivals while having a good time together. Pay attention to their needs and help them out in their daily lives, and they will reward you accordingly. You can recruit more villagers into the village during your adventure, and having more villagers will expand the village. This will allow you to gain access to better resources, and who knows you might even develop a romantic interest in one of them?!\nWe believe that music is the soul of a game because it bring out best in it by triggering a player's emotion throughout their journey in the game world. In order to deliver the best experience for you guys, we're collaborating with none other than the legendary Video Game Orchestra(VGO)! Video Game Orchestra is a Boston-based ensemble that has recorded for huge blockbuster franchises like Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts (Square Enix) to Cytus (Rayark) and Mages of Mystralia (Borealys Games). Their recorded works have been nominated multiple times for Best Soundtrack within various circles, and is internationally renown for its quality and musicality.\nTheir experience and knowledge from those huge titles will be applied to Re:Legend so everything will be blended seamlessly from scene to scene. Audio will be extremely dynamic so you will be able to feel the exact mood of the specific game situation.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nHere are the sample OST that was composed by our star composers for Re:Legend. Hope you guys enjoy it!\nWhile Vokka Island is a peaceful and relaxing place, the outside world is definitely not! There are different regions around Vokka Island and each is a dangerous area filled with wild Magnus. It is always a wise choice to bring along your trusted Magnus before heading out.\nWe have planned 5 different regions so far and each of them will house unique Magnus in their respective ecosystem. There are plenty of exclusive Magnus in those regions that cannot be encountered in other regions where the region\u2019s exclusive Magnus has different strength in terms of their abilities and growth. They will be able to help you in specific sections of your journey so take your time to understand their strengths and raise them carefully.\nThe direction that we are aiming for is a combination of cute and cool so we went with the chibi anime style. We hope that you will enjoy what you see!  \nWe're spending a lot of time taking the monsters from 2D concept art to 3D assets since we want to create a unique feel for the monsters, ranging from distinct physical features to special interaction animations.\nHere\u2019s some of the sample concept that we have developed, enjoy!\nRe:Legend's concept was conceived around December 2015 and we were actually half way through the development. Back then the project had another name and we had poured so much time and effort into it that some of us had our health crippled. But in the end, it was cancelled due to our investor's financial difficulties and more than a year worth of effort was flushed down the drain and destroyed before our very eyes. That was the darkest time of our life and all of us were so lost that we had no idea what to do anymore.\nShortly after the cancellation of the previous project, we put a lot of thought into it and we decided that we had ventured too far to give up on the game, especially after it became one of the top Square Enix Collective projects. It would have been a shame to disappoint those who had taken their time and voted for us during the campaign\u2015it is thanks to them that Re:Legend exists today. \nWe strove to achieve the same result we had with our previous project ever since, and to our delight, Re:Legend is currently the best supported project in Square Enix Collective's history. In fact, we didn't just meet our goal but surpassed it several times over. To everyone who voted for us, you guys are really awesome! We couldn't have made it without your help.\nAfter the major success of our Square Enix Collective campaign, we realized that Re:Legend has huge potential and we want to make it the best it can be. Expectations were really high from you guys and we figured that it would be impossible for our tiny team to fulfill them. This is why we're starting this campaign: To realize the full potential of the game! \nSGD $30(USD $21) Standard Tier - Digital Copy of the game, Backer- exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $50(USD $36) Standard Duo Tier - Digital Copy of the game x2, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $55(USD $40) Digital Collector Tier - Digital Copy of the game, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $70(USD $50) Beta Collector Tier - Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $100(USD $70) Draconewt Tamer Tier - LIMITED Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $100(USD $70) Momochi Tamer Tier - LIMITED Momochi Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $140(USD $99) Master Tamer Tier - LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $210(USD $150) Art Collector Tier - Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x2, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $305(USD $220) Strategic Collector Tier - Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $420(USD $300) Blacksmith Tier - Design a weapon of your choice, Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $700(USD $500) Villager Tier - Immortalized as an NPC in the village, Design a weapon of your choice, Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $1040(USD $750) Legendary Tamer Tier - Design a Magnus consist of 3 evolution stages, Immortalized as an NPC in the village, Design a weapon of your choice, Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $1400(USD $1000) Boss Designer Tier - Design a main story Boss, Design a Magnus consist of 3 evolution stages, Immortalized as an NPC in the village, Design a weapon of your choice, Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $7000(USD $5000) Game Producer Tier - Become Re:Legend's Producer(Receive monthly Producer exclusive updates and provide creative input), Design a main story Boss, Design a Magnus consist of 3 evolution stages, Immortalized as an NPC in the village, Design a weapon of your choice, Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nRe:Legend is currently being developed by a small team of 6 up to date since October 2016.

The game features traditional turn-based combat with a little bit of spice but will primarily focus on the story and how you change it. This will be done through the ESSENCE SYSTEM, which will track a player's personality and morality. After a glitch appears in the world of SOREN, our unexpected hero, Gus, will become aware of you- the player. Experience fourth wall breaking shenanigans while making decisions that will shape this world. \nWe are funded!\nThanks to all of our backers! GLITCHED is now funded and will begin development as soon as the Kickstarter is over! \nIf you cannot back through Kickstarter, use our Paypal to pre-order GLITCHED. You'll be able to pre-order GLITCHED for $10 and have the option for a few of our backer rewards as well. This will go down once our Kickstarter campaign is over! But be aware that any money given via Paypal will not reflect on the Kickstarter page total.\nIf you haven't backed us yet, check out our stretch goals to help add content to GLITCHED! \n   GLITCHED is being developed by En House Studios, a Chicago-based game dev team. Instead of wasting your time reading this introduction paragraph, you could be playing a demo of GLITCHED now.\n(Like right now.)\n     NOTE: This is a demo prototype of the game. It reflects an early development cycle and you can expect changes and improvements to a final version. This version will have some bugs which we will work to fix as soon as possible. We recommend 2 GB of free ram in order to run GLITCHED. A Linux version will be available for the final release only, sorry!\n  The small town of BETWIXT sits far removed from the events of the rest of the world and has always been home to GUS, our unlikely hero. \nThings remained ever constant until one day his best friend, CONRAD, told him he was going to leave for strange reasons.\nOn the night before CONRAD departs, an unexplained phenomenon, the glitch, seemingly erases his existence from the world. After coming face to face with the glitch, GUS is able to interact and speak to you- the player of GLITCHED. The traumatic event of suddenly losing his friend significantly affects GUS, but luckily you\u2019ll be there to guide him through.\nTogether, you and GUS will explore the world of SOREN and discover the truth behind it all. Each choice you make might influence who decides to be your friend or foe   \nYou\u2019ll travel from crowded cities to ancient kingdoms. Remnants and tales of the past will lead you to the answers of the present.\nYou're bound to meet plenty of strange characters on your journey. Some will be friends and other foes- perhaps that choice is left up to you.\n  At its core, GLITCHED is a story driven RPG where the player is constantly making decisions that have an impact of the world of SOREN. \nIn GLITCHED, the ESSENCE SYSTEM will track a player's choices and shape their personality and morality. This system will give each player a unique experience. \nBy exploring the world in your own way, you\u2019ll generate points towards six different ESSENCE alignments. \nThese alignments serve as personality types which will impact characters, story and the world around you. Your interaction with NPCs, how you explore the environment, combat, and even your conversations with GUS will determine your ESSENCE.   \nEach ESSENCE focuses on certain character traits and ideologies. No ESSENCE is good or evil, but instead explains the reasons behind your actions. Through meeting and talking to different NPCs, you\u2019ll get a better idea of what each ESSENCE is about. \n  GLITCHED uses traditional turn based combat with a few twists:\nThere is no leveling or random monster encounters.\nAll combat is story based and players will be making choices that may or may not lead to a brawl.\nLeveling up and experience are also removed. \nPlayers will have to use different party members and equipment in order to change how they approach each battle.\nDeciding to kill, spare, or find another way to stop a fight will all lead to different story outcomes.\nActions in battle are limited to three types: Fighting, Interacting, & Goodies. When enemies cannot fight anymore you'll be able to choose to kill or spare them which will alter the story. \nYou might also choose to interact with your enemy to resolve the conflict in a different way . Lastly, you'll be able to use items in battle to bring about various effects.\nCheck out our stretch goals section to see possible additions to the features of GLITCHED. There are plenty of things to be added, but prioritizing main game play features in the demo means smaller additions did not find their way in.\n  The soundtrack for GLITCHED features music composed by our very own Justin Hilton. Our friend Stijn Van Wakeren also composed a few songs and produced all of the tracks for the demo. Check out more of his work here. Visit the GLITCHED Soundcloud for more tracks here or check out the Band Camp to purchase some of the songs here.\n                                                               Forget Me Not\n                                                                  Kinda Lost\n                                                            Slick Like Green Skin\n                                                     Composed by Stijn Van Wakeren\n                                                                  Safe & Sound\n                                   We kept backer rewards as simple as possible. Each tier includes all previous rewards. The early bird special includes the full game, the soundtrack, and the dev book for $10 but is only for the first 75 backers.\n                                          \u22c6 STRETCH GOALS \u22c6\n  Customize a hub town! You\u2019ll be able to pick and choose the layout, buildings, and residents. A quiet (or noisy) place for you and your friends to kick back.\nBebo's are our lovable flightless birds. As a species, they are quite infatuated with Gus. As you traverse the world, you\u2019ll run into all different sorts of them. As any good RPG would have you do: it\u2019s time to collect them all.\nPut your number crunching to the test against a series of turn based combat trials. You\u2019ll be able to build an arcade in your hub town which will include boss rush modes, new game play, and more.\nOur pixel portraits for each character could use a little love, and with this stretch goal you\u2019ll get two upgrades for the price of one. First, each character will get a nice little talking animation to go along with their speech. Second, each character will get a full sheet of emotions to help bring conversations to life just a bit more. \nLet\u2019s get those enemy sprites movin\u2019 and groovin\u2019. With this stretch goal we\u2019ll add enemy animations along with some animation to the character cards for your allies. Making the battles just a bit more lively might help during some of those longer encounters.\nThis stretch goal will encompass quite a lot of content. We can\u2019t give away too many details about additions to the game, but you can expect more hours of game play at this stretch goal. This will add things like new places to explore, new quests and characters, new equipment, and more branching stories. At this funding level, we\u2019ll be able to create our \u2018dream game\u2019 without leaving content out that we really wished to see in the full release.\nGLITCHED already has tons of replay-ability with the Essence System, but with New Game+ you will challenge tougher enemies, uncover hidden secrets, and more to reward players who want to experience everything. More details will come once it's unlocked! \nThe friendship system will allow your party members to interact with one another. They will gain points being in the party together and learn tag skills in battle. More character backstory and cool skills await with the friendship system!\nNew quests and characters come along with the day and night system. You'll be able to wait or use an inn to cycle the time of day. Different quests and characters will be available during different parts of the day. More secrets and complex quests!\nPlay GLITCHED on PS Vita! All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on.\nPlay GLITCHED on PS3 and PS4! All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on.\nPlay GLITCHED on XBOX One! All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on.\nWith this stretch goal, all backers will receive free additional content after release. The nature of the DLC we want to keep hidden to avoid spoilers, in total there will be an additional 10-25 hours of content with this stretch goal- free to all backers!\n  Play GLITCHED on your 3DS! All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on. \nEn House Studios is a Chicago based game dev team. While the team is small, we are completely dedicated to this project. Through the demo, we hope to showcase our ability to fully develop GLITCHED. En House Studios LLC is an established limited liability company. \nAll funds earned through Kickstarter will be put directly into the company and go towards the development of GLITCHED. Funding allocation can be seen below in the money section.\nTUMBLR | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | RPGMaker.net | Itch.io | Press Kit | Steam GREENLIGHT\n    ZACK - Programmer  |  JUSTIN - Composer & Designer | NIKKO - Lead Designer & Artist \nOur friends:\nAnthony Luna (Enemy/Faces Pixel Art) \nStijn Van Wakeren (Soundtrack Production) \nLou H.\nIf you have any questions, get in contact with us through Kickstarter or social media. We\u2019ll make a video of us answering questions we get!\n  Let\u2019s talk cash. The reason we are here on Kickstarter is because we need more than our personal funds to fully develop GLITCHED. Above, you\u2019ll see the breakdown plan of our spending. A sizable chunk will go to backer rewards. Our development costs can be seen by adding art, soundtrack, licensing, and graphic design together. These all add up to fifty percent of the total. Art will go towards paying our pixel artists and promotional artists. Soundtrack will go towards producing our compositions. Kickstarter fees and taxes will take about ten percent. What\u2019s left will be spent on promotion which gets us to our full budget.   \nThis budget changes in the event that we earn more than our asking amount. We\u2019ll update this little pie chart if that does happen to keep you informed on where your money will be going. We wish to be transparent on how we will use these funds and will answer ANY possible question you have about spending. We take development costs very seriously and believe open communication is important to crowdfunding.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter is a risk. What we have tried to do is showcase not only our serious dedication to the project, but also that we have the skills, means, and environment to develop GLITCHED. We hope that our Kickstarter and demo has provided you enough confidence to consider backing us.\n\nWith that said, game development has its risks. There are everyday risks such as health, family, and life issues that might happen to anyone. Development risks are where most problems arise. For us, this means extended deadlines, delayed development, or the feared \"running out of funds.\" We have taken a look at the necessities for GLITCHED and have carefully based our budget around that. With more money behind the project comes more security, content, and quality. Our main goal is to deliver GLITCHED. We have estimated a release date of February 2018 but the stated risks could possibly change that.\n\nWe have laid out our case in this Kickstarter. We have the ability to produce GLITCHED and our demo shows a taste of what the final product will look like. We hope you understand the risks that might happen down the road but also take a look at what we have done to earn your trust in us. We believe greatly in transparency and there will be nothing that happens in development which we don't relay to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You", "descp": "Our thanks & a tiny place in our hearts.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Full Game", "descp": "Digital download of GLITCHED upon release.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["1,841 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Soundtrack", "descp": "Digital download of the soundtrack for GLITCHED.

Shape your animal tribe and find an ecological niche for it to live in! The main goal is to keep your tribe alive against all odds, such as hungry predators, climate change and spreading sickness.\n         Thank you so much for checking out our Kickstarter! The animal species in Niche is very adaptive and will react to things that happen in this campaign. Influence their evolution with your actions!\n  With Niche we want to create a game that gives you tons of different approaches to tackle mother natures challenges of survival. Develop great camouflage and sharp senses to detect predators early and hide. Become super strong and shred all attackers with your horns and claws. Why not become toxic to eat and poison whoever tries to take a bite? Try to spread your species across all islands and prove how adaptable you are. We believe that this game will be a great joy for everyone who loves biology, animals and evolution. Let's make it a reality!\n  To get an impression of the game, check out this Let's play by Fork:\nIf you'd like to try the latest demo of the game, join our playtester group on Facebook. Don't use Facebook? Send us an email.\n  Creatures: We love the Creatures series. Their approach of simulating a species as well as families in unmatched. The fact that your animals age and are mortal deepens your relationship with them and makes their lifetime valuable.\n\nSpore: Niche and Spore share the genetics and evolution topic. We are mainly inspired by the first two episodes of Spore (when you start off in the water and when you start building your tribe on land).\nDon\u2019t Starve: The big, procedural worlds of Don't Starve shaped our vision of Niche's environment. Wandering, running and migrating through different habitats, each with it's own challenges and inhabitants is what brings our worlds to life.\n  When playing Niche, your main objective is to inhabit all island of the world. If all your animals die, the species is extinct which means the game is over.\nIn order to be prepared for the next island's dangers, it's important to build up a big enough tribe. Mating is based on real genetics, featuring dominant, recessive and co-dominant heredity. \nYour babies grow up fast! Animals grow old and will die of old age. So make sure to produce offspring and keep an eye on your gene pool.\nHaving a bigger territory is beneficial in many ways. More food sources, faster movement on the map, approaching carnivores can be detected earlier, etc. So go explore. Some islands are huge!\nBeware of the islands dangers. You may encounter a carnivore! What will you do? Hide? Run away? Fight? Or some other crazy thing you came up with?\nIt would be way to comfortable if carnivores were your only problem! In order to face all the challenges mother nature has to offer your tribe needs to be adaptable!\n    Genre:\nSimulation, Strategy, Puzzle, Roguelike\n\nPlatform:\nWindows, Mac, Linux\n(maybe tablets and consoles later in development)\n\nPlanned release dates:\nJuly/August 2016 (Steam Early Access)\nQ1 2017 (Full Release on Desktop)\n    We love nature and biology games. So love them so much that we founded a indie developers collective and built a website around them! Now you can be sure you won't miss any awesome games anymore :)\nPlayful Oasis is your source for games about nature.\nPlayful Oasis nature games collective\n    Watching tons of nature documentaries, reading science books, going for a walk in the woods.

I\u2019m here to tell you about a new project I have in collaboration with Chucklefish called the Starbound Penguin Plush Project. Since 2005, ESC has been producing a lot of collectibles in the form of vinyl, resin, and of course, plush. Our involvement in this project is that we\u2019ll be designing, producing, and handling the fulfillment of the production. There are several creatures in the Starbound universe that I really like. I really like the penguin creatures because of the dark, humorous personalities that they have. It\u2019s something I\u2019d really like to capture, and I hope this is something you guys will like as well.\nStarbound is an extraterrestrial sandbox adventure game in which you take on the role of a character who\u2019s just fled from their home planet, only to find themselves lost in space with a damaged ship. Their only option is to beam down to the planet below and begin gathering the resources they need to repair their ship and set off to explore the vast, infinite universe\u2026\nUse the starmap to travel between star systems, settle down and farm the land, build and colonize a modern metropolis or take on jobs and earn a living, and do all of it alone or with friends! With a near-infinite number of procedurally generated worlds to discover, Starbound allows players to create their own adventures in space. \nPROTOTYPES ONLY. SUBJECT TO BE MORE CUTER IN PERSON.\nIn Starbound, penguins are sentient beings, living and working alongside the galaxy's other races. Despite their outwardly cute appearance, they are mischievous rogues who prefer the darker underbelly of society. Some penguins have achieved great renown as rogue scientists, black market dealers and even space pirates!\nTo help make this project happen, ESC & Chucklefish have set up some some special rewards just for this Kickstarter. These rewards include:\nREGULAR BLUE PENGUIN- $15\nEARLY BIRD PRICING TIER + EXCLUSIVE PIN SET (STANDARD BLUE ONLY)- $20\nREGULAR BLUE 6\" PENGUIN TIER + EXCLUSIVE PIN SET + STEAM CODE- $30\nREGULAR BLUE 6\" PENGUIN WITH ACCESSORIES TIER + EXCLUSIVE PIN SET + STEAM CODE- $50\nLIMITED EDITION 6\" WHITE PENGUIN TIER WITH ACCESSORIES + EXCLUSIVE PIN SET + STEAM CODE (LIMITED TO 100pcs WORLDWIDE)- $100\nLIMITED EDITION 6\" PALE BLUE PENGUIN TIER WITH ACCESSORIES + EXCLUSIVE PIN SET + STEAM CODE(LIMITED TO 100pcs WORLDWIDE)-  $100\nMASTER SET TIER (includes all penguins, signed 20 x 30 limited edition poster and one 18\" STANDARD PENGUIN with accessories) + EXCLUSIVE PIN SETS + STEAM CODE- $2,000\nPrototypes subject to minor revisions.\nPrototypes subject to minor revisions.\nPrototypes subject to minor revisions.\nEach set of pins includes three 1.25\" penguin pin.\nHere's a Starbound Penguin plush avatar for our backers!\n In this campaign, you can easily increase your pledge to include additional Penguins. At any tier you can do the following:\nTO ADD AN EXTRA REGULAR BLUE PENGUIN- $15 (increase your pledge by $15 per Penguin. Limit up to 4pcs total.)\nTO ADD AN EXTRA REGULAR BLUE PENGUIN (increase your pledge by $30 per Penguin. Limit up to 4pcs total. This includes an additional exclusive pin set per increase)\nTO ADD AN EXTRA  REGULAR BLUE PENGUIN WITH ACCESSORIES (increase your pledge by $50 per Penguin. Limit up to 4pcs. This includes an additional exclusive pin set per increase)\nIf we can get this project funded, ESC and myself will update with the production development for the Penguin plush. These updates would come direct from Kickstarter with details as we go from pre-production, production, shipping and the fulfillment stages. \nHere's a list of our stretch goals for this project to show what extras and add-ons will be offered during this campaign.\nKickstarter allows ESC & Chucklefish to gauge community interest for STARBOUND merchandise.

Eric Heimburg, Project Gorgon creator and lead developer, has over a decade of experience working as a Senior and Lead Engineer, Developer, Designer and Producer on successful games such as Asheron\u2019s Call 1 and 2, Star Trek Online and other successful Massively Multiplayer Online Games. Sandra also has extensive experience working as a Producer on Asheron\u2019s Call 1, Asheron\u2019s Call: Throne of Destiny, EverQuest II, and EverQuest II: Echoes of Faydwer.\nProject Gorgon is a 3D fantasy MMORPG (massively-multiplayer online role-playing game) that features an immersive experience that allows the player to forge their own path through exploration and discovery. We won't be guiding you through a world on rails, and as a result there are many hidden secrets awaiting discovery. Project Gorgon also features an ambitious skill based leveling system that bucks the current trend of pre-determined classes, thus allowing the player to combine skills in order to create a truly unique playing experience.\nWhen you play Project Gorgon, we want you to feel as if you\u2019re immersed in a whole new virtual world. Rather than trying to manage this with just graphics and excessive backstory, we\u2019ve designed the game with dozens of gameplay features that make you feel like you\u2019re really there, interacting with the world, such as: \nIf you are on fire, you can jump into a lake to put it out. This type of mechanic can have subtle effect on your strategies, especially when you are fighting a fire mage! \nYou can drop items on the ground, and other players can pick them up. What\u2019s so great about that? Imagine laying down a trail of literal (virtual) breadcrumbs to guide your friends (or lure your enemies) into the woods. \nShopkeepers keep inventory, so you can buy items that other players have sold to them. Want to help out new players? Sell your cast-off items to the shopkeeper in the new player zone and watch the new players go to town.\nEach non-player (NPC) you meet has their own goals and interest, and reward players that choose to be their friend.\nYou can inscribe messages onto items, write books, and even leave notes for other players. Make your name as an in-game poet, or pronounce your greatness to the world!\n\nIn Project Gorgon you will kill monsters, a lot of them, and you will be taking their loot. In order to keep the experience fun and interesting we\u2019ve developed unique combat experiences to keep the fights feeling fresh. The loot is randomly generated, monsters have unique abilities, and dungeons have puzzles, traps and terrifying bosses! The combat skills are entirely free-form. You can learn as many combat skills as you want, and use any two of them at the same time to create your own personal \u201cclass.\u201d Project Gorgon will feature dozens to choose from, but some examples include: \nBattle Chemistry: Create huge explosions, inject yourself with mysterious mutagens or program a pet golem, it\u2019s your decision! \nUnarmed Combat: Grapple and control enemies using a situational-aware combo system that varies based on where you are and what day it is. \nAnimal Handling: Tame animals and train them to become ferocious fighters. Then breed your best and sell their offspring to other players.\nNecromancy: Seek out corpses and graveyards to raise an undead army. No graveyard around? Well, there are always the corpses of your friends. \nThat\u2019s just a few, there\u2019s also Sword Fighting, Combat Psychology, Staff Fighting, Sigil Scripting, Mentalism, and more.\nPlayer Choices are important in Project Gorgon. You can learn as many skills as you want, but sometimes power comes with downsides. You can become infected with lycanthropy and gain access to very powerful skill sets. You\u2019ll be able to roam the world in a pack or as a lone wolf. However, when there is a full moon (which is tied to the real world lunar calendar) you\u2019ll be stuck in your beast form. New opportunists come open, but others will be closed. There\u2019s no cure for lycanthropy.\n You can become a Druid, which will give you great power but you have to vow to drop everything when there\u2019s an emergency involving nature. It could be a forest fire, a monster invasion or even a pesky insect. Nature never lets you ignore your duties, ever. \nCan you bear heavy burdens in exchange for greater power?\nCommunity is a critical aspect of Project Gorgon and we will strive to establish a strong, engaged community and we plan on supporting our players through:\nLive events with a focus on story.\nMechanisms for player-create quest content. \nPlayer housing (limited instanced).\nPlayer-managed shops and stalls.\nIn-game communication tools like bulletin boards.\nBookshelves where you can write and submit your own books and stories (and players can vote on their favorites).\n  Funding Goals and Beyond\nThe main goal of this campaign is to help fund current and future development of Project Gorgon. We are in a somewhat unique situation as we have been able to put in significant development time prior to coming to Kickstarter so our goals and expectations may seem more conservative than other Kickstarter campaigns that you've seen.  If the campaign is successful we will be able to significantly improve Project Gorgon by contracting outside help to improve art and other vital game functions. We have a lot of great things planned such as Guild Functionality, Player/Guild Housing (instanced) and Mounts! If we are able to meet our initial goal, we would absolutely be thrilled to offer stretch goals that expand upon those systems.\nBusiness Model\nWe have already been greenlit on Steam and we are in the process of implementing full Steam integration. Project Gorgon will use a buy to play model with an optional VIP Subscription. The full retail price will be $39.99 and this will allow us to give full access to all of our players, without worrying about pay-gates and other restrictive features associated with free to play titles.\n\nVIP Subscription\nThe VIP Subscription is optional and will allow players to support the continued development of Project Gorgon while also rewarding players for their generosity.\n\nThe VIP Subscription* will cost $9.99 a month and will feature the following benefits:\n\n\u2022 Eight (8) Character Slots instead of only four (4).\n\u2022 Additional Inventory slots, approximately 24 additional slots.\n\u2022 Exclusive in-game title.\n\u2022 A monthly allotment of special in-game currency that can be used at a unique in-game vendor. The special vendor will have exclusive minor cosmetic items, experience boost potions, and other neat items! (Note: The vendor will be accessible by non-subscribing players, but they will not receive a monthly allotment of currency.)\n\u2022 Exclusive access to the \u201cAutodidactism\u201d skill which will allow players to slowly level up skills while they are offline. (Note: You will be required to learn the skill and collect all required materials prior to using this skill.)\n\n*The benefits associated with the VIP Subscription are subject to change as benefits may be added, removed, or tweaked prior to launch. \nThank you! We hit our initial Kickstarter Campaign goal in only 6 days and we look forward to almost 24 more! We have so many great ideas for Project Gorgon and the more that we are able to raise the greater chance that those ideas will become reality. We ask that you please keep up the enthusiasm and continue to post about Project Gorgon and our Kickstarter Campaign as those social media posts really are making a difference. In order to help keep the campaign rolling, we will be adding new stretch goals and we have some really awesome ideas that we would love to see happen!\n$25,000 Stretch Goal - Unique Backer Mount \nAn exclusive backer mount skin will be created and available to players once they obtain the horseback riding skill in-game. All backers at the Horseback Explorer level or higher will receive the mount as soon as available.\n$30,000  Stretch Goal - Exclusive Backer Character Race: Dwarves!\n\nThe Dwarves are stout, dour subterranean people and Kickstarter Backers will have exclusive access to them during the alpha and beta period! Kickstarter backers below the Patron level will be able to unlock the Dwarven class through in-game objectives, while those at or above the Patron level will have them automatically unlocked once available.\n\nThe personality of Dwarves varies greatly as some are introverts, some can be a bore, and some are precision craftsmen, while others solely decide to rely on their exceptional strength. There is one thing they all have in common, they love the underground and it\u2019s the only place they truly feel at home.\nDwarven players will be able to unlock the secrets of the ancient race, they include:\nThe ability to track your position underground,  \nSpells that let you hide in stone momentarily,\nA combat stance that makes you unmovable,\nLong-forgotten weapon-crafting techniques. \nThese secrets come with a dark side, however, for their patron god Ormorek is also the god of bitterness, self-doubt, and lost innocence. In ages past, Dwarves were their own worst enemies, and players who unearth these ancient techniques will have to battle with ancient foes -- both within and without.\n$35,000 Player Instrument Expansion\nWe have 6 instruments planned, each with six short music loops that can be combined in any order. But if we hit this stretch goal, we'll add a second \"song\" that's completely different from the first, consisting of six new music loops for every instrument. We'll also add a seventh unique instrument, and we will work on allowing animal forms to participate in the fun!\n$40,000 New Player Skill: the Bard!\nThe Bard is part psychologist, part performer, and all charisma. Bards can inspire allies to momentary bursts of outrageous heroism, use their improvisational skills to change the tide of the battle, and use song to soothe wounded souls. It works great with other skills: combine the Bard skill with the already-existing Mentalism skill to create a classic EQ1-style \"buffing bard\", or combine with Psychology to create an exceptional crowd-controller.\n$45,000 Project Gorgon Soundtrack\nProject Gorgon features a unique soundtrack composed by the immensely talented Conor Brace who has worked with clients such as Rooster Teeth, Nickelodeon, D7 Games, Game Salad, and many others. Conor understands the thematic elements that are required to fully immerse players into the world of Project Gorgon and he will be working to complete a full soundtrack for the game!\nEveryone who pledges at the Adventurer level,or higher, will receive a digital copy of the Project Gorgon soundtrack! There are already 13 unique tracks, and that number will only continue to grow as development continues. \n$50,000 Advanced Guild Features\nWe have plans to implement a basic guild system, but if we achieve this stretch goal we will be able to add all the unusual systems that we have been hoping for!\nThe advanced guild features include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 The ability to have unique behavior requirements such as: humans only, no vegetarians, no plate mail, or even an all cow guild!\n\u2022 An optional system to create a unique \u201chardcore\u201d guild that allows unique features and benefits. For example, you could have a special death penalty where a guild member couldn\u2019t respawn until a member of the guild resurrects him or her.\n\u2022Guild Vendor. Guilds can set up an NPC vendor, in town, that allows members to sell items to the public.\n\u2022 Guilds will be able to discover the secrets of ritual magic. There are a lot of secrets awaiting discovery, but some of that magic includes: the ability to teleport and bring members together quickly, rituals of the mind that let you communicate through time and space, the ability to access the guild vault from remote locations, and the ability to summon your guilds unique \u201cmascot\u201d pet.\n\u2022 Guild Levels. Guilds will be able to complete special tasks to enhance the prestige of their guild. As a guild levels, they will be able to unlock rituals, increase guild storage space, and discover special challenges and rewards.\nBackers at the Patron level, or higher, will receive a special voucher to create their guild for free, bypassing the requirements for signatures and fees. Those at the Lord Commander level, or higher, will be among the first to register their guild name!\n$55,000 a Completely New and Unique Animal Form\nIf we achieve this stretch goal, we will add a completely new and unique animal form! This will be a full featured animal form with unique abilities specific to its characteristics. The exact form will be a surprise, and we don\u2019t want to let the cat out of the bag just yet! There are many possibilities, perhaps a psychic mantis or maybe not even an \u201canimal\u201d at all? Only time will tell.\n$60,000 Unlocking the ancient curse of the Vampire\nThere are many curses in the world of Project Gorgon, but perhaps not many as intriguing as the ancient curse of the Vampire. A curse much like Lycanthropy, the player will have access to greater power but will also carry a heavy burden. The night can be a powerful ally, but the day can be your worst enemy.\n$65,000 Unofficial, Official Stretch Goal: Party Pack!\nThe incentive is two-fold: an in-game party pack that you can use to help us celebrate in-game as the Kickstarter campaign closes on Sunday and some headroom in order to ensure that the Vampire Curse stretch goal doesn\u2019t fall below the $60,000 threshold due to failed transactions.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping an indie MMORPG is a difficult endeavor and it takes a lot of technology and experience to make it happen. Luckily we have both, and instead of just backing an idea you will be backing a game that has had a significant amount of development behind it.

That\u2019s not the case here, as an early alpha version of Project Gorgon is playable now. As such, we invite all interested players to visit our website and play Project Gorgon during our Kickstarter campaign free of charge, after the campaign our backers will have continued access throughout development.\n\nWe have estimated a final release date of December 2016, but Project Gorgon will remain playable by our backers from the current early alpha stage through beta and onto launch. The development process includes technical and creative aspects and that means schedules cannot always be guaranteed.

Let me sum up:\nAfter the last major snapshot build (the one with Bard in it), we started getting a lot more crash reports than usual. Turns out the way we use Unity, the 5.5 version uses more memory than 5.4. Not a lot more, but we were very close to the edge for a lot of computers, and this pushed some computers over the edge.

A big chunk of the extra time was spent on basic optimization. This is a big dungeon with a lot of enemies, but still the dungeon had much worse framerate than we expected. We don't do a lot of client-side optimization during alpha, so I was pretty rusty at it, and there were new Unity tools to learn how to use, too.

Instead, I wanted to talk about a little side-topic: player-run challenges.\nThere was a thread on the forum about doing \"challenge characters\" -- where you make a new character and follow special restrictions you impose on yourself. The classic example is \"self-imposed permadeath\": you play for as long as you can without dying, and after you die, you score yourself somehow (maybe by how many levels you obtained, or how many bosses you killed, or whatever else). Then you compare scores with other people for bragging rights or a prize pool or whatever.

Stopping destructive meteors heading for the planet? Fighting against madmen, clowns and madmen clowns? Travelling back through time? Obviously evil party members who turn on you as the plot comes to a bombastic conclusion? Amnesiac, grumpy protagonists winning against impossible odds?\nDo you? Well, that's a shame. Because you will find none of these in Regalia.\nInstead, you will get a compact and light-hearted slice-of-life story of a young man who was (un)fortunate enough to become a ruler. As he arrives to live out a personal fairy tale, it quickly becomes apparent that there won't be a Happily Ever After - his domain lies in ruins, his forebears have left behind a massive debt, and nobody's left behind to even acknowledge his claim.\nNaturally, in all these perils, he won't be alone. Presenting the main four:\nBut worry not, that's not the entire cast (not even close!). A truly merry band of misfits awaits, and not all of them will be blonde. We promise.\nWith additional mission control from a ghost of a sagacious ancestor, success seems assured...\nYeah, no. We won't lie - it's pretty much a lost cause. Or is it?\nYou can read more about the story and characters here.\nBattles\nRegalia's battles take place on an isometric grid, in a turn-based combat system. You control a party assembled from the protagonist and up to 4 other companions (out of the total 12!). \nWhen it comes to skills, we are focusing on quality over quantity, and therefore, every character and/or enemy feels different; every skill is unique to its owner, without boring duplicates. You can push and pull characters around, buff and debuff, summon new units or gadgets... and more!\nThere are no heals and no restorative potions in Regalia. Instead, the player is given a number of ways to shield a character from incoming damage. Keep this in mind, as pontless rushing and incorrect positioning usually translate into swift defeat.\nEach battle is a part of larger chain of encounters, contained either in a dungeon or an outdoor battlefield. Because of the lack of healing, each encounter must be carefully planned in order to persevere, and perseverance will be rewarded with fabulous loot from deepest parts of the dungeons.\nYou can read more about the Battle System here.\nRip and tear!\nYour own Village\nYou begin the game with nothing but a dusty, ruined castle, a nagging ghost of your grandfather and a vague promise of glory. As you progress in the game, you will harvest resources and gold, which can be used to construct new buildings in your village or upgrade the already existing ones.\nEach building has its own occupant, a unique villager who brings additional benefits to your playthrough. For example, build a Smithy, and by doing so recruit Gunther, a mighty blacksmith who will be able to upgrade your weapons and armor.\nTo top it off, there's also the family castle. This central building lets you exercise your ruling authority, serving both as a diplomacy hub and housing space for some of your party members.\nYou can explore your town freely, visiting crucial hot spots like the market square or walking inside every building you have constructed.\nWorld\nFor Regalia, we have opted for a classic overworld map. However, you will find no content gating here - everything is discoverable right off the bat. The world itself contains both static and procedural elements, so no two playthroughs will be the same.\nOur map is divided into small regions, all of them containing many different goodies. You will be able to explore these regions both with your main party (led by Kay, naturally) and with the so-called expeditions - a group of party members hand-picked by you, the player. Such expeditions may be then issued orders, carrying out exploration and gathering duties in your stead.\nAnd what exactly lies on the map? Dungeons (with randomized interiors, rewards and enemies!), crafting materials, treasure caches and also something we are really excited about - text adventures. Each of those adventures is a really short, self-contained story that you will be able to influence through your choices.\nFinally, there's the Codex, which contains huge amounts of extra lore and background information. At the same time, it is dynamic, filling up as you travel around the nooks and crannies of the world.\nIn-game world map\nSocial Links\nEach inhabitant of your village, be it a companion or a villager, has a unique social link you can pursue.\nBeneath every link lies a short story focusing on a particular character. To advance the link, you will have to spend time with him or her, listening to their experiences and reacting accordingly.\nAs you work on your relationships, your links will go through 5 stages, each stage bringing something tangible that would aid your gameplay. New crafting recipes will unlock, store discounts will be given, new skill modifications will appear - and so on. In addition, some links may contain hidden quests; completing those will reward you with fantastic pieces of loot and money.\nDiplomacy\nWe mentioned diplomacy before, and indeed, 6 factions can be found in the game. As each is mutually exclusive with its political rival, this leaves you free to ally with 3 of those in a single playthrough... and make enemies of the other 3.\nIn general, diplomacy works similarly to Social Links. However, instead of befriending specific characters, you befriend whole nations. Remember, though: as one faction slowly becomes your ally, its rival will start to resent you, which in turn will make your progress more difficult.\nNaturally, securing an ally grants you perks, such as economic benefits, faction-specific buildings or, last but not least, a unique party member. A total of 6 faction characters can be recruited, but - due to aforementioned rivalries - only 3 will be available to you in a single playthrough.\nTo encourage partaking in diplomacy, we tried to make our factions colourful, unique and instantly recognizable. We will discuss them in greater detail in future updates; however, at this point, we can already share that you will encounter nordic elves, samurai dwarves, Arabian Nights-esque gnomes... and more!\nAll six factions of Regalia's world\nTime\nThe main campaign lasts two years of game time. Time is a scarce resource, and so you will have to manage carefully, dividing it between combat, exploration, diplomacy and social links. You and your progress will be evaluated every three months. Fail, and it's game over!\nWe designed the game to make it impossible to achieve everything in a single playthrough. Simply put, there won't be enough time. If you want to beat that secret superboss (and you can bet there will be one), better start working on your muscles right from the start.\nDon't fret, though. If you happen to be a completionist, all progress can be carried over to the next playthrough via the New Game+ feature.\nPlay the way you want\nRegalia features a dynamic scoring system that evaluates your progress every three months of game time. You can achieve your goals in multiple ways, focusing on the part of the game you enjoy most - fighting, exploring or socializing.\nThough the main story itself is linear, the bulk of it unveils every three months. Apart from those \"story clamps\", we chose a hands-off, sandboxy approach. You'll be given a large set of quests and objectives generated uniquely for you - ones that do not aim to railroad the content, enabling you to proceed according to your own wishes.\nPerhaps you'll finish a chapter doing nothing but slaying monsters. Perhaps you'll dedicate yourself to improving social links and crafting. We won't penalize you for this; instead, we want to provide rewards for both balanced and specialized approaches.\nMinor things\nWe aim to make the game's smaller systems as fun as the core of the project. To list a few: characters and villagers talk to each other, producing tiny, optional banter cutscenes, weapons and armors can be socketed with gems, weather phenomena happen in the form of rain and snow, skills can be upgraded and customised, seasons may open or block passages around the world, each week brings a new set of unique buffs (or debuffs!)... oh, and there's a truckload of references to many classic video games.\nAll backgrounds are hand-drawn in glorious 2D, while characters are rendered in 3D (why?). Every character and background is unique - we don't use tilesets or templates for our assets.\nOur lead artist, Runshin, has chosen an art style which blends a familiar Japanese vibe with a hint of western influences. Inspired by works of George Kamitani, our characters are vibrant, colorful and slightly disproportionate, helping them achieve the additional \"pop\".\nThe use of 3D elements allows us to leverage all the goodies that come with the third dimension, like reflections, dynamic shadows and lights, or Havok physics calculations for both gravity and cloth simulation. In the end, there is nothing funnier than launching a physics-afflicted zombie into the air, right?\nRegalia features an original soundtrack produced by Game Audio Factory, known for their fantastic sound-work in Endless game series. The composer for the score is H-Pi (Trackmania, Aarklash Legacy). We are using live instruments for many parts of the music; as you will notice, in the battle theme below, both violin and trumpets were recorded live.\nThe game will ship with a full OST produced by GAF and will be available on their bandcamp page and most digital platforms.\nHere at Pixelated Milk, we are all huge fans of Yuzo Koshiro's music, the man responsible for the amazing music of Etrian Oddysey games, and we hope you will recognize his spirit in our soundtrack.\nYou can listen to Regalia's main battle theme below.\n\nThis is not your typical fund-my-life campaign. Everyone on our core team (writing, design, code) has been working for free for the past six months. Throughout the journey, we have supported ourselves either through our day jobs or personal savings. Every single dollar earned here will go towards content creation: 3D models, 2D art and music.\nUp until this point, Regalia had been funded from savings and a bank loan - in other words, out of our own pockets. Over the course of the last six months, we have completed around 50% of all game systems. This includes a combat system, which is feature-complete and currently in polishing stage, procedural world map elements generation, item and skill systems, dialogue and cinematic systems and all base engine work.\nWe have completed all major character designs and a large part of 2D hand-drawn backgrounds. 3D model creation is currently at around 20%, with models completed for the majority of the main cast. \nHere is a quick graph showing the projected split for the 40k USD funding level:\nTaxes and Fees include Kickstarter and Amazon fees, legal fees for setting up a Kickstarter from Poland and a handful of our domestic taxes. Yep, that's a 25% of the funding down the drain right from the start. ,_,\nSoftware Licenses will allow us to invest in software licences for new employees.\nMusic & Sound covers the costs of producing a full soundtrack to accompany our battle theme. Everything will be composed by Game Audio Factory and performed with the use of live musicians.\nFinally, Art allows us to keep our current artists employed while expanding into additional 3D and 2D artists.\nWe are a small, fresh studio, united by the shared dream of creating games. We lack long resumes and work experiences of other projects, but we try to compensate for it with hard work and transparency. For us, your trust is the key to making this possible.\nPixelated Milk is based in Warsaw, Poland, with some of the team members working remotely from the other parts of the country.\nThe team consists of:\nBartosz \u0141ojewski, project lead and main programmer\nLucjan Pakulski (http://runshin.deviantart.com/), lead artist\nJ\u0119drzej \u0141ojewski, writer\nArtur \u015awi\u0105tek, designer, co-writer\nTomasz Niezgoda, animator and designer\nPatryk W\u0105siewicz, programmer\nSylwia Pakulska (http://sylwiapakulska.deviantart.com/), 2D artist\nDaria Wadas-Modrzejewska (http://yaminolady.deviantart.com/), 2D artist\nShaham Imtiaz, 3D artist (https://www.artstation.com/artist/polymator)\nPawe\u0142 Krzepis, concept artist\nMariusz Wojciechowski, tester and designer\n\u0141ukasz \u015aledziewski, PR and marketing specialist, designer\nJason Summers, PR and marketing specialist", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou heard it a thousand times already - making games is risky stuff. Not to mention this risk increases significantly when you are making games as fresh-faced newcomers, without the aid of industry veterans.\n\nWe did the best we could to minimize this risk. Our team, despite lacking experience in the industry per se, has hard, verifiable skills in programming, 2D art, 3D art, animation and project management. \n\nWe have also invested heavily in this project from our own pockets. Personal savings, family loans and finally a big bank loan enabled us to prepare a prototype for this campaign and code most of the significant game systems. This phase wasn't easy, and we had experienced many difficulties, but ultimately persevered.\n\nWith the majority of critical engine obstacles resolved and core systems implemented, we are confident that the programming itself poses a minor risk. Gameplay scope is kept razor-sharp and we have trimmed all the redundant fat to avoid feature creep or unnecessary bloating. Stretch goals were also thought through to prevent shooting ourselves in the foot through the way of drastic changes.\n\nAs we see it, the biggest risk lies with creation of content. Regalia is extremely art-heavy. Our current artists are tasked to 100% of their capacity, and we would like to have all the pretty things made a little bit faster. Having only one 3D modeller makes for yet another challenge - in this case, some redundancy is very much required. To mitigate all those risks, we plan to hire additional 2D and 3D artists after this campaign concludes..\n\nWithout a doubt, the biggest risk lies with the eventual quality of the game itself. When you are working on something day after day, it's easy to stop being objective about your product. To mitigate this, we have done two things. Firstly, twice a week, we hold brainstorming sessions, where we evaluate the quality/fun factor of what has been produced. Every team member has equal footing here to avoid the \"the boss said it's good, so it's good\" situations. Secondly, we are testing our creations with small focus groups, independent of the main team.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "New JRPG from Pixelated Milk.

Thirty years ago, The Bard\u2019s Tale put Brian Fargo and Interplay on the map and launched a storied career crafting some of the most beloved cRPGs in gaming history.\nToday, we return to Skara Brae for the long-awaited dungeon-crawling sequel to the Bard\u2019s Tale trilogy -- the games that helped define the genre.\n[French Translation] [German Translation] [Spanish Translation] [Polish Translation] [Russian Translation]\nA single-player, party-based role-playing game, rich in exploration and combat\nDungeons filled not just with dangerous fights but with challenging puzzles and devious riddles\nDynamic phase-based combat, where the pace of battle is animated and fluid, but still gives you time to think and respond to your enemies\nA game set to beautiful Gaelic music, where the Bard\u2019s songs and melodies affect gameplay\nCo-funded by fans and inXile: if this game hits its $1.25 million goal, inXile will put in at least $1.25 million of its own money to double the initial budget!\nBuilt using Unreal Engine 4, for PC, Mac and Linux.

We can also be found on localized social media in Polish, Czech and Russian.\nActual Handmade Reliquary Box\nWhy the Bard's Tale?\n30 years ago, a small company by the name of Interplay produced a cRPG titled Tales of the Unknown I: The Bard\u2019s Tale. This game was crafted at a time when the RPG genre was growing and being defined by an endless stream of innovative releases. In this period dominated by Wizardry and Ultima, The Bard\u2019s Tale was an unexpected hit, putting Interplay on the map. Brian went on to produce many of the RPGs we still love to this day, including Wasteland, Baldur\u2019s Gate, Fallout, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and many more. The Bard\u2019s Tale was also one of the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, and The Bard\u2019s Tale III was featured in the Smithsonian\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Video Games\u201d exhibit.\nDuring our successful crowdfunding campaigns for Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, our legions of generous backers stunned us with their outpouring of support, proving those games still had an audience that was willing to help make them happen.\nAs we began to look into our next project, we were flooded with requests from many of our supporters who wanted us to return to The Bard\u2019s Tale universe. The dungeon crawl genre it represents has largely been forgotten by mainstream publishers. What better time than the 30th anniversary of the original for us to bring The Bard\u2019s Tale back to life with a true dungeon crawling sequel, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV!\nCraft your party, your way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to develop, progress and grow a party of adventurers as you see fit. Build a combat-hardened warrior to lead the way, or a spell-flinging Conjurer to provide support from the back lines. A character\u2019s class provides the basic archetype, but as you progress you will tweak and evolve your party to suit your play style.\nThe original Bard\u2019s Tale games allowed you to evolve your magic class characters from the Conjurer and Magician to the more powerful Sorcerer, Chronomancer, Geomancer, and even the feared Archmage, each providing new spell trees to explore. We\u2019re extending this system to all class types for increased levels of customization and tinkering. As your magic and combat abilities grow, you will combine spells and skills from your different party members for increased effects greater than the sum of their parts. Deciding when to evolve your characters has a major impact on the types of spells that become available.\nThe eponymous Bard is of course returning. The Bard is an important member of each party, with magical songs empowering the group in combat or providing a helping hand while exploring and solving puzzles. Your band of adventurers will be influenced throughout the game by the Bard's music. By playing the Rhyme of Duotime, your party will regenerate spell points at increased speed. Switching to The Archer\u2019s Tune will greatly increase your party\u2019s missile damage. Just make sure your bard is well stocked with ale...so his throat doesn\u2019t dry out. \nWe are also bringing back many popular races like humans, elves, dwarves, and including some newly inspired races like the Trow. The races all have their own unique culture and history, integrating your choices more into the game\u2019s narrative. The world and citizens of The Bard\u2019s Tale IV react to your party\u2019s make-up, branching the quest structure and providing a unique experience depending on who is joining you. \n\"In mist-shrouded Skara Brae, in the darkest hours of a winter's night, sometimes can be heard a voice on the wind. The Song of the Maiden the locals call it, a song sung since before the standing stones grew moss, a song of ill fortune, that lures those who hear it to their doom, and drives the melancholy to madness, a song, they say, that must never end, for if it does, the world ends with it.\"\nWhat did the wizard Mangar seek when he cast his spell of Eternal Winter, locking Skara Brae in ice? Why did the invading archmage Lagoth Zanta shatter the Destiny Wand and end seven hundred years of peace? Why did the mad god Tarjan cross the outer planes to burn Skara Brae to the ground and slaughter its people? What secret could drive beings of such great power to again and again lay waste to these ancient isles?\nThe adventurers who put a stop to these fiends never learned the answer to these questions, but now, a hundred and fifty years after its destruction, and the building of a new town on top of the old, another power, greater than all those before, has turned an eye once again to Skara Brae and the time-lost catacombs beneath it, seeking the secret its predecessors failed to find - and once more, a small group of hapless adventurers are all that stands in its way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV brings you back to locations you know and love in the bustling, under-construction town of Skara Brae, though the events of the past years have changed it in ways you might not expect. As always, many taverns dot the city for the party to quaff down large tankards of ale and wet their parched throats. The Adventurer\u2019s Guild is still open and ready to assist. The descendants of the original Skara Brae have picked up where their ancestors left off, so magic users can regenerate at the reliable Energy Emporium (Roscoe Jr.) and restock in the ever-ready Garth\u2019s Equipment Shoppe.\nYou know us as lovers of reactivity, choice, and consequence in our games, and naturally The Bard\u2019s Tale IV is no different. Your actions in and around Skara Brae can change the town forever! As you make choices and complete your quests, other local bards will sing songs of your exploits, which may change the attitude of noblemen, modify the friendliness of merchants, or unlock previously inaccessible buildings. Quests are either offered or revoked based on your influence in the world, so you must choose them wisely.\nTell me more\u2026\nBeing a dungeon crawl, you\u2019ll get to explore the dungeons, forests, crypts, and castles within, underneath, and around Skara Brae as well as worlds beyond the lands of men. The emphasis is on exploration, mystery, discovering new locations, and fighting your way through traps and monsters. Secrets abound in these dungeons, and the world is shrouded in mystery. Like the originals, movement and dungeon design is grid-based, but the game allows you to toggle the grid off and move freely if you prefer.\nWe have a passion for non-linear level design and The Bard\u2019s Tale IV embraces this concept. While you explore the world, you will reach areas, obstacles, and monsters you won\u2019t be able to defeat. By venturing out into new areas, developing additional skills and spells, or finding enchanted weapons and armor, you can return with a new set of tools better equipped for the job. Definitely expect a challenge; this game won\u2019t be easy.\nChallenges beyond combat await you. Dangerous traps dot the dungeons, and you\u2019ll need a deft hand to find your way through them \u2013 as well as a keen sense of mapping. With the full rights to use all of the content, story, and setting of the original games, we are returning to many of the familiar trappings and challenges. But don\u2019t worry.  If you find yourself completely stuck, just turn your way to a Magic Mouth, those perfectly ordinary hint-givers that come in the shape of giant talking stone walls.\nA big part of true dungeon crawls is the combat. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV utilizes a dynamic phase-based system to resolve such encounters. What do we mean by that?\nCombat is resolved in a phase-based manner, meaning your entire party takes its turn, and then all enemies take theirs. In the original trilogy, you\u2019d make all of the decisions at once and only then see the results. For The Bard\u2019s Tale IV, we want a more dynamic experience: as soon as you decide what a character will do, they immediately act. This is the first way in which battles dynamically change, as your rolls and effects can have a variety of outcomes which might make you rethink your next action.\nWhen we say that combat is dynamic, we also relate that to the game's pace and feel. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to give your commands as quickly as you want, even while the animations of your previous commands are still playing out. This removes the tedium of waiting around for animations to finish before the system accepts your next input. And of course, your enemies are a major part of keeping the system dynamic \u2013 you'll need to examine the battlefield and react accordingly to win, including being aware of abilities that directly counter other abilities.\nSpecial abilities will also be a huge emphasis for the game. The Magician class, for instance, uses their powers to enchant and change the properties of objects by manipulating their physical environment. By casting Ybarra\u2019s Mystic Shield, the air in front of the party becomes an invisible shield. Illusions and summoning is a pillar of The Bard\u2019s Tale universe too, so expect your foes to be summoning their own monsters while constantly evolving the tactical nature of the combat at each turn. Running backwards will not be a viable survival strategy!\nPhysical Manipulation of Items and Puzzles\nItems, weapons, armor, and specialized loot are a big part of dungeon exploration. You will want to equip (and conjure) yourself with the best gear, including armor, gloves, helmets, shields, weapons, instruments, rings, and wands.\nThe sense of discovery and mystery doesn\u2019t stop with the environment. Many items hold their own secrets that you\u2019ll need to discover by carefully examining them. Similar to the intriguing video game series The Room, by thoroughly studying special objects, you can unlock ways to enhance or modify their properties. After looting a chest, for instance, you might find a dagger with suspicious holes dotting the blade. After examining it closer and rotating two oddly shaped discs on the hilt of your newly found weapon, a small compartment opens revealing a clock-like dial. Twisting this dial properly and locking it into place, you notice a viscous poison dripping from the blade which will add additional damage to each attack.\nPLAY\n\nWe extend this physical manipulation element into a rich variety of challenges. Dungeons are filled with diabolical puzzles that unlock anything from shortcuts to secrets, to extra loot, and often you\u2019ll need to think of clever ways to use your arsenal of spells and skills to get through them. \nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV has a strong fantasy heritage and represents a leap forward for this genre. We intend to craft its world and creatures with a unique stylistic approach to make the game all the more memorable, with a distinct artistic theme that is instantly recognizable and layers of rich detail that make the bustling world come alive.\nIn both its music and visuals, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV draws heavily from many elements of Scottish culture. We plan to integrate Scottish architecture in the look of Skara Brae and the game\u2019s dungeons and wilderness.\nReference photos from inXile's Scotland trip\nIn many cases we directly take real-life objects, specially photographed, and convert them into 3D objects using the process of photogrammetry. We then take the processed 3D objects and tweak them to end up with authentic and gorgeous game assets that perfectly suit our stylistic approach.\nPLAY\n\nWho is making The Bard\u2019s Tale\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is brought to you by inXile Entertainment, led by Brian Fargo. Brian was directly involved in the creation of all three The Bard\u2019s Tale games in the 80s, the first game launching his long and storied career at Interplay and inXile through the 90s to now.\ninXile has embraced the crowdfunding model fully, delivering the fan favorite Wasteland 2 (over 70,000 backers raising over $3 million), and following it up with Torment: Tides of Numenera (over 90,000 backers raising almost $4.9 million and still going). We doubled Wasteland 2\u2019s crowdfunded budget with our own funds, and continue to support it with the upcoming Game of the Year Edition, which will be released as a feature rich and extensive free upgrade to all PC backers and buyers.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is spearheaded by the same team that delivered the award-winning Wasteland 2.\nAs always, inXile Entertainment is proud to be a part of Kicking It Forward, pledging to spend 5% of our eventual profits back into crowdfunding projects.\nIf you\u2019ve already pledged at any tier $20+, you can include add-ons with your pledge.

Desperate to save the integrity of his story from the whims of his players' crazy characters - a horny bard, wild sorceress, and cryptic monk - Lodge allows Joanna (Carol Roscoe), Cass's (Brian Lewis) ex-girlfriend, to join the game. With Joanna's help, the group's characters trek deep into the fantasy game world to retrieve the Mask of Death from the evil necromancer Mort Kemnon (Geoff Gibbs). Will their choices in the game save their friendships in real life . . . or will Mort Kemnon triumph unopposed?\nThe Gamers: Dorkness Rising feature in full, glorious 1080p!\nSubtitles: English, German and Spanish.\nCast Commentary, Crew Commentary\nTrailers: The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, The Gamers: Hands of Fate\nBacker Credits\nDouble the content!

Kickstarter has finally adapted to making shipping much easier to track and budget for, so there will be a shipping add-on when you select your reward level. We continue to be disappointed at the high cost of international shipping, but our top people are working on that teleporter project. We expect to have that sorted any century now. In the meantime, we are also looking for international partners who can manufacture and distribute overseas to help keep those costs down. \nDead Gentlemen Productions is a group of filmmakers located in the Northwest Washington area of the Pacific Northwest. The group largely met while they were in college, formed an LLC after graduation, and have been making geeky comedy together for 15 years. Some members of Dead Gentlemen Productions went on to found Zombie Orpheus Entertainment with designs on solving some of the distribution problems afforded by Hollywood. The result is their Creator-Distributed, Fan-Supported model which Dead Gentlemen Productions has embraced completely. \nBetween Zombie Orpheus Entertainment and Dead Gentlemen Productions, we have created such titles as:\nDemon Hunters\nDemon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake\nThe Gamers\nHouse Rulez\nThe Gamers: Dorkness Rising\nJourneyQuest Seasons 1 & 2\nThe Demon Hunters RPG and Brotherhood Orientation Video\nThe Gamers: Hands of Fate\nThe Gamers: Humans & Households\nThe Gamers: Natural One\nSketch comedy and live improv, like Gamers: Live and Hat Trick Pony\nAnd we have much more to come, thanks to you!\nPoster art by Conner Marx", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have experienced quality issues with Blu-Ray authoring in the past. To help resolve this, we are going with a proven company to author this Blu-Ray from start to finish. \n\nA note on fulfillment: We are expecting to receive the inventory prior to departure to Gen Con in Indianapolis. We will not get to fulfilling this Kickstarter until after Gen Con, so mid to late August. Please be aware we are intending on selling this inventory at Gen Con and have factored in the extra inventory into the cost. Do not worry, we will not sell your copy(ies). But we will not have time to fulfill the Kickstarter before we go. Selling these Blu-Rays will help keep us financially stable, as we typically do quite well at Gen Con. The other rewards however, will not be offered at Gen Con. Just the Blu-Rays. \n\nThat said, being that we have not worked with this vendor for Blu-Ray authoring before, there may be delays that move us past our ability to sell at Gen Con. We will make every effort to be clear in our communications and set the correct expectations so that we get the best quality Blu-Ray possible, and reach our fulfillment goals. If all goes well we hope you will be receiving your rewards by the end of August or beginning of September at the latest. \n\nWe will be using BackerKit once again, which has proven invaluable for fulfilling rewards efficiently, as well as raising more money for the project after the campaign has ended. The typical survey you get after the Kickstarter will come from Backerkit, and we will send that out 1-2 weeks after the campaign has ended.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #76", "update_userinfo": "Amazon Prime!

Thanks for your support.\nYooka-Laylee is an all-new 3D platformer from the creative talent behind the Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country games. We\u2019ve come together to form Playtonic Games and create a spiritual successor to our most cherished work from the past!\nOur new heroes, Yooka (the green bloke with no pants) and Laylee (the wisecracking lady-bat with the big nose) were conceptualised from the ground up for stellar platforming gameplay, created by the same character artist behind the rebooted Donkey Kong family and legendary N64 heroes Banjo and Kazooie.\nUsing an arsenal of special moves like Yooka\u2019s tongue grapple and Laylee\u2019s tactical sonar blast, players will explore \u2013 and expand \u2013 gorgeous 3D worlds drawn up by esteemed environment artist Steven Hurst (Banjo-Kazooie series, Viva Pinata) and through skill discover the plethora of delicious collectibles hidden within.\nWe did this in 3 months. It took me almost that long to write this page.\nHeroes Built for Fun: Our new buddy-duo were dreamed up specifically for entertaining platforming gameplay and exceptional colour coordination. We think we've captured the spirit of our past heroes while introducing our most inventive moves yet.\nAn Arsenal of Abilities: Sonar blasting, tongue whipping, sky soaring\u2026 a move roster built for platforming fun \u2013 and unlocked with added freedom. Additionally, there may or may not be a move involving a giant fart bubble.\nYooka regretted filling out that PPI claim.\nA Dream Soundtrack: David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) and Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) combine in what's sure to be a melodic masterpiece! Seriously, clean out your ears - they're in for a treat.\nCollect-em-up 2.0: A roster of shiny collectibles with gameplay progression at their core (as well as other, more valuable materials). Every collectible type in our new game will expand gameplay in a meaningful way. Yes, we employ the man responsible for DK64's myriad of trinkets, but we've had a stern word. Our main collectible, Pagies, are used to unlock and expand new worlds in Yooka-Laylee.\nExpandable Worlds: Experience more of the playgrounds you love by spending collectibles to expand your favourites into bigger, more challenging worlds.\nTake (musical) note: our new collectibles are work in progress.\nA Cast to Last: A huge cast of memorable characters to meet (or beat) brought to life by the art and audio teams behind Banjo-Kazooie and destined to endure in future games as part of Playtonic Universe. Expect all manner of grunts, squeaks and squawks.\nIntroducing Play Tonics: Discover these unique gameplay modifiers and use them to customise gameplay to suit your style. Will you run faster, hit harder or fly further? Also, are they named after our studio or vice versa? We'll never know.\nArcade machines: Each world hides at least one secret arcade game encasing old-school gaming goodness. Complete its retro-tastic challenge to claim your Pagie!\nYou can expect accurate bat physics.\nDuring their adventures Yooka and Laylee will complete challenges to unlock and collect Pagies. These golden collectibles are the main currency in the game, used not only to unlock new worlds but expand them too.\nIt's snow joke, this world's going to be cool.\nIn the jungle world showcased in this Kickstarter for example, new islands containing advanced features and challenges will become available once you\u2019ve decided to hand your Pagies over to the world-building construction crew.\n\nDon\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s? Spend your Pagies elsewhere. If you desire, world expansion can be ignored entirely and you can hop, skip and roll your way through the standard worlds towards the final boss lurking in his or her mighty keep. And once the pivotal villain is nought but ash on the pavement, you can still opt to explore the expanded worlds with your full moveset post-credits to hunt down those leftover Pagies.\n\nYooka-Laylee will feature a truly mouth-watering (ear-leaking?) soundtrack created in collaboration by three of gaming\u2019s greatest composers, the legendary David Wise (Donkey Kong Country, Diddy Kong Racing), equally esteemed Banjo-Kazooie composer Grant Kirkhope (Viva Pi\u00f1ata, GoldenEye 007) and Banjo sound effects supremo Steve Burke (Kameo: Elements of Power). \nThis is one musical performance you definitely won\u2019t want to miss! Don't believe us? Listen to the early excerpts below and tell us you're not excited. Go on, we dare ya.\n'Jungle World' (working title / progress) by Grant Kirkhope:\n'Jungle Challenge' (working title / in progress) by David Wise:\n  What's more we've already had Chris Sutherland - part time programmer, full time voice actor extraordinaire - locked in the recording booth to bring his iconic 'gibberish' style to the characters (and googly-eyed objects) of Yooka-Laylee, ensuring a genuine audio treat. You might as well play it with your eyes closed, to be honest.\nIf our initial Kickstarter funding goal is reached, backers can be assured that the Playtonic team will deliver a complete and satisfying game package. However, given the opportunity and additional resources required, we have a list of \u2018dream\u2019 additional extras \u2013 and release structures - that we\u2019d love to deliver in order to make Yooka-Laylee an even better game.\nIf funded, Yooka-Laylee will be released for Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Wii U. However, the exact release timing and scope of each version will be determined by the success of this Kickstarter campaign and specifically, our stretch goals.\nWe\u2019d love to be able to guarantee a simultaneous, day-one release on all platforms in order to satisfy every Yooka-Laylee backer. In order to do this we\u2019ll need to significantly expand our resources and budget, and if we can reach the funding number required we\u2019d be excited to do so.\nAny extra money will of course go towards improving the game. Below is an example of some of the extra features we\u2019ll be able to fulfil by reaching stretch funding goals:\n What the Bleedin\u2019 Norah is a Toybox? Our Toybox experiences are designed to deliver hands on time with Yooka and Laylee before the game even comes out. You can be the first to take our heroic duo for a spin (literally, if you press X) but we promise this self-contained plaything won\u2019t spoil the full game: It\u2019s built from in-game assets arranged specifically for this experience. There won\u2019t be any objectives to beat, just a controllable duo, nice music and a few surprises too\u2026 !\n Toybox ++ The Enhanced Playtonic Toybox? Well of course, sir. A fine choice. I\u2019ll prepare the improved play space, advanced props and special moves right away. Oh I\u2019m sorry, are those sports shoes? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\n   It'll look something like this: (work in progress!)\n     [Updated 08 June] The concert will be in Stuttgart, Germany at the Hegel Saal on October 30th 2016 \u2013 David and Grant are confirmed with more details to follow soon\u2026!  \nThe Playtonic Team, composers and our backers will meet up in Stuttgart \u2022 You will be our VIP guests, we\u2019ll all sit together at the concert and dinner and discuss the potential reasons why Grant talks so fast \nYou may want to know more details before pledging, so please get in touch with us on kickstarter@playtonicgames.com or check out the organisers Facebook page here; https://www.facebook.com/rareconcert/info?tab=page_info\n    Playtonic was formed in 2014 by veterans of Rare Ltd. Between them, the seven-person Playtonic team has over 100 years of combined experience working on blockbuster franchises such as Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pi\u00f1ata and Kameo: Elements of Power \u2013 and using this Kickstarter we intend to grow our talent even further! Allow us to introduce the team (so far)\u2026\nOur plan is to have Yooka-Laylee ready to ship on PC, Mac and Linux by October 2016. Console versions will follow shortly after, dependent on resources and the performance of this Kickstarter campaign. However, if our crowdfunding is a big success and stretch goals met, then we will look to secure the resources required to pull off a simultaneous, day-one release on all major console platforms alongside PC, Mac and Linux.\nIn order to finish Yooka-Laylee we will need to expand our team to an \u2018N64 size\u2019 roster of around 15, which we\u2019ll look to do immediately upon reaching our funding goal. Therefore the vast majority of our budget will be allocated to wages and office space, plus the cost of outsourcing sound, testing and version creation. \n\nYooka-Laylee is a real passion project for the Playtonic team and we\u2019ve all made financial sacrifices to get it this far. We\u2019ll finish the game at a smaller scale even if this Kickstarter doesn\u2019t succeed, but the game will be bigger and better if it does! \n                                                                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development can be a harsh taskmaster, with time and financial constraints often providing unexpected challenges that can ultimately lead to changes and delays. Fortunately, the Playtonic Games team has collectively been involved in more than 30 different games across more than ten different platforms and has great expertise in the 3D platformer specifically, with a strong track record of shipping some of the genre\u2019s greatest hits. \n\nSo not only do we have extensive experience delivering quality releases within this genre, but we\u2019re also well versed in working under the pressures of strict deadlines, budgets and high expectation. We\u2019re very confident we can deliver a game that lives up to fan expectations, on time and on budget.\n\nAnother challenge is to find the perfect balance between our own ideas for Yooka-Laylee and the expectations of the community. We\u2019re well aware that many fans are deeply, passionately attached to our past work and in some ways probably understand and adore its intricacies even better than we do. That\u2019s why over the coming months \u2013 and during this very Kickstarter campaign \u2013 we\u2019ll be consulting the community on some design issues and then ultimately making the final decision within our development team on the absolute direction.\n\nIn the past our most famous games have been single-platform releases. However, backers can be assured that the Playtonic team already has the necessary experience and channels to deliver a multiplatform release, and if certain stretch goals are met we\u2019ll recruit in this area to deliver different versions of our game to an even smoother deadline. This is also one of the reasons we've decided to create the game using the versatile Unity engine.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #77", "update_userinfo": "2021, here we come!", "update_content": "Hey backers, long-time no speak!\nYooka-Laylee news\nWe come bearing the news that we are still chipping away at the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of the 64-bit Tonic.

Your name will be displayed under the clan of your choice!\nMiriam\nPicked up as an orphan by an Alchemist at a young age, she became a host for the dark Alchemists\u2019 curse. Although the magi-crystals were fused with her body at a young age, for 10 years she lay sleeping while the curse matured to its full form. It was during this period that the demons arrived, meaning that she missed their appearance and awoke with a mild form of amnesia, not quite fully understanding what happened to her.\nShe is a woman of few words but strong of purpose. Her youth is deceiving, making her seem confrontational and quick to judge, though in reality she is constantly evaluating her next step. The pain she felt as an orphaned child fuels her compassionate desire to protect her loved ones and friends.\nGebel\nOriginal host for the magi-crystal curse that summons demons to the planet. Gebel (JEE-bill) was the only one to survive its effects at such a high level. He destroyed the guild that created him, but in doing so realized he was no longer human and had no place on Earth. This in turn, lead him to summon the demon castle from hell to appear on the planet.\nIt is said that his real purpose in summoning the castle was to give Miriam a place of her own, but as his Magi-crystal disease progressed, he soon forgot his own reasoning. The more he surrounded himself with hell-spawn, the quicker the magi-crystals engulfed his body. He continues to plot the downfall of man, and how to best convince (or use) Miriam to achieve his dark ambition.\nJohannes\nA member of the defunct Alchemist guild and Gebel\u2019s best friend. Johannes (yo-HAH-nis) was the only Alchemist who dissented with the plan to call demons to the earth to cement Alchemy as the prevalent philosophy. His rejection of the other Alchemists\u2019 scheme is what kept him from sharing their fate. He has a vague understanding that Miriam\u2019s awakening and the demon castle\u2019s appearance are no mere coincidence.\nExploration: Bloodstained's story unfolds as you explore Gebel's hellish castle; a sprawling structure that features a variety of locations. As you explore the massive castle you'll find warp gates that will allow you to travel quickly without having to backtrack too much.\nRPG Elements: It's not an Igavania without leveling, and Bloodstained will be no exception. In addition to the classic elements everyone\u2019s come to expect, enemies in Bloodstained will drop a wide variety of items, materials, and magi-crystals necessary to create the items that will get you safely through Gebel\u2019s castle. \nCrafting: As you explore, fight enemies, and complete quests you will gain experience and become more powerful, acquiring a variety of weapons along the way. Enemies will also drop materials you can use to craft new weapons and abilities using Miriam's training in alchemy.\n\n \n \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDarkness lurks around every corner, seeking to corrupt all that it touches. The world is torn between those in power and those the powerful would destroy, and both sides are held in thrall by the demons lust and avarice. Games get delayed sometimes, and it would be dishonest of us to promise you this one won't be.\n\nBut Inti Creates has shipped more than 30 games on eight different platforms, and Koji Igarashi personally oversaw the production and design of one of Japan's most legendary franchises. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the kind of game they love to make, and they've got a lot of experience making them.\n\nBetween us, the people behind this Kickstarter have helped to launch and fulfill several of the biggest, most complicated gaming Kickstarters ever launched. We've spent months trying to get this one right because we believe in the game (and really, really want to play it.) We\u2019re certain the game will be made, and that you\u2019ll get all the rewards you\u2019ve backed for.\n\nIGA has worked for more than a year to prepare and gather support for this game because fans have asked him for it. Now that he's come to you for help, his goal is to make the game you've been waiting for. By backing this campaign, you'll become a part of the process. During and after the campaign he hopes to keep you involved, whether it's voting on swords and whips, telling us how you play his games\u2014as fast as possible, or exploring every hidden passage\u2014or helping us find the perfect style for the graphics.\n\nFinally, the possibility exists that a man scarred by unfeeling, power-mad alchemists could summon a hell-castle filled with demons across the street from Inti Creates headquarters in Tokyo. IGA has as much experience handling that risk as any game designer on earth, but we estimate that it might set production back slightly (depending on whether or not he's allowed to backdash).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #106", "update_userinfo": "Classic Mode and Kingdom Crossover Are Here", "update_content": "Hello, Army of the Night!\nClassic Mode and a new area and boss based on the hit game Kingdom: Two Crowns launched on January 14th.

But in early 2015, in spite of the site's strong and diverse audience and traffic, our corporate overlords decided to sunset the profitable Joystiq network and other enthusiast blogs, jettison the veteran staff with little notice, and archive our 20,000+ articles.\nThe former Massively crew is not giving up so easily. We provided a unique lens through which to view MMORPGs, with diligent editorial oversight, honest opinions, and truly independent coverage, and we did so sustainably. We'd like to keep on doing what we were doing only better, not just because we love MMO blogging but because we know that our community and the greater MMO fandom is unique and worth serving.\nNow we're turning to our readers and fans and the genre itself to ask whether or not this is something you love and want as badly as we do. If it is, we will deliver it to you from our new MMO site: Massively Overpowered on massivelyOP.com.\nHere's what Massively Overpowered can offer you, the MMO player\nCorporate independence. As a small site under a large, faceless corporation, we maintained editorial control, but we were powerless to step in and change how our website looked and operated and how ad sponsors were acquired. Some of the bugs we reported and features we requested in 2010 were still not addressed by the time the lights went out in February 2015, and our website's ad structure was poorly implemented by our parent company. As our own masters, we can ensure that we have exactly the site we want, exactly the sponsors we want, and exactly the content we want. We'll never have to shrug apologetically and tell our readers, \"Sorry, guys; that dead widget or broken comment form or gallery system is out of our hands.\"\nTransparency. Ethics has been the cornerstone of our website from day one. We have always been strict about mitigating studio influence and maintaining our editorial independence. Because our funding will no longer be filtered through a distant corporation, we'll be much closer to our revenue streams. While this will ensure that our core readers have more influence over what we write about, it will also necessitate even more transparency about potential conflicts, which we will deliver unflinchingly. Just as before, we will never let our ad funding dictate our opinions. We will shut down before we do that, end of story.\nQuality. At one of my first events for Massively in 2010, I told some reps from rival sites about my main role on the site: copyediting. They were dumbfounded, and I was dumbfounded that they were dumbfounded because I had no idea that most sites didn't have an editorial process, that their writers just posted what they wanted. That is not how we operate. Even when our budget was stretched thin, we insisted on checking and double-checking our articles to minimize mistakes and improve the clarity and accuracy of our work. If it's got our name on it, we want it to be good. That will never, ever change.\nExperience. We're not new at this. The proposed crew of Massively Overpowered has been making a large-scale, professional blog happen every day for the last five years (some of us longer!), and some of us have been playing the games we're embedded in and are reporting on for almost two decades. We know these games and their developers inside and out, and you know we won't pull our punches. We've already got established connections with studios and fanbases and social media. We already have an existing readership. We already have a network of tech fiends and legal advisors. We know how to get this stuff done.\nCommunity. Not quite two years ago, the head of Joystiq came to me and said, Bree, Massively is growing faster than any website on the network. What are you doing and how can we copy it? The answer was a snap: community. Our comments frequently went viral. We had streams, social media, a weekly article dedicated to highlighting articles from around the MMOverse, and writers hired straight from our readerbase. Fan interaction actually matters for MMO blogs. This is not a genre where people hide in a room and have a single-player experience, even when they are soloing; MMORPGs are social beasts, and our blog will be too. We have never been or will be mouthpieces shouting down at you. We want to inspire vibrant debate in a haven from the toxicity and harassment prevalent in other corners of the internet.\nWhy do we need a Kickstarter?\nIf there's one thing we learned from the experience of shepherding Massively.com, it's that our site could have been making more money (and therefore had more writers and content) if it had been supported and monetized better by our parent company. We probably could have gone the Patreon-only route for Massively Overpowered, but it would have been a much smaller site with fewer writers, less breadth, and less sustainability. The MMO genre is unique and deserves better. Our ambition and dream is to not only survive as we were but grow to restore content we lost in 2014's network budget slashing -- and then some.\nTo make Massively Overpowered both profitable and sustainable and replace the corporate infrastructure we've left behind, we need to do it the right way, all the way. We'll be a company with legal and bookkeeping support. We'll have a professional web designer and tech engineer. We'll have scalable, high-traffic hosting that can handle the hit spikes you send our way. We'll have an ad sales person who is actually a person and not an algorithm. We'll have a website that doesn't burn your eyes and widgets that actually work. And we'll have writers who are actually paid what they deserve for their considerable efforts.\nTo ensure sustainability and redundancy, we need multiple revenue streams. Kickstarter is the first phase of our plan; it'll allow us to repay our writers and tech experts, who are already taking risks, swallowing paycuts, and donating time, equipment, expertise, and money to Massively Overpowered. This Kickstarter will give us the time to fully establish our company, reduce our personal risks, buffer us from setbacks, and hire on the experts we need to do this right. It will not fund us forever; it will merely help us replace and improve on the backend services our parent company provided as we transfer our audience and contacts. Past the Kickstarter, we'll be funded through a combination of ethical ad sales and Patreon support, the latter of which will allow our readers to help direct the types of content they'd like to see. Our community and audience deserve better than financial instability: This is the best way to make that happen.\nWe're trying not to go crazy with stretch goals; the point of our Kickstarter -- and therefore, its stretch goals -- is to fund us while we secure long-term sustainability and buffer us in the event of setbacks. Here's what we've got planned as special perks if the KS does even better than we hoped:\n75K STRETCH GOAL: CONVENTION COVERAGE & MO COMIC\nWe'll have travel budget to send writers to several major cons in 2015, including PAX East, PAX Prime, BlizzCon, and E3 (assuming E3 will recognize us as press again by then). Those of you who followed us at our old site know we took cons seriously and delivered our coverage to you quickly. We'd like to ensure we can do it again. We'll also commit to a weekly, four-panel, hand-drawn MMO comic -- starring Mo and drawn and written by Larry Everett and Jef Reahard -- for the remainder of 2015.\n85K STRETCH GOAL: VIDEO CONTENT\nWe'll wrangle a weekly video program for the site!\nThank you, MMORPG community\nWithout crowdfunding, the old Massively you knew and loved is dead. Our writers would be forced to go their separate ways and scale back to small, fragmented personal blogs. But by kickstarting the former Massively.com staff's new and independent site, you'll be helping us get back to being your morning coffee buddy and your commute companion. In striking out on our own, we have a rare opportunity to escape corporate influences and build a new MMORPG site with you, our readers and commenters, at the forefront. Your encouragment and faith has meant everything to us, and you proved over the last few weeks that our words made a difference and can do so again. We know this is a big task. But we've already got the talent -- now we just need the tools. Help us restore our blog community and rebuild as Massively Overpowered.\nGet the word out!

The player assumes the role of a Cat sailing on the seas in order to reclaim it from the many creatures that now control the waters. With fishing gear in hand and a few nifty gadgets, our hero can climb the ranks from lowly fisherman to master of the seas, unlocking all sorts of new outfits and boats on the way. \nChoosing to chase down legends or simply wanting to sail on the seas in your best outfit are both equally valid ways to experience CatFish. The game is meant to be played at whatever pace is comfortable for the player. \nGame-Feel\nWhen one thinks of sailing, there are certain scenes that people create in their head- most of which are rather beautiful and serene. The feeling of floating in the open sea surrounded by the omnipotent force of the ocean waters is one of beauty, curiosity, and a certain awe-like excitement brought on by a yearning for adventure. Every aspect of how CatFish works, looks, and sounds was made to evoke these emotions in the player. In regards to the visual style, a toony, cel-shaded approach was an obvious choice to steer away from the \"uncanny valley\". This allows us to bend the rules of reality and create fantastical experiences that could not be created as well in any other style.\nThe world of CatFish is filled with fish varying in appearance, behavior, and rarity. While there will not be bosses or dungeons in the traditional sense, certain fish reside in special areas of the sea that will put the feline captain to the test. To claim mastery of the seas, players will need to gather new types of equipment and obtain many different vessels in hopes of taking on these great challenges.\nSome brief highlights of the fishing include:\nQuirky, original equipment like the Canned Tornadoesand Tesla Jellyfish will turn the tide of battle\nFace the Audience as fish gather to watch your battles\nBring fish that aren't on the line into the fight as they influence the battle\nThis is not your average fishing game.\nIn the real world, sea life exists in sunny subtropics, frozen boreal climates and everything in between. In a world with a feline captain, we're taking a more whimsical approach.\nCatFish features several original biomes such as the Pirate Bays, and Fantaseas. Water conditions can vary from calm, raging, and the deep, each with their own varieties of fish. \nTime of day as well as weather conditions will also come into play in CatFish, affecting both your ability to sail and what sort of fish you will come into contact with.\nCatFish also has many islands that function as landmarks for traversing the ocean. Some of these islands, such as the Harbor, bring additional functions into the game. In addition to that, if we surpass stretch goal 5, the feline captain will also be able to fish off of some islands.\nAs the player fishes, the natural order of the sea will be reshaped in real time based on which predators and prey have been added or subtracted from the environment. What once was a dominant species may become extinct, while its former prey may come to thrive in its place.\nHere are some highlights of our dynamic world mechanics:\nIslands and Biomes will change locations when you start a new game, making the game a new experience in every play-through \nFish populations will grow and shrink based on natural predators- including you\nWhat you choose to fish will have both subtle and dramatic consequences in the world around you\nAdventuring in Style\nSet out to sea in your favorite style. Select from fur patterns, costumes and paints to make your cat and ship the way you like them.\nCollect different ships and costumes on your adventure to increase your style and capabilities, as you progress from rafts and rags to yachts and a diverse wardrobe.\nCollect and wear diverse costumes\nSwitch between different fur patterns \nPaint your boat different colors\nUnlock even more options as you progress\nBy reaching our first goal of $6,000 dollars, we'll be able to create the base version of CatFish. This includes:\n7x7 ocean grid (49 islands)\n75 different fish species\n3 different Biomes to Explore\n15 outfits\n7 collectible boats\nIf we reach the first stretch goal, we will be able to expand on the base game by adding the following features:\n8x8 ocean grid (64 islands)\n25 additional Fish; 100 Fish in Total\nAn additional biome to explore (4 in Total)\nMore outifts and fur patterns\nMore boats, gear and other collectibles!\nAt the second stretch goal, we'll be adding two cool new features: Aquatic Mounts and a Camera!\nThe Aquatic Mounts are sea creatures that you can ride in addition to your different boats! These creatures are:\nCheetah Mantaray\nTreehouse Turtle\nSea Horse Carriage\n1 Mystery Bonus Mount\nIn addition we will also be adding the Camera! With it you can:\nTake photos of your adventures\nGet new perspectives you couldn't achieve with just a screenshot\nTake cool photos that will raise funds for new boats and equipment\nUpon reaching the third stretch goal, we will expand the game further by implementing:\n9x9 ocean grid (81 islands)\n25 additional fish; 125 Fish in Total\nAdditional biome type to explore (5 in Total)\nSwimming in the water\nMore outfits and fur patterns\nMore boats, gear and other collectibles!\nIf we manage to reach the 4th stretch goal, we'll be expanding the customization options even further in what we call The DogFish Update.\nFirstly, we'll add a new set of costumes and outfits that your character can wear. Additionally, for those who prefer canines to felines, we're going to add an additional playable character: Dog.\nIf we successfully reach the fifth and final stretch of our initial goals, we will be able to add even more content, including:\n10x10 ocean grid (100 islands) - That's HUGE!\nThe Complete Fishipedia - 150 species of fish!\nAn additional biome type to explore (6 in Total)\nFishing off of some islands\nMore outifts and fur patterns\nMore boats, gear and other collectibles!\nCatFish is a game built on an ocean's worth of experiences and a modest, realistic budget. CatFish is being made because we think it is a game that needs to exist. With a wide variety of creatures, collectibles, and cats, we think this game will be worth every ounce of work and funding it receives.

If there was a dog around, Joel wanted to pet it, and squeeze it, and let it lick his hands.\n We've already been working on a scene where you get to play catch with Joel and a service dog that visited him in the hospital.  We see absolutely no reason why the game shouldn't be full of dogs!\nWe can think of nothing he would have liked more, and we thank you for your generous support. You will receive an PATRON SAINT credit for your donation.\nIn-progress animations to bring dogs in the game to life.\n Content Guidelines:\nOur intention for adding your content to our game is to give you a place to honor those you love, to share your heart, pain, comfort or beauty you find in the midst of all of it.

We want to make ensure the proper artists are credited for the amazing work they do and that we have the releases necessary to authorize us to display the work.\n\nIf you have any questions about this, please reach out to us, before backing!\nA significant portion of the game has already been developed, and the entire game is now planned out from start to finish. We have just three scenes left to build, followed by the process of polishing and refining the game as a whole.\nThe remainder of savings from our teams' families won\u2019t be enough to finish the game, which we're estimating will take roughly eight months.\nWe need a total of $145k to finish this game. Raising $85k through Kickstarter will leave us with about $70k after Kickstarter's fees and the cost of the rewards. If the campaign reaches its goal, the remaining $75k will come from a private loan (up to $25k) and Indie Fund, a group of successful game developers who support the growth of games as a medium (up to $50k). If the campaign exceeds its goal, our private investment will provide the remaining budget. The success of this campaign will allow our team to finish the game by mid-2015.\nDavid Osit and Malika Zouhali-Worrall are Documentary filmmakers who are making a film about the creation of our game in association with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and ITVS to be released in 2015.\nWatch the Teaser Trailer\n \"Not only did this move beyond my expectations for a videogame but also seemed to have no reference point in books or films.

His heart is in the creation of video games and is very excited to be focusing more time in that arena by working closely with the team in a Project Management role on That Dragon, Cancer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk to our project is a delay beyond mid-2015. If our Kickstarter succeeds, this will be unlikely, for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirst, Ryan and Josh have developed and shipped several videogame titles before and know the work involved in finishing a game, including within more limited hardware limitations like the OUYA console. This is not our first shipped title as individuals, but it is as a company.\n\nSecond, to reduce risk as much as possible, we have the entire game planned from start to finish. Most of it is already built, and most of what\u2019s built is beyond a crude prototype stage. We've estimated our remaining development time based on previous building and polishing tasks for this game, plus we've allotted extra time for unforeseen issues, such as with QA for the PC.\n\nLastly, this estimate includes several deadlines that allow us to track overall progress. In the unlikely event we miss a deadline and aren't able to catch up on our own, we'll notify our backers as soon as we're aware of this problem and seek help to provide as small a delay as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "New Accessibility Initiative inspired by Joel", "update_content": "I have this sneaking suspicion that the things that will ultimately matter the most in my life are not the ones I value the most.
