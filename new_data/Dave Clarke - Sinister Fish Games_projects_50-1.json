[{"backer": "Dave Clarke - Sinister Fish Games", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Now the campaign is over you can still pre-order via the ACG website!\nScreen printed meeples are unlocked for all Kickstarter backers!\nBuild and manage your own theme park in Dice Theme Park, where the dice are your visitors and you are working to ensure your visitors have the most fun!\nBut you\u2019re not the only park in town, as other Dice Theme Parks are appearing nearby so you\u2019ll be competing for visitors, attractions, and even mascots, all whilst solving your own unique puzzle of how to maximize the enjoyment of each the dice shaped customers that visit your theme park.\nWill you build the most attractive attractions around or will your efforts have your visitors going elsewhere?\nJoin the ride and find out if you have what it takes to run the best Dice Theme Park!\nDesigned by Daryl Andrews (Sagrada, Bosk, Speakeasy Blues) and Adrian Adamescu (Sagrada, Speakeasy Blues), and developed by Dice Hospital co-designer Mike Nudd (Dice Hospital, Waggle Dance), Dice Theme Park is a dice manipulation and worker placement game for 1-4 players, aged 14+, which plays in about 60-90 minutes\nIn Dice Theme Park, you\u2019ll deploy your staff, welcome visitors (represented by dice), draft Attraction tiles, hire mascots, and upgrade your Attractions to give your visitors the best time ever!\nDice Theme Park is the latest in the line of \u2018Dice X\u2019 games from Alley Cat Games, the publisher who brought you the award winning Dice Hospital. \nAs the successor to one of the most popular Dice Manipulation & Worker Placement games of the past 5 years, Dice Theme Park has a lot to live up to so we\u2019ve made this simple image to show you how they compare.\nDice Theme Park is a completely stand-alone game which builds on the feeling of Dice Hospital. \nIf you enjoyed Dice Hospital you\u2019ll be familiar with the satisfying combos in Dice Theme Park but there\u2019s so much more to explore in the brand new gameplay experience of Dice Theme Park\n\nA French edition will be available to buy through this Kickstarter with Supermeeple!\nA French edition with translated rules, and game component text will be made available through this campaign in association with our friends and partner: Supermeeple. \nSimply back the campaign today and then select a French edition when you checkout from the pledge manager, when it launches later in the year. \nPledge levels available in French:\nBase Game Edition\nDeluxe Edition\nThe \"New Dice X games\" bundle\nThe All in pledge is NOT available in French. Dice Hospital, the Dice Hospital Deluxe add ons box, and Dice Hospital: Community Care are all available now from Super Meeple directly or your (French) FLGS.\nPlease note that delivery of the French edition will be 1-6 months later than the English edition due to various logistical challenges, although we will try to keep you appraised of its production and fulfilment timelines as best as possible.\n\nLes pleges propos\u00e9s pour la version fran\u00e7aise sont les suivants :\nJeu de base \nEdition deluxe\nLe bundle \u00ab Les nouveaux jeux Dice X \u00bb\nAttention : le pledge All-In N\u2019EST PAS propos\u00e9 ; le jeu Dice Hospital, ses extensions Deluxe et Soins Communautaires sont disponibles directement aupr\u00e8s de Super Meeple et de ses partenaires pour les territoires francophones.\n\nMerci de noter que la version fran\u00e7aise sera potentiellement livr\u00e9e de 1 \u00e0 6 mois plus tard pour des raisons logistiques, mais nous ferons en sorte de vous tenir inform\u00e9s et de de tenir les d\u00e9lais le mieux que possible.\nDice Cascading is a new mechanism created for Dice Theme Park by Daryl Andrews and Adrian Adamescu. \nIn Dice Theme Park, when you activate your attractions you\u2019ll pip down the dice that were activated, and then move them to an adjacent tile. You can then activate that tile and move the dice again, creating a cascade that can go on as long as you have tiles to activate. \nIt\u2019s combo-tastic!\nEach player starts with the same hand of staff cards, which give you an income, set your turn order, and grant you a special bonus; as you play you\u2019ll pass the staff cards you played to your left at the end of the round and receive the cards from the opponent on your right. \nThis leaves you with a different hand of cards every round. \nTiming is crucial in choosing which staff card to play this round and which to save for later rounds.\nYou\u2019ll be able to customise your park with various upgrades, attractions, and mascot skills. Each game you\u2019ll create a new park with new combos to explore. \nSynergies between attraction tiles, mascot skills, upgrades, and administrators will mean that every time you play Dice Theme Park it\u2019s a new and exciting experience.\n\nPlaceholder artwork and graphic design used for the expansions. For an explanation of how the expansions change the game see the 'How to play' section below\n\nFor the second cross over promo pack, simply back at a tier also containing Dice Hospital ER: Emergency Roll. See below in the DHER section for more details! \n\nThe deluxe add ons box comes with monorail miniatures which are an upgrade on the monorail cards in the base game.  These are really chunky miniature upgrades!\n\nThe deluxe add ons  pack also includes 2 mini expansions. We're still working on the graphic design for these so the images above don't represent the final expansion and only represent the types of components included. We hope to update this before the end of the campaign!\nThe experimental rides mini expansion adds a re-roll mechanic to the game, which is included on the additional attraction tiles, new meeple skills, and an extra administrator.  Using rerolls can be risky, but with great risk comes great rewards!\nThe Innovations expansion comes with 48 new upgrade tokens and replacement staff cards to help use them. The upgrades help with movement, which helps create cool combos, and score additional points. \nInstead of the base game ability on the staff cards, you can use these new staff cards to build an additional upgrade meaning your park will be full of upgrades!\n\n\n* The Kickstarter pack will be available for purchase at an additional cost directly from the Alley Cat Games website and from conventions\nYou have the opportunity to make this Kickstarter pack even better throughout the campaign.

The staff cards you deploy will set your turn order for the round, give you income, and give you special abilities.\nTurn order is determined by the combined value of the two staff you have deployed. If you have the lowest value, you\u2019ll be first to attract visitors and build new attractions. If you have the highest, you\u2019ll be last!\nEach staff member also has an income they bring to your park. You\u2019ll gain income from both staff members and also from some attractions that bring income in your park.\nSpecial abilities on staff members range from increasing pip values on visitors, moving visitors around your park, and even activating attraction tiles an additional time.\nYou\u2019ll have to think carefully about which staff you deploy. Not just because of the benefits they provide, but also because at the end of the round the staff you deployed will be passed to the player on your left and you\u2019ll get the two that were deployed by the player on your right.\nVisitors in Dice Theme Park are represented by dice, and their pip value represents their excitement and energy.  You\u2019ll attract visitors to your park by drafting a monorail car in turn order. The monorails have set pip values but the colours of the dice placed on them are determined by the order they are drawn from the dice bag.\nThe most excited visitors will stay in your park for longer and earn you more points but the values aren\u2019t the only important factor. You\u2019ll also want the visitors who want to visit certain rides in your park. Some will prefer water rides (blue dice), some will prefer horror rides (green dice), and some visitors will be thrill seekers! (yellow dice)\nEach round, in turn order, you\u2019ll have the option of expanding your park with new attractions and rides. The more attractions you have the more you can keep your visitors happy, earning you points, but attractions cost money to build so you\u2019ll need to think about how much money you need when deploying your staff and building your park.\nAttraction tiles also come with amenities such as toilets, If you collect matching amenities, you\u2019ll get a bonus action. This could be changing a die value, gaining an extra die, or even gaining an extra attraction tile for free!\nEach round, in turn order, you\u2019ll draft cards to hire and train the mascots in your park, giving them abilities and jobs like juggler, photographer, and tour guide, creating a unique team of mascots every game.\nHiring a mascot will cost money but you\u2019ll gain special benefits depending on what ability or job they have ranging from increasing or decreasing dice values, moving guests, scoring points, or earning money.\nThis phase happens simultaneously each round.\nBoost attractions with special abilities by using upgrades. The better the tile, the more expensive the upgrade will be\nYou can upgrade attractions with:\n-Special FX give extra points when activating a tile\n-Merch stands earn money from activating a tile\n-Power generators to allow an attraction to be activated an extra time.\nThe deluxe add ons box includes additional upgrades which are explained in the mini expansions section below\nThis phase happens simultaneously each round.\nEach attraction tile can be activated by a specific combination of dice, and brings in points for each activation.\nTo activate an attraction, place an activation token on it and designate some dice that match the requirements of the attraction. Then, score points shown on the tile and any additional points given by bonuses like special FX upgrades.\nAfter an attraction is activated, the dice used in the activation are pipped down one step and you\u2019ll choose one of them to move to an adjacent tile. You can then use that dice again if it matches the requirement of the next tile. This \u2018dice cascading\u2019 creates a unique puzzle in each park and makes it possible to do some very fun combinations!\nThe real puzzle in Dice Theme park is that each attraction tile can usually only be activated once. You can only activate a tile more than once with the special ability of a card or if the tile has a power generator upgrade.\nThis restriction means you have to think 2 or 3 activations ahead to get the best out of your park.\nIn the last few rounds of Dice Theme Park (last 2 rounds of the 4 round \u2018short game\u2019 or last 3 rounds of the 5 round \u2018full game\u2019) you\u2019ll compete with other players to win awards, which give extra points for being the best or having the most of various criteria such as most money, most amenities, fewest dice in your park etc.\nYou\u2019ll have all game to plan ahead for these as they\u2019re revealed during setup\nAfter all activations are completed and awards are scored, you\u2019ll reset your park by removing activation tokens and pass your deployed staff cards clockwise, then you\u2019ll begin a new round until you\u2019ve completed 4 rounds in a \u2018short game\u2019 or 5 rounds in a \u2018full game\u2019\n\nThe solo mode for Dice Theme Park has been designed by David Digby, solo mode designer of games such as Tinners\u2019 Trail, Eternal Palace, and many more games from Alley Cat Games and elsewhere!\nThe solo mode David has designed for Dice Theme Park follows his challenge style designs, similar to Chocolate Factory, which gained critical acclaim after its release.\nIn Dice Theme Park solo play, you will aim to complete a range of goals whilst also hitting a target score. The more goals you complete the lower the target, the more you fail or choose to ignore the higher number of points you need to win!\nEach combination of goals provides a different challenge to complete allowing you to experience the core fun of Dice Theme Park in a highly replayable solo game. Keep an eye out for special announcements on further solo content during the campaign!\n\nThe experimental expansion adds the risk and reward of experimentation, with the ability to reroll dice through new attraction tiles, new meeple skills and a new administrator. \nThis expansion can be shuffled into the base game and can be used with the solo mode\nThe innovations expansion adds 3 new types of upgrades to to Dice Theme Park; Statues, which give big points but must be built on specific tiles; Hubs, which give the ability to move all dice from the adjacent attractions when activated; and Cable Cars, which allow you to create a network of tiles that act as adjacent to each other for movement purposes.\n\nFor Dice Hospital ER: Emergency Roll previews, please go to the relevant section further down!\nJoin our Discord server and arrange a demo of Dice Theme Park with one of our Demo Team\nCheck out the rules yourself!

Tumour. A city built on the ruins of itself. Beneath the sewers the bones of the old city fester.\nThe troll-king Niduk was exiled, driven into the depths to rot and die. Now twisted by hatred and rage he oversees the small domain he has carved for himself, in a forgotten chapel to a murdered god.\nWhy are you here? A lost bet? A doomed quest for silver? Boredom?\nDoes it even matter?\nALT: A digital mockup of an A5 paperback zine. The art shows the face of a troll, furry and black with a mouth filled with teeth that interact with the text between them in an unsettling way. Gold chains adorn the troll's horns and it wears a gold crown. The title reads \"Treasures of the Troll King\".\nThe crown will be gold foil. We don't need to say much more about that, do we?\nM\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday rpg  about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world.  It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules  light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult  \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by  Free League Publishing.\nM\u00d6RK BORG is copyright Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Stockholm Kartell.\nTreasures Of The Troll King is an independent production by Loot The Room and is not affiliated with Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games or Stockholm Kartell. It is published under the M\u00d6RK BORG Third Party License.\nTreasures Of The Troll King is an adventure designed for one- or two-shot play. You'll need the M\u00d6RK BORG core game to play it, unless you want to convert it to another system. I literally can't stop you doing that and have very little interest in trying.\nThe adventure will be published as an A5 saddle-stitched softcover zine. Internal pages are 135gsm silk and the cover is 250gsm silk with matt lamination and gold foil stamping on Niduk's crown. This is the same specification as The Wretched and will look and feel really nice. \nAs well as the cover art, Johan Nohr has also produced internal artwork for Niduk, the Troll King - the main threat in the adventure. If you pledge, you'll probably get to see that in an update at some point.\n\nALT: A digital mock-up of an A5 zine open to a two page spread. The pages are black and spattered with red and yellow ink spots. The first paragraph starts with a large calligraphic letter G, in red.\n\nThe adventure takes place in two phases - a point crawl through the sewers beneath Galgenbeck in search of the sunken chapel that houses Niduk, the Troll King, and a location-based dungeon in the chapel itself.\nDuring the adventure characters might encounter:\nA pile of forgotten wishes at the base of a wishing well\n The Church of Forgotten Things, a sewer shrine to the discarded treasures of everyday life kept by a strange old man who has forgotten daylight\nThe finger collector, a strange denizen of the sewers who trades in digits\nA forgotten god sealed inside the bells of the chapel, begging for release\nYou'll find a host of weird locations, harrowing creatures, and new Occult Treasures to drop into your game.\nThe dungeon portion of the book mimics the layout of Rotblack Sludge, the introductory adventure found in M\u00d6RK BORG, so it's familiar and easy to use at the table.\nThere are no stretch goals or add-ons and just five standard reward tiers to keep things simple. What you see is what you get!\nFinger Collector is for people who just want the PDF. You'll get an Itch download key and my thanks. \u00a38.\nTroll Hunter gets you the print zine with foil-stamped cover and a PDF copy of the adventure. The Kickstarter edition will be the only one with the foil stamping - future print runs won't have it. \u00a315 plus shipping (to be collected later).\nSupplicant To The King gets you the adventure in print and The God Of Many Faces, a trifold pamphlet adventure. I'll have more details about this in an update during the campaign.  You'll also get PDFs of them both. \u00a320 plus shipping (to be collected later).\nTreasure Hoarder gets you print and PDF copies of Treasures Of The Troll King and The God Of Many Faces, plus a double-sided poster with the cover art on one side and the dungeon map on the other. The poster will be printed at A3 and folded down to A5 when it ships. \u00a333 plus shipping (to be collected later). UPDATE: There will now be the option of two posters. You get one as standard in this tier and will be able to choose which design you want, and will be able to add the second poster through the Loot The Room store after the campaign ends if you want both.\nKeeper Of Occult Secrets is the expensive tier for people who want to help out and have money to burn. Identical to the Treasure Hoarder tier, but I'll write additional content by hand in 66 copies of the zine. This could be new occult treasures, additional encounters, more adventure hooks, or something else entirely.

As a new recruit your abilities and resources are limited so you'll need your wits about you to try and survive. Push your luck to press deeper into the unknown or play it safe and live to fight another day. The choice is yours!\nThe game includes a deck of rooms that you must explore. Some will contain harmless frog swarms, whereas others will hide dangerous frog monsters or even more notorious foes from Hellboy's past! The differently coloured dice represent your limited resources and you must choose carefully when selecting which ones to roll. If you run out of dice or wounds, it's the end of your turn.\n The thrilling Dice Game isn\u2019t the only way to back this Kickstarter because we\u2019re also funding FOUR brand-new expansions for Hellboy: The Board Game. Designed by original developers, Needy Cat Games, each of these expansions builds on the tension-packed, co-operative experience of Hellboy: The Board Game but turns the danger up to 11, thanks to the all-new optional Ragnarok mode.\n\nThat\u2019s right, saving the world just got a whole lot tougher as enemies become stronger and more difficult to defeat. Ragnarok mode can be used to offer an additional challenge to not only these new expansions, but the core game as well. It's perfect if you've breezed through the previous Case Files and want an even tougher experience!\nPlease note, you will need Hellboy: The Board Game in order to play these expansions.\nYou\u2019ve played through the core game, Darkness Calls and The Wild Hunt. Now it\u2019s time to bring the saga to a close with The Storm and The Fury. Armed with a certain magical sword (no spoilers here, just in case), Hellboy must face his toughest foe yet: Nimue in her dragon form. This is the biggest miniature we\u2019ve made for Hellboy: The Board Game and it\u2019s not going to be easy to take her down.\n3D renders of miniatures.\nThe Storm and the Fury includes new miniatures, an epic Case File, new Deck of Doom cards, new Encounter Cards and a new playable version of Hellboy.\nTest miniatures painted by Studio Giraldez. Miniatures supplied unpainted.\n\n\nHELLBOY AND THE B.P.R.D.\nBut that\u2019s not all for Hellboy: The Board Game fans because with the storyline complete, it\u2019s time to move onto a whole new chapter inspired by the B.P.R.D. graphic novels. These three new expansions focus on a different element to make your games of Hellboy more unpredictable and action-packed than ever before.\nWith Hellboy gone, the B.P.R.D. faces a range of horrifying new minions as the world descends into chaos. The Hell on Earth expansion introduces new minions to add to your missions. From swarming Crickets, to demons and Ogdru-Hem mutants, you\u2019re going to wish you were only facing the Frog Monsters from the core game. This expansion includes 15 minion miniatures, the Nesting Site Case File and Encounter cards, plus all the minions can be mixed into existing missions using the previously released B.P.R.D. Archives expansion.\nIf only it were just the minions you needed to deal with... but they're the least of your concerns. In Pandemonium some all-new bosses are here to try and end the world. This expansion includes The Flood Case File, Enemy cards, Unexpected Threat Hammerhead card, Encounter cards and Boss Behaviour Cards.\nWith all that, you\u2019re going to need some new heroes and the B.P.R.D. is here to save the day. End of Days includes new playable agents \u2013 Ted Howards, Sledgehammer, Evolved Abe Sapien and Flaming Liz Sherman \u2013 plus the Eviction Notices Case File, character-specific Deck of Doom cards and Requisition Cards. Use these new agents to tackle the new expansions or return to your favourite missions from the original game and play them again with a fresh cast of heroes.\nTest miniatures painted by Studio Giraldez. Miniatures supplied unpainted.\nCombined with the original Kickstarter or the core game, these new missions make Hellboy: The Board Game infinitely replayable. Please note, you will need Hellboy: The Board Game in order to play these expansions.\n\n\n Tabletop Gaming magazine plays a prototype version of Hellboy: The Dice Game.\nJames from Needy Cat Games and B.P.R.D. consultant Edwin, talk about what you can expect from the new expansions!

As the leader of a noble house seeking the favour of the Emperor you plan to aid in its reconstruction. Collect the materials you need to contribute to rebuilding the Palace monuments, and commemorate the restoration by creating a beautiful painting of his beloved gardens.\nWill your efforts catch the eye of the Emperor, or will your rival nobles be honoured instead? Only one house will win the Emperor\u2019s ultimate recognition.\nEternal Palace is a highly interactive dice-placement Euro game for 1-5 players. Players assign workers, represented by dice, to locations based on their combined value. You'll visit locations to gain resources, rebuild monuments, and gather painting pieces for your masterpiece. \nDice placement\nThe way dice are played in Eternal Palace is unlike any other game. You'll roll dice and secretly group them behind a screen. Your opponents will know what dice you have but not how you'll use them. Will you use the 3/4/5 to visit locations 3, 4, and 5 or will you group them to visit location 12? Or maybe something in between? Predicting your opponents moves and making a surprise move yourself really elevates Eternal Palace to a game that is truly great! Once the dice are locked in, you can either stick to your decision or use some wisdom to manipulate your dice and go somewhere completely different!\nInteractive and positive gameplay\nUnlike other worker/dice placement games that focus on blocking opponents, the interaction in Eternal Palace is focused around mini races at each location. Get to the top of a location's track first and you'll get a bonus point. The race at each location means you'll always be interested in what your opponents are doing. Should you try to catch up or will you focus your efforts elsewhere?\nGreat table presence\nGaining points has never been so beautiful. Each painting layer you gather in Eternal Palace is layered onto your canvas to create a unique painting, which scores you points at the end of the game. If you win one of the race tracks, you'll gain a unique feature piece and a bonus point.\nHand- cut prototype of the painting pieces in action - the cut will be much more accurate in the production version!\nGather painting pieces throughout the game to paint your masterpiece\n\n*All photographs on this Kickstarter page are photos of the prototype, not a pre-production copy of the games, so dimensions, components and colours are subject to minor changes.\n\n- Rahdo\nThe rulebook will be translated into these languages and will be available as a free download from Board Game Geek by the time the game is fulfilled\n\n\nWe're currently working on a storage solution option for the painting pieces and we're hoping to update everyone on the progress of this by the end of the campaign. \nThe Deluxe Edition is limited edition which is unlikely to ever come into retail stores or mass distribution. If it does, it will be at least 3 months after the base game.\nThe miniatures from the deluxe edition come in grey, but they look great when painted!\nKickstarter pack - Fully unlocked\n\n\n\nFor this Kickstarter campaign we have chosen to focus our stretch goals on making the Kickstarter pack even better to reward our Kickstarter backers even more! They will be revealed below once the campaign is funded.\n\nAll stretch goals now unlocked\n\n\nWant to make Eternal Palace even better? In addition to stretch goals that are focusing on the Kickstarter pack, these social goals will improve the game quality for all versions of Eternal Palace.\nFollow the instructions below to unlock some great component quality upgrades \n\nThe image now has over 75 Thumbs so the box will now be upgraded with a spot UV! Click this image to go to the image on Board Game Geek and boost it even more if you haven't already!\nThis Instagram post now has over 300 likes so we've upgraded the rulebook with a linen finish. Click this image to go to the Instagram post.\nThis Facebook post has now been shared over 100 times so all cardboard tokens have been upgraded to 2mm thickness.\nWe now have over 150 retweets, so we've unlocked linen finish on all cards!\nWe now have 300 more Kickstarter followers so all card stock has been upgraded to 330 gsm\nThe deluxe edition will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers and direct orders for at least a 3 month period. It may never enter distribution!\n- Slickerdrips\nGather resources,  recruit advisors, rebuild monuments, and create your masterpiece to gain the favour of the Emperor.\nRoll your dice to see what values you have to play with this round. The player with the lowest total goes first. You'll be able to see each others dice rolls but you'll secretly group them behind a screen, so you won't always be able to predict what other players will do this round\nGroup your dice to visit higher value locations  or keep them separate to visit multiple locations. You'll even be able to manipulate your dice and change your strategy based on the other players' actions.\nVisit locations to gather resources. Visit with more workers to gain bonus resources. Resource gathering spots (and some other spots in the game) are also a race to the top: be the first up the track to gain a unique feature piece for your painting and an extra point for the end of the game\nPlacing a die here, the blue player gains 1 wood. The yellow player placed 2 dice here so gains 3 wood\nAdvisors give ongoing benefits or powerful one-time bonuses. You'll be able to recruit them at spots 1 & 2 in slightly different ways. At spot 1, draw 3 face down cards and choose from them, at spot 2, choose from the face up cards before your opponents hire them.\nPlacing a die here, the blue player recruits an Advisor\nContributing to rebuilding will gain you favour with the Emperor, and an art piece towards your masterpiece. You'll also claim the monument to take credit for your contribution but timing is important and these monuments will change hands throughout the game so only one person can ultimately take the credit. \nPlacing a die here, the blue player pays 1 wood and gains 1 favour. They also gain the painting piece and monument\nCreating your masterpiece is key to being honoured by the Emperor. The locations you visit will gain you a painting piece, which scores points and brings the game closer to an end. You might even get a unique feature piece to add to your painting if you're the first to 'complete' a location. \nFinishing your painting first and getting the longest 'run' of painting pieces will gain bonus points at the end of the game.\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 - a run of 7 painting pieces!\n- Rahdo\nThe solo mode is included in all versions of Eternal Palace\nIn the Solo Mode, you'll play against the Master, an AI opponent. The Solo mode plays similarly to a 2 player game but after you've grouped your dice the Master's dice groups are determined by the flip of a card. \nWhen it's the master's turn he will decide where to go, first checking if any of his dice values are the same as yours (in which case he'll try to beat you there) then checking which dice spots gain him a benefit (like going up a track or taking a monument)\nThe master is a worthy opponent, with 3 difficulty levels to suit all player skill levels. \nThe solo mode also has different sets of cards that can be used, which gives the master a different feel every time. This makes the solo mode very variable and offers a lot of replayability!\nThe solo mode is compatible with all expansions, except the turn order expansion\nThe solo mode is included in all versions of Eternal Palace.\nFull solo rules are in the print and play folder\n\nThe Turn order tokens (included in the base game) give advanced players a way to alter their turn order and perhaps gain an advantage at a pivotal moment in the game! They can be played after dice are grouped but before they are revealed.\nEach expansion adds a unique twist to Eternal Palace.\nLabyrinth\nRace through the labyrinth to gain bonuses. Will you take the longer path to gain additional favour from the Emperor or will you race to the centre?\nExports\nIn the Exports expansion complete export requests at the market by trading goods and you'll gain the benefit of the export. \nYou'll gain the bonus when he export is complete and you'll even be able to visit the fulfil the export request more than once to gain the benefit multiple times\nComposition\nIf you complete specific painting combinations first you'll gain a bonus. Some combination are harder to complete but you'll get better bonuses\n\nThe Labyrinth and Exports expansions are only included in the deluxe edition of Eternal Palace. The Composition expansion is included in the Kickstarter pack (free to all Kickstarter backers)\nThe Labyrinth, Exports, and Composition expansions are also compatible with the solo mode.\n- We're Not Wizards\n Help us make games - We're a small company and we rely on Kickstarter income to survive.

If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store's email address and/or physical address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 6 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment. Costs are shown in the approximate local currency. To double-check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the pledge tier and select your country.\nEU2: Italy, Sweden, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Turkey, Romania.\nAll other EU countries are EU1\n\nActual shipping charges will be charged in the pledge manager and may be cheaper than the amount stated.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, India and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia).\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n April: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development.\n June: Submit Files to manufacturer\n  July & August: Manufacturing\n September: Shipping from China to the UK begins\n October: Arrives in ports\n  November: Fulfilment commences\n  December Fulfilment completed. \n January: Most backers have their copies.\n  PLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in January/February - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nCONVENTION SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at conventions. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before these conventions, but you or a friend are attending the convention, you/they can pick it up from that convention. Conventions we may be attending before fulfilment include UK Games Expo, Origins & Gen Con.\n\nAt Alley Cat Games we're a multicultural team so we're acutely aware of the importance of appropriate research when representing a culture that doesn't reflect our own heritage, even when the setting is fictional like in Eternal Palace. That's why we paid a cultural advisor and involved them in our research on Eternal Palace at an early stage. We made a lot of changes to the game and took on advice for things such as representation, thematic choices and even colour options. \nIt's also important to point out the one aspect of the game that we didn't change, the easels. These were not commonly used in China during the time period, but we felt that they added a table presence and beauty to the game that would not have been as striking had we meticulously represented painting styles in an accurate way.

In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon.

These videos may include content that are stretch goals and may not be unlocked yet.\nCheck out the videos to see what people are saying about the game.\n\"If you like dungeon crawls and you\u2019re up for a challenge, consider exploring Tiny Epic Dungeons. It\u2019s bigger than it looks from the outside!\" - Jonathan H. Liu, Geek Dad. Click to read the review!\nADDITIONAL COPIES AND ADDITIONAL ADD-ONS ARE HANDLED IN CROWDOX AFTER THE PROJECT.\nSee 'Shipping Details' below for shipping rates and VAT.\nTo keep shipping costs affordable, rewards will be shipped from three hubs: US, EU, and the UK.\nRegion-Friendly Shipping\nAll Tiny Epic Dungeons games and Tiny Epic Dungeons accessories will be Region-Friendly for the US, Canada, Europe, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.\nBased on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees.\n*Items added in CrowdOx after the project, that are NOT Tiny Epic Dungeons related, will be shipped from the US and all taxes and VAT for receiving the product will be the backer's responsibility.*\nVAT\nIn compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will be collected in CrowdOx for EU and UK backers. VAT is not included in the shipping cost and will be a separate line item in CrowdOx. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping is very expensive and is a cost we all need to share. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nWorld(B) = Argentina, Belarus, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Romania, Russia, South Africa\nWorld(A) = All other countries, including the UK.\nThe most effective way to assure that we reach all potential upgrades is to share this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, blogs, etc. Share this project with EVERYONE!!\nHere are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nThe 6 defining features of a Tiny Epic game!\n\"Tiny Epic\" is an exclusive series of small box games produced by Gamelyn Games and designed by Scott Almes.\nEach game in the series is entirely unique but strictly adheres to two core values: TINY and EPIC!\n\u2022 TINY being the small box used for each game AND the simple, easy to understand, set of rules each possesses.\n\u2022 EPIC being their surprisingly gratifying gameplay. Each is packed with meaningful decisions, layered strategy, and high replayability, traits not typically found in games this size.\nTo learn more about the series, please visit us online.\nGamelyn Games, LLC. is a passion driven game publishing company based out of Arizona.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

Most of it is created by our wonderful community and will be (or already is) made available for free download on morkborg.com, but there is also exclusive official material.\nIn this Kickstarter is also the official M\u00d6RK BORG GM screen, and a box full of almost-forgotten gods. \n\n\u2716 Thank you Terra Tenebrosa for letting us use the track The Arc of Descent from the album The Tunnels in the Kickstarter video. If you're looking for feverous, experimental black/post-metal, check it out here. \nThis is what this godless tome will look like\nPunish your ears\nTo get into the proper mood, we created this Spotify playlist. Put it on while reading this Kickstarter, and/or when playing M\u00d6RK BORG.\n\u2716 M\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday RPG about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world. It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by Free League Publishing. Check it out here, you might like it.\nSome people said this\n\n\u2716 M\u00d6RK BORG CULT (MBC) is our sub-label for selected, approved and curated M\u00d6RK BORG content by the community. Basically, you send us homebrew stuff and if we like it and it follows our guidelines, we make some edits, art and lay it out before publishing it for free download on morkborg.com. Digital MBC content (including that of zines like this) will always be free, but this is a chance to get some of it in high-quality print form. I mean, you can download the content for free and print it at home too if you want. \n\u2716 Since a few days ago, we are also putting the submissions to MBC on pause. When we started this project we had NO IDEA we would receive as much content as we are, and since we're also working on forthcoming books etc, we simply can't keep up with the demand. So we close it down for a bit, until we've cleared the backlog, at which point we can open it up again.  \n\n\u2716 About six months ago we Kickstarted M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, the first MBC zine. It was a much bigger success than we could have imagined and an unbelievable 1792 backers helped us realize the project. Since then we have received a TON of awesome content submitted to the Cult and we want to collect it into a physical zine once more. So, if you're familiar with MBC: FERETORY, you know the drill. This is pretty much the exact same thing. Oh, and there's also the Official M\u00d6RK BORG Game Master's Screen of Doom and the mysterious shrine IKHON. We'll get to that. \nM\u00d6RK BORG CULT: HERETIC is published by Free League Publishing, same as M\u00d6RK BORG and M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY was. They will handle printing, distribution and digital fulfillment.\n  All these either are or will be available for free download on morkborg.com\n Adventure: Graves Left Wanting. The PCs find themselves buried alive in the vast, ever-changing cemetery of Graven-Tosk. This dark and weird tombcrawl is suitable as a campaign starter or a post-TPK adventure. By Karl Druid \n Adventure: Sepulchre of the Swamp Witch. In a hidden repository deep in the Slithering Swamp is a witch's altar of glyph-covered roots. They say it can fulfill any wish. Could stopping the approaching Doom be within its powers? Only one way to find out. By Christian Sahl\u00e9n. \n Adventure: Bloat. Villagers disappear. Tracks lead to an underground temple of bacchanalian frenzy, reeking of rot, offal and bile. Find them and sate your hunger. By Greg Saunders. \n Rules: Unheroic Feats. Enhance and personalize your classless characters with these optional advancement rules. By Johnny Carhat. \n Class: Sacrilegious Songbird. You struck a deal with a devil and since that woeful day your soul screams but your throat sings sweetly. And so does your purse. A small price to pay. By Karl Druid. \n Class: Shedding Vicar. Armor is weak, clothes a sin and your very skin an abhorrent vanity. Best to remove it all and walk peeled, clean and glistening wet into the night. By Cameron James. \n Creature: The Merchant. Cursed with eternal life and destined to roam the world trading shards of souls for ruinous relics. You never know when this mysterious monger might appear. Will you make a deal? By Johnny Carhat. \n Creature: The Bone Bowyer. This horrid fey lurks in the tangled depths of Sarkash where it fashions heart-seeking bone bows and blood-dyed cloaks from the flesh of the lost. By Matthew Bottiglieri. \n Rules: Blackpowder Weapons for the Rich and Foolhardy. The world is ending, so let's end it with a BANG. These optional rules are the spark that adds fire- to your fights. Whether it's a pepperbox or a ribauldequin, you can be assured these things are loud and deadly. By Ian McClung. \n\nThese are exclusive to the zine and will not be made available for free download. These will not only be included in the printed zine, but will also come translated to Swedish as a digital appendix to the PDF version. \n Creature: Borg Bitor. Vile, insectoid, parasitic creatures creeping into houses and nurseries come nighttime. There is a baby. There is an egg. Don't let them become one.\n Creature: Rotting Nurse. Many a Galgenbeckian remembers Mikol's infirmary and its gruesome experiments exposed by the inquisition. The head surgeon was jailed but whatever really happened to his accomplices, the nurses? Their lengthy, cruel punishment and vivisepulture. The empty graves. The shimmer from the starless skies. The many-legged horses carrying the bodies away... for what purpose?  \n 250.000 SEK STRETCH GOAL Adventure: Nurse the Rot. As you put Mother Marathuk\u2014the aunt of one of you dregs\u2014to her final rest, the village Tunstal is set in complete darkness, leaving it to its doom unless something is done. \n Rules: Curses and Cures. So you opened the puzzle box, whistled in the old mine or carelessly removed the protecting wards? These curses will be the consequence. Luckily, there are ways to break them, but it comes at a cost. \n\n\u2716 Our goal is to make this zine similar to M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, meaning something quite different from the M\u00d6RK BORG  core book. This is a rough zine, a haphazardly composited collection of ideas and articles, and we want it to feel like something you'd pick up at a concert or an underground art fair. It'll be a soft-cover zine, about 60-ish A5 pages thick, printed on heavily textured uncoated paper in 7 colors (CMYK+3), with some extra things metallic foiling and golden staples or who knows? You know, a typical zine.\nThe zine will only be printed in English, but the things written by Pelle and Johan will be included in Swedish in a digital Appendix.\n\n Introducing: The M\u00d6RK BORG Screen of Doom* \n*not really the name. OR IS IT?\n\u2716 Since the release of M\u00d6RK BORG we have seen quite a few awesome custom-made GM screens made, and now we want to offer you guys our take on it. This will be a beast of a screen; small but versatile. \nA five-paneled A5 portrait wall of death \nPrinted with gold metallic ink on one side and vivid neon yellow on the other. We want the screen to scream in your face when you run the game. \nShould we reach the 325.000 SEK stretch goal, we'll even equip each screen with two pairs of photo corners (for lack of a better name) that can hold A5 sheets with whatever tables or notes you want. So that you don't have to use that sharpie on the screen (I mean you still can, but you don't have to). Think old-school photo album, but for your adventure notes.\n Available in both English and Swedish. You pick the language you want in a post-Kickstarter Pledge Manager.\n\nThe back has a ton of more or less useful tables. If we reach the Stretch goal you can even change two of the panels to have whatever reference tables, adventure notes and/or profane poetry you prefer.\n The front is all art, five scenes of various locales and important characters in the Dying world, from SHE in the mountains of Bergen Chrypt to the endless graveyard Graven-Tosk beneath the Shadowking's palace. \n The GM-facing side sports a wide array of tables and rules summaries that might come in handy during play, such as an NPC generator, equipment and Powers, combat summary (with an optional hit location table), generic enemy stat-blocks and a d100 list of random junk you can find when looting the cultists' coffers (previously printed in MBC: FERETORY and available on morkborg.com). \n\n\nOne more thing\nForged by the left hand of Nechrubel, bound in cured skin and soot-black wood, the ancient god-vessels known as IKHONs are detested by the Two-Headed Basilisks. Wielding their Powers, unfettering the Profane Profound shackled within is a serious heretical crime and whoever may carry these blackened shrines will be forever hunted by the inquisition. But perhaps it is worth it. \nEarly mockup. Might change. You never know with these things.\n\u2716 IKHON is a mysterious box. A gaol keeping four almost-forgotten folk gods at bay; the Bilkherd, the Becklure, the Old Dead and the dreaded Silkfiend.  Those who dare commune with them are promised great rewards. But life and death go hand in hand and too small a sacrifice could be perceived as an insult. This gift could very well be a curse. IKHON is an\n a6 box with rules on how to unfetter the Profane Profound. While you can never choose which one to summon and how they'll react, (willing) human sacrifice will tip the odds slightly in your favor. Within are\n four tracts, one for each god-creature, detailing their gifts and punishments. Each a 24 page A6 booklet. \n Available in both English and Swedish. You pick the language you want in a post-Kickstarter Pledge Manager.\nWritten by Pelle Nilsson but torn apart and rebuilt in a stranger, darker form by Fiona Maeve Geist and Jarrett Crader of the MoonRat Conspiracy.  \n Over 40 full-page illustrations by the masterful Paraguayan artist Samuel Araya, whose oil paintings will bring the Profane Profound to blasphemous life. This is but one of them, giving you an idea of the kind of aesthetic this thing will have:\nOne of these mysterious, bene/malevolent deities.\n\nPledge levels and what they include\nWe got some stretch goals, in case we should get more funds than we need to just make the zine, screen and IKHON happen:\n 100.000 SEK We make this thing, simple as that.\n 175.000 SEK No zine is complete without silver foil details! If we hit this Stretch Goal we'll add a bit of shine to one of the pages.\n 250.000 SEK  We include the official and zine exclusive adventure Nurse the Rot (check the Stuff by Pelle and Johan section above for more details). \n  325.000 SEK We equip the GM screen with two pairs of photo corners allowing you to customize it with your own reference sheets for whatever you're running (just print and cut it to roughly A5 size and you're good!). \n 400.000 SEK We'll make two of these additional GM screen reference sheets and have them printed and included with the screen. Exactly what they'll have on them will be revealed.\n 825.000 SEK We print a minimalistic dungeon crawl in the form of a one-page comic, made by \u0141ukasz Kowalczuk. It will be in A2 format (and also PDF) and comes with the zine. \n 900.000 SEK Pelle will make a generator that will let you generate sects, cults, their leaders and beliefs. This will take up one spread in the zine.\n 1.000.000 SEK, the final stretch goal: We turn the Monster Generator from M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY into a digital app, just like we did with scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\u2716 Of course, if you want to supercharge your pledge with additional things you'll be able to tack on these (more or less) family-friendly products after the Kickstarter campaign ends. These will be shipped together with the MBC: Heretic items. \n\u2716 To buy an addon, click the \"Manage My Pledge\" button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost (in SEK) for all the addons you want. After the Kickstarter ends, there will be a Pledge Manager where you can mark which addons you want for the extra money you put it.\n\u2716 You can also leave your pledge unchanged and add things after the Kickstarter ends.\nNote that addons can incur additional shipping fees as the weight increases, paid for in the pledge manager.\n\nM\u00d6RK BORG CORE BOOK, 250 SEK\n\u2716 The actual game that all this is for. Maybe you want to start your perilous M\u00d6RK BORG journey here and thus need the actual rule book, or something happened to your old copy. Either way, you can get it here! Includes a PDF. \n\n M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, 150 SEK \n\u2716 The previous M\u00d6RK BORG CULT zine, with lots of adventures, monsters, treasures and untimely demise including the mini/solo game Dark Fort which was the original game that later evolved into M\u00d6RK BORG. Includes a PDF. \n\nDEATH TEMPLE SZTUN, 50 SEK\n\u2716 A hyper-linear murder gauntlet of a dungeon crawl. Short (a folded A4 pamphlet, so 6 pages) but sweet (actually not sweet, more bitter and rank). Does not include a PDF.\nCharacter sheet pads, 60 SEK\n\u2716 A pad of character sheets printed on uncoated paper, perfect for writing on or to angrily crumple into a pathetic ball of disappointment. Does not include a PDF but the character sheets are available for free download on morkborg.com so there's no need.\nExtra copy of M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: HERETIC, 150 SEK\n\u2716 Add a second copy of this zine to your pledge. Give it to a friend. Cut it to pieces. Or just keep one close at hand in case something happens. These are weird times. Includes a PDF.\nIKHON, 180 SEK\n\u2716 We don't recommend it, but perhaps you want to obtain this mystical box and have a peek inside. In that case, you can add one to your pledge. Includes a PDF.\nM\u00d6RK BORG GM Screen, 180 SEK\n\u2716 Add a GM screen to your pledge. Includes a PDF. No witty text here, sorry.\n\nShipping\nThese are weird times. Not only because of covid-19 and the uncertainty it brings but also with Brexit screwing international shipping up in unclear ways. Luckily we are able to ship from a Germany-based warehouse and a US-based instead of the UK this time around, but the current situation will, unfortunately, lead to increased shipping costs and possible delays beyond our control. We have done what we can but at the end of the day, some of these things are outside of even our unholy grasp. \n\nShipping will be added in a Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter campaign ends and will be based on the number of products you add to your pledge. But these are the estimates for the pledge levels as they are in this Kickstarter: \nAdditional costs like taxes and/or customs could, but should not, apply.\n\n\u2716 Due to COVID-19 there is a possibility that American backers will receive their stuff a month later than European backers, meaning it might arrive in August. We are doing what we can to avoid this but can't make any promises.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are experienced in running successful Kickstarter campaigns and to lower the risks on this one, the majority of the stuff we're offering is already done. The zine is written and most of it is proofread, most of the art is done. The screen is pretty much ready to send to print and Ikhon is well underway. We're in good, reliable hands with Free League Publishing when it comes to fulfillment and distribution, and we will keep you guys posted on any news and updates during and after the campaign. \n\nThe two things that cause uncertainty are Covid-19 and Brexit. The former could possibly affect both our production and the distribution should anything happen, and the latter could, in the worst case, make shipping way more expensive than we initially budgeted for but right now we're running with the latest numbers and estimates from the distributor and have a buffer to take from should things go to shit.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAs with all M\u00d6RK BORG stuff we're focusing on top quality printing and materials, to make sure your books and products don't fall apart.

Pre-Order via the Alley Cat Games website now!\nExample game in play\nA close up of the board detail\nThis new edition of Tinners' Trail is a reprint of the critically acclaimed 2008 game by Martin Wallace, which has been redeveloped and upgraded in partnership with Alley Cat Games\n\nTinners' Trail is a thematic Euro game set in 19th century Cornwall. You play as a mining conglomerate at the height of the tin and copper mining industry. You must buy plots of land across Cornwall in auctions and survey them for tin and copper, always managing your 'work points' and money effectively. Once you have a mine in place, it's time to extract the ore, and make a profit(!) but the deeper your mine goes the more expensive the process gets. You'll have the opportunity to improve your mines with infrastructure like ports, train stations, and adits (drainage tunnels), but there's only so many improvements to go around. Can you outplay the competition and make the most money or will you be left without two shillings to rub together?\n\n\n\n\n\n* Screen Printed Meeples only included with Expanded Edition\n\n\n\n\nSee the changes below...\n Increased player count - a game that was once only 3-4 players can now be enjoyed by 1-5 players!\n 2 new expansions - the Arsenic expansion, which introduces a new resource, and the Emigration expansion, which sees miners travel overseas.\n Reduced randomness - but still keeping the variability. The board is now set up with tiles instead of the roll of a the dice.\n Improved Auctions - dual-use cards are now an important part of the game, giving you information before an auction or an extra boost after an auction.\n Improved artwork and graphic design - with artwork by Ossi Heikkla (Flamme Rouge) and artwork and graphic design by Javier 'Inkgolem' Gonz\u00e1les (Cooper Island).\n Improved component quality - with custom meeples and colour blind friendly colours.\n Lord Wallace solo mode - a brand new solo mode from our solo mode expert, David Digby, designer of the Chocolate Factory solo mode.\n\nThe expanded edition of Tinners' Trail comes with 2 brand new expansions, which add to Tinners' Trail with thematic new gameplay. These expansions require the base game to play and can by played alone or combined. They are also compatible with the Lord Wallace solo mode.\n\nArsenic Expansion\nThe arsenic expansion adds the extra resource of arsenic. Due to the danger of arsenic, it is mined at the cost of PERMANENTLY losing work points but with the reward of a big cash payout.\nEmigration Expansion\nIn The Emigration expansion, you can send your workers overseas to gain ongoing benefits, such as extra income or free improvements.\n\nLord Wallace Solo Mode\nThe solo mode plays just like the 2 player game, but the actions of your opponent are determined by a deck of solo cards.\nEvery time it's Lord Wallace's turn (decided by the work track like normal) you'll flip a card and look at the round number and Lord Wallace's work marker position to find the action that Lord Wallace will perform. Sometimes there will be two options, and Lord Wallace will decide which option to take depending on the price of copper.\nLord Wallace will also have a hand of cards and will use those cards to bid on area tiles.\nOther than that, Lord Wallace will interact with the board in the same way as a normal player, Building Mines, taking developments, and Mining ore. Can you outmatch the esteemed Lord Wallace?\n\n\n\nDownload the (almost final!) rules here!\nDownload a basic print and play file to try yourself here!\nPlay on Tabletop Simulator!\n\nEach player represents a growing mining operation in 19th-century Cornwall, seeking to profit from the rich tin and copper deposits of the region. Over the course of the 4 rounds players will build mines, acquire developments, extract ore, sell their tin and copper, and invest the proceeds to earn points. The player with the most points is the winner.\nAvailable actions\n\nActions are taken by using points from the 'work track', and players further back on the work track take their turns first.\nBetter actions cost more work points so time your actions carefully. You'll need to think about the best action now, but also how many work points it'll cost you, affecting your turn order later\n\nPlan your actions carefully\nThe market value of tin and copper change each round, so you'll have to push your luck at the right time to sell. Tin can be sold at a pretty good price right now, but will it be even higher in the next round?\nA changing market price makes every round (and game) play differently\nDevelopments can increase your mining capacity, remove water from your mines and even add more tin and copper. However, they are limited each round, so you'll have to snap them up quick. The competition is fierce so you might even want to pass a round early to give you the first choice in the next round!\n\nBuilding developments increases your mining efficiency\nUse your profits to invest in the market to gain victory points. The sooner you invest the more points you'll get for your money\n\nThe Arsenic Expansion adds a new resource to Tinners' Trail. Arsenic can be mined without spending work points and it can be sold instantly and gives a higher price the sooner it is sold but Aresnic is very dangerous to mine and you permanently reduce your maximum work points for each arsenic you mine.\nThe Emigration Expansion sees your workers take their mining skills overseas. Cornish miners were in high demand overseas as skilled labourers and if you send your miners overseas you'll receive ongoing benefits such as regular income each round, free developments, extra investments, or even adjusting the market.\n\nIn The Lord Wallace solo mode, you'll go head to head against Lord Wallace as he attempts to establish dominance over the Cornish tin and copper mining industry.\n\nLord Wallace will choose actions based on the card that is revealed and the number of work points he has left. He also takes into account the price of copper and will take advantage of an increase in the market, which will keep even the most experienced miners on their toes.\n\nThe Lord Wallace solo mode can be used alone with the base game or in combination with either or both of the expansions\n\nThe Lord Wallace solo mode was designed by David Digby, who not only developed the expansions and updated gameplay for this version of Tinners' Trail, but also created the critically acclaimed solo mode for Chocolate Factory.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be using a Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter has ended to manage add-ons and shipping. \nIf you want to add any of the add-ons below to your pledge, please do so in the Pledge Manager. If you want to add extra copies of Tinners' Trail to your pledge, you can do this in the Pledge Manager too\nYou can pledge at the $1 level now to gain access to the pledge manager.\nThese Add-on prices are indicative of the actual prices that will be charged in the pledge manager but are subject to change due to exchange rates.\nWe always offer excellent rates for retailers around the world. If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store's email address and we will send you our rates!\n\nFor groups of 6 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nPlease back at the retailer pledge tier for group pledges\n\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\n\nEU2 - Italy, Sweden, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Turkey, Romania.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment. Costs are shown in the approximate local currency. To double-check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the pledge tier and select your country. More accurate pricing will be in the pledge manager\n\nCustoms Friendly Shipping - With the new Brexit deal we are working with our shipping partners to make all EU packages customs friendly, by paying the customs before shipping. This is still being finalised and we should know more by the end of the campaign. If this cannot be done for whatever reason, we are offering a money back guarantee for EU packages that we cannot fulfil for any reason.\nWe are also working with Asia & Canada partners to offer custom free shipping, though currently this is not the case.\nActual shipping charges will be charged in the pledge manager and may be slightly different than the amount stated. The above estimates currently improve a surcharge due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, with the rollout of the vaccine we are optimistic that these prices will be lower when fulfilment costs are finalised. If costs are cheaper before the pledge manager closes, we will pass these savings on to you.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia). \nIn very rare cases the shipping price can be significantly higher than the early estimates. We reserve the right to cancel any order and will offer a full refund in these cases.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n February: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development.\n March: Submit Files to manufacturer\n April/May/June: Manufacturing \n June/July: Shipping from Poland to the UK begins\n Late July: Arrives in ports\n Early August: Fulfilment commences\n September: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in September/October - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nCONVENTION SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at conventions. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before these conventions, but you or a friend are attending the convention, you/they can pick it up from that convention. Conventions we may be attending before fulfilment include UK Games Expo, Origins & Gen Con.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs always with our campaigns, we cannot prevent \"god-like\" failures such as thunderstorm, hurricanes, pandemics (!) etc.\n\nWe can promise you though that we will do everything in our power to keep everyone updated as well as stick to the original plan as possible.\n\nYou can rest assured that since this is our 14th campaign, that we are a capable and knowledgeable company.

To date, we\u2019ve raised enough as a company to donate over 60,000 games to kids. This campaign will help give even more! \nThe Newest Expansion to Nemo's War is Here! Featuring...\n A COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS MANUAL & BETWEEN VOYAGES GUIDE: The new Operations Manual shows how to run the ship turn-by-turn and includes many useful appendices at the end, while the new Between Voyages Guide features instruction for setup, ending the game, scoring, epilogues, variants, and more!\n\n A NEW 2-PLAYER VERSUS VARIANT: Joining the riveting solo and cooperative modes where players command the Nautilus, in this game variant one player will play as the Imperialists, bent on its defeat. Includes special cards and 2 Imperial Squadron Miniatures!  \n\n A NEW CHARACTER TILE: Entering our story is Nemo\u2019s son, Nadeen Dakkar, who crosses paths with his father after hearing news of mysterious events at sea!\n\n NEW FINALE CARDS: Spice up your endings with The Trap, Imperialists\u2019 Catspaw, Scientific Espionage, and The Kraken! \n\n NEW STERN MOTIVES, ADDITIONAL NAUTILUS UPGRADES, AND EVEN MORE TOKENS & MARKERS! \nBrave the hazards of the seas, combat vessels around the globe, incite uprisings, chronicle amazing wonders, find mysterious treasures -- your quest knows no bounds in this Ultimate Edition. Combining all expansion content, including the Journey\u2019s End Expansion, both new and returning players will be able to experience everything Nemo\u2019s War has to offer. Play solitaire, cooperatively, or competitively; the choice is yours!\n\nEach turn, you must address the seas\u2019 challenges in a grand adventure, confront the growing pressure of the Imperialist powers\u2019 navies, undertake Actions with the Nautilus and her crew \u2013 all while maintaining Captain Nemo\u2019s spirit to continue.  The Turn Sequence is as follows:\n\nBegin each turn in the Event Phase by flipping an event, Test, or other card from the Adventure Deck. Favorably resolving Tests, and using resources to manipulate your die rolls in this pursuit, will be critical to securing a victory no matter what your motive is.\nRoll high, captains, but be careful: your mission ends in Defeat if you deplete a Ship Resource. Developing an understanding of the probabilities, risks, and rewards for each Test and to what degree will ultimately be the reason for your mission\u2019s success or failure.\nNext is the Placement Phase, where you roll the dice for this round\u2019s Oceans for Ship token placement based on the game\u2019s current Act and your Notoriety. Strategic choices about where to place your ships, what we call \u201cpainting the board,\u201d will be crucial to your plans! Which Oceans to populate (and, through combat, denude) is the vital strategic chess game you are playing with the Imperialist powers who oppose you.\n You also receive the Differential Roll result of the two (selected) white dice rolled in Action Points for that turn. If the two (selected) white dice are doubles, a Lull Turn takes place..\n  Now it\u2019s time to act! During the Action Phase, you spend your Action Points to Move, Attack, Search for Treasure, Incite Uprisings, and more, all to advance Nemo\u2019s goals.\nAlways remember: you are questing for the greatest number of Victory Points (VPs) that you can acquire, as modified by Captain Nemo\u2019s Motive, while avoiding the many ways to suffer defeat. BVPs are earned in several ways (e.g., sinking enemy ships, passing TEST Events, collecting Treasures, inciting oppressed peoples, making scientific discoveries, etc), so choose your actions wisely each turn, and beware: \n Your mission ends in Defeat if your adventures gain too much notoriety, as you become an international Pariah to be hunted down mercilessly.\n\nRepeat these Phases until the game ends with your early defeat or you reveal the Final\u00e9 card that ultimately instructs you: \u201cThe game ends!\u201d\n\nWhen all is said and done, read the epilogue to your voyage in the Between Voyages Guide. Your level of victory and motive will change the story of your Journey\u2019s End.\n\nHere's a Preview and How to Play video for The Ultimate Edition from the Game Boy Geek:\nYou can also check out this How to Play from Meeple University with designer & developer Alan Emrich! This video uses an older edition of the game, but it does an excellent job of showing the gameplay.\n\nThe first expansion for Nemo's War.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific local taxes, or other charges. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details.\nAdd-ons, including additional copies of these same items, will increase this cost. Shipping will be calculated and charged in the pledge manager.\nWe are only shipping to the following countries, due to shipping uncertainties and restrictions:\nIf you back this campaign and request fulfillment to somewhere outside of these countries, we will cancel your order and refund your pledge per our Refund Policy (90% of the total you pledged).\n\nWe do anticipate that these products will be available through our online stores around the world so if you cannot participate in this campaign, you should be able to order them through those in the future.\n\nTaxes\nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see the chart below for more information about the tax rates to be charged:\n\n\nIf your country or state is not listed here, you may be responsible for paying your local taxes and import costs (use tax, VAT, GST, clearance, etc) depending on your local laws and customs rules.\nPlease review our campaign terms of service by reading the FAQs in full.

Together, we\u2019ve created a brand-new edition of Don\u2019t Get Got with 120 new missions and an aggressively orange colour scheme.\nIf you don\u2019t own Don\u2019t Get Got, that\u2019s perfect. Included in this \u00a320 box is everything you need to play.\nIf you DO own Don\u2019t Get Got, that\u2019s perfect too! Think of this box as a very generous expansion, doubling the amount of missions in the base game and letting you play with up to 20 players. Imagine that! It would be carnage.\nCheck out SU&SD\u2019s glowing review!\nAre you the kind of hotshot who doesn\u2019t have 10 minutes to watch a video? Not a problem, here\u2019s a quick gif-stuffed overview:\nDon\u2019t Get Got is a game of secret missions for 2-10 players, and it takes place while you go about your day. Perfect places to break out Don\u2019t Get Got would be living with housemates, at work, on holiday, at parties, even at gaming conventions.\nEach player receives a cute little wallet full of unique missions, and then you just get back to living your life, except you\u2019re immediately going to start scheming like a mean scheme machine:\nHand out some random missions to each player\nEach mission will tell you what you\u2019ve got to try and trick the other players into doing...\nRead and insert the missions into your wallet\nEach time you succeed at this you get to (a) flip over the little mission in your wallet, which is super satisfying:\nNailed it!\nand (b) reveal your mission to the player who just got got, which is even more satisfying:\nPoint and rejoice\nBut there\u2019s a catch! If you ever get caught (which is as easy as another player asking if you\u2019re trying to trick them), that mission is flipped over to the \u201cFAILED IT\u201d side for the rest of the game.\nFailed it :'(\nThe first player to complete 3 missions wins!\nVictory\nThe writers at Shut Up & Sit Down have had a great time creating new expansions for some of their favourite party games, like Monikers and The Metagame. When Big Potato asked if we wanted to design a brand-new box for Don\u2019t Get Got, we leapt at the chance.\nIncluded in this Shut Up & Sit Down Special Edition are 10 plastic wallets, 1 collectible sticker and 120 missions, all of which were painstakingly entered into a spreadsheet by team SU&SD.\nIn all seriousness, we worked super hard on this, and went through several rounds of refinement and feedback with the original game\u2019s designers. The perfect Don\u2019t Get Got mission makes you smile when you receive it, and represents an interesting, open-ended puzzle as to how exactly you\u2019re going to pull it off. We aimed to deliver that with each and every mission.\n\n\nBut of course not! With enough pledges we will reveal not one, not five, but three stretchy goals that we\u2019d like to offer all of our backers for absolutely free.\nYou took that poor target and smashed it into pieces!\nAs a reward, you\u2019ve unlocked the \u2018EPIC MISSIONS\u2019 pack \u2014 20 Kickstarter-exclusive missions that require so much forethought, even a criminal mastermind would wince at them.\nSurprise extra stretchy goal unlocked! \nWe messed up with the shipping, so here\u2019s something to say sorry \u2014 all the cards from the original Don\u2019t Get Got game. That\u2019s 186 extra missions, carefully placed inside each and every copy of the Kickstarter special edition.\nYou want the rest? Well guess what, you can\u2019t handle the rest!\nOnly joking, of course you can. Introducing the \u2018GAME NIGHT\u2019 pack \u2014 20 Kickstarter-exclusive missions, all designed to be played while you\u2019re playing another board game. How meta are we?\nYou\u2019ve unlocked this year\u2019s hottest fashion accessory!\nFresh from the catwalks of Milan, it\u2019s the SU&SD x Big Potato pin badge. Whether you pin it to your bag, your ear or your fancy lapels, everyone will know you backed the hottest game around (and that you might be up to something sneaky).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt should be a relief to anyone who\u2019s watched team SU&SD finger board game components into their mouths that they won\u2019t be involved in manufacturing or fulfilment at all.\n\nInstead, publishing and manufacturing will be handled by Big Potato Games, who have published over 50 games and distributed to countries all over the world. They have literally shipped out more games than you\u2019ve had hot dinners. We're using Blackbox as our fulfilment service who are the complete bomb and we trust with all of our possessions.\n\nAdditionally, the copy of this Special Edition that you can see in the Kickstarter video is a near-final copy sent to us directly from the manufacturers, so all we need to do is tell them how many more copies to make.

Whatever version of Oceans you pledge for, it will automatically come with a 5-6 player expansion.\nThe Evolution games are known for vivid themes, easy rules, and hidden depth. With many thousands of play-tests, years of non-stop design, over 100 unique illustrations, and more content than we've ever put into a game before, Oceans is our most ambitious project to date.\nAt the game's start, the only food source is plankton, the foundation of the ocean food web. It populates the beautifully illustrated Reef and Ocean boards, shown here as prototypes: \n(Note the fish tokens you see above are off-the-shelf items we used for testing. The actual tokens will be cardboard for the standard edition and acrylic for the deluxe edition. See below.)\nYour goal is to create and evolve species so they find their niche in the growing ecosystem, by giving them helpful combinations of traits. This is a what a species looks like: \nEach species is defined by its population (the fish tokens above), and its traits (the cards above). Through the game It'll gain and lose traits, and gain and lose population depending on what it can eat, and what can eat it. Despite your best efforts, some species will go extinct! It's natural selection at work. \nBecause you can build species from any combination of traits, thousands of species are possible, and they all interact in their own particular ways as the ecosystem builds. Every game creates a one-of-a-kind world, never to be seen again.   \nMany species will be predators, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded apex predator. But some will eat in other ways, for example by scavenging on the sea bottom or filter-feeding on plankton. Below are examples of trait art - each a watercolor painting by famed nature artist Catherine Hamilton:\nThen there's a whole other side to the game. It's called The Deep. \nHuge regions of deep ocean are unexplored, and what little we've seen of them can seem like fantasy:\nWe had to put this mysterious world into the game. Hence The Deep.\nThe Deep will contain, at minimum, 50 unique, powerful traits, which dramatically boost the range - and strangeness - of species you can evolve. We commissioned scores of illustrations from a variety of fine artists to make them. Here are examples:   \nThrough unlocked stretch goals, at least 32 additional Deep cards may become permanently added to the game. \nBeyond those, there are also 8 foiled Deep promo cards to unlock. These foiled traits are more aggressive and/or complex than the other cards in the game. \nWith all stretch goals unlocked, you'll get more than 90 unique Deep cards in total. They raise the number of distinct species you can evolve from thousands to about one million.\nEach time you play, there are 2 scenario cards in play (chosen at random at the start of the game from a deck of at least 25). Each creates a major ecosystem-shift when activated, altering the whole game. It's another way the evolutionary timeline changes each play.\nThe standard scenario deck can create about 600 distinct Ocean histories to evolve through, but we're also offering up to 13 more scenario cards as stretch goals. With those added, about 1500 Ocean histories are possible. \nWe've packed all this into rules that are simpler, more intuitive, and easier to teach even than Evolution, which was already known for being easy to teach. Nonetheless you'll find tons of hidden tactics and strategies...under the surface. \nNote: Oceans is mechanically quite different from previous Evolution games. See this update for details.  \n For every pledge level, at the end of the campaign, you'll choose between English, French, Spanish and Italian versions of Oceans in the pledge manager. You can pledge for as many copies as you wish.\n North Star Games will publish the English version\n Funforge will publish the French version. Pour voir cette page en fran\u00e7ais, cliquez ici! \n Schwerkraft-Verlag will publish the German Edition. \n Ediciones MasQueOca will publish the Spanish version. You can read their updates about Oceans at their blog here.\n Pendragon Game Studio will publish the Italian version. To read about this campaign in, click here.\nStandard Edition Pledge Level - $45 USD ($5 off MSRP)\nYou get the Oceans Standard Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. \nThe Standard Edition contains:  1 Rulebook, 1 Reference Guide, 2 Player aids, 1 Reef board, 3 Ocean boards (2 small, 1 large), 120 Surface cards (10 of each type), 50-80 Deep cards (1 of each type), 24 Scenario cards, 24 Species boards, 200 cardboard fish with 6 different illustrated designs (see below), 4 Player screens, and 4 Bonus Score tokens. Note exact numbers of some components could change with final game tweaks.\nThe 5-6 player expansion contains 40 additional fish, 2 extra player screens, 2 extra bonus score tokens, and 10 extra species boards.  \nNote: unlike in the prototype pictured above, the final cardboard fish will be illustrated on both sides: \nDeluxe Edition Pledge Level - $70 ($15 off MSRP)\nYou get Oceans' Deluxe Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. The Deluxe Edition improves on the Standard Edition in the following ways:\nIncludes 240 deluxe translucent acrylic fish tokens in addition to the cardboard fish of the standard edition, so you can decide how you want to play. The acrylic fish are more durable, easier to handle, and they refract light beautifully. Our goal is to make them as delicious-looking and as tactile as possible. We'll have done our job if your first instinct is to eat them. Prototype:\nThe final version may look even better, as they'll have smooth, beveled edges.\nIncludes custom-printed, premium food bags for up to 6 players for storing your points, instead of cardboard player screens. They feel super-silky, they have drawstrings, and they help keep your playing area neat and compact. \nIncludes 220 custom Oceans premium matte card sleeves, for sleeving both the core trait cards and The Deep trait cards, plus spares. \nBox Cover Art Painting Pledge Level - $3000\nYou get the Deluxe Edition, all unlocked stretch goals, and Catherine Hamilton's original 12\" x 12\" watercolor painting for the Box Cover. Because the painting is one-of-a-kind, only one backer can pledge this level: \nPledge levels which are no longer available\nThere are a number of pledge levels with backer limits that have been reached, and so are no longer available. To simplify this page, we've removed descriptions of these levels for now. We'll add them back in if any become available again.\nWhatever language you choose for your game, your stretch goals will also come in that language. There are three types of stretch goals: \n Deep Cards: Unlocked Deep traits that will become a permanent part of both the Standard and Deluxe Editions. Each card that isn't unlocked may be available on our website for $2.  \n Foiled Deep Cards: Promo Deep traits that are more aggressive and/or complex than normal Deep traits. After the campaign, each foiled card may be available on our website for $3 if there are any left over. \n Scenario Cards: Promo scenarios that are wackier than the standard scenarios. Some are downright goofy. After the campaign, each scenario card may be available on our website for $1 if there are any left over. \nThe total value of all stretch goals is more than $100.\nYou can order as many of each add-on as you like. Note the non-digital add-ons will add extra shipping cost, which will be charged after the campaign ends in our pledge manager.\nEvolution (English or Italian) - add $40 to your pledge for each English copy, $35 for each Italian copy\nEvolution is an award-winning board game where 2 \u2013 6 players adapt terrestrial species in an ever changing ecosystem with hungry predators and limited resources. The game has been used in the evolutionary biology department at the University of Oxford and featured in the world's leading scientific journal, Nature. You'll be able to choose between English and Italian versions in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nEvolution Video Game (English Only)\nAdd $12 to your pledge for a Steam code (20% off). In the pledge manager at campaign's end, it may also be possible to add-on iOS and Android versions.\nWe've turned Evolution into a video game for iOS, Android, and Steam. It's got lots of new content and modes of play, and a refined interface. The learn-as-you-play tutorial makes it perhaps the easiest way to learn Evolution.\nEvolution: Climate Standalone (English Only) - add $60 to your pledge for each copy\nClimate is a more advanced version of Evolution, where you must contend not only with other species, but also with a changing climate that can swing from scorching hot to icy cold, and major environmental disruptions like drought and meteor impacts.\nEvolution: The Beginning (English Only) - add $25 to your pledge for each copy\nThe Beginning is a faster, simpler, more casual Evolution experience than its parent game. It's especially good for playing with young kids (8 and up) and it works very well for 2 players.\nEvolution Foiled Promo Card Pack #1 (English Only) - add $12 to your pledge for each pack\nThis pack contains 7 copies each of 5 foiled promo traits that that can be used in both Evolution and Evolution: Climate. We normally sell each trait for $5 each (and not all of them foiled). With this pack you save more than 50% on each card. The cards are: Extra Sensory Perception, Cybernetic Limbs, Gigantism, Venom, Unstable DNA.\nEvolution Foiled Promo Card Pack #2 (English Only) - add $17 to your pledge for each pack\nThis pack contains 7 copies each of 7 foiled promo traits that that can be used in both Evolution and Evolution: Climate.

The cards are: Sharp Teeth, Rapid Mutation, Pest, Invasive Species, Pounce, Quills, and Last Stand.\nEvolution Foiled Promo Card Pack #3 (English Only) - add $15 to your pledge for each pack\nThis pack contains 7 copies each of 6 foiled promo traits that that can be used in both Evolution and Evolution: Climate.

The Fail Faster Playtesting Journal will guide you throughout your playtesting process to ensure that you\u2019re capturing the right information as well as guide you towards improving your design. \nAt its core, the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal contains pages to keep track of 36 playtests. The journal is most useful if you dedicate one journal to each game that you are designing, but you could easily use one journal to keep track of all the different games you\u2019re designing. Each section has been tested and planned for optimal use of space.\nHere's an overview of what's included in this journal. Scroll down lower to see more details about each section of the journal. \nHere's a video of Jamey Stegmaier going into more detail about his thoughts on the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\n\nThis journal got a lot better as we achieved certain thresholds! We earned badges throughout the campaign and once we earned enough badges for a stretch goal to be unlocked, we held a poll. The poll asked if you preferred to redeem the badges for the first stretch goal, or if you preferred to wait and save up the badges for a different stretch goal. Majority prevailed! With 12 badges left at the end of the campaign, there was one more vote, but we can't edit the campaign once it's closed, so here's a snapshot of where we ended up:   \nVIDEO EXPLAINING STRETCH GOALS\nHere's a video explaining how the Stretch Goals work, in case this didn't make any sense! \nRED TROPHIES\nWhenever we made it to the end of any row in the Stretch Goal chart, we also unlocked a RED TROPHY! Red trophies unlocked more content for the journal and didn't cost any extra badges! Here's what we unlocked:\n1) Contract Checklist: A checklist of everything you need to consider before signing that contract! \n2) Blind Playtest Feedback form: A form to provide your blind playtesters to ensure you get the feedback you need. This will only be included in the PDF since it doesn't really make sense to include in the final copy of the journal. As a reminder, everyone who backs this campaign for at least 1 physical copy of the journal will also receive the PDF! \n\nFail Faster is the culmination of ideas from Jay Cormier who co-designed all of the games pictured above, with many more signed to come out soon.  He has detailed his journey on how he got his games published along with Sen-Foong Lim, at www.bamboozlebrothers.com. He teaches Game Theory at the Vancouver Film School and has done so for the last 6 years.   \nIt's possible that content and images shown below could change by the time we go to print. Mostly this will be due to listening to feedback from you, the backers!\nPlaytesters and Scores: The top left corner includes spaces for name, version, number of tests and date. Then an area to write your playtesters name - including a box to indicate if it's their first time playing the game and columns to keep track of various scores, or even times when players achieve specific thresholds.\nTimes: Here\u2019s where you can keep track of the time it took to explain rules and play your game and if you were able to play to the end or not.\nRules Changes and Focus: Do you have any rules changes since your last playtest that you don\u2019t want to forget? Write them here before you start your playtest. Then keep track of any observations you have as well as any questions your playtesters asked you while playing.\nWinning Strategies: Keep track of the winning player\u2019s strategy up here to see, over time, if there are dominant strategies. There's a nice reminder here to take a photo of the end game state. This can be useful when analyzing afterwards.\nFeedback: Feedback from your playtesters is written here. The questions that are asked vary on each page, and start by assuming you\u2019re in the Alpha phase of game design and by the end of the journal, the questions are more geared towards games in the Gamma phase. \nAdditional tools and resources\nThe journal is full of other interesting tools and resources that will help make you a better game designer.\nDesigner Progress \nOn the fold out cover, ten behaviours have been identified that, when followed, will make you a better playtester of your game and ultimately, a better designer.\nWhen you have accomplished one of these behaviours in your playtest, shade in the next box. When you reach a badge on any of the rows, flip open the fold-out cover and colour in that badge on the front.\nIf we unlock the sticker stretch goal, then the journal will come with stickers of each badge which will really pop when placed on the cover!\nYou can also keep track of your overall designer level by totaling up the number of badges you\u2019ve earned from previous journals. Write in the lifetime sum total in the top of your journal. If we reach our sticker stretch goal, then there will be stickers available to indicate your level as a designer for all to see.\nGame Idea Generator\nThe inside of the fold-out front cover contains a Game Idea Generator. Simply roll 2 dice three times to get a random Mechanic, Theme and even a Constraint. Don\u2019t have 2 dice lying around? No worries because that\u2019s also built into the journal.\nSimply flip the journal open to any page and the bottom left corner will have a random 2d6 result. This can be handy while playtesting your game if you forgot dice. Twenty-six of the middle pages also have a random letter tile on it for those games that require a random letter.\nHow to Get Your Game Published (in PDF version only)\nThere's a guide showing you how to get your game published. \nManufacturer Considerations\nThe back cover will have a page full of information from manufacturer, Panda that will help you as a designer.\nScoreboard\nThe inside back cover has a scoreboard in case you need one during your playtest. It folds out too, so you can still use the rest of your journal! It also has a metric ruler along the side. \n Goals\nThe front page has an area for you to write your own SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound), and if you work towards those goals, they too can earn you badges that you can put on the cover.\n\nProtips\nThe bottom of each playtesting page contains a different ProTip that comes from over 10 years of designing board games.\n Game Crafter Coupon\nEvery Kickstarter version of the physical journal comes with a $5 coupon for The Game Crafter - a great source for components as well as print-on-demand games. The retail version and any digital version will not come with this coupon.\nWatch Jay Cormier get interviewed by Edo about Playtesting as well as the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\nHere's an interview by Inquisitive Meeple where Jay Cormier dishes out a lot of facts and history about the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal\n\nPhotos: Dylan Hamm, www.dylanhammphoto.com\nVideo: Nathan Watkins,  nathanwatkinsfilm.com \nWeb Design: Jason Gorber, www.bearshark.com\nGraphic Design of Journal: David Mak, www.honeycombgraphics.ca\nSocial Media Consultant: Gerald King III,  ko-fi.com/mrking ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I've had numerous games on Kickstarter (Belfort, Tortuga, This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us, But Wait There's More, In the Hall of the Mountain King), I've never had to run one myself. I've learned a lot from my experiences and from others in the business. The risk could be that I missed something or forgot about something, but that should really only affect me and not you.

It\u2019s a thrilling experience of TALKING and THINKING and HIGH FIVING that anyone can play\u2014but it also has some of that deep word game sorcery, like Codenames, where your decisions feel tense, strategic, meaningful. \nWavelength is designed by Wolfgang Warsch, Alex Hague, and Justin Vickers. Wolfgang is the creator behind The Mind and won the Kennerspiel des Jahres award in 2018\u2014basically the most prestigious award in tabletop games. Alex and Justin make Monikers, which the New York Times called \u201cthe perfect party game.\u201d\nThe game\u2019s stunning art is by Nan Na Hvass & Sofie Hannibal of Hvass&Hannibal.\nLike the best party games, Wavelength is deceptively simple. \nEach round, one team rotates a 3D dial to where they think a hidden bullseye is located on a spectrum:\nBullseye = those 3 colored wedges\nThe spectrum is completely hidden by a plastic screen, BUT one player on your team\u2014the Psychic\u2014knows exactly where the bullseye is. Their job is to get your team to guess the location by: \n1. Drawing a card with a pair of words that represent two ends of a spectrum, like\n2. Giving a clue that is *conceptually* where the bullseye is located between those two binaries\nSo if the card this round is \u201cHot - Cold,\u201d the Psychic needs to give a clue ON THE SPECTRUM between extremely hot on the far left side to extremely cold on the far right side. And so in the example above they might give a clue like \"coffee.\"\nAfter the Psychic gives their clue, this when the real game begins: your team discusses where they think the bullseye is located and turns the dial to that location on the spectrum.  This is when your team has a chance to think out loud, debate, and ponder extremely dumb questions\u2014all while the other team tries to poison your brain with bad suggestions.  \nAfter your team \u201clocks in\u201d their answer, the Psychic DRAMATICALLY REVEALS the bullseye. The closer to the center you guessed, the more points your team scores!\nOh, and the opposing team ALSO gets a chance for points: before the reveal, they quickly discuss and guess whether the bullseye is to the left or right of your team's dial position and get 1 point if they're right!\nIt\u2019s smart and funny and endlessly social. \nWavelength comes with 168 different spectrums, which combine with the randomized bullseye position in an infinite number of weird and challenging and interesting combinations.\nHere\u2019s the best thing about Wavelength: when your team guesses exactly right, it feels like you all just performed an impossible magic trick together. Success feels AWESOME and unlike any game we\u2019ve ever played.\nEveryone screams and high fives. Other people in the room look over to see what just happened. People hug, sometimes. It\u2019s wild.\nWavelength\u2019s theme may be telepathy, but it\u2019s secretly all about empathy. To win, your team will have to figure out how each of you thinks about the world. And talking through that will lead to some of the most oddly profound discussions like:\nHow ugly is a baby kangaroo?\nIs stealing from orphans forgivable?\nDoes cotton smell good?\nHow hairy is David Hasselhoff?\nIs pizza a sandwich?\nWavelength is the game we\u2019ve been wanting to make for YEARS: an experience right in the middle between a think-y word game and a ridiculous party game.\nThe secret ingredient is that there are NO NUMBERS in the game at all. So instead of rationally debating between an 8 or 9 on a scale of 1-10, you have just this completely unquantifiable feeling of going with your gut. \nBut Wavelength isn\u2019t some loosey goosey opinion game: there\u2019s an ironclad logic behind a great clue that feels exhilarating when your team gets a perfect bullseye.\n  \u201cThe Device\u201d: This is the main interactive element of the game. It's a fully assembled component that includes a 7.5\" rotating wheel with scalloped edges for turning, the 2.5\" diameter plastic dial, plastic screen w/handle for easy reveal, and front and back cardboard panels.\n 84 spectrum cards: Double sided for 168 spectrums, linen finish.\n 3 Scoring tokens: Cute little cardboard heads!\n Custom plastic tray: With space for expansions, debossed text for scoring.\n Rulebook: It's a rulebook.\nOne of the really unique things about Wavelength is that it's played entirely IN THE BOX. The cards, dial, and score tracker all slot into the box\u2019s tray, and you just\u2026pass it around. So you never have to worry about losing components at a bar or under your friend\u2019s table. \nThere\u2019s NOTHING TO SORT and NOTHING TO BAG. Which makes Wavelength a breeze to set up and take down. It literally takes less than 30 seconds to get a game ready. \nThere\u2019s one more thing that makes Wavelength so special: it\u2019s TACTILE. \nYou have this big, juicy 3D plastic dial that feels incredible in your hand. It gives such a satisfying feeling of precise control rather than just guessing numbers.  \nOne of our MANY working prototypes, developed by the brilliant Sarah Pavis\nYou\u2019ll want to turn it for the sake of turning it.\nAnd to randomize the bullseye's location each round, instead of having to fiddle with cards every time, we've designed a game show worthy rotating wheel that the Psychic gets to turn each round before giving their clue:\nThe result is a game that's intuitive and playable for non-gamers and yet still feels fresh to us jaded tabletop veterans after hundreds of plays (yes, we\u2019re obsessed). And because of the near-infinite combinations of bullseye positions and spectrum cards, you\u2019ll want to switch up teams and play again and again and again. \nWe can\u2019t wait to get it to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our 6th kickstarter, and we're really proud that we've delivered a solid final product every time.\n\nAnd for Wavelength, we've never prototyped or tested a game this much before. We spent countless hours over the past year on the rules, card set, and physical design. \n\nIn terms of manufacturing, this is the most complex game we've ever made, so we've also put a ton of time into making sure we can get it from idea to execution. Fortunately, we're working with Panda, who manufactures hyper complex games like Scythe. So we're in very good hands there with their engineers and logistical wizards. We've also built in a lot of cushion into our delivery estimate of October, just in case we have an even longer prototyping process. \n\nFor fulfillment, we're working with Blackbox, who we've used to ship thousands of copies of Monikers to backers around the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "WAVELENGTH", "descp": "A copy of the game.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8,545 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Wavelength app", "update_content": "Hello!

Dice Hospital was held up at customs and faced a few manufacturing issues, but we in turn delayed the retail launch to put our backers first. Coral Island's deluxe version will not be in general retail until backers have had it for many months. Backers are always our priority.\nWorld class manufacturing\nThis is a game of premium wooden components. For this project, we are using Longpack, who manufactured Dice Hospital for us and gave us some fantastic wooden doctor meeples. \nShipment and Fulfilment\nWe will be shipping most - if not all - the games from our UK Alley Cat Games HQ via our business Royal Mail account. Unlike Dice Hospital, we will NOT be using GamesQuest for fulfilment. If Brexit happens and free trade is no longer possible between UK and EU, we will send some games to EU to be fulfilled from within. As such, the game should be customs-friendly for all EU and UK backers. It is likely US shipping will be done from within the USA using QML - this ultimately depends on a number of factors, but we will keep everyone informed of course.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n March: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development. \n April: Submit Files to manufacturer \n May: Manufacturing\n June: Shipping from China to the UK begins \n Late July: Arrives in ports \n Early August: Fulfilment commences \n September: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in October - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nESSEN SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at Essen Spiel 2019. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before Essen, but you or a friend are attending Essen, you/they can pick it up from Essen itself.\nOur last medium weight euro - Dice Hospital - was in high demand and hard to find for several months after release.

Both games utilise dice stacking as the predominant mechanic in the game (and needed a serious number of dice), but dice-stacking is explored in completely different ways!\nCoral is a 3D pattern recognition game\nIn Coral, you have your own dice but place them on a shared board. Create shapes in 3D, utilising not only your own dice (the coral!) but your opponents' dice! \nIslands is a fresh take on set collection and drafting game\nUsing dice stacking, move around neutral dice (representing land). During each turn, you will draft one set of cards. How many cards you take dictates how far you can move a die. A single card from the cards you took is kept, to help establish the end-drafting.\nA fresh take on dice stacking and coral themed games\nWe absolutely love dice stacking games such as Blueprints and coral themed games like Reef, but both Coral and Islands are highly interactive takes on these mechanics/themes. There is no \"take that\" and both games are family-friendly.\nHigh Replayability\nCoral and Islands come with more cards than you'll use each game. In Coral, different shape cards are used depending on the experience levels of the players per game, while in Islands, using only 3 of the 6 rule breaking specialists ensures each game is played completely differently from the last.\nSolo mode for Coral\nCoral (but not Islands) has a solo mode! You will play against \"Nature\". See the solo mode below for more details!\nIf you previously backed Dice Hospital, you can* receive The Inspector - a specialist promo card for Dice Hospital for free with your pledge! Importantly, please read how to receive this with your pledge below...\nIt features a new one-time only ability and Sabrina Miramon has captured the likeness of Tom Vasel for the upcoming Dice Tower Kickstarter campaign. This is a special thank you to everyone who backed that previous project. For those who bought Dice Hospital through other means (or who don't wish to back this project) the promo card will be available for sale in the future. Alternatively, if you bought Dice Hospital not via the Kickstarter or our website, you can share this campaign on social media and we will add it to your pledge for free too! Again you will need to message us please :)\n*If you backed Dice Hospital, please send us a direct message via this campaign to ensure you get this promo card; otherwise it is not guaranteed.\n*Please note, that the final number of cards in the Coral mini expansion is still TBC.\nShape-creation in 3D space\nEvery placement matters. \n\nYou will have to consider every angle, perhaps walking around or at least looking from other sides to consider other perspectives - literally!\nReal interaction on a shared board\nYou are 'growing' shapes not only using your own dice, but also other players'. Each die you place could be a blocking move, or - if you're not careful - could actually help someone else grow a high-scoring shape!  \n'Fish tokens' mitigate luck and give you extra turns!\n Fish tokens, collected throughout the game, let you mitigate some of the minor luck in the game.\n\nFish tokens allow you to change your dice, or place both dice at once.  Used judiciously, they reward skilful play!\nA feeling of growth and accomplishment\nBy the end, you've all made a beautiful coral reef, using the translucent dice!\nA complex puzzle in a short playtime\nEvery turn is a thoughtful puzzle. Can you make a shape immediately? Can you make progress towards a larger shape? Is it worth using your fish to place an extra die? \nThe entire game, once you've played a few times, takes about 10 minutes per player. Even including teaching time, a first game with 4 players is usually over within an hour - meaning you can play it a 2nd time, or fit it in at the end of an evening.\nA new way of thinking\nMovement can quickly change what colour a given pile will be allocated to.  It's all about keeping your options open and keeping an eye on what everyone else is doing. \n6 unique rule-breaking 'specialists' for varied games\nThere are 3 piles of land cards you can choose from. Each is tied to one specialists power. \nAn fresh take on drafting\nNormally when you draft in games you take the card and use them immediately or later. In Islands that is still the case, but the cards you discard have an impact on how far you can move the dice. By having land cards underneath specialists (and therefore activating their ability when taken) it can make the difference between a good move, and great move.\nEach is wildly different, so the 20 different setups all feel unique.\nThanks to Polyderon Collider for this awesome gif!\nYou have 2 dice to potentially place. Dice can only cover lower numbers, but 1's are wild.\nYou can spend fish tokens before you place a die to add/subtract 1 from its value, gamble by rerolling it, or even place two dice on the same turn!\nCollect a card if the die that you place lets you complete a shape! You've earned those points!\nYou get a fish if you didn't manage to make a shape. If you were the first to play on a fish square or you bring a stack to the maximum height, you get another fish.\nFinish your turn by rolling new dice so you have 2 ready for your next turn\nAt the end of the game, add up all the values of your shape cards and whoever has the highest total is the winner!\nClick to download the basic rulebook for Coral!\nClick here to land on the page with the Coral PnP!\n*Please note in this video Tom unfortunately should receive a fish token every time he does not score a card (in addition to reaching the highest level of a stack  (3) and landing on fish tokens). This is by far the most normal way to receive fish, and would have made his game much easier to mitigate. \nThanks to Polyderon Collider for this awesome image of \"final game-state\"!\nChoose a pile of cards. \nKeep 1 in a personal area. This affects this turn's movement and final scoring.\nMove a die. The colour of the card you kept determines what colour of die you can choose. Increase its value. \nThe number of cards in the pile determines how far it can move. Dice move over other dice of lower numbers.\nSpecialists let you break rules in various ways.\nThat's all you do on a turn!\nAt the end of a game, look at each colour 1-by-1. Whoever kept the most cards of a colour keeps the tallest piles with that colour on top. Take all the dice in a pile!\nWhoever has the most dice is the winner!\nClick to download the basic rulebook for Islands!\nClick here to land on the page with the Islands PnP!\n\nThe Deluxe edition contains extra mini-expansions for Coral (but not Islands)\nIf you are easily able to visualise the shapes, add the 3D module straight away! \n\nIt's a bit trickier to 'see', and rewards you for exploring the 3rd dimension. It also means that the final boards look even prettier, as it leads to more intertwined shapes.\nThe live coral expansion is all about the coral on the top of each stack! \n\nYou will be rewarded for making shapes or using particular numbers when viewing the board from above, regardless of what the height of each stack is. We are thoroughly exploring this idea and taking it in 2 directions - the fast flowing module is all about quick objectives that sit alongside your usual target shapes and replace a couple of them. \n\nThe deep module offers you far more points per card, but these patterns might take you most of the game to set up. \n\nWe are still making last-minute changes to this expansion. You will see preview cards and full rules in due course.\nWe are finalising the solo mode for Coral. You take turns as normal, whilst 'nature' continues to grow. Nature has no objectives, but simply helps and hinders you as it will.\nYou are trying to make all the shapes selected when you begin. With a few different challenges, this will be a fun way to play with the framework of the game when alone.\nRules will be freely available soon.\nCoral's solo mode is compatible with the 3D shapes expansion but there is no solo mode for Islands.\nFor written reviews scroll down to the written reviews section below!\n*The deluxe edition is Kickstarter exclusive for 6months after being sent to backers! We will however, continue to allow pre-orders on our website, and sell it directly at conventions (once backers have received their copies). \nTo save on shipping costs you can order our other established games to come with your copy of Coral Islands. \nPlease note, we will NOT be using a pledge manager for this campaign, but we can still take orders/pre-orders after the campaign.\nWelcome to Dinoworld, Pocket Pharma and Pocket Sub listed below are the deluxe editions.\nRuthless - a pirate-themed deck-building game. (\u00a323/$29) \nPocket Pharma - a pharmaceutical themed drafting game. (\u00a321/$27) \nPocket Sub - an abstract strategy game of nautical warfare.

If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store email address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 10 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates. \nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment, so we can offer shipping within UK/USA at no additional cost!\nCosts elsewhere are shown in the approximate local currency. To double check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the tier and select your country.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia).\nWe do not charge additional shipping after the kickstarter! You will not have to pay anything more!\nTransparency guarantee\nWith every game we have kickstarted, we kept backers informed of all the problems, issues, and - of course - good news as we get the games finished, manufactured and sent to your door. This project will be no different. We don't believe in updates for the sake of them, but we aim for an update twice a week during a campaign, and once every 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over.\nGet it before retail\nLab Wars and Cauldron Master, our first two games, were delivered on time or even early! Dice Hospital was held up at customs and faced a few manufacturing issues, but we are in turn delaying the retail launch to put our backers first. Coral Island's deluxe version will not be in general retail until backers have had it for many months. Backers are always our priority.\nWorld class manufacturing\nThis is a dice game and we taking steps to ensure we have good quality, beautifully translucent dice. For this project, we are considering Longpack, who manufactured Dice Hospital for us. Given we are using \"standard components\" we don't anticipate there being any issues during manufacturing, but sometimes things do happen.\nShipment and Fulfilment\nWe will be shipping most - if not all - the games from our UK Alley Cat Games HQ via Royal Mail. If Brexit happens and free trade is no longer possible between UK and EU, we will send some games to EU to be fulfilled from within. As such, the game should be customs-friendly for all EU and UK backers.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\nFebruary: KS completes, Chinese New Year \nMarch: Submit Files to manufacturer \nApril: Manufacturing\nMay: Shipping from China to the UK begins \nMid-late June: Arrives in ports \nEarly July: Fulfilment commences \nAugust: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction.

We are a capable and knowledgeable company. Customer service has always been our number one priority.\n\nBrexit is a new potential obstacle that we might have to deal with. Worst case scenario, we will have WTO terms for import/export with EU and customs will become an issue. ACG does have the cash reserves to absorb the potential extra cost of the game and - worst case scenario - we will send several cases of the game back into EU.\n\nWe have worked out a plan to hopefully send the games to EU backers before Brexit, but this can't be guaranteed. If we do get the games as planned, EU backers will be sent games earlier.\n\nWe will be selling the games at UKGE - but only if backers can get their games first, or at worst, pick up their games at the UKGE.\n\nWe are a very open company and welcome feedback, suggestions and comments either publicly or privately!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Sea Pen Tier", "descp": "Retailers - back here!\nMessage us for the rates.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "Blue Coral Tier", "descp": "Get Coral Islands the base game!\n- Includes all stretch goals!\nShipping:\nUK: Free, USA: $4, CA/EU1: \u20ac5/$8\nROW: Please check your country in the dropbox\nAdd-ons (with free shipping included!)\n- Ruthless: Add \u00a323/$29\n- Pocket Pharma: Add \u00a321/$27\n- Pocket Sub: Add \u00a316/$21\n- Welcome to DinoWorld: Add \u00a329/$37\nPlease note add-ons will come together with your pledge in October!

We hope you\u2019ll come along for the ride!\nThe Forest Dragon Bang & Twang is a fast and fun game of keeping up with an ever-changing piece of music, played by a variety of characters on a variety of characterful instruments from the world of The Forest Dragon.\nThe musicians gather at crossroads and campfires across the forest. They produce their instruments, tune up and begin to play! They play tunes both weird and wonderful, with many a twang and bang from their array of amazing musical implements. As the tunes get faster and more complicated, the musicians wrestle to keep up and challenge each others\u2019 musical ability.\nWith amazing art from Rory, Ben, and with just a little help from their dad, games-industry veteran Jon Hodgson, The Forest Dragon Bang & Twang is a fast and exciting game for the whole family!\nThe Forest Dragon centres around 3 special cards. On one side they have \u201cBang\u201d and on the other, they have \u201cTwang\u201d.\nThere\u2019s also a deck of 24 other cards, from which players draw a hand of 2 cards. Players must try to match the sequence shown on those special \u201criff\u201d cards with the cards in their hand. They can flip one of the riff cards, or they can move one of them. If they can match a riff they \"bank\" that card. Or they can play a special card that has special effects. \nA round of play takes around ten minutes, and play moves around the table nice and fast!\n\nWe\u2019ve made the game so there\u2019s almost always something to do on your turn, so no one gets left out. And for younger players, you can just play along and have an enjoyable time. For older players though, there\u2019s a lot more strategy - remembering who has \u201cbanked\u201d what card, and deciding which of the possible moves is the best one on your turn adds a lot more depth.\nThere are 8 special cards in the Bang & Twang deck, and these cards form \u201cthe tune\u201d. If you want to change the tune for the next game, you can take out those 8 special cards, and replace them with a different set! This makes gameplay really varied!\nBang & Twang features 6 sets of special cards - 6 \u201ctunes\u201d, and totals 67 cards in the box!\nYou can download a print and play version of Bang & Twang right now! It doesn\u2019t have art - we\u2019ve kept it very simple for home printing, but you can try out the first \u201ctune\u201d, absolutely free! Download it here: https://www.dropbox.com/\nIn 2016 we Kickstarted our first game together. The Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9 proved to be a huge success. We raised way more support than we expected, and doubled the size of the game through the campaign! It was an amazing ride!\nThe Forest Dragon was created by Rory when he was 7. He\u2019d been thinking about games, and described the whole thing in pretty much one breath. We wrote it down and slowly over a couple of years turned it into a playable game. And with your help on Kickstarter we made it into a reality. You can buy our first game in selected stores and on line.\nClearly, this isn't really just about making another game. I want my kids, Rory and Ben to continue to learn about hard work, games design, probability, art, layout, writing rules, product design, costings and all kinds of things that are good to learn about. \nMaking a game with them has been a way to show them a creative path, and how the whole world around them is someone's idea put into practice. With this second game, we\u2019re learning about sticking with something, persistence, and all the trials and pitfalls of making that second game. Can we do it? We think so!\nI really want to show the boys the reality of how games get made, and all the different processes involved. With Bang & Twang, we\u2019re learning about what it means to make an \u201cintellectual property\u201d and how we approach a line of games, rather than just one game. \nOur first game was made with print on demand technology that let us order one game for each person that backed us. This time we\u2019d like to try to go one further and make a full print run of the game, and get it deeper into more shops around the world! If we fund, it means we\u2019ll make the game through print on demand once again. And we\u2019ll be very happy with that. But if we can reach some of our stretch goals, we\u2019ll be able to make a more fancy box, and do a whole print run, which will be a big learn for the boys! (Dad has made many such boxed games in his day job, so you\u2019re in safe hands!)\nTo help build towards our goal we had some great Add-Ons. These are extra things you can pledge for. If you decide you\u2019d like an Add-On, then up your pledge by the appropriate amount. You can pledge for them before they are unlocked if you wish - that will help them get unlocked.\n\nIf we do manage to unlock some of these Add-Ons we\u2019ll make some new pledge levels that include them too, for your convenience.\n\nAll prices include shipping.\nBang & Twang Badge Set Add \u00a35 to your pledge\nYou\u2019ll get a cool selection of exclusive Forest Dragon goodies! 4 Forest Dragon badges, a cool round sticker, and a square fridge magnet!\n\nThe Forest Dragon By Rory Add \u00a317 to your pledge\nThis is the game that started it all. The price includes shipping.\nThe Forest Dragon Expansion Box Add \u00a317 to your pledge\n A selection of amazing expansions to the original Forest Dragon game! Includes The Poo Cave, Dogs and Stuff, Robo Realm, Fire Dragon Realm, Quest Givers!\n\nOriginal Game Double Up! Add \u00a330 to your pledge\nBoth the original Forest Dragon by Rory game AND the Expansion Box\nBang & Twang Play Mat LOCKED Add \u00a312 to your pledge\nCurrently locked, but with enough backers, it\u2019ll become available! A neoprene play mat that makes a lovely space to hold the riff cards and the draw deck. It\u2019s 13 inches square making it large enough to use the coasters on too! It\u2019s like a mouse mat but bigger and cooler!\nBang & Twang Coasters Add \u00a35 to your pledge\nAVAILABLE NOW! These are adorable! Replace the Riff cards you get in your Bang & Twang Box with a set of 3 Bang & Twang Coasters! \nBang & Twang Coins Add \u00a312 to your pledge\nAVAILABLE NOW! The Bang & Twang coins are something very special - a strictly limited edition set of real metal coins, with gorgeous enamel colours - green on one side, orange on the other. Made by the coin experts at Campaign Coins these are really amazing. They come in a set of three, and are perfect to replace the riff cards in the Bang & Twang box for the fanciest game imaginable!\nBurp & Fart LOCKED Add \u00a315 to your pledge\nCurrently locked, but with enough backers, it\u2019ll become available! This is basically disgusting. One of our playtesters who is old enough to know better suggested the whole game could be re-skinned as \u201cBurp & Fart\u201d. This will feature the adorable \u201cGreedy Boys\u201d characters sat in a ditch, holding a burping and farting contest. If we unlock this stretch goal we\u2019ll make a whole new base game available as an Add-On. It will have the same rules, but all new, deeply ill-mannered card art. \nWARNING: Will contain pictures of burps and farts drawn by giddy children.\nMany of our fans are friends and family who don't know much about Kickstarter. Thanks for making it this far! We love you!\nKickstarter is a website that allows project creators with an idea to pitch that idea to the audience of the Internet. There's usually a product at the heart of a Kickstarter campaign. In this case, it's the Bang & Twang game. \nIf people like the idea they can pledge money to the project. If enough money is pledged in order to meet the campaign's funding goal by the end, the money is collected from your card by Kickstarter, they take a cut, and the rest is passed on to the creator. And the project is made a reality. If we don\u2019t raise enough pledges no one gets charged. And we go away to think very hard about what we did wrong. \nTo encourage and thank supporters, or \"backers\" as they are known, we are offering a range of Rewards and Add-Ons. These start out at the game itself, and you can get more stuff like artwork, your own expansions and more!\nAnother encouragement to spread the word and convince others to join in, are Stretch Goals. These are milestones which unlock extra rewards. Sometimes they allow backers to buy something new, by upping their pledge. Other times they add something to existing rewards for free. \n\nThroughout the period of the campaign, you can amend your pledge up and down as you see fit. Only once the campaign ends is the amount you pay locked in. So it pays to keep an eye on progress, and pledge for everything you'd like!\nIf you have any questions at all, please drop me (Jon) a line via PM, email, text or whatever method suits you best, and I\u2019ll do my best to explain how to back us! Don\u2019t be shy, we understand that Kickstarter can be daunting if you\u2019ve never used it.\nTo pledge to our campaign you need to hit the Pledge button. You'll sign up to an account, decide how much you'd like to pledge, select what kind of reward you'd like - you can choose to just give to the campaign out of kindness, or you can select what you'd like to receive for your support. We'd love you to have a copy of the game.\nYou can throw in whatever you like above the basic pledge levels - there aren't fixed amounts you have to give.\nYou'll provide some payment details and, if enough people chose to support us, at the end of the campaign your card will be charged. The project creators get in touch a short time after that to collect any additional information they might need.\nFollowing a Kickstarter campaign is a lot of fun. A community of supporters is created, who can all share their excitement and support in the comments section, as well as ask questions or make requests of the project. You'll also receive updates throughout the campaign either here or by email.\nFor our second campaign we\u2019re playing it very safe - the whole of the base game is done. 5 additional Expansions are completely made. With children helping to make the core reward we needed to know they'd be able to finish the project. And they have. We just need money for printing and shipping it to you. We are not spending any time after the campaign on further development, testing or art for the core game. It\u2019s done. This does mean we won\u2019t go much beyond 5 additional expansions, but we feel that\u2019s the best and most honest way to do things. We have not yet completed work on the art and graphics for \u201cBurp & Fart\u201d but should we be lucky enough to unlock that stretch goal we\u2019ll get it done as soon as possible! It won\u2019t take long.\nStretch goals are each unlocked as we reach their milestone in our funding level. If we\u2019re lucky we\u2019ll reveal more as the campaign progresses!\n\u00a31500 This is our basic goal. At this level, we\u2019ll make a print on demand version of the game in a nice tuck box and send it to you with our thanks. \nWe\u2019ll reveal more stretch goals if we do well!\nPraise for the Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9\nDon\u2019t just take our word for it, here are some thoughts about our first game, The Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9: \n\"The Forest Dragon is a precious thing, an experience Jon Hodgson and his son Rory will treasure for years to come. And it\u2019s a fine game to boot! We\u2019re so lucky they decided to share it with us.\" - Francesco Nepitello, game designer\n\u201cThe Forest Dragon is as indispensable as wet wipes and snacks, and occupies a permanent place in my 'leaving the house with the kids' bag.\u201d - Gareth Ryder Hanrahan, author, game designer \n\"If you\u2019ve ever experienced wonder while wandering and exploring, the Forest Dragon contains that excitement in a conveniently-carried, child-friendly card game.\" - Jacob Rodgers, game designer\n\u201cIt's very easy to pick up and play the game, with enough depth in the game to keep kids of all ages entertained. At its heart, there's a marvelous whimsical adventure, which had my pair (an 8 and 11-year-old) coming back for more. I knew I was onto a winner when they were picking up the cards and having games without me :) \u201d - Newt Newport, game designer\n\u201cThe most nutritious cardgame I have ever eaten!\u201d - Patric G\u00f6tz, game publisher \n\"Our Forest Dragon card game has (literally) been to the base of Mount Doom and to Hobbiton, entertained plenty of adults and children along the trek and is an absolute joy to play.\" - Scott Purdy, artist\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good game because it was written by a kid; it\u2019s a good game because it\u2019s a good game.\u201d - Jared Earle, writer, photographer\n\u201cIt's an awesome game which my kids love playing! Especially when they beat me at it!\u201d - Gordon Kennedy, game artist\n\n\"With its bright colors, fun illustrations, and easy rules, The Forest Dragon became a fast favorite in our house. It is quick enough to learn to hold my children's attention and fun enough to appeal to adults as well.\" - August Hahn, game designer\n\n\"This game is amazing. I like stealing items from my family, especially my brother. We usually play with the whole pack to make the game really long and exciting, and my favourite bit is the Poo Portal!\" - Milla aged 7.\n\"Both enchanting and hilarious, this simple-but-fun card game is already a favourite in our house. The artwork is delightful. The Poo Cave Expansion is essential. We've played it with small people and with my eighty-year-old parents. It's a winner with everyone. Gutted we missed out on Clarinetto.\" - Claire Longhurst, gamer\n\n\"So good I wrote a review of it\"  - Pookie, game reviewer\n\n\"It\u2019s funny and my wife likes it\" - Adam Littlefield, musician\n\n\"I\u2019ve so far only played it with adults, but they all loved it (and it wasn\u2019t too complicated for them) \ud83d\ude42\" Andrew Peregrine, game designer\n\n\"Fantastic game. My kids have racked up over 200 hours playing this game. A family favourite that never get old! Highly recommended.\" - Wayne McNamara, gamer\n\n\"Such a simple game and great fun to play. That said, I\u2019ve yet to win a game against my eight year old and his friends!\" -Tom Cusworth, gamer\n\"The Forest Dragon is a great game. Attractive to look at, simple enough to play as soon as the box is open, but with enough variety to repay any number of repeat plays. And the monsters are very cool.\" - Matt Cambridge, writer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve successfully made our first game and delivered it to people all around the world. \n\nWe're keeping things very simple.

Everything will be ready to start printing at the end of the campaign. \n\nLike every kickstarter creator, we\u2019re a bit worried about shipping - the price of moving stuff around the world can change a LOT in a short time. We hope we've done our sums right.\n\nWhere we print the game will depend on how well we do. If we fund at a lower level it will be printed in the UK. If we manage to unlock the fancier version it will be printed in Europe, and dispatched worldwide from the UK.\n\nWe want to deliver in a timely fashion, using processes we understand, even if that means a lower final figure.

Each time you play, you'll have to consider a new set of abilities and ways to score.\nPlayable with 150 players!!!***\nBy using a central pool of visitor cards, Light Mode can be played with a ridiculous number of players! Theoretically, you could use the 150 sheets of paper included to run a massive event at a convention!\nOr, if that's not enough, use 2 boxes for 300 players.\n*** - Final number depends on the arrangement with the manufacturer as it may be 150 double sided sheets (light vs danger mode) or two 75 sheet pads of paper for each mode.\nA complex spatial puzzle \nEvery square of your park is a valuable resource. Enclosures must be accessible to visitors. Each path you build should lead directly somewhere. Generators can be cleverly used for multiple enclosures! Special buildings make you think even more carefully about where your pens are. Every placement is critical!\nROLL the dice\nUse each die to draw one of 3 things: paths, a special building, or a dinosaur pen!\nPaths let you connect everything together. In DinoWorld, rather than using whole dice values, you use the pips. So to draw two straights and a T you need two pips for the straights, and another two pips for the T!\nSpecial buildings are different each game and offer you different ways to score!\nDinosaur pens are one of the main way you get points! Draw your fences, make sure you have the required number of generator connections, and then simply draw in your dinosaur! You just need to make sure you have a path leading into each of your new dinosaurs by the end of each round.\nAt the end of each turn, check if you've managed to complete any of the visitor cards next to you! If you have, you take those cards! You'll score them at the end of the game, and you've just denied points to your neighbour!\nThat's it! Ater 9 turns, the game is over. Hopefully, you'll have drawn a beautiful park where visitors can go to see exciting dinosaur clones!\nIn danger mode, the dinosaurs might break free! This time introducing a damage tracker, and a power outage phase.\nFor each dinosaur pen you build, the risk increases. Herbivores increase your threat by one, carnivores are doubly risky!\nYou can use security to mitigate the danger, but risky play (not using security) does have potential reward...\nAt the end of each round, roll the danger dice! Add your threat level, subtract your security and see if any pens are straining the generators too much! If they are, the pens will be damaged and be closer to a break-out!\nDanger mode also adds a variety of public use laboratories, which will give you different ways to mitigate the rules each game, for a limited use per type of lab.\nIn the deluxe and expanded edition of the game, it contains 2 new mini expansions and cards for an automa.\nNotably, this edition will not be available for general retail until 6 months after copies have been sent to backers! We will however may still sell it directly at conventions such as GenCon, UKGE and Essen and our own website.\nAquatic expansion\nFirst, we have the aquatic expansion (3 cards), which lets you fill that lake! The aquatic expansion has fixed numbers for the dinosaurs which are randomised at the beginning of each game. Each card dictates which dice spread is required to build a certain dinosaurs, so some cards may only allow one type of dinosaur to be built with one type of value on the dice, while other cards will allow an even spread of dice for all dinosaurs. \nThese dinosaurs are scored using a set collection mechanic, with the same, and different dinosaurs scoring (almost) exponentially.\nAviary expansions\nNext, we have the aviaries! Choose from a wide selection of awkward and fixed shapes that you will play with each game. Flying dinosaurs breed, so place them early enough that they can be filled! (Final card count 15-20 depending on final playtesting during the campaign)\nAutoma deck for solo players\nThe 1p Automa lets you play solitaire in a brand new way, making some binary decisions for an AI that competes with you for visitors and points. More details below....\nHow does the automa play?\nDesigned by automa creation specialist: David Turczi and further refined by Nick Shaw, you will play against a \"normal\" or \"hard\" automa. The automa has it's own deck with 16 double use cards. 12 can be used with the core game, while 4 can be added if used in conjunction with the aviary and aquatic expansions. The automa also uses an extra die so that each round you will be rolling 4 dice, allocating one to the automa, and the final 3 to yourself. \nHow does it work?\nThe automa will have one card drawn from the automa deck at the beginning of each turn. The card will be double use, with each side giving instructions of what the automa would do (and therefore score), if you choose that side. The side you choose will be dependent on the die you allocate to the automa - hence starving yourself of a particular value, and potentially gifting the automa valuable points if allocated without careful consideration.\nHow does it score?\nThe automa scores by using a set collection mechanic of units written on the cards themselves such as special buildings, dinosaurs and in hard mode, the security and generators. The trick is to allocate a die to the automa with careful consideration!\nA german version of the rulebook has been translated, while a french one is in the works. We hope to offer multiple languages through the Boardgamegeek page soon\n *The deluxe edition will not be available for retail purchase for 6 months after backers get their copies. We will however allow late pledges to allow those late to the party, to get this edition, right until we start shipping them out. So if most backers have received their copies in June, the deluxe edition will only be available the following January. Please note, Retailers who back this campaign directly, will also be treated as kickstarter backers - so there may be a small number of retailers who sell the deluxe version of the game.\nTo save on shipping costs you can order our popular and previous games: \nRuthless - a pirate themed deckbuilding game (\u00a323/$29)\nPocket Pharma - a pharmaceutical themed drafting game (\u00a321/$27)\nPocket Sub - an abstract strategy game of nautical warfare (\u00a316/$21)\nTo add these on, please use our pledge manager when it opens\nThe Pocket games mentioned above are the deluxe editions\nDice Hospital may be available in the future as an add-on, but will be available soon through all good FLGS's. \nAdditionally, we are likely to offer extra pads for people to purchase, again in the pledge manager. We think it'll be around \u00a36-8 if purchased along with a game through kickstarter/pledge manager. \nPlay along with Tom Heath by using the basic print and play files we've supplied!\nWe always offer excellent rates for retailers around the world. If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store email address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 10 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates. \nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment, so we can offer shipping within UK/USA at no additional cost!\n\nCosts elsewhere are shown in the approximate local currency. To double check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the tier and select your country. \nDue to previous shipping issues we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia). \nWe do not charge additional shipping after the kickstarter! You will not have to pay anything more!\nTransparency guarantee\nWith every game we have kickstarted, we kept backers informed of all the problems, issues, and - of course - good news as we get the games finished, manufactured and sent to your door. This project will be no different. We don't believe in updates for the sake of them, but we try to do an update twice a week during a campaign, and once every 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over.\nGet it before retail\nLab Wars and Cauldron Master, our first two games, were delivered on time or even early! Dice Hospital was held up at customs and faced a few manufacturing issues, but we are in turn delaying the retail launch to put our backers first. Backers are always our priority. \nWorld class manufacturing\nFor this project, we are considering Longpack, who we have worked with several times in the past. We are also considering established Polish manufacturers (Trefl and Axel), who might be able to print and deliver the game in only 6 weeks. Ultimately, it will depend on the exact number of backers, and how many we print.\nShipment and Fulfilment\nWe will be shipping most - if not all - the games from our UK Alley Cat Games HQ via Royal Mail. If Brexit has happened before the games are ready to be shipped, we will send some games to EU to be fulfilled from within. As such, the game should be customs-friendly for all EU and UK backers.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\nmid-December: Submit Files to manufacturer \nJanuary: Manufacturing\nFebruary: Chinese New Year\nearly-mid March: Shipping from China to the UK begins\nMid-late April: Arrives in ports\nEarly May: Fulfilment commences \nlate May: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies. \nIf we do decide to use a Polish manufacturer, our timeline will be as follows:\nDecember: extra time for tweaks\nJanuary: Submit Files to manufacturer \nearly February: Manufacturing  \nearly March: Shipping from Poland to the UK \nmid-March: Fulfilment commences \nlate March: EU Fulfilment completed. \nearly May: fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always put a worst case scenario on our tiers - as delays can happen.\nThis game has had the attention of a talented team lavished upon it. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs always with our campaigns, we cannot prevent \"god like\" failures such as thunderstorm, hurricanes etc.\n\nWe can promise you though that we will do everything in our power to keep everyone updated, and will stick to the original plan if at all possible.\n\nWe have lots of previous experience running projects. We are a capable and knowledgeable company. Customer service has always been our number one priority.\n\nBrexit is a new potential obstacle that we might have to deal with. Worst case scenario, we will have WTO terms for import/export with EU and customs will become an issue. ACG does have the cash reserves to absorb the potential extra cost of the game and - worst case scenario - we will send several cases of the game back into EU. \n\nWe have worked out a plan to hopefully send the games to EU backers before Brexit, but this can't be guaranteed. If we do get the games as planned, EU backers will be sent games earlier.\n\nWe will be selling the games at UKGE - but only if backers can get their games first, or at worst, pick up their games at the UKGE.\n\nWe are a very open company and welcome feedback, suggestions and comments either publically or privately!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Probing Protoceratops (RETAILER OPTION)", "descp": "- For retailers to back here for retailer rates.\n- Please message us for retailer rates.\n- Non-retailers can back here to stay informed.\n- A big thank you from us!\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincere thanks.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["120 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "Velociraptor Value", "descp": "- Full game plus all stretch goals\n- Free shipping to UK/USA!\n- Subsidised shipping elsewhere\nAppx: $27, \u20ac24, AUS$38, CAD$36\nPlease select your country for more detailed shipping costs outside UK/USA, or see the shipping section.\nINCLUDES:\nWelcome to DinoWorld full game\nAll stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["197 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a329 or more", "title": "Tremendous Tyrannosaurus rex", "descp": "- Full game plus all stretch goals\n- Expansion pack with aquatic expansion, aviary expansion, 1p automa mode.\n- Free shipping to UK/USA, subsidised shipping elsewhere\n- We will not sell this version to distributors/retailers for 6 months after backers receive their copies, although we may still sell it directly at conventions and our website\nAppx: $37, \u20ac33, AUS$52, CAD$49\nPlease select your country for more detailed shipping costs outside UK/USA, or see the shipping section.\nINCLUDES:\nWelcome to DinoWorld full game\nAll stretch goals\nAviary expansion\nAquatic expansion\n1-player automa mode\n6 months exclusivity after release", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,941 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Welcome to DinoWorld shipped!", "update_content": "We've just shipped all NON-UK orders!\nAfter shipping domestic (UK) orders last week, we've now shipped all international (non-UK) orders.

PLEASE NOTE MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED.\nMonumental is a massive board game for 1 to 4 players where you\u2019ll compete with your opponents to lead your prestigious civilization through the ages.\nThe game starts with the Classic era (antiquity), will cross the Medieval times to end up in the Modern industrial age. Through all these ages, you\u2019ll have to assemble your military forces to conquer new territories, focus on scientific research to enhance your civilization\u2019s abilities, build breathtaking wonders to harness their unique advantages, and develop your cultural policies to guide your people to victory. The fate of your civilization is upon you!\nEach civilization has its own deck of cards with cultural specificities, as well as an army to explore and conquer the provinces on the board. On each turn, you\u2019ll be able to draw and activate cards, combining their effects to develop your civilization and conquer the world. But you\u2019re not alone in this race, as your opponents will try and outrun you as soon as they can. A game of Monumental plays over different eras, each of them featuring new cards to acquire and use. At the very beginning of the game, you control a small town in some remote country that nobody has ever heard of. Yet by the end of the game, thanks to the many cards that you will acquire, all will admire your monumental city, the jewel of a glorious nation!\nAs war is inevitable, you\u2019ll need to lead your troops to combat when necessary. Fight the barbarians or protohistoric Free Cities to loot their resources, then wage war against your opponents! Each civilization comes with 14 army units - either nicely illustrated tokens (Classic edition) or finely sculpted unique miniatures (Deluxe edition) that you\u2019ll be able to deploy on a richly illustrated modular game board to take control of the world. On the other side of your army, send your explorers to crawl new provinces, exploit new resources or even obtain new ones from various marketplaces in order to reinforce your city production capacity and speed up your evolution. Not a warmonger? Then maybe focus on Knowledge to enhance your cards\u2019 abilities and gain more resources. Build Libraries, Laboratories, Colleges and other scientific buildings to educate your people. Then use this Knowledge to gain powerful cards that will allow you to do more actions in a single turn. Another solution would be to focus on Culture: various actions you take in the game will develop the culture of your empire, which in turn allows you to deploy special Cultural Policies with permanent advantages.\nAnd of course, what would be a civilization without its wonders? The Great Pyramid, Stonehenge, the Great Wall\u2026 all have powerful in-game effects that will allow your empire to rise to glory. Building wonders is another way to assert your dominance over your opponents in Monumental, and a great way to show your greatness to the world.\nThe path to glory will not be simple. You need to find the proper balance between all these possibilities to achieve victory\u2026 and this will take time. But after all, Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day!\nEach Civilization comes with a set of cards comprising common buildings along with a unique building and knowledge card. The basic buildings of your city will give you the basic resources: the fort will provide Military, the Library will provide Science and the Work Camp will provide Production.\nA unique Knowledge card as well as 5 Cultural Policies complete the cultural distinction between civilizations. A Warlord card, working along with the corresponding unit on the board, also gives a unique and special conquest power to their owner.\nKnowledge cards that will increase other card\u2019s capabilities when coupled with them.\nIn Monumental, the cards that you will buy and activate in your city are the key to victory. You must find the proper balance between the different types of cards, as each of them will give you special advantages. Managing your deck and anticipating the cards to come will also give you the upper hand over your opponents.\nAs the game progresses through its 3 ages (Classic \u2013 Medieval \u2013 Modern times), so does history allowing you to acquire several types of more and more powerful cards: Buildings to bring you more resources and some occasional special abilities, Knowledges that will increase other card\u2019s capabilities when coupled with them, Wonders which are very expensive but very powerful (and very rewarding as victory points) and, to finish with, Cultural Policies cards which can be activated thanks to culture points given by other type of cards and which will give you powerful passive permanent advantages.\nCITY AND CROSS-TAPING\nBefore the first turn, you randomly draw 9 cards from your deck (out of 14 at the beginning of the game) and place them on the table in a square of 3x3 cards: this is your city for the first turn. Over the course of the game, your city will evolve. You\u2019ll start with basic buildings with limited interaction, but by the end of the game, your city will be full of advanced buildings, breathtaking wonders, and top-notch Knowledge.\nHowever, even if there are 9 cards in your city, you can only activate 5 of them on each turn. This will lead to difficult choices, as all cards can be useful. Your citizens cannot work all the time though, and you need to allow them to rest.\nThis unique gaming mechanic is called CROSS-TAPPING. To activate your cards, you choose a line and a column in your city, and activate (tap) the cards from this line and column (5 cards out of 9). You can choose any line and any column; you simply cannot choose two lines or two columns.\nThis innovative mechanic introduces a whole new way of programing and using the cards of your deck turn after turn as optimization and combos are the heart of the game.\nEXPLORATION AND CONQUEST\nDeveloping your city and your empire will require you to gather resources and to conquer new territories.\nThe territories of Monumental are called Provinces. The modular game board gives the basic setup of each game. This setup will be different whether you use one of the pre-defined scenarios (made for a certain number of players) or one of the scenarios you create.\nAt the beginning of the game, the provinces are all to discover and are occupied by independent barbarian tribes or ancient Free Cities. You\u2019ll have to move your army (thanks to your military points) to conquer them. The conquest mechanism is very simple: one military point allow you to move one unit \u2013 you need to move at least the same number of military units as the defense value of the province (a number given by the terrain difficulty + the existing inhabitants resistance). Each conquered province gives you victory points at the end of the game but it also gives you more required space to build your wonders.\nThe Provinces also contains various resources depending on them. Sometimes you may recruit some workers (as a production token) and sometimes you may end up in a Maketplace (such as Babylon or Rome) where you will be able to grab new resources to bring to your city in order to enhance your future turns capacity of development. All these resources are only opened to your Explorers who moves thanks to military points too but who never take part in any battle.\nTurn after turns your realm will become bigger and bigger, your knowledge and culture stronger and your buildings and wonders more and more impressive.\nDesigned to be extremely modular, Monumental is implementing on one side the power and depth of a deckbuilding system which loads the game with hundreds of potential combos and on the other side the flexibility of a modular game board which allows the players to create an infinity of new scenarios, all of this to bring on the table a game that is super easy to learn but hard to master thanks to an important learning curve and which will grant dozens and dozens of hours of renewed playing pleasure!\nPlease note that we are currently working on the graphic layout of the rules. However, you may already access the prototype PDF file which is absolutely not what the final files layout will be ;). Please note also that, despite the fact that these rules have been thoroughly tested, they may still evolve during the campaign tweaking and fine tuning process.\nPlease click on the pic to download the PDF file.\nCliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger le fichier PDF.\n                    My name is Matthew Dunstan, and I\u2019m a research scientist and game designer based in Cambridge, UK. I started designing games about 8 years ago, when I was still living in Australia, and to date I have had 11 published designs. Monumental is my second game with Funforge following the release of Professor Evil and The Citadel of Time last year. Monumental is a fitting title for the game, considering it is the most ambitious of my designs to date!\nWhile the origin of Monumental isn\u2019t as old as the Pyramids or Stonehenge, it is still one with many twists and turns, a journey that started over 4 years ago. At the heart of Monumental is a new mechanic I call \u2018cross-tapping\u2019, where you deal cards from your deck into a 3 x 3 grid, and you choose 1 row and 1 column of cards to use on your turn. In this very simple system, you already have all the tools for some very satisfying combos, and every turn you are presented with engaging and interesting decisions.\nI was intrigued by deck-building games, which are interesting by the fact of them offering a random selection of cards from your deck each turn, and then you have to make the most of what you have been dealt. But the interest is not really in the playing of the cards \u2013 once you have a hand your choice of actions is mostly automatic. I wanted this feeling of getting a new set of opportunities each turn, but with some juicy decisions as to how to use these opportunities. What do you need to do right now, and what can wait until later? Do you pull off a small combo now, or wait and hope for something even better? Hopefully this tension and excitement permeates through Monumental from its core mechanism.\nFunforge has done an amazing job bringing my design to life, immersing you in the world of mighty armies, feats of technological advancement and towering wonders. The choices you make in Monumental will ultimately tell the tale of your civilization...what will you be remembered for?\nWithin three weeks after the campaign\u2019s end, we will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account using the CrowdOx pledge manager system.\nYou\u2019ll be able to chose your language options, add any desired add-ons to your pledge and complete your shipping informations at that time. You\u2019ll also be able to add any new add-ons at this point or complete your pledge in any desired way.\nIf you change adresses before we ship your rewards, you\u2019ll be able to access your survey anytime after we\u2019ve send it at this link: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/funforge/monumental\nPledge levels will be available in English or French. You\u2019ll have to choose the language of your pledge in the Pledge Manager, after the campaign completion.\nWe will also deliver Digital only versions (pdf files) in the following languages: German, Polish and Spanish. Please note that these digital files are not yet available and will be provided somewhere between the end of the KS campaign and the delivery of the games.\nLes niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais. Vous devrez choisir la langue de votre pledge dans le Pledge Manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne.\nNous fournirons \u00e9galement des fichiers uniquement digitaux (pdf) dans les langues suivantes : Allemand, Polonais et Espagnol. Notez que ces fichiers ne sont pas encore disponibles et seront fournis entre la fin de la campagne KS et la livraison des jeux.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter campaign completion.\nWe will collect all information through the Pledge Manager in order to dispatch your pledge to the most accurate of our international shipping hubs.\nHere are the initial estimates for the shipping costs depending on your area of living. Please, keep in mind that these costs may rise depending on the evolution of the campaign (unlocked stretch goals which will increase the weight of the parcel) and on the potential add-ons you would add to your initial pledge during the Pledge Manager phase.\nUSA: 12-15\u20ac to most states, 40\u20ac to Alaska, Hawaii, and all remote islands.\nEUROPE: 12\u20ac to France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. 15-20\u20ac to the rest of the UE countries. 20-25\u20ac to the non UE-countries.\nCANADA: 20\u20ac to most cities\nLATIN AMERICA: 45-80\u20ac to most countries.\nASIA: 15\u20ac to China and Hong Kong. 20-30\u20ac to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: 20-30\u20ac to Australia. 35\u20ac to New Zealand.\nFRENCH TERRITORIES: 40\u20ac to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nREST OF THE WORLD (all unlisted countries): 80-100\u20ac to most other countries.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.\nWe DO NOT SHIP to the following countries: Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Russia and Syria.\nPlease note that these prices are NOT including the possible brokerage and/or custom fees and/or local taxes that may apply to your country, these fees are at the customer's charge (i.e. you). As a reminder, if your country is listed into the Friendly shipping badges, you would have no import fees to pay.\nThe decision of making this project a Kickstarter exclusive is the result of a long and precise thinking.\nIn short, we had the choice of offering a \u00ab regular \u00bb game at a \u00ab regular \u00bb price or a fantastic game at a fair price.\nWe decided to go for the second option as we believe that this game deserves the best from our publishing efforts. Notably we have put a lot of hard work for months into the testing process but most and foremost into the production works, hiring dozens of stellar artists to turn each of the card artwork into a masterpiece. This is also true regarding the mini pre-production process for which we aimed to fantastic sculptures and unique (and expensive) design choices. These are just some examples of our commitment into making MONUMENTAL a unique experience for you.\nWe are used to publish games for ten years now and we know fairly well the distribution network and how it works. Should we choose to let this game go to the regular network, it would have been financially unsustainable for us because of the cascading margins of the classic distribution scheme.\nGame Designer: Matthew Dunstan\nPublisher: Funforge\nArt Direction: Philippe Nouhra\nArtworks: Paul Mafayon, Georges \"Gorg\" Bouchelaghem, Fajareka Setiawan, Agri Karuniawan, Asep Ariyanto, Maerel Hibadita, Tey Bartolome, Justine Cruz, Wyn Lacabra, Raph Lomotan, Brian Valeza, Chang-Wei Chen, Andreas Rocha, Marco Gorlei, Hendry Iwanaga, Philippe Nouhra, Charles-Victorien Kaing, Grafit Studio, Ivan Sevic, Roman Tishenin, Piotr Dura, Eugenia Firs, Jordan Albro, Orion Vang, Esmail Zalat, Uros Sljivic, Heng Tang, Tomislav Jagnjic, Alisher Mirzoev, Tuan Nguyen, Alexandre Mokhov, Martin Mottet\nLead sculptor: Charles-Victorien Kaing\nAdditional sculptors: Alfonso Gonso, Nicolas Pessina, Gregory Krasnoperov, Raul Garcia Latorre\nTranslator & rules editing: Antoine Prono, Gersende Cheylan, Claude Amardeil\nPublisher Testing: Philippe Nouhra, Antoine Prono, Claude Amardeil, Thomas Baggi-Sani, Charlotte Noailles, Gersende Cheylan\nLead Community Manager: Charlotte Noailles\nAdditional Community Managers: Claude, Brett, Valentin\nTabletopia integration: Thomas Baggi-Sani\nFunforge would like to express special thanks to David Preti and R\u00e9gis Bonness\u00e9e, you guys are the best! ;)\nFunforge social networks\nOfficial FB page: @MONUMENTALboardgame\nFunforge FB page: @Funforge\nTwitter: @funforge\nInstagram: @funforge\nTo spread the word!

Snacks and drinks are out. Everyone's excited for game night. The new hotness was just set down on the table. The atmosphere is electric. But there's one problem: The shrink wrap is still on the game. You know no one has read the rules. What now? Someone draws the short straw and becomes the one rule-reader to lead them all. An hour later, maybe you're playing. More likely, you've gone back to your group's old faithful. Perhaps you'll get to that new game next time.\n None of us like that situation, but we all experience it far too often. That's why we're creating Dized, the premiere tabletop companion app that will bring tons of helpful content to your gaming sessions. To begin, we're launching with Tutorials and Rules. \n Dized's fully-voiced, interactive Tutorials are able to react to what's happening in your game, so you can learn as you go, turn by turn. Dized acts like the friend that already knows what to do, introducing a game's rules on a need-to-know basis while adapting to the actions of the people at the table.\n If the need arises to refresh your memory, Dized's Rules have you covered. Dized Rules are like fast, searchable FAQs able to respond to all the questions you might have. Gone are the frustrating times where you find yourself endlessly flipping through the rulebook or scrolling through forums searching for a \"quick answer.\" And if something isn't covered, the publisher of the game can be notified and respond in a blink. No game night will be complete without Dized. And with Dized, no game night will ever be the same.\nIt's also important for us to note that Dized will be able to offer content in multiple languages, starting with French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Russian, Finnish, and Dutch!\nDized is designed to handle every type of game you bring to the table, including highly-strategic board games, family-friendly experiences, tabletop miniature games, collectible card games, chess, Bridge, and so much more.\nWe're giving you a look into the future with Dized Early Access, open to everyone right now. Anyone with an iOS or Android device can experience interactive Tutorials and Rules for the 2017 Spiel des Jahres winner Kingdomino, and interactive Tutorials for award-winning designer Eric Lang's Blood Rage and 2017 Kinderspiel des Jahres Winner ICECOOL. Those are just a taste of what's to come, so check back throughout the Kickstarter for additional content. Please note: the publisher FAQ notification feature is still in development and not part of early access at this time.\n                                    Based on feedback and conversations we\u2019ve had with gamers, families, education experts and others, one topic stands out: everyone learns and plays games at their own pace. There is a desire to use Dized in a way that works best for them according to their gaming experience, with fewer or more details throughout the interactive Tutorials.\nThrough the success of this campaign, we can address this need by incorporating learning algorithms directly into our Tutorial engine. We call this feature Adaptive Profiles. Your profile will learn the types of games you like and understand your level of gaming experience to better deliver custom learning experiences to you table. It ensures every player is on the same level, so everyone can focus on playing the game and enjoying their friends at the table.\nPublishers are on board with how Dized is changing the rules of learning and playing games. Feedback from Early Access tells us players are much more willing to try a new game if they can learn it through Dized. Even better, that leads to adding the game to their collections. That's why so many publishers you know and love are ready to get their games on Dized, which means the library is going to explode with new content.\nWe're happy to say that the Rules Creation Tool is now available for publishers and content-creators! The Dized Rules for a game can be completed in a very short time using this tool. We're also deep into development of the Tutorial Creation Tool (expected to release in 2019) that will do exactly what the name suggests: make Tutorial creation easy and fast.\nPublishers, sign up for the tools here!\nContent-Creators, sign up here!\nCreating the initial content for Dized Early Access took months per title, but we learned a lot about the type of Tools we needed to create. Without sacrificing quality, the Content Creation Tools will dramatically reduce production time for everyone using them and won't require a team of tech experts to use them! With our team, publishers and content-creators using the Content Creation Tools, you can expect the Dized library to expand fast and furious.\nCredits are exclusive to our crowdfunding backers. They will be used to acquire game packs or monthly subscriptions to the Dized service at deeply discounted rates. (See the chart below for details on what\u2019s included in each.) No matter the price of a game pack, 1 Credit will always cover it! Subscription rates are estimated to be $4.99 per month or $49 for a year, so using a Credit will always be the best value. For example, the Champion Pledge Level Credits could be used for 2.5 years of subscription at the price of 1 year. As an early supporter, we want to ensure you\u2019re getting an amazing value. Please note that the Credits system will be implemented as development continues, so it is currently not part of the app.\nSome of the hottest publishers working with us have produced unique promo items for a variety of games. If you back at the Champion Pledge Level, you'll receive:\n We've got some great stretch goals lined up for you, check them out!\n Check out what community members have been saying at different shows we've visited:\nWe've also heard from several industry members, including publishers, distributors and more:\nRead the full review here!\n                                Read the full review here!\n               Read the full review here!\nRead the full review here!\nBack to us for a moment. The Dized team is a passionate group of board gamers, developers, and artists. Based in Helsinki, Finland, but with team members all over the world, we've spent our careers working on several cool board games, tabletop RPGs, video games, and more.\n We also have an incredible group of shareholders. In fact, after our initial pitch a couple of years ago, industry veterans became immediately interested, including the amazing Eric Lang, who became one of our first investors.\nFor Our Previous Crowdfunding Supporters!\nIf you supported Dized during our Indiegogo, we salute you! Without you, Dized wouldn\u2019t be at this next great step in development. The Kickstarter does not impact the delivery of your digital and physical rewards, and no action is required by you. If you choose to support the Kickstarter, the new Reward Credits will stack with your previous ones. Whether you pledge to this Kickstarter or not, we appreciate the immense support you\u2019ve already shown. We'd also love (and be very grateful) for you to help us spread the word about Dized by sharing this campaign with anyone who missed out before. Let's welcome new fans to our amazing community!\nSo Why Kickstarter?\nWe decided to bring Dized to the Kickstarter community for a couple reasons:\nThe reach Kickstarter gives us as a startup company is invaluable. We have an amazing base of supporters already, but the larger the community the better. This includes our awesome Dized users along with publishers. The more people who know about and use Dized means more content!\nOur team is amazingly talented, but scaling up production and introducing features like the adaptive profiles takes time, money, and a larger team (Want to join? Check here!). Achieving a successful Kickstarter will ensure increased support after the campaign, including: New Dized Users; More Publishers; Government Funding; And Much More.\nWe'll be shipping all promo items from our hub in China. Shipping all over the world is $4. Additional shipping may applied through BackerKit if you add additional pledges when the project is funded.\nFor this campaign, we are using BackerKit, an amazing third-party service that assists in ensuring your rewards are well managed! You will confirm your shipping and email addresses are correct through their system to receive your physical and digital rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSoftware Development\n\nDeveloping software, especially something like Dized that has never been done before, is incredibly challenging. Timelines shift, staffing changes, and unexpected costs and delays arise. While we do our best to mitigate any of these issues, the unfortunate truth of developing software is that it is difficult to foresee every possible roadblock. We fully believe in our ability to deliver on this project, as is evident by our Early Access already being available, but timelines may shift despite our best efforts.\n\nPhysical Delivery of Promos\n\nWe're always in touch with the publishers that are working with us on the promos. While we're carefully planning production and delivery so that everything goes smoothly, something might be delayed by the factory or during transportation. Luckily, all of our partners have an excellent track record with logistics, so everything we can do to avoid issues is already being taken into account.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dized\n2 created \u00b7 36 backed\nDized is a platform for everything digital that improves your board game experiences: tutorials, up-to-date rules, exclusive content...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 4 or more", "title": "GUARDIAN", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCredit - Can be redeemed for a game pack or subscription month\nGuardian Badge - In-app profile badge showing your support!\nAll Non-Promo Stretch Goals Unlocked During The Campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["111 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "ADVENTURER", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n15\u00d7 Credits - Can be redeemed for game packs or subscription months\nAdventurer Badge - In-app profile badge showing your support!\nAll Non-Promo Stretch Goals Unlocked During The Campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["74 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "CHAMPION", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n30\u00d7 Credits - Can be redeemed for game packs or subscription months\nGame Promos\nChampion Badge - In-app profile badge showing your support!\nAll Stretch Goals Unlocked During The Campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["239 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Dized Kickstarter Relaunching Today!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Dized Kickstarter is relaunching!", "update_content": "We have plenty of big news since our last update!\nKickstarter Relaunch on Monday the 10th\nGoal #1: New Content Published Daily\nGoal #2: More Information\nGoal #3: Previous Campaign\u2019s physical rewards shipped\nLet\u2019s make this happen!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Dized and Crowdfunding blog post is up!", "update_content": "Hello Everyone,\nWe are back from the very successful Spiel 2018 expo held in Essen, Germany.

Over 8 rounds, each player will select actions to achieve their goals, carefully managing resources, engaging in epic battles with one another and the Ancients that lie in wait. Only one will guide the galaxy toward the second dawn.\nThis new edition features new components and thoughtfully revised content, incorporating material from former expansions to create the best possible updated version of the game.

Every backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping is very expensive and is a cost we all need to share. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a small discount on ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nThis campaign includes Customs-Friendly delivery to the US, Canada, the UK, and the EU. Customs-Friendly means, if you live in any of these regions and have any additional charges for receiving your package, simply email kickstarter@kolossalgames.com a copy of your customs receipt and we will reimburse you via PayPal. Note: If your country is not in one of the above-mentioned regions, we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. (For example, Norway & Switzerland are not in the European Union.)\nWe have adjusted rates for the following countries: Macao, Australia, China, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Norway, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Taiwan, Ukraine, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. If you live in one of these countries, please choose the desired pledge level with the title \"adjusted shipping\" included. \nPlease note: While the U.S. is customs-friendly, there is a small possibility that tariffs for the U.S. are something that could happen in the future.
