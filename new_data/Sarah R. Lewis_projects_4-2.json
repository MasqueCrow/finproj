Lewis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Pixels are the coolest dice you\u2019ve ever seen! Full of LEDs, smarts and no larger than regular dice, they can be customized to light up when and how you desire. Incredibly strong, smooth and sharp, they work for several hours at a time, after which you can simply recharge them with the accompanying case. Pixels know which way they roll and can communicate with your phone or tablet via Bluetooth. This means they will work with Roll20, Foundry or any one of your favorite online platforms.\nPLAY\n\nDepending on the design you select, the LED lights will either shine through the entire face (Midnight Galaxy and Aurora Sky) or only through the numbers (Onyx Black and Hematite Grey).\nPLAY\n\nBecause of all the electronics and the battery, Pixels tend to be slightly heavier than regular dice of the same size. As a result they feel really nice in your hands, sound like proper dice, without being nearly as heavy as metal dice.\nAurora Sky Pixel next to a few other types of dice\nWe\u2019ve put a lot of effort in Pixels to make sure they are just as easy and convenient to use as regular dice. We\u2019re really excited to have been able to fit all the electronics inside such small packages.\nOnyx Black Set next to other types of dice.\nPLAY\n\nDice are made to be rolled, tossed, thrown and dropped. Fortunately, Pixels are really strong and don\u2019t expect you to be careful handling them; all the electronics are encased in very tough resin. Your Pixels will last for many years!\nBecause Pixels are cast in resin, there are no screws, no flaps, no parting lines anywhere; the dice are perfectly smooth! Programming and recharging the dice are both taken care of wirelessly, a significant technical challenge in such a small form factor, but one that we strongly believe was worth it!\n In fact, Pixels are fully waterproof! :)\nPixels are, above all, great dice for your table games. This means that balance and fair rolls are just as important to us as all the fancy electronics inside. We have dedicated a lot of time, design and testing to make sure they are as fair as possible. With a combination of small counterweights and precise attention to the finish of our edges, we\u2019ve already made Pixels surprisingly well balanced. And of course we will continue to improve the balance before release.\nPLAY\n\nFairness comparison with well-known brands (Comparison Data Credit of Mark Fickett)\nPixels speak Bluetooth. This is how the companion app communicates with the dice to reprogram them. It is also how the dice communicate back with the app to report what you rolled. In this early version of the app, we use the functionality to have your phone play sound effects based on your rolls.\nPLAY\n\nHowever the Bluetooth protocol used by the dice isn\u2019t proprietary, and many other apps will be able to talk directly to the dice as well. We are already in talks with D&D Beyond, Roll20, Foundry, and a few others to integrate Pixels directly.\nPLAY\n\nAnd while the dice can connect to your phone or computer for extra fancy features, that is not at all a requirement. Once you\u2019ve customized your Pixels, you can put your phone away and just use them for as long as you want. Or until you get tired of the color scheme and decide to try something new ;)\n\nIt was very important to us that Pixels be \u2018dice\u2019 first and foremost, and that design philosophy extends to the software side of things as well. They are just as easy to use as any other dice. Just pick them up, roll them, and they\u2019ll light up! That\u2019s it.\nThe dice use a small rechargeable battery. The battery, while absolutely tiny compared to a typical cell phone, is large enough to power the dice for several hours. In fact, in our tests, we\u2019ve averaged 5 hours of use on a single charge. And if you only use Bluetooth but don't have the dice light up, then you can easily record more than 20,000 rolls on a single charge (Check out the video in the Balance section).\nPLAY\n\nOnce your session is over, Pixels will recharge conveniently in the accompanying case. Every single Pixel will come with its own charging case, and every set will come with a larger one.\nPlace the die in its case. Make sure the highest face is up (20 in the case of the D20) and it will recharge in an hour or so.\nThe lid of the case contains a small magnet that will prevent the dice from turning on and lighting up during transport. Don\u2019t get us wrong, glowing pockets are cool and all, but not being able to flex your flashy dice isn\u2019t; we wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\nBattery Voltage over ~1000 rolls.\nThe To-Go case next to the standard individual case.\nAny 7-dice set you get will come with a To-Go carrying case. This larger case has its own battery, and room for 8 dice. It will be able to recharge all your dice 2 or 3 times before needing to be recharged itself. Great for when you are not necessarily close to an outlet or if you just want to keep your dice topped-up while you play.\nPLAY\n\nThe case will let you carry any set of dice. Want a full set? No problem. Need to have 8D6 for some reason? You got it! The case and individual chargers both use the same insert system, so you can customize the dice layout as much as you want.\nPLAY\n\nPixels are completely customizable. Thanks to the accompanying app, you are in control of how the dice light up. Want to create a quick colored theme? No problem! Prefer a colorful set of patterns instead. Go right ahead! Using the accompanying app, you can control exactly how the dice light up and when.\nPLAY\n\nUsing a Condition -> Action system (similar to IFTTT) you can describe exactly under what condition you want the dice to light up or even your phone to play sounds (if connected).\nPLAY\n\nAt any time you can easily preview your creation directly on a die and make sure the result is exactly what you want.\nRoll20, Foundry and D&D Beyond are all working with us to ensure Pixels are supported on their platforms.\nWe are also discussing potential integration with Fantasy Grounds.\nIn addition to the planned Official Integrations, we are committed to keeping the Pixels' API completely Open Source and available on Github.\nAll of Pixels Software and Firmware code is available on GitHub.\nThis means that even if we are not supporting your favorite platform directly, you will be able to use 3rd party integrations, or even better, write your own.\n\nPixels will allow developers to write their own apps, and do that even for commercial purposes. If you are interested in writing games / apps / integrations that use Pixels, consider one of our limited Devkit D20 Addons.\nIf you are a developer, grab one of the D20 Devkit Addons and receive a sample shortly after the campaign ends.\nAlthough every Pixel can be used as a Dev Kit, if you grab one of those addons, you will receive an Early D20 so you can get a head start on development.\nPixels are not only Open Source, but also Open Hardware! Pixels wouldn\u2019t exist without the open-source and open-hardware communities, and so we think it the right thing to do to share our work as well.\nPixels Design Files are also Open Source\nMost of the design files are already available on Pixels Hackaday.io project page, along with multiple prior prototypes and documentation of our adventures getting to the final versions of the dice.\nThe \"core\" of a D20 Pixel\nIf you are interested in using Pixels, have a question or suggestion for future updates, or just want to show your support, stop by our Discord!\nThis is also the place were we tend to share the most up-to-date developments. \n\nPixels have also appeared in the following publications:\nPixels use RGB LEDs that are individually controlled to give you the most flexibility possible. Choose dice that will either glow entirely (brighter overall), or only through the numbers (more readable when lit) and let your creativity decide how they light up. \nClick on the image below to check out high-res pictures of all the available designs.\nHead over to the Pixels website to see High-Resolution pictures.\n\nCan't quite find the exact combination of dice you need? Add one or two more singles to your pledge. \n Eager to start integrating Pixels with your app? Grab one of the limited Early Devkits!\nAll the rewards consist of a combination of Single dice and 7-dice sets. For instance, if you pledge at the 1 Die level, you get 1 single die. If you pledge at the Set level, you get 1 set. If you go for a 2 Set + 2 Dice, you get 2 sets and 2 singles. What those singles and sets are is up to you! You get to pick the size and design of each.\nIf you are not able to get exactly the combination you want from the rewards, we will also offer Addons. Want a Standard Set with 2 extra dice? No problem: Back at the Byte level and tack on an extra Single die! All Addons will ship at the same time as your rewards.\n\nNot sure which level to back at? Here are some suggestions:\nPlease note that the rates below are estimates, exact shipping costs will depend on your country and shipping speed. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first physical product that we will be bringing to market, so there is no question that many challenges are still ahead of us. This is why we have been working with a manufacturing partner to help us through the process and pair us with reputable and reliable manufacturers. At this point, we have two manufacturers lined up and able to begin production.\n\nBased on the feedback we got from factories, we expect to ship rewards in 12 months. However, please understand that this is an estimate. While we hope start delivering rewards sooner, we fully expect to have many issues along the way, no matter how hard we try to avoid them, and so it possible that it will take us longer to finish production. After all, getting this far was anything but easy and there is no reason to think that things should change during production! :)\n\nWe are, however, committed to making Pixels a reality and to keep the entire process transparent. This was a passion project before it was a product, and seeing the excitement spread throughout the community has almost given us a sense of duty to making flashy-connected-dice happen in the open.

In the few days since our Kickstarter campaign launched we've had potential investors come forward to fund the series.  Everyone is committed to Mike Nawrocki\u2019s vision and agrees he should retain creative control over the series\u2019 content \u2014 which was our main reason for choosing Kickstarter vs. traditional investor funding.  As a result, we are suspending this Kickstarter campaign and hope to have more great news to share with you soon.\nFor all the latest updates and exclusive clips, please join our mailing list at www.deadseasquirrels.com.  And for more information on potential investment opportunities and/or for general questions, please email us at info@deadseasquirrels.com.\n\nTHE STORY:\nIt's a squirrelly age we're living in... and we need new heroes. THE DEAD SEA SQUIRRELS tells the story of Merle and Pearl, two 1st century squirrels from Israel who\u2019ve been preserved in sea salt in a cave alongside the Dead Sea. When 10-year-old Michael discovers them 2000 years later and sneaks them home in his backpack, hijinks ensue after this salty couple reanimate and take their new friend on adventures full of action, humor, music, and character-building lessons. \n I'm Steve Taylor, and as producer of The Dead Sea Squirrels I've convinced my longtime friend Mike Nawrocki that Kickstarter is the best way to fund it. Why? Because it's way more fun building a community on Kickstarter than pitching the concept to soulless entertainment conglomerates who would then become Mike's boss. And besides boatloads of money, what have they got that we don't? So put your paws together and let's bring The Dead to life!\nHere's Mike to tell us more... \nWhen I co-created VeggieTales with Phil Vischer in 1993, I never imagined the impact our stories and characters would still be having three decades later. From Silly Songs with Larry and 3-2-1 Penguins! to our theatrical movies Jonah and The Pirates Who Don\u2019t Do Anything, it\u2019s been quite a ride. But I\u2019ve always dreamed of launching another series that taught biblical values in an entertaining way\u2026 and maybe this time featuring characters with actual arms and legs and\u2026 paws?\nEnter The Dead Sea Squirrels, my new book series that launched in 2019. The response has been incredible, with Book One now in its third printing. I knew all along I wanted the stories in these books to come alive through animation, and to create another resource for parents to get their kids excited about the Bible.\n But animation is expensive, and (despite what the internet says about my very inflated net worth) I don\u2019t have anywhere near the financial resources to fund a new series myself. In fact, I\u2019m currently making a living as a professor at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee \u2014 where I teach film and animation in our excellent School of Theatre and Cinematic Arts. What to do?\nMy colleague Steve Taylor \u2014 who continues to make music and films while overseeing our school \u2014 had an idea. What if our animation program, founded by renowned Disney animator Tom Bancroft, created the series with us? Tom and his faculty of professional animators could work alongside our top students (who we would pay to work while they're still in school), and the combination would create world-class animation.\nTom Bancroft with students in Lipscomb's Animation lab\nLipscomb Animation major Zoe Fitzhugh on the job.\n Then we could partner with our friends at Mukpuddy Studios in New Zealand to beautifully craft much of the final animation. \nAnd as a bonus, each episode would feature an original song \u2014 assuming you like all those Silly Songs I\u2019ve written through the years \u2014 like this one I wrote with Steve... \nPLAY\n\nHow do we know this will work? Because we\u2019re weeks away from finishing the pilot episode. It was funded by some generous donors who asked, \u201cCan you pull this off?\u201d\nYes we can.\nWanna make history as a Founding Backer who brought The Dead Sea Squirrels to life?\nEven better, wanna see what it\u2019s gonna look like? \nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nBut wait! There's more! While the majority of your donation goes to producing the series, we've lovingly crafted these soon-to-be-priceless collectibles as a thank you for your generosity, including...\nTo commemorate your role in bringing \"The Dead\" to life, we'll personalize this official certificate with your name or the name of a loved one and email it to you as a .pdf file. And unlike a college diploma, this one comes with minimal debt.\nBecause stickers go with everything: laptops, mirrors, sleeping foreheads..\n\n When worn in public, this functions as: 1) a secret handshake between backers (without the need for a post-shake hand sanitizer); or 2) a conversation starter that typically begins with, \"Why is there a dead squirrel on your lapel?\"\nThe traditional \"Dead Sea Squirrels\" design features our ready-for-adventure cast of characters posed deep inside a mysterious cave. \nThe less traditional \"We're Not Dead Yet!\" design \u2014 available in black and pink \u2014 is sure to turn heads and prompt questions like, \"Are those squirrel skeletons on your shirt?\" and \"Why are there squirrel skeletons on your shirt?\"\nAll shirts available in Youth sizes XS, S, M  & L and Adult sizes S, M, L, XL & 2XL\n We've assembled the first six books of the series into a boxed set that is being offered exclusively to our backers and will be lovingly signed by author Mike Nawrocki. And as a special bonus, we're including the time to read them.\nWe've hired Master Plush-maker Gregory Autore to design life-sized (10\") Merle and Pearl plushies so adorable that you may want to get them insured. (Merle shown above. Pearl is still being lovingly crafted.)\n\n Because if you pledge for the Complete Squirrel Works package, wouldn't you feel cheated if it didn't arrive in its own nut case?\n\n Are these premium perks more expensive? They sure are! But if you've squirrelled away a few extra (metaphorical) nuts this season, you could do worse than use them to teach and delight children.\nHigh quality animation is expensive, and depending on the studio and the content it can cost from $10,000/minute to over $1mil/minute. With the help of our faculty, students, and our partners at Mukpuddy Animation Studio, we've reduced those costs to make our series more affordable. But we need your help to make it happen!\nOur goal for the first 6 episodes (approx. 22 minutes each) is $1.2 million. \nPLAY\n\nAnd what if we exceed our goal? Do we dare dream even bigger?  Of course we do! We\u2019ve got a total of thirteen episodes planned (Mike is currently writing Book #10), so if we hit the \"stretch goal\" of $2.88mil, we can fund an entire thirteen episode series!\n And here\u2019s a sneak peak at the stories for the first six episodes: \n And now for your Soon To Be Frequently Asked Questions:\n What if you exceed your goal? We make more episodes! We\u2019ve got a total of thirteen episodes planned (I\u2019m currently writing Book #10). If we hit the goal of $2.88mil, we could fund an entire thirteen episode series!\n Let\u2019s get crazy and think even bigger: what if this campaign succeeds beyond your wildest dreams? We like the way you\u2019re thinking! More money allows us to up the quality even further on each episode, and adding to the workforce allows us to speed up our timeline.\n Speaking of timeline\u2026 what\u2019s the timeline? Once we reach our goal we\u2019ll immediately begin work on Episode Two. The plan is to produce a new episode every sixteen weeks, with the first six episode series ready to launch in Fall 2022. But if our campaign blows up and we\u2019re able to fund the entire thirteen episode series and beyond, we can use the additional funds to expand our team and speed up the timeline.\n Don\u2019t you want the series to be seen by as many people as possible? Yes we do, which is why we hope to land The Dead Sea Squirrels on a streaming platform or network to introduce it to the widest possible audience. But as beloved backers who are \u201cbringing The Dead to life,\u201d you\u2019ll be the first to see the pilot episode, along with other sneak peeks and exclusive content for our backers. \n Isn't it true that most networks and streaming platforms want to own what they present? Yes it is, and when a network puts up the money to have a series made, they ultimately have control over its content and messages. We\u2019re hoping to negotiate licenses to other broadcast and streaming platforms, but the main reason for funding the series through Kickstarter is that it will allow us creative control over these stories so we don\u2019t compromise on quality or biblical content.\n As a backer, when will I get to see the episodes? We\u2019ll send you a secret link to the pilot episode as soon as it\u2019s finished in April of this year. But we don\u2019t want to release individual episodes until the series is finished and ready to premier on a streaming platform (i.e. Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, etc.).\n What if I don't have access to that particular streaming platform? Great question... and we don't know the answer. For those who can't access the series, we'll do our best to negotiate with our distribution partner for some sort of \"backers only\" access portal (for the $25 and up level). Or maybe there's a DVD release in our future (since evidently that's still a thing). But since we don't know who our distribution partner will be at this point, we can only guarantee that you'll have access to the pilot.\n Tell me more about your partners. What is Lipscomb University? We\u2019re a Christian university here in Nashville, Tennessee, and our College of Entertainment and the Arts is rare within Christian higher education as it is situated in the heart of one of the top creative capitals in America, with access to some of the best entertainment industry veterans. Let us name-drop a little: our School of Music is directed by Grammy Award-winning producer Brown Bannister, our Animation program's founder is Disney animator Tom Bancroft, Steve Taylor leads our School of Theatre and Cinematic Arts, and our faculty is full of top practitioners in their field. (We\u2019re so connected that Steve Martin even gave our theatrical performance of his musical Bright Star a shout-out.) Here's a testimonial from storyboard artist Naomi Bethel, who was one of the first to graduate from our Animation program...\n\u201cI had a blast working on the storyboarding team. As a Lipscomb Animation grad, collaborating with my professors and former classmates was really special.\u201d\n                                                                                                         \u2014 Naomi Bethel", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause we're weeks away from finishing the pilot episode, we feel reasonably confident in both our process, our projected budget, and our timeline.

It is a world of magic and mystery, of dragons and sea serpents, a world where the Sky Lords - the Constellations - can take physical form and walk the land. It is a world in which an ancient evil, long imprisoned, threatens to break free.\nThe central characters in these stories are children and young adults who grapple with fear and sorrow, loss and longing, and who are given the opportunity to choose courage and hope. Their individual stories weave together to begin to tell a larger narrative. \nThis full-color volume is as much a book of stories as it is an art book: it is brimming with richly painted illustrations, numerous supplemental sketches, and finely detailed maps. Here is a sampling of page spreads and images included in the book:\nWant to hear a sample of one of the stories? Click below to play an excerpt from The Snow Beast.\nThis project has consumed my life for the better part of a year. As the world of Hibaria has developed in my mind and come more into focus, I've grown more excited by what I see, which has increased my enthusiasm and spurred this project forward. I have been driven by the desire to create a book that will further make sense of and bring life to this tangle of ideas that have, until now, only existed as painted images.\nAnd so I have spent countless hours writing and re-writing, fine-tuning histories and maps, and making sketches. When not working on it, I have thought about it - how to make it better.\nI'm proud of the fruit of these labors and am so excited to share it with you. With your help, we can bring this project to life. \nThis will be a hardcover, 8.5\"x11\" book. The stories and appendices together total over 120 pages. The audience is 12 years and up. \nI live in Wichita, Kansas with my wife and three children. I do creative work for a living. I primarily paint narrative images infused with fantastical elements, and write stories to go along with my paintings. I sell my work online, in galleries, and at art festivals and fairs throughout the Midwest.\nI am the author and illustrator of Ellen and the Winter Wolves. I also illustrated The Wishes of the Fish King by Douglas Kaine McKelvey and helped McKelvey create Stories We Shared: A Family Book Journal. All these projects were funded through Kickstarter campaigns.\nHere are the different reward descriptions. And if you don't see a print you were hoping to see, never fear! Keep on scrolling till you see the Additional Items Through the Add-on Store section. After the campaign, you'll be able to get any combination of the prints, maps, and books there!\nStar Chart, Map, and Reproduction\nOriginal Paintings\n\nThere are pledges that include a reproduction, the map, and the star chart, but I understand that many of you will want more choices. For this reason, after the campaign is complete I will collect your shipping information through a Backerkit survey. Here you'll have the opportunity to add any number of the following items to your pledge: \nYou are welcome to add any additional funds to your Kickstarter pledge to account for add-on items, but you will have the opportunity to checkout again at the end of your survey, in the event that you purchase additional items and have a remaining balance.\nThere might need to be slight adjustments along the way, but delivery by Christmas is my goal!\nJust a note: Tariffs on this book look to be high. Instead of covering it by raising the pledge levels by $5 per book, I've decided to absorb this cost myself. I love this project and want it in the world and don't want to make it cost prohibitive for you, even if it means I don't make much on it. I mean that. However, if you'd like to contribute toward the tariff, you'll have an opportunity to do so at the end of the campaign. Any amount would be greatly appreciated!\nThis campaign would not be possible without the support of friends and family. Paul and Kyra Hinton have generously given me so much help thinking through and setting up this Kickstarter. The add-on store? Paul's idea. Pretty much everything behind the scenes? Paul's involved. The cool book mock-up? Kyra did it. The images of the maps and paintings hanging on the wall that allow you to envision my art in your home? Once again, Kyra. Kyra also agreed to put my video together for me (because I was overwhelmed with life) WHILE SHE WAS LAUNCHING A SALE OF HER OWN. Paul and Kyra, you guys are gold.\nLisa, thanks for giving me extra time to work on this. You've seen my stress and worry and freak outs and instead of getting annoyed you've consistently asked, \"How can I help? Do you need to work late? Do you need to work this weekend?\" You've kept the children out of my studio (which is no easy task) and given me everything I need to get this Kickstarter ready for launch.

Having only sporadically attended church growing up, my familiarity with hymnody is admittedly shallow, but as an artist-songwriter drawn to honest, rich, genuine lyrics, it is not terribly difficult to see just how extraordinary and profound are so many of these songs. Like psalms, hymns speak for and to us, especially when our own energy, heart, mind, or words are sapped or even empty. Their gift to us is to remind and to advocate. Though this collection of songs is not my typical offering, I do hope they will reveal some part of me, and in the process be something pleasant, a balm.\nUPDATE: In the tornado that ripped through East Nashville on March 3rd, Eric lost his home and studio. Thankfully, the songs for this project were near completion, and though the release may be delayed slightly, all rewards will still be delivered.

Music that helps to prepare my heart for worship. If you ever want to hear me try to do Dylan or Springsteen justice, this is your chance!\nI\u2019ll get right to it. My objective at this point in my career is simple: I want to create resources that serve the Church, the capital-C Church. As a worship leader in a local congregation and as a contributor and curator of content for Worship Leader Magazine, I recognize the importance of amplifying the voices of particular communities; and am committed to listening and responding. This record is a love letter to the Church, reminiscing all of the good it has done for me, ways it has inspired me, taken care of me, given me a place to belong; while also looking forward to and setting the course for what lies ahead of us.\nAlbum Cover\nI\u2019ll Wait For You, My Love is a full-length album of new, old songs. All of the lyrics were written over a hundred years ago which gives them lilt and charm even as they display weighty theological and doctrinal truth. The melodies are modern and winsome; written to be simple enough to pick up quickly and substantial enough to have staying power. \nThe ultimate vision is for the music to be used congregationally; offering words and melody to the prayers of the people. The songwriting, performances, and production all support that objective. \nAs in all of my previous work, I value emotional verity very highly; both in the genesis  of the songs and in the performances (I believe God is honored by this, and desires to be worshipped in spirit and in truth.) I'll Wait For You, My Love is certainly not an exception. These songs give words and movement to my prayers. They offer inspiration, challenge, and consolation; and I want to share those gifts with you.\nSoftly And Tenderly...\nDuring the recording, I\u2019ve been joined by a bunch of generous and gifted artists as well as a dream band comprised of some of Nashville\u2019s most talented players.

With I'll Wait For You, My Love, I want to be able to spend resources (time, creative energy, finances) being bold and courageous about sharing the music that I have been so intentional and thoughtful in making (even if that is the most vulnerable part.)\nI\u2019ll Wait For You, My Love will be released on 04.03.20\nHere\u2019s a tentative release schedule:\nFirst Single  (Blessed Be The Name) - 01.24.20\nFirst Single Remix (Blessed Be The Name) - 02.07.20\nSecond Single (Doxology feat. Mission House) - 02.14.20\nSecond Single Remix (Doxology) - 02.21.20\nThird Single (TBD) - 03.06.20\nAlbum - 04.03.20\nThe full-length digital download will be exclusively available to Kickstarter backers on 03.20.20. \nHere\u2019s the deal: I\u2019m an independent artist, but I also produce music for a living. This means that I have already paid for a lot of the costs that most artists incur in making a record. Stuff like studio rental, engineering, production, mixing, and mastering are already \u201ccovered\u201d by me. That being said, there is still a substantial amount of money that goes out in the process. That money covers: \nCompensation for musicians/contributors\nRemixes\nAlbum art\nMaking physical product\nAdvertising/Promotion\nSo, what I\u2019m saying is, when you pay for these rewards, you're buying an album\u2013of course\u2013but you're also making albums like this possible. I genuinely need your help to make this happen.\nBIO\nGreg LaFollette has been involved in more than one hundred records in his career. He has worked with Andrew Peterson, Audrey Assad, Sara Groves, Leslie Jordan of All Sons and Daughters, Robbie Seay Band and many others. He has been featured in multiple prominent podcasts and published in CCM Magazine, The Rabbit Room, Relevant Magazine, and The Gospel Coalition. His record, Songs of Common Prayer, an album of congregational worship songs centered around prayers found in the Book of Common Prayer, garnered much attention and was supported by church partnerships across the US. LaFollette has had multiple placements in international advertising campaigns with his band Trouvere, and has contributed many songs to others\u2019 records. His passion to equip the Church is palpable: \u201cI\u2019m always grateful when I hear that a song I have written for myself or my people is useful for someone else. Whether it is sung by a congregation in a church service or given as a gift to a grieving friend, I hope my music feels trustworthy while still telling the truth.\u201d Known for his vulnerable and veracious vocal approach, simple and effective production, and beautiful melodic sense; LaFollette wants his music to be a reminder to the Church that what unites it is greater than what divides it. \u201cMay my music be an open door, assuring people that they are wanted and welcome; that there is a place for them.\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI don't anticipate any substantial risks.

Lewis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "  Check out Update #10 for more details...\n  Do you love pie?\nDo you barely know how to turn your oven on let alone bake a pie?\nDo you have a plethora of geeky friends you'd like to completely blow away at your next game night, movie marathon, or other special occasion?\nGood! Because I'm here to show you how your first pie, can be the most epic pie your friends have ever seen... with Pie Guides!\n                        My name is Jessica (aka @ThePieous) and I think Pies are Awesome.\nIn my non-pie life I'm a filmmaker, designer and a big geek who loves to learn new things. Last year when I decided to finally learn how my oven works and bake my very first pie, I turned to the web for inspiration. I found thousands of gloriously geeky cakes, waffles, cookies, cupcakes, breads, muffins, rice crispy treats, pancakes... but almost no geeky pies. Seriously! I mean, geeks like pies, right? So what gives?\nWell, I did a bit of digging and it turns out, people think making pies is hard. I was told by veteran baker friends that even working with pre-fab rollout crusts is too much of a challenge to \"fancy up\" because of the speed with which you have to work before the dough starts to dry out and crack.\nBUT! If I could think of a way to speed up the process of creating awesome designs in pie dough, suddenly there would be nothing standing in the way of an army of geeky Pie-oneers filling the web with weird and wonderful pie-y goodness...\nEnter my \"Pie Guides\u201d!\nTo correct the horrible imbalance of \"regular\" vs. \"geeky\" pies out there in the universe, I invented a simple modular system of Pie Guides that allow anyone - from baking novice to pie god - to create sophisticated and fun pie crust designs in under 10 minutes (because really, why should cakes have all the fun?) \nNow I need your help to raise $2000 to place a minimum first order based on my prototypes.\nIf you, like me, believe it is time for pies to take their rightful place as the kings and queens of geeky desserts we all know they can be, click on that big 'ol green \"Back This Project\" button and \u2018dough your part\u2019 in becoming a true Pie-oneer!\n    Sections in the project page:\nHow to Use Pie Guides\nPowder Guide Kits\nThe Ultimate Pie Guide\nResearch & Development\nBacker Rewards\nStretch Goals\nPies Are Awesome in the Media\nThank you!\nWith just a $10 (Canadian!) pledge, you can get your oven mitts on one of these bad boys... \nEach individual Pie Guide can create many unique pie designs quickly and easily. It was a tough process to decide which designs would make the cut for the first batch of Pie Guide prototypes, but after a few months of consultation with expert geek focus groups, I narrowed it down to these six and I hope you dig them! \nPie Guide 1: Rampant Unicorn \nYou can't spell \"geek\" without \"unicorn\", right? With modular legs and hair, the Rampant Unicorn Pie Guide gives you the freedom to control your level of pie epicness. Plus you can add a bit of food colouring and sprinkles to your dough to really kick things up a notch with some full-on rainbow unicorn pie power! \nPie Guide 2: Graphic C'thulhu \nWhat is it about C'thulhu and pies that go so well together? The Graphic C'thulhu Pie Guide offers my own Celtic Knot-esque twist on the Lovecraftian creature of legend, complete with Elder God symbol. Give your Necronomicon book club something to consume while you wait for the denizens of R'yleh to consume you! \nPie Guide 3: The Murder Kitties \nYin and Yang, Love and Hate, warm fuzzy hearts and cold steel glocks... The Murder Kitties Pie Guide has it all! You can produce positive or negative designs on one pre-fab pie crust as the guide cutouts are designed to fit within one another to maximize your design options. \nPie Guide 4: Fire Breathing Dragon \nA classic geeky offering - the Fire Breathing Dragon Pie Guide is perfect for those marathon viewing parties. Game of Thrones night? Hobbit-a-thon? Kicking it old school with a little Dragon Slayer? (I love that movie) Whatever your friends are into, you'll be the hero of the evening when you throw down this fiery offering.   \nPie Guide 5: Moustache Man \nWould you like a little weird with your wonderful? The Moustache Man Pie Guide has got you covered. Emulate your mustachioed friend for his birthday, give a handlebar 'stach a ride on a regular ol' cherry pie, or create an epic abstract masterpiece out of dozen of different lip warmers. The pie-sibilities are endless! \nPie Guide 6:  Pi Mandala \nOne of the most versatile of the bunch, the Pi Mandala Pie Guide allows you to create gorgeously geeky works of art with hundreds of different possible combinations. You can combine these shapes with your own cookie cutters at home for even more options, or keep things classic with a simple Pi symbol cutout to celebrate next Pi Day on March 14th.  \nA $10 pledge gets you the Pie Guide of your choice from the six options above. While each of these first six Pie Guides can create multiple compositions on their own, when you combine them together you can really unleash your inner geek with dragon-winged kitties, heavily armed unicorns, and moustache mandalas. So have a look at the higher pledge levels that allow you to get all six at a discount!  \nTo use any of these Pie Guides - alone or together - simply place the Guides on your chilled dough, use a sharp knife to trace the outlines, and then lift the cutouts with your knife and place as desired.  \nEasy peasy!  \nI have over a hundred 8\" diameter Pie Guides designed on paper already - everything from sea monsters and submarines to rockets and robots to pandas and poodles - and my hope is to be able to continue to offer nifty new designs to the pie-loving public. But first we have to make this campaign a success! \n  If you are ready to help me bring my Pie Guides to the world, please click on the green \"Back This Project\" button and select a reward level. If you'd like to see some more of Pie Guides in action, read on... \nGeeky Upgrade! Add incredible effects and detail with the \u201cPowder Guide\u201d Kits. \nThe basic Pie Guides outlined above are the just the first batch of what will (hopefully!) be many more designs to come... But I wanted to also offer a unique incentive for backers who select the option of purchasing multiple sets of Pie Guides. The following \"Powder Guide Kits\" are special Guides that incorporate both a traditional Pie Guide for cutting out dough, and a \"Powder Guide\" - made of a thinner flexible clear foodsafe material - for adding additional, finer detail in your favourite powder such as cinnamon or cocoa. \nThese kits allow for more sophisticated compositions without adding any additional complexity to the creation process. If you can sprinkle spices from a jar, you can pull these off! \nTo use the Powder Guides in the kits, simply:\ncreate your basic shapes with the regular Pie Guide in the kit\nplace your Powder Guide on top and give it a quick egg white wash\nsprinkle your cinnamon (or powder of your choice) and blow off the excess\nlift off the Powder Guide to reveal a unique and beautiful pie design!\nTo date, I have created and tested prototypes for two different Powder Guide Kits... \nPowder Guide Kit 1: Math Butterflies \nThe Math Butterflies Powder Guide Kit consists of four beautiful sets of wings covered in some of my favourite mathematical symbols. At first glance your guests will be greeted with a lovely array of textured butterflies in flight, but on closer inspection the true nerdy nature of this pie will be revealed...  \nPowder Guide Kit 2: Steampunk Caravan \n\"Carry me caravan, take me away...\"  The whimsical Steampunk Caravan Powder Guide Kit just begs to be tricked out with your own special touches... particularly with details from the other Pie Guides (I'm picturing a C'thulhu attack erupting around the wagon from a steaming cherry pie sea. Anyone else picturing that? No, just me?) \nUPDATE Three new Powder Guides just announced: Mr Puggy Face, Eye Brain Eater, and Retro Rockets! You wanted cute, you wanted gross, you wanted Retro... you got it. Choose from any of these, or the two above.\n  My final offering in the initial volley of Pie Guides is something I'll wager no one in your circle has ever seen: \"The Ultimate Custom Pie Guide\" - aka. your face on a pie.  \nPicture this:  \npresenting your pie-loving brother with his favourite pie, adorned with his smiling face, for a graduation present \npreparing a buffet table filled with dozen of different flavours of wedding pie, each featuring the likeness of the happy couple \nsurprising your impossible-to-buy-for spouse with their mug on a pie for their birthday \nproposing to your fiance, in pie form, with a special message and image served as the final course of a home cooked meal \nfreaking out your D+D group by constantly bringing a pie with your face on it to every game night and shouting \"eat me!\" as you deposit your creepy edible centrepiece in the middle of the table \nOkay, maybe I'm the only one who thinks that last one is cool... But whatever you use your \"Ultimate Custom Pie Guide\" kit for, I guarantee the recipients will never forget it!  \nI make each custom kit myself using high contrast, high resolution images which you provide, and creating two illustration components:  \n1) A basic Pie Guide, which forms the head outline in pie dough, plus a simple decorative shape if desired \n2) A Powder Guide, which creates all of the fine detail in contrasting powder, and may also include a short line of text \nTogether, these custom Pie Guides and Powder Guides combine to create one-of-a-kind images of your friends and loved ones (or any other image you own the rights to) in the immortal medium of pie.  \nOkay, its not really very immortal. But it is darn cool. \n  This reward level is limited though, so act fast if you want one!   \nThe making of each Pie Guide and Powder Guide involves a process of: \nBrainstorm sketching \nSketch refinement and focus group testing \nDigital mock up in Illustrator \nFile refinement for manufacturing \nMaterial selection and negotiations/QC with manufacturer  \nPrototype stress testing \nPrototype pie testing with third parties \nDesign refinement as needed (when angles too sharp or detail too fine) \nFinal documentation and design lock \nI have gone through this process with all of the designs featured in the above sections, but I need your help to complete the next step! In order to make my Pie Guides available to the world at a reasonable price, I need to place a minimum-sized bulk order with my manufacturer. Which is why I am looking to raise $2000 (Canadian!) from you, the good people of Kickstarter.  \nBut I don't expect anyone to help me out of the goodness of their hearts... gosh no! So, what's in it for you if you back this project? Read on... \nWhether you're a master baker (tee hee), just a little pie curious, or simply a fan of the whole \"pie\" thing, there's a reward level for you!  \nAnd if you are looking to order a Pie Guide as a gift for a baker friend this Christmas/Chanukah/Festivus/etc. I've got you covered... Every backer at the $10 and higher level will receive a link to download a special \"You're getting a Pie Guide!\" Gift Announcement card which showcases the Pie Guides in action, and has a place for a personal holiday message from you. The cards will be available to download the second the project ends on November 30th so you don't have to worry about missing your holiday deadlines - you can wrap up the card in a pie pan and your friends and loved ones will know exactly what they've got coming to them!  \nShow your support for team pie AND your mad colouring skills on a neato downloadable Art Nouveau-inspired pie poster. Plus you'll get a special thanks on www.piesareawesome.com as one of the very first supporters of the geeky Pie-oneering movement. \nGet the thing! For $10 Canadian plus shipping you can choose from any of the first six Pie Guide prototypes. And of course you'll have instant access to the downloadable gift card for your holiday gift-ees. \nKick the epic up a notch with one of the Powder Guide Kits. Choose from either the Math Butterflies or the Steampunk Caravan.\nWhy choose? Get both Powder Guide Kits at a savings of $6!\nGet all six Pie Guides at the $50 level for a savings of $10, then mix and match to unleash maximum weirdness - er - creativity! \nSave $21 when you order all six Pie Guides and both Powder Guide Kits!\nGo in with a buddy, or buy an extra set for your bestest baker friend... and save $52!\nWith the Ultimate Custom Pie Guide you can propose to your fianc\u00e9, wish a delicious retirement (re-pie-r-ment?) to your folks, or a Hap-pie Birthday to your boss in a way they'll never forget... with their face on their favourite pie! Plus you get one of each Pie Guide and Powder Guide Kit too.\nSince I hand make each Guide file, this tier is limited to 10 backers so act fast...   \n    While I only need $2000 to get the pie party started, I would love to be able to expand my offering and spread the good pie word even further... With this in mind I've prepared a few stretch goals to gun for: \nIf we hit the $5000 mark, I will produce a series of How To videos, showcasing all the weird and wonderful things you can do with Pie Guides. Backers will get a preview link before they go live online.  \nIf you are a member of the Pie-oneers Club, you know that you get a new pie colouring sheet every quarter with my newsletter already. But I would love to be able to produce a full 24-page downloadable book of Art Nouveau inspired pie posters for people to colour! If we hit the $7500 mark on this campaign, I will do just that. Backers will get 4 new pages free as a downloadable pdf before the book is released. \nIf we're fortunate enough to hit $10,000 in pledges, I will kick things up a serious notch by producing a full-length cookbook showcasing all of my pie secrets - codified by technique, and chock full of new delicious geeky pie examples and tutorials. Everything from simple \"pie modding\" (that's fancying up store bought pies) to from-scratch epic masterpiece construction. Backers will get a free preview chapter as a downloadable pdf before anyone else. \nBrand-spankin'-new stretch goal! We held a poll on my Twitter account so you could vote for the next Pie Guide I would offer, and the Ninja Bunnies won in a landslide! So if we can reach $31,415.92 before November 30th, everyone at the $50 pledge level and higher will get a new Ninja Bunnies Pie Guide FREE! \nOn my blog, Pies Are Awesome, I teach people how to make a new epic pie masterpiece each week.

Lewis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Introducing the DotsPlus \"Super Grid\" Notebook\nHello Kickstarters. I\u2019m excited to introduce you to my new notebook design\u2014DotsPlus.\nDotsPlus was inspired by my own dissatisfaction with conventional dot grid notebooks. I like the grid concept, but dots alone make me cross eyed. So, instead of dots, I created a 1/4-inch grid of crosshairs\u2014or plus signs. I found this pattern mush less visually obtrusive than traditional graph paper, while making it much easier for me to write in straight lines and freehand draw tables, charts and graphs.\nI then added back the dot grid, and offset the dots so they're positioned at the center of the squares defined by the crosshairs. This helps me center letters, numbers and symbols inside the squares, and makes it easy to add finer details on my tables, charts and graphs.\nThe 1/4-inch spacing is intentional\u2014it's the traditional \"narrow ruled\" format for lined paper here in the USA. For me, it economizes on space without being too tight for everyday note taking.\nI tried several different colors for the pattern\u2014including traditional \"graph paper\" blue and \"engineering grid\" green\u2014and concluded light gray is the most unobtrusive.\nThe resulting \"super grid\" of dots and crosshairs is easy on the eyes and remarkably useful for keeping my notes and charts neat and tidy. DotsPlus is great for writing, sketching, designing and doodling\u2014and I think you'll find it especially useful for bullet journaling and do-it-yourself planner layouts.\nJust like the PocketDoJo Checklist Notebook in my last campaign, each DotsPlus notebook starts with a Contents/Index page, and ends with an Endnotes page. All of the DotsPlus-imprinted pages in-between are sequentially numbered, with title and date blocks at the top of each page, and my special page navigation arrows at the bottom of each page for tracking projects, lists, plots and thoughts that continue on multiple and non-sequential pages.\nI\u2019m offering DotsPlus in two formats\u2014a soft pocket notebook and a larger hardcover notebook (product details below). I'm also offering a free download so you can print a sample page and try before you buy (download link below).\nDotsPlus Pocket Notebook Specs\nDotsPlus is the latest addition to my Efficiency Supply Co. pocket notebook collection, which includes the PocketDoJo Checklist Notebook, plus new Blank and Lined companion notebooks.\nNotebook Size: 3.5\" by 5.5\"\u2014the most common size among popular pocket notebook brands.\nPage Style: DotsPlus pattern, crosshair grid with dot grid overlay, 1/4-inch grid spacing, light gray print on white paper.\nCover: 100# jet black cover stock.\nPaper: 60#, bright white, archival-quality, acid-free.\nPages: 52 pages total\u201450 sequentially numbered pages with DotsPlus pattern, plus Contents/Index first page and Endnotes last page.\nBinding: Two black staples.\nSticker Sheet: A special sticker sheet is included, with a title block sticker for the outside front cover, a nameplate sticker for the inside front cover to identify the book as yours in case you misplace it, plus color-coded stickers to differentiate multiple notebooks at a glance.\nOrigin: Made in USA.\nDotsPlus Hardcover Notebook Specs\nDotsPlus hardcover books are made in USA by the veteran-owned world-leading manufacturer of engineering, laboratory and field notebooks for Fortune 100 companies, research universities and government agencies. Our books are made to the same exacting standards required for evidence, data and intellectual property protection\u2014so you can be sure they're perfect for preserving your precious ideas, designs, artwork, plots and thoughts. \nNotebook Size: 5.25\" x 8.25\" x 0.67\"\u2014the same size as the popular Moleskine\u00ae hardcover notebook.\nPage Style: DotsPlus pattern, crosshair grid with dot grid overlay, 1/4-inch grid spacing, light gray print on white paper.\nCover: Black and completely blank\u2014front, back and spine\u2014because it's your book to decorate. PVC-free, water and stain-resistant, sticker and paint-pen friendly.\nPaper: 80#, bright white, archival-quality, acid-free.\nPage Layout: 168 pages total\u2014166 sequentially numbered pages with DotsPlus pattern, plus Contents/Index first page and Endnotes last page.\nPage Marker: One black ribbon.\nBinding: Smyth sewn, so the book lays flat when open.\nOrigin: Made in USA.\nTry Before You Buy\nFollow this link to download and print a sample page and try it yourself before you pledge. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.\nRewards\nI'm keeping the reward structure super simple, to minimize shipping costs and get your notebooks to you as quickly as possible.\nJust Pocket Notebooks: The pocket notebooks are packaged in 3-packs. You can pledge for 1, 2, 4 or 10 three-packs (3, 6, 12 or 30 individual notebooks), and take advantage of quantity discounts.\nJust Hardcover Notebooks: The hardcover notebooks are packaged individually. You can pledge for 1, 2, 4 or 10 individual notebooks, and take advantage of quantity discounts.\nNotebook Bundles: Double-down on DotsPlus with a combo pack of one 3-pack of pocket notebooks and one individual hardcover notebook. You can pledge for 1, 2, 4 or 10 combo packs, with the same quantity discounts as the other rewards.\nFree USA Shipping: All rewards include shipping within the USA.\nDelivery Goal\nMy goal is to ship all rewards by December 15, 2016 (not 2017\u2014that's a typo in the $42 and $78 reward descriptions) so they're in your hands before the New Year, so you can get a fresh start on your new notebook for 2017. Deliveries in the USA and Canada usually arrive within 5-10 days. International deliveries can take 2-4 weeks.\nThank you!\nSo, if you like dot grid notebooks, I think you\u2019ll LOVE DotsPlus.

Most of our shoelace pictures are up-close shots portraying a unique design with parallel lines. They actually look really cool and add some character. From eye level though, it's a different story. You would never spot them on someone passing by.\nMinimal by design. The Lace Anchors are manufactured from a fiber filled resin providing amazing strength and preventing any breakage or warping. The end clips, if used, have multiple rows of teeth that clinch the laces. This allows you to pull as hard as you would like without the end clips separating from the laces. We did, however, design the end clips to be adjustable, this means you can unlock them and re-lock them if you need to make shoelace length adjustments.\nIt's about combining style, comfort and convenience. Our Xpand shoe lacing system packs a powerful punch. We want to make sure that we have our bases covered when it comes to all aspects of wearing your shoes. First we offer you 24 colors. Then we offer you a fully adjustable fit providing comfort whether you're heading out for a night on the town or running a marathon. Last but not least, you will never have to tie your shoes again! We know it's not some crazy technology product promising to teleport you to the moon, but we can guarantee it will bring a smile to your face everyday you slip your feet in.  Sometimes it's about the simple things in life.\nZero interruptions, 100% focus. When using our lacing system, your shoes will never cause any distractions like untied laces or tension loss. You will be able to focus 100% on hitting that next mile marker and making it to the finish line. You get to decide how tight or loose your shoes will fit by adjusting pre-set tension when installing the Lace Anchors.  Whether it's in your cross-fit class or on a treadmill, we guarantee there will be zero shoelace malfunctions!\nLess bulk more comfort.  Not only does our system rid your shoes of the bulky mechanical objects other systems use, we believe our laces provide more comfort.  Round elastic laces can cause pressure along the top of your feet, whereas our flat laces provide a more even spread-out pressure.\n Kids love to be as creative as you will let them be.  Not only will you love the fact that your kids shoes are magically transformed into perfect fitting slip-ons, but you're giving them the opportunity to show off their creative side!  They can start in any eyelet and finish in any eyelet, creating awesome designs that they can actually wear!\n           Reflective laces unlocked!\nThese are great for any night time activities. They will send off a reflective glow from almost any light source. These will be offered in 5 - 10 of the most popular colors! These images were shot in normal light conditions WITHOUT the camera flash and then in dark conditions WITH the camera flash.\nGlow in the dark laces unlocked!\nThese are our glow in the dark laces. Kids will love these. They are charged by placing them under bright light for 30 seconds. The glow will last approximately 5 minutes.\nRainbow laces unlocked!\nOur rainbow laces have a really smooth color transition with a different pattern on each side. The colors included on each lace are as follows: Orange, red, blue, green, yellow, purple and pink.\n   We are ready to rock and roll!  Over the past 3 years we have been designing and developing all components of the Xpand lacing system. It started with our very first Kickstarter project, Lace Anchors, which rounded up 9,565 backers and $147,000.  We have successfully tested Lace Anchors with people all around the world.  All of the hard work is done.  The molds and tooling have just been completed and what you see in this campaign are actual production parts.  Our shoelace manufacturer has successfully run hundreds of production cycles with their equipment to ensure their ability to manufacture consistent quality laces for us.  We have turned to Kickstarter to launch Xpand into the world, hoping for thousands of backers so we can place a huge initial purchase order.  Below you will find information that merely skims the surface of our Journey thus far.     \n Seattles Pillar Product Design Team.  Without the Pillar team involved in this project, Xpand would not be what it is today.  They have the creative minds and dedication to make ideas reality.  They are behind some amazing innovative ideas.  It's always a pleasure working with them! \nThe \"end clips\" were designed to give a finished look for those using the Lace Anchors on the exterior of the shoes. Great for marathon runners.\nThe interior of the end clips are specifically designed for the Xpand shoelaces. The teeth are strategically placed pinching our laces with great tension.\nSince we had a solid functioning design from our existing Lace Anchors for standard shoelaces, the changes were minimal for our Xpand laces. \"Minimal\" is the key word in our designs!\nOnce the design was finalized for the end clips, 3D prints are sent to the tool makers to complete the production molds.\nSame goes for the Lace Anchors. Once the design was finalized, 3D prints were sent to the tooling company to prepare \"molds\".\nAfter several small adjustments to the teeth size and material used, we have a flawless product! These are pictures of actual samples from the mold!\nThis is a picture of the sample Lace Anchors run from our new production molds. These are extremely durable made from a special blend of fiber filled resin.\nI really didn't have to learn much about the shoelace manufacturing process. What I did have to do was test endless elasticity rates. We wanted to make sure our product had perfect tension without losing it's strength over time.\nWhen I say we tested, I mean we tested. With so many elasticity rates and materials, we had our hands full. This is a small portion of the test cycles run with our manufacturer!\n\"Modeling shot\" of our final samples with a few of our colors and our chosen elasticity rate. We couldn't be happier and all of our hard work is paying off!\nThis is our favorite choice when it comes to packaging. We love how it looks, however, it does come with challenges. keeping it nice during shipping is a major one. We may switch to something a little more durable.\nDisclaimer: There were no endorsements by any Brands for this project. All shoes used in the pictures and videos were paid for and are my personal property. Although our product is used in all of the shoes in these pictures and/or videos, the shoes work perfect in their natural state without Xpands Shoe Lacing System. Our product simply gives the user an optional way to keep their shoes secure.\nDisclaimer: Just like any other shoelaces, it is the responsibility of the end user to make sure your Xpand Lacing System is installed correctly.  It is also the end users responsibility to make sure the pre-set tension is set tight enough to secure your shoes and give proper support under normal and high stress levels or during vigorous activities.  Always test with light activity to ensure the Xpand Lacing System is performing properly and securely before using under vigorous circumstances.  \nDisclaimer:  We do not own the music in our video but we did obtain the rights to use. The music in the first portion of the video is \"Do What it Do\" by Dolce X Ozzie.  The music in the second portion of the video is called \"Power of Motivation\" and it's from Pond5.com\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nF.A.Q.\n1. Does the Xpand Lacing System work with \"All\" Shoes?\nThere are so many shoes it's impossible to test on all of them. If you have eyelets and shoelaces, odds are they will work great. They work excellent with high tops as well!\n2. Can I run with the Xpand Lacing System?\nAbsolutely.  This system is designed with runners in mind.  You can pre-set the tension as tight as you would like.  You will also be surprised how comfortable our flat style laces are in comparison to the round elastic laces other companies use.\n3. Are the laces adjustable after I trim them?\nAbsolutely, just make sure that you don't trim them too short initially.  We suggest test fitting prior to trimming the laces.  Always set the initial adjustment on the loose side, you can always tighten them up if needed.\n4. Do they work on kids shoes?\nThey work excellently with kids shoes!  My kids love not having to worry about tying their shoes.  They are constantly coming up with creative designs as well. \n5. Can you ship international?\nYes. We will ship ANYWHERE in the world!\n6. Can I pledge for multiple rewards?\nPlease send me a private message for details.\n7.  Can I become a distributor?  \nYes.  Please send us a private message and we will get back to you.  \n8.  Do you have a patent?\nYes we do have Patents Pending.   We will monitor domestic and international trade shows as well as multiple USA/International internet and brick-and-mortar retailers and resellers. We will protect our Patents / brands / images / retailers / resellers to the fullest extent of the law.\nFor those of you that made it all the way to this point, I want to say thank you!  I appreciate you taking the time to view my entire project and want to offer you a special gift.  If you pledge for the 6 pack or greater please enter the promo code \"Simple\" on the survey after the campaign ends.

We have helped over 50,000 people accomplish that mission. That is a lot of happy people!\nBeing fans of physical notebooks, we were searching for a simple, elegant daily planner to help us become more productive. We found nothing we liked until we stumbled upon this productivity legend...\nAround 100 years ago, PR consultant Ivy Lee shared with Charles Schwab, CEO of Bethlehem Steel, a time management technique that drastically increased his productivity. The method was quite simple. List out your three to five most important tasks for the day and tackle them in order of importance. This simple technique made Schwab millions and helped the unknown Bethlehem Steel Company become the biggest independent steel producer in the world.\nThis technique and story has been told by many, including Napoleon Hill and Dale Carnegie, and has influenced thousands of people and their businesses.\n  We tried Lee's prioritized to-do list for a while to help plan our days, but something was missing. We were still inefficient with our time as there was no rhyme or reason to the list. We could cherry-pick jobs such as \u201cedit blog\u201d or \u201cconnect with event manager.\u201d The tasks did not flow. There had to be a better way!\nWe combined Lee\u2019s method with the Pomodoro-style focused work sessions and a daily productivity score to learn about our work patterns and become more effective.

Check out the forum they created showcasing their EcoQubes here! \nWe wanted to make the EcoQube even more accessible and efficient, so we took all the feedback we got to further develop the product, which resulted in the EcoQube C!\n What is the EcoQube C?\nThe heart of the EcoQube C is the aquaponics filter, which we've integrated into the tank to create an all-in-one system that uses plants like Basil or Mint to keep your aquarium clean.\nPLAY\n\nHow does it work?\nPLAY\n\nSimply decorate your tank and fill it with water, plug it in and enjoy your very own sustainable ecosystem!\nWhy is it better?\nThe new beautifully integrated design is durable, portable, and compact. We've made it more affordable while maintaining the high quality product build. It's now even easier to maintain with less parts and automatic functionality, AND it's manufactured in the USA.\nNever change or replace filters again with the EcoQube! Everything Works. Together.\n Our Story\nPLAY\n\nOur names are Eric and Kevin. We're UC San Diego students and aquarium geeks who met in high school and share a passion for planted aquatic ecosystems. \nWe started out working at various aquarium shops in San Francisco, including Aquatic Central and Aqua Forest Aquarium. We eventually started our own online aquarium store called Aqua Design Innovations while selling shrimp out of a garage.\nAs we got older, we started to become more aware of the harsher realities of our world, realizing that there are many people globally who face food and water shortages every day but that for most of us, such issues are so foreign.\nWe couldn't ignore the facts, so we decided to use our knowledge of aquariums to find a feasible solution.\nWe believe aquaponics is a clear solution to many of the food and water shortages humanity faces today. While this food production method was used thousands of years ago in early Aztec and Chinese civilizations, it has since fallen into disuse and become largely forgotten.\nWe hope to educate as many people as possible about the practical solution and beauty of aquaponics and to ultimately help initiate the process of bringing aquaponics to the forefront of today's agriculture. \nWe were able to reach many with the first EcoQube, and now, we hope to reach even more with the EcoQube C! Please join our mission and share the EcoQube C with as many people you know!\nOriginal EcoQube (left) and EcoQube C (right)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've spent most of the last year working with our partners to mitigate as many risks as possible, yet we know there will still be hurdles along the way. We will always be transparent with our community about challenges, including these:\n\nThe biggest risk is having users eat the herbs they've grown in their EcoQube C. This is because professional aquaponics farms do not use regular aquarium chemicals for their water treatments. It is entirely unknown if chemicals from regular water treatments will find their way into the herbs. Also, aquariums with frogs, turtles, snails and other more disease-prone animals should not be eaten from. There are simply too many unknowns, and nobody wants a case of salmonella poisoning! It is not recommended to eat anything you produce through the EcoQube C.\n\nShip Date: We are confident we will ship by the projected dates, as we are manufacturing the EcoQube C in the US (100 yards away from our office!). While there is always a chance that things will take longer than planned, the proximity of our manufacturers will definitely speed up the process!\n\nProduct Changes: As we refine the EcoQube C based on additional community feedback and more product testing, slight changes may be made. We'll only make changes that enhance the product experience. \n\nSupplier Coordination: We work with a variety of suppliers to source the best materials and ensure that the product is developed correctly. Each supplier has its own challenges, which may affect its partners, including us.\n\nMaintenance: As hard as we've worked to make this AS LOW MAINTENANCE AS POSSIBLE, it is still a living ecosystem. As with all ecosystems, imbalances can be prompted if your kids throw in a bag of fish food thinking the fish will grow faster, or if the aquarium is placed in the sun even though it comes with a beautiful bright light. Imbalances will cause algae growth and will require a tiny bit of wiping.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nHerbs and micro-greens can be extremely great filters and will thrive with the EcoQube C, but for that same reason, it is EXTREMELY unsafe for food consumption. Chemicals used for aquariums are NOT safe for human consumption and the plants WILL soak these chemicals up.

Members of the cooperative weave natural cotton into traditional Mayan cloth with the backstrap loom.\n2. The cotton then goes to the city where community women sew the fabric into pillowpets.\n When you buy a pillowpet, you get a cute and cuddly creature with a connection to another culture. The Pacutama and Chuicutama Women's Cooperative receives direct income through your purchase.\nDue to the extreme remote location of the work and the intrinsic nature of backstrap loom weaving, it only makes sense for the cooperative to sell in \"bulk.\" By buying between 50 and 100 seahorses, we provide a meaningful income boost to the community without infusing a malignant quantity of cash into the village economy. A Kickstarter campaign is the most direct way to reach customers while ensuring that as much of the money as possible goes directly to the women creating the pillowpets.  \n$22 for a seahorse. \nBe one of the first 40 backers, and get yours right away. \nCheck out all the perks here.\n After agriculture, artisan goods are the second largest source of employment in the developing world. By backing this campaign, you are buying a one-of-a-kind pillowpet, empowering female breadwinners in an indigenous, Guatemalan community.\n  In a small village called Santa Catarina Ixhtahuacan in the mountains east of Quetzaltenango, 20 women whose village was resettled here after the devastation of Hurricane Stan in 2005, work together to weave traditional Mayan textiles using the backstrap loom (see below for more information on backstrap loom weaving).\nThe village was re-settled (see video footage above) in large part thanks to Yabal, an NGO brought into the region to help the indigenous K'iche' group cope with the dramatic environmental, economic and social changes that resulted from their evacuation. Yabal helped evacuate and resettle two coastal villages (Pacutama and Chuictama) into one mountain community called Santa Catarina Ixhtahuacan. The land was available here for a homesteaded resettlement because the surrounding environment (in terms of climate and accessibility) is quite remote and intemperate -- making it undesirable but vacant.\nTemperatures in Santa Catarina Ixhtahuacan can go from the high 20s to the high 90s Fahrenheit in a single 24-hour day. As a result, community members have had to adapt much of their lifestyle and agricultural economy to survive. Because the growing season is so short, and because the village is cut-off from traditional regional commerce, everyone has had to innovate.\nForming the Pacutama and Chuicutama Cooperative (named after their former villages) in the wake of post Hurricane Stan resettlement was a way for the female members of the new, hybrid community to once again take control of their own fate. To support the effort, Yabal formed a handicrafts support entity and laid the foundations for the cooperative\u2019s success with handicrafts and business trainings as part of a market readiness program. Soon, the women had the business and tangible skills to work together to create beautiful textiles just like their ancestors had done for centuries. Now the trick was in finding the market in which to sell.\nTo solve the sales problem, Yabal partnered the Pacutama and Chuicutama Cooperative with designers and a local seamstress named Sylvia Mazariegos. As a collaborative trifecta, the parties created the pillowpet design and setup a network of talented sewing women in Quetzaltenango (the nearest large city). As a result, the pillowpets project has been able to create valuable, fair wage yielding trades for both rural and urban women who each bring a sense of empowerment (along with the extra money) to their families in both the city and the mountains.\nPerhaps no cultural handicraft is as synonymous with the Central American region as backstrap loom weaving. The loom gets its name from the leather strap that weavers wear around their waists to keep tension in the threads and the cloth, and so the distinctive Mayan cloth is quite literally attached to its creator while it\u2019s being made. Check out the video above to see the backstrap loom in action.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many challenges that go along with sourcing handicrafts directly from artisans around the world. Aside from the obvious (language skills, cultural-savvy, affordable international payment methods and access to the internet), we\u2019ve dealt with our fair share of customs challenges, quality control issues and disparity of customer/artisan expectations. We\u2019ve been working on perfecting our model for the past 2.5 years. We started in Mexico, Russia and Kyrgyzstan where we began to introduce artisans to the somewhat foreign concept of online selling, and began actively making ecommerce sales and fulfilling the orders directly in cooperation with our partnering artisans. \n\nBy now, we\u2019ve ironed out the kinks in the \u201csupply chain.\u201d We have reliable partnering organizations and artisans such as Yabal Handicrafts and the women of Santa Catarina Ixhtahuacan village who buy into our mission and share our dream. Now it\u2019s time to move onto the next level, and setup a test crowdfunding sale, which is what you\u2019re looking at right here. \n\nWe chose pillowpets to be our first test sale because of their broad appeal, high quality, ethical backstory, light weight (for shipping) and general awesomeness (we just love them!). \n\nThe completed pillowpets will be sent fast via TNT bulk from Guatemala to our office in San Francisco, where we\u2019ll immediately parse-out the pet supply and send them on their way to you via the US mail. We have pre-ordered the first 40 seahorse pillowpets so the first 40 seahorse backers will be able to enjoy their pillowpet ASAP; the rest will have to wait for a second round of weaving, and will likely get theirs sometime in February. \n\nAfter over two years of first hand experience and work on this project (I\u2019ve personally lived and worked in Kyrgyzstan), I can honestly say we\u2019re ready for this next step: a crowd-funded artisan campaign.

Not noticing all the great things around you because you're too busy surviving to really live?\nThat's what \"Love Where You Live\" is setting out to change.  My dream is to use this video travelogue (aka \"travel blog\") to inspire you to love where you live, wherever that may be.  To stop, look around, and enjoy the place you call home.\nIt will start here in my home state of Idaho.  I LOVE it here.

The people, the history, the beauty, the heartache, and everything in-between.  Those unique things that make a place more than just a dot on a map, but a place people are proud to call home.\nWhat Will It Be Like?\nThis will be far more than a documentary.

There is also a developing relationship that would feature segments of the travelogue on local television.

Meaning that, included in the goal is funding not only to travel and film the first travelogue itself, but to purchase the needed gear and studio equipment to create professional, polished products, and ensure the ability to film and create future travelogues, reviews and more for years to come!\nThese items include:\nHD Video camera, lighting and related equipment\nMicrophones, recording equipment and related accessories\niMac computer for audio and video editing\nTravel and related expenses incurred during the recording of first travelogue.\nRelated production expenses.

What it lacks in ability to travel through time, it makes up for in saving time for you and your family. \n   CNET TOOK THE TIM3 MACHIN3 FOR A TEST DRIVE.  HOW'D IT DO? \nIt makes up to 20 cups of rice. It makes it faster. And it makes it better. \nAnd it also does much more. \nYogurt. Quinoa. Oatmeal. Slow Cooking. Steaming. \nWe\u2019re hoping you can help us make it a reality. \nHow does it work?  \nAny backer is eligible for the accessories pack. Just add on $15 to your pledge and we'll make sure to send you the accessory pack as soon as it is available. Please note that it will ship separately from your TIM3 MACHIN3 as the accessory pack will not be completed until MARCH 2015.\nWith your help, we hit our $100K stretch goal on the last day of our project! Thanks! We'll be commissioning a professional chef to write a digital recipe guide calibrated specifically to the TIM3 MACHIN3! Ships digitally to ALL reward levels in April 2015. If you have a personal relationship with someone you think would be a fit, please message us or email to support@get3squares.com.\nObviously a rice cooker should make rice. They all do. But there are some problems with the rice cookers that are out there (at least the ones that cost less than a car payment). \nRice takes too long to cook, especially brown rice. What\u2019s the point of automating the cooking if you've got to sit around and wait 2 hours for your rice to finish? We souped up the TIM3 MACHIN3 with 900 watts of power to help get rid of this problem. The result? Our white rice cooks up to 30% faster than competing rice cookers. And brown rice is up to a whopping 45% faster. \nCooking times in comparison to other 20-cup rice cookers tested.\nAnother problem: rice burns on the bottom. You cook a couple cups of rice, only to be dismayed by the fact that there's a yellowy-brown skin of rice lining the bottom of the pot when you stir it up to serve. Dry yellow chunks in your rice don\u2019t do anyone any good. So we configured our TIM3 MACHIN3 to solve this issue. With each batch of rice cooked in the TIM3 MACHIN3 you\u2019ll see the rice at the bottom is still nicely cooked, not scorched earth. \nQuinoa is, well, super. NASA has called it almost a perfect food thanks to the amount of protein and nutrition packed in it. Cooking it at home can often end in either a gloopy gruel or what tastes like a big bowl of sand. Since quinoa is a grain (well technically a seed, but it cooks a lot like a grain), a rice cooker should be a perfect way to cook it. But using the same methodology as rice just doesn't pan out. So after a ton of trials, we found that tweaking the cooking logic ever so slightly and including a \u201ctoasting\u201d stage prior to cooking really unlocks the flavor potential of this nutritional powerhouse. \nPLAY\n\nSure, there\u2019s are a ton of yogurt makers out there already. What they don't tell you is that before those yogurt makers do anything, you\u2019ve got to get milk in a double boiler, heat it, measure the temperature, hold it there, pull it off the burner, let it cool to just the right temperature, then finally add the starter and put it in the yogurt \u201cmaker.\u201d That\u2019s so much work it made a run-on sentence long enough to make any English teacher shake their head in disgust. \nThe TIM3 MACHIN3 makes yogurt making something that's actually easy to do at home. It uses its brain to do all this for you. It heats the milk. Then holds it at the right temperature. It lets the milk cool. It tells you when it\u2019s time to add the starter. Then it makes the yogurt for as long as you set it. \nPLAY\n\nRice cookers again provide a perfect method for making this, but have never quite gotten it right, particularly with steel cut oatmeal. Leaving it to cook in the rice cooker with the lid closed can lead to you coming back to a Mt. Vesuvius-like explosion of starch all over the cooker and your counter. \nWe got tired of having to deal with that and so did our counter tops. So we developed a specialized Oatmeal function for the TIM3 MACHIN3 to cook any type of oatmeal perfectly without any starch-canic eruptions. \nPlus, with the TIM3 MACHIN3\u2019s delay timer you can add your oatmeal and water the night before and wake up to a hot and ready breakfast.\nSlow cooking has been such a popular cooking method for so long for a reason. Not only do you get incredible flavor, it\u2019s really, really easy too. A rice cooker and a slow cooker really aren\u2019t that different: both have a heating element under a pot. So we made the TIM3 MACHIN3 a slow cooker too.\nSet the TIM3 MACHIN3 to 4, 6 or 8 hours and it will cook your food at a low temperature, slowly increasing as the cooking time comes to a close. So you'll end up with that fall-off-the-bone-flavor everyone loves. It\u2019s just like a digital 4-quart slow cooker, if only a digital slow cooker could do all these other awesome things. \nThe TIM3 MACHIN3 also has a programmable steaming option so you can tell it how long to steam your food. It won\u2019t start counting down until the water comes to a boil, so you\u2019re programming exactly how long your food will steam. And you don\u2019t need to keep one eye on the kitchen while it cooks. It\u2019ll automatically switch over to warm once your set time has passed. With a steam tray that hangs above the pot, it\u2019s also a great way to make a complete meal all in the TIM3 MACHIN3. Add your protein and vegetables to the steam tray and have them steam above while rice or quinoa cooks below! \nThe key to the TIM3 MACHIN3\u2019s success is our Fuzzy Logic 2.0\u2122 system. \nWe developed a smarter brain for our TIM3 MACHIN3 that\u2019s able to handle this heavy cooking load. Our powerful 900-watt heating element (compared to the 650-watt average for rice cookers), allows us to cook faster and make quicker temperature adjustments while cooking. \nA sensor both above and below the cooking pot works in conjuncture with our big rice cooker brain to ensure your food cooks perfectly every time. \nAnd lastly, we made our cooking pot 20% thicker than the industry standard to prevent the browning that\u2019s so prevalent in rice cookers. We also coated it with a long-life, PFOA-free nonstick coating from Whitford to enhance nonstick release and durability. \nWe\u2019re really close to making the TIM3 MACHIN3 a reality. After multiple trips to Asia, we finally identified the right manufacturing partner. We\u2019ve completed our prototypes, received our US electrical safety standard approval (thanks Intertek!) and even finished a pilot run of 50 units. There are a few tooling modifications we need to make in order to get the level of quality we want to achieve. We\u2019re hoping the Kickstarter community can help us achieve our dream. \nOnce we reach our modest goal of $10,000, we\u2019ll be able to move forward with production and have TIM3 MACHIN3\u2019s in stock and ready to ship prior to Christmas 2014.

Lewis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " *****************************************************************************************************************\nTuesday, Dec 2 @ 10AM: Stretch Goal Achieved!\nWe'll be able to include an extra special parcel along with the final letter of the story. The parcel will contain none other than the actual \"unidentified sculptural object\" from A Curious Bit of Matter.\nWill you guess what it is before it arrives?\n*****************************************************************************************************************\nKeep Me Posted: A New Kind of Children's Book\nKeep Me Posted is an experimental new format for children's book publishing. Adventurous adults with a keen sense of humor will love it too! We propose to combine the magic of a great original story with the wonder and surprise of receiving letters in the mail. Very tiny letters, actually.\nEach whimsical story is told through weekly surprises that arrive via mail.\nPut your tablet away and turn off the phone. There's no app or ebook option here. Just pure tangible delight! Pay close attention\u2014and watch your mailbox each week\u2014as these kid's books for all ages unfold.\nTechnically speaking, this is epistolary fiction. You'll enjoy the story by essentially reading \"over the shoulders\" of the characters as they write letters back and forth to each other.\nOpen each tiny letter carefully upon arrival and use the included magnifying glass to keep up with your new favorite characters. A Keep Me Posted story by mail is an innovative gift for kids and adults that love surprises.\nEach Keep Me Posted story will be tiny-themed featuring characters like insects, specks of dust, paper clips, teeth, raindrops, zeros and ones, nano-circuits, etc.. It will be equal parts ridiculous, charming, and incredible.\nHow Does It Work?\nWeek 1: The first installment of the story arrives via a tiny letter in your mailbox along with a high-quality magnifying glass, character roster, and a small custom box that sets the stage for the story. Use the box for safekeeping of the additional letters that arrive in subsequent weeks.\nThe first package kicks off the story and will arrive before Christmas!\nWeeks 2 Through 6: A new letter will arrive via mail once a week. Each letter will move the story along, via direct communications between characters. Sometimes there might be extras included, like a postcard from a character who's on vacation or some other piece of paper ephemera that plays into the story.\nOne delightfully original letter arrives each week, plus some fun extras!\nWeeks 7 Through Infinity: Take all six letters that make up the story out of the box and read the series over and over, just like you would your favorite traditional children's book.\nAre the Letters Truly Tiny?\nYep, they measure 1 x 1.5 inches. You'll most certainly need the magnifying glass, which makes the experience all the more fun and intriguing!\nHow Will Each Letter Arrive?\nThe first letter plus the box, character roster, magnifying glass, and a small card (with your name on it as the giver) will arrive in a padded mailer addressed directly to your recipient. Subsequent installments of the story will arrive via regular mail in special translucent envelopes that showcase the tiny wonder inside.\nWho wouldn't love finding this in their mailbox?\n\nStory #1: A Curious Bit of Matter\n\u201cCheck it out. There's a snail in the mailbox! And her name is Shelly. Oh, and look, there's Anton and Buzz too. I bet Alfred the Aphid is hiding in the back underneath all that junk mail.\u201d\nTo kick off this new concept in publishing, we're seeking your backing for our first story by mail, entitled A Curious Bit of Matter. Installment #1 will arrive before December 25. Wrap it up and put it under the tree! Or have us send your reward as a gift directly to your recipient.\nThe rest of the story will arrive one letter per week through early February, 2015. If successful, we hope to launch many more wonderful stories by mail in the months and years to come. Help us deliver anticipation and delight to mailboxes around the world by backing this very first tale.\nWhat's A Curious Bit of Matter About?\nThis first story is about a sweet and clever group of backyard insects that discover a USO (unidentified sculptural object) and try to sort out what to make of it. Along the way, they learn to appreciate the little things in life and the diversity of the natural world.\nCan I See a Sample Letter?\nOkay, but just the first one. After all, each letter is supposed to be a surprise!\nGet your magnifying glass ready!\nWho's It For?\nThe content and characters are appropriate for curious kids of all ages. We've worked in a few inside jokes and obscure references to keep parents entertained too. After all, the best children's stories are the ones that kids and adults can read and appreciate together, over and over again.\nWe believe that kids are capable of much more than is typically expected. Each child has an inherent ability to discover the world at his or her own pace, one small step at a time. You won't find a strong moral or message at the heart of our stories. Instead, you'll find characters that notice and comment on small details and are mindful and aware of what is happening around them. They'll ask questions, consider various possibilities, and then venture off in search of answers. And it will all be original and vastly entertaining!\nIs It Illustrated?\nYes, sort of! The custom box will feature illustrations by Lea, as will the character roster and some of the extras. What's most special about this story is that it's told exclusively via letters sent back and forth among the characters. The focus on written words lets kids exercise their limitless imaginations. Given how much time many kids now spend on iPads or watching television, we think this is a very important detail.\nJust enough illustrations to set the scene...\nWill My Kid Love It?\nAbsolutely. Your child (or other recipient) will probably remember the tiny story he or she received via mail forever.\n\nWho Is Lea Redmond?\nLea Redmond is an author and artist. She created the World's Smallest Post Service back in 2008, which surprises and delights thousands of people every year. Lea has tons of experience designing at small scale and loves working with kids.\nLea is also the creator of a successful series of letter writing diaries from Chronicle Books, which includes Letters To My Future Self and Letters To My Baby. She is currently working on four other book projects for various publishers, including a children's picture book.\nWho Are Some of Lea's Favorite Children's Book Authors?\nDavid Weisner (Sector 7, Tuesday)\nPeter Sis (The Tree of Life, Starry Messenger)\nCrockett Johnson (Harold and the Purple Crayon)\nAmy Krouse Rosenthal (Spoon, The OK Book)\nLea's mom, Ginger Howard (William's House, Basket of Bangles)\n\nWhat Is The Current Status?\nDesign the tiny letters, including miniature stamps, etc. [Done]\nResearch and select best mailing materials [Done]\nDesign and illustrate the custom box [In progress]\nWrite the story [First draft done]\nCopyedit the story [Not yet started]\nSource awesome magnifying glass [Done]\nPackage and send first installment to your lucky recipient [By Dec 15]\nWill The First Installment Really Arrive by Christmas?\nYes, we're totally committed to making sure your recipient can unwrap the first installment of the story by Christmas morning. Kids don't dig IOUs. They want the real thing in their hands. If you'd like, we can stamp \"Open on Xmas\" on the outside of the mailer. We'll also include a small card with your name as the person who sent the gift. The rest of the story will unfold in your recipient's mailbox over the next five weeks.\n\nHow Will Kickstarter Funds Be Used?\nPrinting of tiny letters, gift cards, etc.\nCutting die to make custom boxes\nSource high-quality magnifying glasses\nHand assembly of tiny letters and extras\nPackaging and addressing\nPostage and mailing materials\nDevelopment of additional stories for future releases\n\nWhat Happens After Six Weeks?\nIf all goes well, and with your support, we hope to launch many more Keep Me Posted stories with the same unique epistolary format. Someday, we'd even love to invite other children's book authors to contribute content for future editions.\nHelp us make opening the mailbox fun again for years to come!\n\nWhat Is Leafcutter Designs?\nLeafcutter Designs is a creative studio run by Lea and her brother Devin in Berkeley, CA. We develop, make, and sell a line of creative gift items via our online shop and we also work with other businesses to produce memorable custom goods for special events. We've launched other creative projects via successful Kickstarter campaigns including Seed Money and Trade Tokens. This is our first effort to self-publish a children's story.\nSpecializing in small wonders since 2008!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe timeline to deliver the first installment of the reward is tight. We have years of experience with automated shipping software and can process a high number of shipments daily. That said, each tiny letter is made by hand so we'll need to finalize the story and begin making tiny letters immediately upon achieving our fundraising goal.\n\nInternational rewards will ship first via First Class mail and delivery times to some foreign countries can be very unpredictable. We ask that international backers be extra patient and understand that sometimes a letter may arrive out of order. It's not that we sent it out of order, but that a more recent shipment arrived quicker than an earlier one.

It\u2019s the result of more than two decades of experimentation with productivity methods due to learning disabilities; over time, these disabilities wore off, but the effectiveness of the organizational methods endured. By incorporating digital principles into an actual, hand-held notebook, the Bullet Journal offers the flexibility of a blank page with the clarity and structure of a digital system.\nBulletjournal.com was launched just over a year ago to make this system freely available to all. It\u2019s since been featured on Lifehack.org, Lifehacker.com, and Fast Company. The original tutorial video (above) has been viewed over half a million times, and unique communities have sprung up all over the Internet, communities that create and share their own mods and methods. When it comes to being more productive, the Bullet Journal has already proven itself to be an invaluable tool for many.\nWhy the Kickstarter?\nFrom organizing to-do lists, managing schedules and meetings, tracking health and fitness goals, and everything in between, the Bullet Journal has the amazing ability to organize a very diverse range of data. \u201cBulletjournalists\u201d are creating new and incredibly valuable tools for tackling everyday organizational challenges. These ideas could be helping significantly more people, but instead they\u2019re getting lost online.\nThis Kickstarter campaign will fund development of the next version of bulletjournal.com: a stronger, smarter, more intuitive platform that will make it easy for users to find and contribute new methods to make the Bullet Journal system even more useful and effective. The new site will serve as a free library for the ever-growing catalog of productivity methods.

Everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative projects that are brought to life through the direct support of others.\nThousands of creative projects are funding on Kickstarter at any given moment. Each project is independently created and crafted by the person behind it. The filmmakers, musicians, artists, and designers you see on Kickstarter have complete control and responsibility over their projects. They spend weeks building their project pages, shooting their videos, and brainstorming what rewards to offer backers. When they're ready, creators launch their project and share it with their community.\nEvery project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. If people like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing.\nBacking a project is more than just giving someone money, it's supporting their dream to create something that they want to see exist in the world.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWebsite:\nThe development of the new site will be collaborative with the backers. Locking down the first set of features for the new bulletjournal.com is the initial goal; based on the number of features, we can then establish a timeline. Sometimes certain features prove more difficult or time consuming than anticipated, which may impact the delivery. In this case, we will choose to either roll out promised features at a later date, or push back the launch. \n\nJournal:\nThe journals are being fabricated by a third party. In the case these journals will not be delivered on time, backers will be notified. \nThe NEW \"unlimited\" edition will be produced and ship after the limited edition.

Isn't it time your case did the same. \nIntroducing the world's first Felt Case for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. \nIncorporating a protective inner layer and wrapped in precision-cut felt, your iPhone 6 will be a stunner wherever you go. The premium look and feel of real felt is sure to be conversation piece wherever you go.\nShipped Right After Funding Period Ends\nFree Worldwide Shipping\nIn what we believe is a Kickstarter first, we will begin shipping your case immediately after we get funded. Here's how it will all work:\nThis will be the one of the world's fastest Kickstarter campaigns. Immediately after reviewing Apple's specifications, we started tooling. The tooling will be complete in just a couple more weeks. Mass production will start immediately thereafter.\nWe will ship your Felt Case as soon as the funding period ends.\nOrder Now at F\u016aZDesigns.com\nDesign\nDesigned in Utah, the Felt Case is a beautiful representation of modern design. Using Apple's case design guide it is sure to be a perfect fit.\nMake a Statement\nBrooks Forrester from the Bachelorette.\nSome people feel the need to use outrageous styles and colors to get attention. That's not how we do things at F\u016aZ Designs and that's not how you live your life. \nYour sense of style is understated but powerful. You won't be buying the Felt Case to get noticed, but it's going to happen anyway. \nWhen people see the Felt Case, they always want to touch it and then they ask where they can get one. You'll want to buy a few so you don't feel obligated to give up yours.\nMaterials\nThe Felt Case starts with a thermoplastic urethane inner layer for strength and rigidity. Then we layer it with premium industrial grade felt for a feel that is unlike any other. \nJust grippy enough that it won't slide off your lap, but easily slides into your pocket or purse. \nBoth pieces are precision molded and cut to perfectly fit your new iPhone 6. The felt is then heat molded to the inner core providing an exceptionally strong bond.\nOrder Now at F\u016aZDesigns.com\nProtection\nA case is only as good as the protection it provides, so we designed the Felt Case to deal with the inevitable drops that are sure to come your way. \nFelt is used in many industrial applications to absorb shock and look good doing it. Combined with the inner thermoplastic layer, you get a great deal of drop protection from a case that is less than 2mm thick. \nIn addition to the rear protection, the front of your iPhone will be protected by a lip that extends just above the glass.\nLess Than 2mm Thin?\nYes, the Felt Case is a two-layer case that is less than 2mm thick. We worked very hard getting the Felt Case to be as thin as possible. We wanted the Felt Case to complement the iPhone 6's exceptionally thin profile and not overpower it. We never could understand why you'd want to buy the world's thinnest, most beautiful phone and cover it with the world's fattest, ugliest case. The Felt case is beautiful, thin, and protective in a way that is unparalleled.\nRewards\nDimensions\nOrder Now at F\u016aZDesigns.com\nAbout Us\nF\u016aZ Designs was founded by David Gengler and Cameron Gibbs in 2013 to create exceptional products for today's electronic devices.

It is a pretty impressive process. I've also attached a photo of something pretty unique to the Felt Case.

Sitting in a meeting, or on hold with the cable company, or listening to a conference call that has gone on past the point of being productive. As the brain starts to wander, the hands reach for a stack of yellow sticky notes. What a fantastic format! Small, square, disposable, and with a sticky strip on the back. In mere moments, a silly drawing or message appears, and can be immediately displayed on the wall, inside a book, on the edge of the computer monitor, or on the back of a friend's jacket as he sneaks by.\nIf you saw my first two Kickstarter projects, you already know I'm a teacher, as well as an artist. I'm one of those people who needs to keep his hands busy in order to stay focused, so I take a pack of Post-it\u00ae Notes with me every time I attend a meeting at the school. I've probably drawn hundreds of sticky note cartoons. Ducks, robots, giraffes, appliances, starfish, stereos, fire hydrants, and a few people. So I've already got an ongoing love affair with the ubiquitous yellow square.\nWhy?\nAs the new school year begins, I need a project to work on. It will be used to demonstrate to my students some very important aspects of art. I can show them commitment to a large-scale project that spans months of work. They will see me working daily, and understand the importance of regular, frequent, and rigorous practice. The students will (hopefully) see the effect of that practice, in the form of improved quality or evolving style. I will show them how an artist can make a living through hard work, determination, and commitment, and watch the project go from conception to completion, all over the course of one school year. I can also use examples from this project in lessons on composition, portrait drawing, pencil shading, crosshatching, etc.\nSo, in the interest of improving art education, inspiring young artists, pushing myself to practice, and bringing hand-made art to the masses... I've decided to begin a huge undertaking. I will draw hundreds of portraits on Post-it\u00ae Notes and compile them into one book. The final page count will depend on how many backers send me photos, but ideally, they would number in the hundreds.\nPORTRAITS\nEach portrait will be hand-drawn (by me) on a 3\u201d x 3\u201d Super Sticky Post-It\u00ae Note of my choosing. I like to use pencil, ink, marker, color pencil, chalk, and paint. But not all on the same drawing. Your portrait will be drawn using whichever materials I feel are most appropriate for the image. You can see from the drawings I've already completed, there is a range of media and style. Unfortunately, I am not able to take requests for materials or colors. Sorry!\nBOOK\nThe book will be a collection of hand-drawn portraits (originally on sticky notes), in varying styles and color. While I would like to make the book 3\u201d square, just like the drawings, I think the printing process will require a small border around the images. So I am left with two options: Make the book more like 3.25\u201d square, or lose part of every drawing to edge bleed and trimming. I'm looking at going with the former. So hopefully the book will be 3.35\u201d square, with full color gloss pages. The drawings will be as close to actual size as possible, and one portrait will be on each page. Since the book is so small, I will have to use a special binding method that will allow the pages to open fully.  Normal binding might prevent the book from opening flat, and we would not be able to see the part of the drawing closest to the spine.  I want to be able to see the entire image on every page...  So we are left with a very expensive method for binding.  The more backers buy a portrait, the more pages will go in the book. I'd like to have more than 250 images, but 200 will be the minimum.\nI'll be working with the same local printing company that produced The Heartless Machine Guide To Drawing, and 99 Ways to Die: a Coloring Book for Adults.  They make fantastic books, right here in Austin TX, and they consistently provide me with the service and quality I need.  I DO NOT have books made in China.  My products are always made in the USA.\nThe binding is very important to me.  I always strive for quality.  So with this book, it came down to two options.  There's a cheap way to do it, and a quality way to do it.  Look at the difference:\nOn the left, you will see a cheaply bound book, meant for mass-distribution. Notice how the spine is fully glued, and the damage sustained when opening the book.  See how the spine of the book is already falling apart, and I haven't even read the book!  This will not do.  When I am done reading it, I will put the book on the shelf, and the ugly spine creases will be all I see!\nOn the right, there is an extra step to binding this book.  The cover is glued separately, so the flexing of the pages and spine do not crease the cover.  It's so much better!  When I put this book back on the shelf (and I might not), the spine will look brand new.  This is the quality I provide to my backers!\nTIMELINE\nSEPTEMBER- After the Kickstarter deadline, I will send out a survey to those who pledged for a hand-drawn portrait. The survey will include information about how to submit your image. As the images come in, I will begin drawing.\nJANUARY- If I end up with 400 portraits (that's a lot!), and I draw 100 portraits each month (that's totally possible), I will finish drawing by the end of January.\nFEBRUARY- Scanning, cropping, color correcting, rotating, converting to PDF, and compiling for the printer.\nMARCH- Submit the files to the printer.\nAPRIL- It's quite possible to have the books ready for shipping in April.\n\nI've decided to give myself plenty of room in the timeline, though. So I've scheduled the rewards to be delivered by July, just to be safe. I prefer to be months ahead of schedule vs the opposite, and you can see in my previous two Kickstarter projects, everything went out at least on time, if not early. Besides not wanting to let down my backers, it's also very important to me that my students see this project completed. I'm very motivated to stay ahead of schedule.\nRULES\nPart of the point of this project is to show a wide variety of people and expressions in a constrained format. To that end, I am requesting that you do not send photos of children, pets, or the deceased. I am only interested in photos of consenting adults. That means you, not some guy off the street. You will need to confirm that the person in the photo is either you, or a consenting adult, and that you are allowing me to publish the drawing as part of my book.\nIt will be the backers' responsibility to contribute a well-lit and clearly defined photo for inclusion in this project, so please do your part! If you send me a bad photo, you can't expect a good drawing. If you don't send a photo at all, I will have nothing to draw.\nYou don't have to make a funny face, but these little portraits are a lot more fun if you do.\nIf you would like to see more examples, you can check my website, twitter, tumblr, and Facebook.\nPost-it\u00ae is a registered trademark of 3M.

I\u2019m a fine art photographer specializing in portraits of horses. I have a small studio in San Diego, California where I create and build large scale pieces using canvas and resin. I feel this gives my images something special and lends a unique, artful quality to my work.\nMy focus on horses is a natural extension of my personal life. I\u2019ve been riding for years and started leasing my horse, Tobie, about two years ago when I left the corporate world to be an artist. That\u2019s when my camera started following me to the barn. I love my horse, and I know first hand the deep connection and partnership that develops between horse and rider. I am so happy that my work allows me the chance to tap into that energy and emotion, to frame the essence of these beautiful creatures and freeze a moment in time for their humans to treasure.\nBecause of the strong response I get when I show people these pieces, I want to have my first public exhibit. While my goal is to gain new clients through this exposure to my photography, I knew that a greater purpose could be served. So, this collection is called \u201cPortraits of Hope\u201d and it is focused on rescue and sanctuary horses. With this collection I hope to remind people of the important work being done by these grass roots organizations to save such noble creatures from neglect, abuse and slaughter.\nI learn so much from horses every day. Grace, humor, patience, and compassion. And playfulness. When I started shooting photos for this collection I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect and was prepared for it to take time for these subjects to get comfortable with me and my camera. But they needed no time at all, and the trust and love they showed me from the very start made me laugh out loud, and cry. Their caretakers shared stories of their money earning years, and how they were discarded. And then how they were found and brought to their new homes - stories that will appear beside their portraits at the exhibit to allow everyone to get to know a little about their journey, as well as the dedication and loving hands that helped to restore their trust in humans.\nThis show is all about revealing the beauty and grace of these horses and recognizing the tireless work of volunteers who get them to safety and the life they deserve. With your help, I\u2019ll be able to make this show a reality and share pieces of my work and process with you.\nI am thrilled to be building this exhibit and I thank you for any support you can offer.  The rewards I have defined provide an opportunity to participate in this project by supporting the funding, and in turn owning a piece from this exhibit.  The money raised from this Kickstarter project will go to the canvases, printing, framing and materials to finish the final works for the exhibit, as well as the creation and delivery of the rewards.  Thanks for visiting my project.  Whether you contribute to fund this project, or you simply share this with your network of friends, I thank you for your efforts in spreading the word.\nhttp://kickingitforward.org\nEXHIBITION TO BE HELD AT PREFAB, Opening party details to come!\nAt The Headquarters in Seaport Village is a unique co-working, gallery and event space for creatives and makers.

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more.

With 14 years of experience in San Diego's culinary industry, he's held the gamut of front and back of the house positions throughout his career to gain thorough knowledge of proper food preparation, health codes and sanitary requirements. Born and raised in San Diego, he's always hoped to someday open his own local small business and now... he's almost there. Chris believes there's a simple concept that can be translated through any type of food... happiness.  He has touched the hearts and taste buds of thousands of people in San Diego over his career with great food and personable service. He's a passionate gardener and having a green thumb is a modest description of his connection with the plant world.  His home based gardens have received endless enthusiasm and interest with the public each season for over 18 years.   Having a professional platform to be able to increase social awareness for the problem of our declining access to fresh local produce and self sustainability would be a life long dream of his.  Whether it's serving tables in a downtown restaurant, catering an event or grill cooking at upscale cafes in Sorrento Valley...

She fatefully married Chris in September 2012.  Being conscious about overall well-being, Tory's passion for healthy food is as strong as it is for healing and these two go hand in hand.  She'll be assisting in prep, running the register and will occasionally have a massage chair set up at the truck to show off her healing hands!\nThe assistance of two additional creative, motivated and talented local chefs will be necessary for day to day operations.  Along with pleasing the streets of San Diego, I'm in discussions with multiple business park campuses in the Sorrento Valley area to begin catering on our opening day.\nThe grub\nLocal, sustainable and fresh is the foundation of The Machine's menu.  With a larger selection, we'll have the option of creating daily specials and offer even more selections to satisfy your taste buds. I'm going to create a mobile App that will allow ordering and paying at our truck quicker and easier for our loyal patrons. The menu is going to have a North and South of the border theme which fits right in here in San Diego. The North side will have a savory grass-fed cheeseburger, a delicious chicken Machine-wich, and decadant BBQ pulled pork.  On the south side you'll be able to choose from some of the best pollo asada and pork carnitas in SD or a weekly selection of beer battered fish using our finest local brews.  We'll be offering beer battered onion rings, tortilla chips, french fries or a salad as sides. Having such a versatile menu allows us and our patrons to be able to cross over items to create an endless menu for an endless crowd.  To date, I've come up with over 280 specials to offer on our truck and still counting.  We'll be creating gluten free, vegan and vegetarian options as well as be utilizing our local organic produce and humanely raised livestock within 250 miles of San Diego. Food that not only pleases your stomach and mind... but your soul as well. \nEnvironmental and community improvements\nWe're going to be:\nUtilizing our humanely raised livestock raised within 250 miles of SD\nDonating %'s of sales to charities such as the ASPCA\nUsing as much local organic vegetables I can get my hands on\nSponsoring monthly beach clean up events\nConverting our engines into bio-diesel ASAP\nEstablishing local home based and urban micro-gardens\nContributing to food donation programs\nUsing 100% biodegradable and compostable paper products\nParticipating in local youth cooking classes\nCreating AS MANY local honey bee hive collectives as possible\nThe list goes on and on for what I want to accomplish as a small business owner here in San Diego and with your support, I'll be able to achieve all of my goals!\nWhere you come in!\nInitial expenses to commence operation include: \nPrimary truck lease - $2,750/month\nkitchen rental - $2,400-$3,000/month\nNecessary kitchen utensils/equipment - $2,300\nInsurances (3) - $780\nWebsite/Mobile App/Logo development - $2,600\nStart-up food/commissary costs - $4,200/first week\nRewards fulfillment - $5,000-$7,000 (depending on # of backers)\nMedia devices and POS system - $1,850\nLabor - $2,500/first week\nTaxes and fees - $2,212 (8.2%)\n\n        Sum = $29,192\nStretch goal $50,000\nSecuring the initial funding will allow us to commence food truck operations for the first month.  We'll use the additional funding for upgrades such as a Mobile Facility Support Unit, converting our truck engines to bio-diesel (once owned) and be able to start the green projects mentioned above... IMMEDIATELY.  We'll be able to purchase ALL of the desired kitchen equipment which would speed up our prep process (which is vital) such as a meat grinder, vegetable dicer, food processor, meat slicer, etc.  I would love to be able to have the assistance of a MFSU which would allow us to store backup product and would also provide an additional venue to offer fresh smoothies, frozen yogurt and GrabNGo items.  We're going to do our absolute best to provide San Diego with an honest, reliable and most delicious venue to satisfy your taste buds, hearts and wallets!\nWords can't express my gratitude for your support in helping me reach my goal!! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm confident that my success as a personal chef and the experience I've gained throughout my career will translate to being a successful small business owner here in San Diego. Challenges arising with running any type of food platform are endless if you look at them as \"problems.\" I've never viewed negative situations that arise as problems, only as opportunities. As a Chef, I have an obligation to provide the utmost personable service, quality product and overall kindness to every last patron. This is a rare quality in any type of business these days and I pride myself on having this come naturally for me. \n\nI've spent the last 11 months researching the industry, acquiring contacts, obtaining quotes, marketing my truck, developing my business plan and my last step will be securing funding. I have my primary truck and mobile facility support unit picked out, my kitchen equipment selected and an available kitchen space to rent. I've created a versatile menu that can cater to a large demographic and San Diego's eagerly awaiting our grand opening.\n\nThe greatest foreseeable challenge that could arise after being successfully funded, but not yet open for service is being over budget. Some examples might be that the costs of my website/mobile App is higher than anticipated OR the truck I have picked out for lease (to date) isn't available. Though these situations are highly doubtful, I'm confident that I'll be able to conquer any obstacle put before me. As setbacks arise, we'll do our best to tackle them promptly and keep you updated on the progress as new milestones are met. \n\nThank you everyone for your support, patience and hope to see you soon!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Chris Shinsky\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nThe Machine is going to set a new standard for how mobile food venues should operate here in San Diego!See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Hi-5's, handshakes and hugs to all of my loyal backers!!", "update_content": "          Hey everyone!  I want to graciously thank everybody for your positive feedback and loyal support throughout my project.  Although I may not reach my intended goal, I will in no way let that discourage my efforts to eventually be operating a gourmet food truck here in San Diego.  The \"all or nothing\" aspect of Kickstarter can be a motivation for backers to ensure the project's success but can also be the main reason for it's failure.  I'm approaching my dream of owning my own business from different angles and might initially start off by catering events and delivering pre-made meals to residents throughout San Diego county.  I'm a pretty happy guy but I'll be an even happier camper once I'm working for myself.\n          A few unfortunate events in my life within the past few months haven't made this project very easy.  My smart phone and computer simultaneously crashed two weeks after I launched my project on April 30th and were pretty expensive to fix.  I lost my job on March 3rd and made the decision to launch my project 2 months earlier then I had initially anticipated.  I decided to dedicate 100% of my time and energy into marketing my new business and I've been spending the last 3 months single handily trying to spread the word about my Kickstarter project via flyers, social media and face to face interactions.  My lack of initial funding and experience with social media hasn't made it easy to generate the desired response with reaching my \"funding goal\" on Kickstarter.  However, I have gained A LOT of fundraising experience, professional contacts, exposure for my new business and have been able to \"plant seeds\" in 1,000's of like-minded individuals brains."}, {"status": [{"Project ends": "JUNE 10, 2014"}, {"Project launches": "MAY 1, 2014"}]}], "comment_no": 9, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1175171005/the-machine-a-san-diego-based-gourmet-food-truck", "project_name": "The Machine"}}, {"backer": "Sarah R. Lewis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thanks for checking out our Phil The Pill Kickstarter Campaign! We\u2019re excited to introduce you to our game, our villain Hank The Stank, our very own Princess Polycorn, the pillbug inhabitants of Pillville and, of course, our hero Phil The Pill. Our goal for this campaign is to raise the necessary funds to complete and launch Phil The Pill on iOS and Android. We look forward to hearing your feedback, thoughts, ideas and suggestions. Let us know what we can do to earn your support!\n  Think Bomberman meets Pacman meets Temple Run. Phil The Pill is an immersive, surprising and mildly addicting action/puzzle video game. Players will experience fits of laughter, tears of joy, racing hearts, fits of frustration and above all else, pure fun!\n  Welcome to Pillville!  Ruled by the fair Princess Polycorn, Pillville is home to a peaceful colony of kind hearted, fun-loving pillbugs. One such joy filled pillbug is our hero, Phil The Pill! Phil is a pillbug who spends his days rolling \u2018round the kingdom, relaxin' with friends and devouring delicious sugary snacks. Pillbugs love their sweets.\nUnfortunately, the peace, quiet and serenity of Pillville is under attack!  Hank The Stank, a downright dirty rotten stink bug and his brood of Stenchmen have infiltrated Pillville and are spreading stench across the land.  The poor, defenseless pillbugs have no choice but to retreat into their shells to escape Hank\u2019s nauseating smell. \nPillville is no longer the joyful paradise it once was. It's a wasteland consumed by vile stink bug stench. Even the once bright and happy Polycorn Palace has been converted into a filthy, pungent bowling alley. Hank The Stank, a fierce, competitive bowler now spends his days on the lanes using frightened, rolled up pillbugs as bowling balls.\nCaptured and locked in an airtight bowling trophy, Princess Polycorn\u2019s magical powers have been rendered useless and there is nothing she can do to save her kingdom! All hope would be lost, if it weren\u2019t for the severe allergies and clogged sinuses of Phil The Pill! Even Hank The Stank\u2019s aromatic stench cannot infiltrate the stuffed nasal passages of Phil\u2019s nose!\nPillville and it\u2019s sugary snacks have begun to wither and rot.  Phil The Pill, immune to the stench, is our only hope! Be a hero, support our Kickstarter Campaign and help Phil The Pill save Pillville!\nAt its core, Phil the Pill is a top down action-puzzle maze explorer game. Using intuitive swipes, taps and multitouch gestures you control Phil as he navigates a series of mazes riddled with hazards, traps, tricks and baddies. As you might expect, Phil's main mode of transportation is rolling. Swiping in any direction, Phil takes off, rolling at a brisk pace, till he hits an obstruction. A quick tap stops Phil and brings him to an upright action stance where he can punch or fire off a variety of weapons to bust through walls or take out baddies. Don\u2019t stand around for long though, you gotta keep on rolling on to stay ahead of the creeping cloud of stench that chases you towards the finish of every level!\nSAVE THE PILLBUGS\nEach maze has 3 pillbugs to save. Saving all the pillbugs isn't required, but come on, have a heart.\nSWEEP THE COINS\nCoins are scattered generously throughout the levels. Collect them for extra points, equipment upgrades and to use in Bert's Shop.\nSEARCH FOR CRUD\nPillbugs love random crud. Many levels have a hidden piece-o-crud. Find them all for bonus loot. \nFIND THE EXIT\nLike the ancient proverb says, In order to begin the next level you must first exit the level you are in\u2026 Make it to the exit portal to unlock the next level.\nPuzzles become less forgiving and more intense as you travel deeper into the game. Choosing a strategic path, conserving your weapons and managing hazards are key to your survival. The following level feature overview will prove useful when strategizing your way through the levels.\nWORM HOLES\nThese holes can be used as secret underground transport paths but beware, there\u2019s no telling where you\u2019ll popup after entering one. You\u2019ll also want to be cautious of the dwellers that occasionally pop out of them! \nLASER GATES & SWITCHES\nEach laser gate has a color coordinated switch that must be pressed before passing through it. Running into the gates isn't a good idea, take our word for it!\nCONVEYOR BELTS\nConveyor belts are a one way street. They\u2019ll get you moving in one direction, but don\u2019t even think about trying to go back!\n \n  STEEL BLOCKS\nSteel blocks are impassable. Don't punch or waste your ammo on them. No matter what you do, they won't go away!\nGRASS BLOCKS\nThey might slow you down but they'll never stop you. You can punch right through these blocks!\nSTONE BLOCKS\nThese blocks require a little more firepower. Stock up on bombs to clear stone blocks out of your way.\nWOOD BLOCKS\nWood blocks are a little too tough for Phils' fists, but any other weapon will blast right through \u2018em.\n  A variety of destructive weapons will be available when you need them most.\n  Don\u2019t underestimate the power of an insect's fists. Phil can punch out enemies, and through dirt walls. Watch out for stone though, it can be a little rough on the knuckles.\n  As you may have guessed, bombs go boom! And take out most things in a close vicinity. Bombs can destroy dirt, stone, wood and enemies.\n  A basic semi automatic projectile weapon, the pea shooter is handy for ranged shots as well as blasting through dirt, wood and enemies rapidly.\n  The missile launcher turns a bomb into a ranged weapon! Use missiles to blast blocks and baddies from a distance.\n  Sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire; or in this case, stink with barf. The barf cannon sends a glob of barf over an obstacle where it splats down with nasty force taking out whatever it hits.\n  It may be pretty, but the rainbow ray should be used with caution. It has the ability to take out every destructible item in its path in a high-powered laser-like fashion.\n  Designed for the most dire situations, the smart bomb has the ability to clear an entire level, leaving virtually no chance for Hank\u2019s Stenchlings to beat you. They\u2019re rare so use \u2018em sparingly.\n  Life in Pillville has become very difficult and even the strongest Pillbug needs an occasional \u201cpick me up.\u201d As Phil fights his way through level after level, he\u2019ll need power ups to lift his spirits and keep him alive. \nPower ups can be found throughout the game, or are available for purchase in Bert\u2019s Shop using coins you\u2019ve collected along the way. Bert can be a bit of a slimy guy, but he has a knack for being there when you need him most.\nHEALTH REFILL\nRunnin\u2019 on empty? Fill 'er up and bring Phil\u2019s health back to 100%.\nGAS MASK\nGas masks lessen the debilitating effects of the creeping stench cloud. You're nostrils will thank you.\nSTINK REPELLENT\nTake your time, fumigate and relax! This repellent completely removes the stinky creeping stench from the level you\u2019re on.\nINVINCIBILITY\nThe name says it all! This one renders Phil invincible for the remainder of the level.\nCRUD FINDER\nThis handy gadget reveals where hidden crud can be found. Nothing hit's the spot like a little crud!\n  If obstacles are opportunities, there are a LOT of opportunities in Pillville! Rescuing a princess, defeating a stink bug and setting a colony of Pillbugs free is pretty hard work when danger lurks \u2018round ever corner. Keep on your toes and watch for these hazards.\nCREEPING STENCH\nThis green gaseous cloud is found on every level of the game. As Phil races to collect coins, nab weapons and free his fellow pillbugs, the creeping stench wafts further into the maze, pushing Phil higher and higher on the screen. If Phil can\u2019t complete his mission prior to the level being fully engulfed\u2026  All hope is lost.\nSPIKED WALLS\nAvoid these sharp spikes at all costs! Nothing ruins your morning like impaling yourself on a wall!\nMOVING SPIKES\nAvoiding a stationary spiked wall can be fairly difficult. Avoiding a moving spiked block is downright hard!\n  Some baddies are Hank The Stank\u2019s henchmen and others are mutated bi-products of the stench that has rolled into Pillville. Either way, they\u2019ll do anything in their power to derail Phil\u2019s quest.\nSTENCHLINGS\nThese stink bug larvae are foul little beasts that leave an offensively odorous trail of stink that\u2019ll burn the retina right outta your eyes! Steer clear or you might find yourself the victim of a Stenchling \u201ccrop dusting.\"\nSLUGLIES\nSluglies sluggishly slug around Pillvile depositing a slimy snail trail wherever they go. Watch where you roll, the Sluglies sludge will slow you down to less than a crawl.\nWORMURS\nThese toothy wormhole inhabitants don\u2019t take too kindly to our hero trespassing in their deep, dark, and dirty corridors. Watch your fingers, toes, arms, legs and face anytime you\u2019re near a worm hole!  You never know when a Wormur might pop up!\n   As the stink continues to rise along with the difficulty of each new level, you\u2019ll find that Phil requires new and improved gear to keep him fighting for the Pillbugs of Pillville. Use the coins you've earned to keep Phil up to code. \n  Makes Phil tougher and less vulnerable to various level hazards.\n  Helps Phil punch through grass tiles and take down enemies with fewer punches.\n  Makes Phil faster! Swipe once for normal speed and a second time on a straightaway for a super sweet speed boost!\n  Well, there you have it\u2026 The future of Pillville, Princess Polycorn\u2019s freedom, Phil\u2019s very life and the health and safety of an entire colony of good hearted Pillbugs is in your hands. So we ask once more for you to look into your heart\u2026 Back this Kickstarter Campaign and help Phil The Pill save his world.\nOh\u2026 And get some super sweet Phil The Pill swag while you\u2019re at it.

Well, Nampa is a beet farming town about 15 miles west of Boise, Idaho. Like us, Nampa is what you\u2019d call small-ish. Don\u2019t let our location fool you though! Curious Media builds games and websites for companies like Disney, PBS Kids, Scholastic, Random House, Warner Bros and more! To experience our work, spend some time at curiousmedia.com. We are more than capable of bringing Phil The Pill through to the finish line!\nOur team is made up of some of the best illustrators, animators, designers and game developers west of the Mississippi.\nCreating Phil the Pill gives us the chance to build something completely original, and share it directly with you! Thanks for taking time to read about the project, and we hope you're as excited as we are to bring Phil the Pill to life.\n  iOS - August 2014\nIf you haven't noticed, Phil the Pill is well underway. We've finished about 80% of the app already! We just have a few features left to build, some animation sequences to create, some bugs here and there to work out and of course tweaking things based on our backers feedback! Once those tasks are complete and we finish building levels, we'll be ready to launch!\nAndroid - September 2014\nWe are actively testing Phil the Pill on Android, too! There are a few features that need to be built specifically for Android that we'd like to take an extra month to work out. We want to get it just right before deploying.\n   $75k - PC/Mac/Linux Support\nAt $75k we will work on a build for desktops with keyboard and controller support. The test build plays awesome on PC, but there are a lot of other things to incorporate for a polished desktop release.\n  $100k - Community Level Creation\nOur level builder is already pretty awesome, but at $100k we will polish it for mass community use and create a portal for you to share, play and challenge others with your creations! \n\n??? - Your Idea! \nCan you think of something awesome that we could do with the game? Tell us your ideas and maybe we'll add it as a stretch goal! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges with Kickstarting an iOS/Android app is distribution of the game itself. This will play heavily into how we decided to monetize the app initially, whether its Free to Play or a Premium app. Our thoughts are that we are going to need to initially release the app for free. Beyond that, we are really not sure how we should monetize the app for non-backers. We'd like to have an open conversation with our Kickstarter backers about this and try to come up with the preferred approach of the community. \n\nThere has been a lot of controversy lately regarding free to play games and understandably so. Many free to play games are designed around the monetization mechanic and pay walls rather than around what makes for the best possible game. We can assure you that this is not and will never be the intention of Phil the Pill. The indie game industry on mobile is in a state of disarray due to free to play models and we'd love to help push it back in the right direction before its too late. We think it will require a collaboration between players and developers because without the players the developers won't have anyone to make games for! Please help us determine the best way to distribute our game in a way that is good for the players and gives us the financial success we need to continue making more games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Curious Media\nFirst created \u00b7 7 backed\nCurious Media is an all around interactive company.

What if there was a place where you could easily find the UX talent you need to hire? What if there was a place you could go to learn all the skills you need to be hired as a UX professional?\nThrough our years of research, we\u2019ve discovered a significant need for a holistic UX design program for adult learners\u2014a program focused on both technical and interpersonal skills through project-based learning. This is why we\u2019re making a new kind of UX design school called Center Centre.\nWe\u2019ve already created the structure for the school. Now, it\u2019s time to build the course content.\nCreate content for 30 courses for a brand new design school in seven months. Ambitious? Yes! Doable? Definitely!\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll do it: We\u2019ll work through an intensive course design process for each of the 30 courses. Through this process we will determine each course\u2019s: \nlearning goals \nassessments \nlearning activities \nresources \nThe 30 courses will cover topics like:\ninteraction design \ncritique \nuser research\nleadership \nvisual design \nsketching \nmobile integration\nfacilitation \ncopywriting and content strategy \npresenting \nfront-end development \nstorytelling \nproject management\ninformation architecture\nCOURSE DESIGN BY THE NUMBERS\nCreate thirty courses? No problem. Here\u2019s what it takes...\nCrafting cohesive course content can be quite complicated. We estimate that we will define about: \n180 learning goals \n150 assessment tools \n30 course descriptions \n30 course syllabi \n60 resources \n1 set of guidelines for industry-grade workshops \n1 set of guidelines for team projects \n1 set of guidelines for individual mastery projects \n1 course design taxonomy\nYes, it\u2019s a lot of work. However, with your help, we can secure the resources we need to take this huge step toward making the UX design school a reality. \nWHY CREATE A NEW UX DESIGN SCHOOL?\nWe\u2019re connecting education and industry.\nYou might be asking yourself: Why do we need a UX design school? Doesn\u2019t this already exist someplace?\nIt\u2019s true, you can learn parts of user experience design through a variety of programs, both online and in person. However, it\u2019s challenging to piece together all of the required skills for a UX designer.\nWe\u2019re creating a holistic program that connects education and industry to bridge the skills gap between what students learn and what industry needs. Our long-term goal is to create a bricks-and-mortar school where students learn the comprehensive skills to earn meaningful jobs in the field of user experience design.\nWe want to create a school to produce industry-ready UX professionals\u2014otherwise known as \u201cunicorns.\u201d A UX unicorn is the ultimate generalists: a person who has the right mix of hard and soft skills.\nWe\u2019ve talked with hundreds of hiring managers, UX professionals, and potential students. We\u2019ve read over 60,000 pages of research. And we\u2019ve integrated what we\u2019ve learned into the structure of the school we\u2019re creating. We\u2019ve already accomplished a lot. In fact, we\u2019re already authorized by the State of Tennessee as a diploma granting postsecondary school! \nOur goal is to raise at least $21,700. Your pledge will allow Leslie to focus on the course design process. We\u2019ll hire additional editors and writers to make up our course creation team.\nYour contribution will help us change the future of UX education. \nTHERE\u2019S A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR UX PROFESSIONALS\nDirect quotes from our conversations with hiring managers.\nThere are 150,000 UX job listings in the U.S. alone. That\u2019s a lot of jobs. However, many job seekers don\u2019t have the skills needed to qualify for the open UX positions.\nThrough our research, we\u2019ve found that companies recognize the benefits of staffing their own permanent design teams. User experience designers are an integral part of the business solution. Companies need experienced designers with the right mix of hard, technical skills and soft, interpersonal skills. Companies need people who can jump in on any project at any time because they\u2019re trained in all aspects of user experience design.\nBE A PART OF THE STORY\nJoin our Superfriends!\nIt will take a lot of us working together to produce better qualified, industry-ready designers. In our organizations, we need knowledgeable and skilled professionals we can easily work with to create exceptional design for awesome experiences.\nWe\u2019ve talked with many of you at conferences, on Twitter, and even over dinner. After hearing your challenges, we\u2019re crafting a program to meet your needs. It\u2019s up to all of us to invest resources into the next generation of UX unicorns. It\u2019s up to all of us to work together\u2014both in education and industry\u2014to design our industry\u2019s education. Join us at the Unicorn Institute to create a new design school. Together, let\u2019s build Center Centre.\nAre you in?\nREWARDS\nWe are truly grateful to have Superfriends\u2014a team of smart and passionate advisors, consultants, and champions\u2014who continue to help shape how we build the school. It will take a team working together to build the right type of learning environment to move UX forward.

We\u2019ve created digital-only rewards that are easy, because there\u2019s no shipping or other fees. And we\u2019ve priced a reasonable international shipping fee for the notebooks and t-shirts. However, some countries require additional duty fees and tariffs. We\u2019re sorry but you\u2019ll be responsible for paying those.\nTIMELINE\nWe plan to craft the course content over seven months. Our plan: start in March and end in September. \nMarch: Begin course design. Research and choose the course design taxonomy. Start writing descriptions, learning goals, assessments, guidelines for individual mastery projects, guidelines for team projects, guidelines for industry-grade workshops, resources, and course syllabi for the first 8 courses for our first-year students.\nApril: Finish the first 8 first-year courses. \nMay: Start the last 8 courses for our first-year students. \nJune: Finish the last 8 first-year courses. Woohoo! The first year\u2019s courses are now done! Celebrate.\nJuly: Start the first 7 courses for our second-year students.\nAugust: Finish the first 7 second-year courses.\nSeptember: Start and finish the last 7 courses for our second-year students. (We can do this quickly here because several classes are internships, directed studies, and individual study which don\u2019t need as much work.)\nAnd Done: Super Woohoo! All the courses are designed and ready! Celebrate more!\nWe\u2019ll share major Center Centre course creation updates through Kickstarter. To follow our progress and research more closely, join the quest at the Unicorn Institute.

At least, not quite like this.\n\nSure, it\u2019s a bit scary to create a new educational program, but mostly it\u2019s exciting. We\u2019ve centered our approach to crafting course content in solid research and years of practice. Leslie earned her doctorate in Learning and Leadership, and Jared is a leader in the user experience field. Leslie and Jared are unicorns with decades of experience in both education and industry.\n\n\u278b It\u2019s a lot of work and, yep, we have an aggressive timeline.\n\nCrafting course content for 30 courses is ambitious, but we\u2019re up for the challenge. Our goal is to have the course content fully developed by Fall 2014. This timeframe might seem aggressive; however, it allows us to create and sustain the momentum needed to craft exceptional courses.\n\nWith our powers combined, we have the right skills to craft courses that meet the needs of both students and companies.\n\n\u278c It\u2019s not all rainbows and unicorns.\n\nThe quest to form a school is long and challenging. It\u2019s no easy feat to get state authorization to be a school\u2014especially when that school is vastly different from traditional approaches to education. Jared and Leslie spent 2 years researching what the ideal UX design education should be. Designing a school from the ground-up is hard but it will be worth it.\n\nLast May we submitted our application to be an authorized school. On January 30, 2014, the Board of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission of the State of Tennessee unanimously approved Center Centre as a post-secondary, diploma-granting school.\n\nWe believe our efforts will be worth all the sub-quests, side-quests, and fetch-quests because Center Centre is the way we can move our industry forward.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Your Kickstarter Pledge Did All This!", "update_content": "5 years ago, we started our journey with the Unicorn Institute Kickstarter project to create a UX Design curriculum for our new school, Center Centre.

Charms, Quivers & Parades is a winsome ode to wildlife, words, and the joy of discovery\u2014a project guaranteed to work its magic on children and grownups alike, and wholly deserving of an enthusiastic kickstart.\" \u20142Modern\nBackstory \nEver since I was a kid I've loved animals. Nature shows were the best. It could have been about grizzly bears in Alaska or lions in Africa, it didn't matter. Whatever Marty Stouffer's velvety voice was narrating over on Wild America, I was glued.\nWhen I wasn't stuck in front of the television, I was outside. I grew up in northwest New Jersey and there were acres of woods behind my house where I'd find all sorts of critters: deer, wild turkeys, bats, snakes (garter, water), raccoons, rabbits, foxes, possums, salamanders, hawks, spiders (daddy long legs, black widow, garden, wolf) fuzzy caterpillars and turkey vultures, to name just a handful.\nSafari Animal / Wildlife Cards like the ones my brother and I collected as kids\nThen there were the awesome Safari Animal/Wildlife Card packs that came in the mail. My brother and I would cover up the names at the top of the cards and quiz each other. In the top right corner of each card was a world map with a portion colored in where that particular animal inhabited. I'd get excited if there was a possibility I'd come across one of them in my adventures.\nOrigins \nNow let's fast forward to 2012. This is when I began to collect 19th and early 20th century printed matter in earnest. I'm always on the hunt for beautiful illustrations and etchings I can remix into my own art and design (specifically where copyrights have expired on images and they're in the public domain).\nAs I scanned more and more images into my laptop, I noticed I had inadvertently acquired a ton of animal illustrations. At some point in early 2013 the odd names of animal groups popped into my head so I started investigating all the ones I didn't know. They really were peculiar. An unkindness of ravens. A shiver of sharks. A troubling of goldfish. Haha! Wow!\nSo I began superimposing these words on images of the animals they referred to and a project was born:\nEvolution \nCrashes, Charms & Quivers started out as a poster series because I'm a designer and I love posters. I love them! (My first Kickstarter project was a poster series) But\u2014as I began to design more animal posters I realized not everyone shared my love of posters. This would make a great children's book, I said to myself. Why not make something to spark kids' interest in animals like those shows and animal cards did for me so many years ago?\nAnd so, like living beings in nature, my project began to mutate and evolve.\nA hardcover book. An e-book. Postcards. A poster. Wallpaper images for desktop computers, tablets and phones.\nSomething for everyone.\nThe Book\nCover, Book 1 (rendering, final dimensions may vary)\nCover, Book 2 (rendering, final dimensions may vary)\nE-Book (rendering)\nE-Book (rendering)\nBook spread (rendering, final designs may vary)\nThe Cards\nPostcards, 4\" x 6\" (final designs may vary)\n The Posters\nA Mob of Kangaroos (12\" x 18\")\n Featured Animal Groups\nNOTE: This list and the names of the groups are subject to change as I continue to validate everything. I wouldn't be surprised if I get corrected by people more knowledgable than I in zoology and related fields.\nAnimals Featured in Book One (Charms, Quivers & Parades):\nA shrewdness of apes / A troop of baboons / A battery of barracudas / A sleuth of bears / A sounder of (wild) boars / A kaleidoscope of butterflies / A quiver of cobras / An intrusion of cockroaches / A parade of elephants / A convocation of eagles / A charm of finches / A skulk of foxes / An army of frogs / A tower of giraffes / A troubling of goldfish / A bloat of hippopotamuses / A parcel of hogs / A cackle of hyenas / A smack of jellyfish / A mob of kangaroos / An exaltation of larks\nAnimals Featured in Book Two (Gulps, Prides & Zeals):\nA pride of lions / A plague of locusts / A scourge of mosquitos / A parliament of owls/An ostentation of peacocks / A rookery of penguins / A celebration of polar bears / A prickle of porcupines / An unkindness of ravens / A crash of rhinoceroses / A shiver of sharks / A walk of snails / A fever of stingrays / A gulp of swallows / A rafter of turkeys / A bale of turtles / A committee of vultures / A pack of wolves / A descent of woodpeckers / A zeal of zebras\nNot included in the children\u2019s book (but included in the posters and cards):\n- A murder of crows*\n*this was one of the first animal group names that inspired me to make this project, so I want to include it.

Fortunately I've thoroughly researched printers in the San Francisco area who can do what I need done (and for the right price).\n\nThe second biggest risk is having the printer I choose be available when the time comes to begin printing. Since I can't place an order with a printer until the project ends, there's the potential they might not be available when I need them.

But now, almost in my 30's I've finally seen the other side of the dark, rainy filled tunnel. Drawing encouraging doodles has helped me get through SO many things, and while on my doodle journey, I realized they helped others as well! \nWhile having a rough \"I'm not ENOUGH\" day one afternoon in early 2013 I created the VERY FIRST page of THIS book. After creating that page, I became ecstatically excited when I realized what my PURPOSE in life is!! It's to encourage as MANY PEOPLE as possible!! First stop? Tweens and teens! My goal is to write a super honest, encouraging, vibrant book with the intent to help teens feel less alone in this world. BUT a book that women [and men?!] in their 20's and beyond can enjoy as well! By using MY story, and LOTS OF colorful illustrations, my goal is that others realize they aren't alone on those dark, lowest of low days! This is my doodle dream!\nthe VERY FIRST page of my book!\nUltimately, my goal was to make THE BOOK I WISH I had when I was younger. Something easy to read and relate to, something that's visually stimulating! Something RAW and HONEST and not all sunshine and butterflies.\nFor the past 8 months, I have been immersed in doodle/writing land, and have created a book i've never seen in ANY bookstores. And one I WISH I had growing up! The book will be approx. 50 pages front and back, full color and FULL of silly, encouraging, very honest stories and illustrations!  Body Image, Depression, Eating Disorders, and Ambition are just SOME of the topics talked about in the book. \nI supported LOTS of cafes during the creation of this book!!\nWhat Will the Funding Go Towards?\nIn order to stay true to my original vision I decided to self-publish. At this point in the project the manuscript is just about complete and the rewards are just about ready to go. If my project is fully funded, I'll be able to print the first run of books, which goes out to you stellar folks, and hopefully into a few local shops! By helping self-publish my book, this encouragingly honest book can go into production immediately and start helping people right away!! yay! \n\nWhat if I EXCEED my goal?!\nGood golly! There will be MAJOR bounce dancing to celebrate! After I calm down, I will add some really wonderful extras to the rewards, be able to add more digital versions of the book, and have the ability to purchase more copies of the book than originally intended! THUS the retail price of the book could go down some, which would be stellar! \n\nRewards!!!\n\nOne of the illustrations from the book printed as an 8x10!\nFour of the SIX holiday cards in the greeting card packs.\nYou can see more of the card options in my shop. \nIn the process of painting YOUR potential paintings!\nHERE\u2019S HOW YOU CAN HELP SPREAD THE WORD:\n1.

When Paul writes something, you can tell it comes from years of on-the-ground experience, giving his work a realness that keeps readers reading.\" \u2014Sean Blanda, Managing Editor and Producer at 99u.com \nMy favourite thing about writing is connecting directly with my readers. No publisher, no marketing channels, just me and you. To that end, I dream of printing a gorgeous, limited edition, hardcover copy of my upcoming book, Everything I Know\u2013available ONLY to my Kickstarter backers.\nNon-backers can purchase Everything I Know (in digital format only, for a higher price) a few weeks after Kickstarter backers receive it. Once the limited-edition hardcover is sold out here, it's sold out for good.\nI\u2019ve spent more than 15 years running my own web design business and the last few years writing self-published books that have sold thousands of copies to date. The main lesson I\u2019ve learned, and that I share in the book, is that you can run your business your way.\nI've experimented, failed and spent the last two decades learning what it takes to do meaningful creative work as an entrepreneur. Now I want to share those lessons with you \u2013 and I know that you can\u2019t see the depth of your creative potential until you start experimenting with it.\nI also see a future where books create a more direct connection between authors and their readers \u2013 and I think a Kickstarter campaign is the best way to make that happen.\nIf I raise more than the campaign goal, I'll add automatic bonuses for every backer. The first bonus is a professionally recorded audio version of the book that includes the full text, plus additional stories, new ideas and even some interesting tangents. The more I raise, the more bonuses and extras I'll add. Each hardcover copy will also be numbered and signed.\nThis book truly represents everything I know.\n\"Paul speaks to the guts of creating. I say guts, not heart or soul, because what he's calling us to do is be gutsy. Be gorey. Be scared shitless. Fuck shit up. And keep creating.\" \u2014 Dyana Valentine\nABOUT THE BOOK\nEverything I Know is about creativity, fear and choosing your own path. Following someone else\u2019s plan for success won\u2019t guarantee your own, so why not align your work with what you value?\nWe don\u2019t know the consequences of our choices until those consequences become the present or the past. No one call tell you with any certainty that if you follow specific steps, you\u2019ll reach your destination (especially not this book). If someone promises that kind of certainty, run screaming in the other direction.\nThis isn\u2019t self-help and there aren\u2019t any tips, tricks or tactics. The Internet is full of e-courses, webinars and advice about how to achieve success. But none of them really explore how success can mean different things to different people. Or how your own values are what really matter, not what\u2019s important to some experts.\nI\u2019ve simply laid out what I\u2019ve learned and how I\u2019ve run my business, along with a few other examples of people who\u2019ve done the same. It\u2019s up to you to figure out your own path. Following what I\u2019ve done won\u2019t get you anywhere. Instead, the book simply provides ideas for you to consider and a new way of looking at your work. Most of all, it encourages you to question and find what you value most.\n\"I love your take on everything you do\u2014I'm a huge fan of your work.\" \u2014Erika Lyremark\nI\u2019m working with Cheri Hanson to edit this book, and she\u2019s the editing brain behind my last two titles. I\u2019m also working with Marc Johns for the cover illustration. Justine Musk is writing the foreword. Printing and order fulfillment are ready to go. All that's left is some more editing and digital + physical book production, once this project is successfully backed.\nWHAT IS THE MONEY FOR?\nIt will cover production costs\u2014printing hardcover books, shipping, order fulfillment, illustration, editing and hiring other professionals.\nThe physical book will be a work of art\u2014cloth bound, gorgeous paper stock, and embossed with original artwork. \nThe book will be completely self-published and promoted, and I'll do the design, print setup for the hardcover, and ebook development in all formats.\nEditing & copyediting: ~$3,000\nCover illustration: ~$1,000\nBook printing (for 500 copies): ~$8,000\nOrder fulfillment of book packaging + shipping: ~$8,000\nSTRETCH GOAL, Audio version: ~$2,000\n\u201cReading your work is like taking a cold shower, in a waterfall.\u201d @meredithtuqan\nWHO AM I\nI'm Paul Jarvis and I've always chosen my own adventures in work and life. I've founded several start-ups, toured the US and Canada in bands, written two self-published books that have sold over 6,500 copies and worked as a freelance web designer for over 15 years.\nMy writing appears in Fast Company, Fast Company again 99u, 99u again, The Next Web, Medium and many other publications. Thousands of people read my work every day, including Ashton Kutcher. \nI've worked with Fortune 500 companies, best-selling authors and the world's biggest entrepreneurs.

I've got a solid draft, though, and have a brilliant editor, Cheri Hanson, who's working with me to polish it into a shine. I also have an awesome illustrator, Marc Johns, lined up to create the cover (and more pages if the funding is surpassed). Every part of the process is set up and ready to go once the book is copyedited. \nWriting my last two books taught me what it takes to complete big publishing projects. I've also spent the last 15 years delivering exactly what I say I'll deliver to my clients.\n\nAnother big risk, as I see it, is that I die before publication, which I obviously hope won't happen. I promise I won't do anything too risky until the book is done (and probably not even after that).

Created to transcend transportation toys and focus on practical movement we've built a totally new product that celebrates personal and intuitive transport. Join us in the new mobility revolution! \nAbout Inventist and the Inventor\nInventist is based in Camas, WA lead by founder, president and inventor, Shane Chen. A true inventor and tinkerer since he was young, Chen received his collegiate degree in agricultural meteorology from Beijing Agricultural University. \nIn 1986 his passion for inventing guided him to relocate to the U.S. Arriving in America with only $200 in his pocket, Chen's entrepreneurial spirit led him to start his own company, CID (Chen Instrument Design) http://cid-inc.com/ dedicated to making instruments for agricultural research. \nStill, Chen had more ideas about scooters, skates and flying machines. So in 2003 Chen founded Inventist, Inc. which became successful enough that he sold his plant research device company in 2010. Chen was finally free to follow his imagination blending his unique ability to invent with his love of sports and fitness. In his free time Chen speed skates, windsurfs, snowboards, scuba dives, swims, roller blades, Swerver Skates, and Aquaskips. \nTo view our product portfolio please visit: www.Inventist.com. \nTo visit our Facebook page please visit: www.Facebook.com/InventistInc\nComputer aided design of the Hovertrax while in development.\nHovertrax Project Objective\nThe objective of the Hovertrax project is to introduce the future of powerful and portable transportation complemented by a sleek design. \nInventist is no stranger to creating high-tech portable transport devices! For all Inventist's products, we fuse unique design with advanced technology and engineering to deliver ground breaking and fun experiences. We debuted the one wheeled, Solowheel last year. Fresh off the heels of our success with the Solowheel, Chen decided to make a product that provided immediate enjoyment for all ages.\nAfter several months of intense research and development, Shane Chen invented the Hovertrax. The Hovertrax is a pioneering example of man meeting machine in everyday life. Built with instinctive controls and large foot platforms so riders can easily stand on the Hovertrax and get moving. The future of transportation is just a step ahead!\nThe Hovertrax is a product people can use daily both indoors and out. Weighing only 9lbs, the Hovertrax can easily be stored or carried in a backpack or handbag.  Recharge the battery at home or while out on the go, by easily plugging the Hovertrax into a wall outlet for one hour.\nA 3D rendering of the Hovertrax.\nHow Does it Work?\nThe tough yet super light, ultra chic Hovertrax responds to your foot movement accelerating forward, backward and left and right. The Hovertrax has two halves that tilt independently of each other. Each wheel has its own motor, each equipped with a gyro sensor and accelerometer. \nThe Hovertrax is durable, eco-friendly, hands-free and responsive. Join us in the movement! \nHovertrax prototype!\nTechnical Specifications\nSpeed: 6 MPH (10 KPH)\nTravel range: 4 miles (6.5Km)\nCharge time: 1 hour\nGyrosensors\nAccelerometers\nRegenerative braking \nZero emissions\nTotal weight: 9lbs (4Kg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\nIs the Hovertrax motor powerful? The Hovertrax shown in the photos is a prototype with 5\" hub motor wheels from another product. The actual Hovertrax will have slightly larger hub motor wheels and will be 3 times more powerful. The final product will look identical to the prototype featured, with the addition of larger hub motor wheels. \nIs it really as simple as leaning your feet? Totally! By pressing your toes slightly downward the Hovertrax will move forward. Pressing the heels backwards will move the Hovertrax in reverse. Move them separately to turn or even spin!\nHow will the quality be controlled? Of course, quality control is especially important because the Hovertrax carries the rider. To ensure the highest caliber production the Hovertrax will be produced in our Washington state headquarters. We will also put the Hovertrax through a variety of safety tests.\nHow will the Kickstarter funds be used? Funds will be used for production: purchasing machines, molds, product parts such as motor, battery, wheels, gyro sensors and product testing measures.\nIs the Hovertrax safe? The Hovertrax has auto-balancing capabilities, meaning it will automatically catch the rider. Without any handlebars in the way, the rider can step off at any time. As with any wheeled device, we encourage riders to wear protective gear at all times. Get on, explore and start having fun. The future is just a step ahead!\nFeaturing intuitive foot platform controls.\nHas a patent been filed? Yes.We filed a utility and design patent for the Hovertrax. \nCan I fit the Hovertrax in my DeLoreaon? Yes, absolutely. Send us photos please!\nIs the Hovertrax for fun or purely for transport? Built strong and lightweight, the Hovertrax is used for both fun and transport. Stand out among bulky Segways, e-bikes, and traditional skateboards and bicycles. You can use the Hovertrax at the park or mall with friends or use it to get around school, a warehouse, a restaurant, airport, hotel or your neighborhood. The Hovertrax is both fun and practical!

I have never left home without one since its inception because it is so useful!\nThe HankyBook (short for handkerchief book) has a BOOK-form. It has 8 super soft organic cotton fabric \"pages\" and an attractive cover that are all sewn together on an edge. The book-like form allows you to have easy access to a new clean page for each use and the protective cover keeps you from getting your hands, pocket or bag dirty until machine washing.\nThe HankyBook eliminates tissue clutter (and endless visits to the trash can) and expenses ($$$) as well as prevents the painful sore nose you get from using harsh tissues (like when you're sick or during allergy season). The super soft fabric and on-the-go convenience also makes them a GREAT item for keeping baby faces clean and cute while out and about. It is the perfect travel companion.\nWith your support we can pay the initial start-up costs for mass production which will allow the HankyBook to be made affordably and ethically. \nTHE BENEFITS OF A HANKYBOOK:\nEasy to use. A clean surface every time.\nSuper soft pages prevent nose irritation when sick or during allergy season.\nPocket & Travel-friendly: Fits easily in a pocket and is there when you need it. Cover keeps your pocket clean.\nNo tissue clutter and waste.\n$$$ Saving. No need to buy more tissues!\nCertified Organic fabric and Made in the USA\n\nWHAT CAN A HANKYBOOK BE USED FOR?:\nExercise, Bike & Yoga companion. (when you're sweating and leaking more than usual)\nCold weather climates and sports. (skiing, snowboarding, etc)\nBaby clean up. (Babies drool and slobber CONSTANTLY which leads to a bag full of used tissues or else you're visiting the trash can every other second. Great $ saver and the baby will appreciate the soft fabric.)\nCamping & Hiking. (when you need to pack light and tread lighter)\nCleaning your glasses and camera lenses.\nMake-up touch-up.\nTears for touching moments.\nRunny nose during allergy and Flu season.\nyou get the picture, anything!\nHankyBook cover patterns available.\nSoft and Absorbent Organic Cotton Fabric (no more red nose! ...OUCH!)\nExample Single and 3-Set for Regular users and for Baby Care. A great gift!\nTissues, you ain't got NOTHIN' on the HankyBook!\nModern and Elegant Cover Patterns. Bike Pattern\nSustainability:\nAround the 1930's our society succumbed to clever Kleenex ad campaigns and moved away from the handkerchief without realizing the devastating effect disposable tissues would have on the planet. Today, if every household in the United States replaced just one box of virgin fiber facial tissues with HankyBooks, it could save 163,000 trees (source: NRDC.com)! The HankyBook revolutionizes the classic handkerchief to help us make the transition today. \nRewards:\nAmerican Apparrel HankyBook T-shirt Design. Baby Blue, Green or Brown.\nProduction Plan:\nWe have identified a screen printer and die cutter and have completed a small sample run with these suppliers. We will use the Kickstarter money for tooling costs and the large startup costs of mass screen printing production. We anticipate it will take about 6 weeks to go from start of production to delivery. We will always keep you updated in the case of changes to the schedule.\nHi! More about Us:\nWe are a husband and wife team (Arto & Leslie) living in sunny San Diego, CA. We share a passion for the environment and treading lightly on the Earth which is what brought us together. We dig gardening, Permaculture, farmers markets, camping, film and creative projects. Arto is a film editor and Leslie designs SCUBA dive lights. We have been developing the HankyBook together and see a big future for our baby. Hope you agree!

When I turn 40, I'll have a 1-hour video that encapsulates my 30s.  If I live to see 80 years of age, I'll have a 5-hour video that summarizes 50 years of my life.\nEach second has a story. \nI gave a TED talk on this project at TED 2012! Photo Credit: James Duncan Davidson\nI spent a couple of years saving enough money to afford taking a frugal year off from work.  I wanted to spend it doing all the important things I never had time for\u2026 travel, family, and my own personal creative projects.\nThis is 1 Second Everyday\u2026 me at age 30 (original):\nThis particular project has had such a profoundly positive impact on my life that I think everyone could benefit immensely from doing it too.  It's easy to do\u2014the process requires very little time or effort, but now I\u2019m trying to make it even easier, so everyone everywhere can experience this exciting project.  In collaboration with the extremely talented developers at Alchemy50 here in Brooklyn, I've spent the past few months developing an App that will make it extraordinarily easy for anyone to do too.\nhome screen\nThis project initially started as just a fun way to chronicle my year off, but it quickly turned into something more important.\nRecording one second every day suddenly allowed me to easily reflect back on my life\u2014to look back at my day-to-day decisions.  I started re-evaluating how I approached each day.  Quickly, I was able to see when a couple of days would go by when I hadn't done anything remotely interesting or outside my typical routine.\nWe have a tendency to pull cameras out when we're doing something fun or interesting, but we probably don\u2019t think to record when we're just sitting at home watching TV.  Recording a moment daily started encouraging me to wake up and seize each day.  \nQuick interview with CNN regarding 1SE:\nClick for video interview. [2 minutes long]\nI don't know about you, but I've always felt that I have a pretty bad memory.  If you asked me about a particular year\u2014say, 2007\u2014I really couldn't go into detail about it.  Sure I remember where I lived and where I worked.  I could probably find some photos to remember a couple of notable events by, but what about all the days in between?\nWhat did I do then?\nJust because we didn't do anything world-shaking one day, doesn't mean we should forget that day ever happened.  Perhaps use your less-enthralling days to inspire you to do something cool tomorrow.  Instead of letting the days, months, & years blend together into a hazy mush, make each day have meaning!  This project continues to provide me with priceless data on how I'm living my life, and it can do that for you, too.\nReliving the past month in 30 seconds\u2014or a year in 6 minutes\u2014provides a treasured perspective on life.  It holds me accountable for making every day count.\niPhone 5 Ready!\nSome App Features\nThe App accesses the videos in your camera roll, so you can start recording 1 Second Everyday RIGHT NOW!!

The 1SE App will use any videos in your camera roll.  But if you want to record your second directly from the App, you can!\nOptimized for iPhone 5 users.\nOnce you've selected a day's second, you can remove the original video from your camera roll.  The App copies the moment and keeps it within the App itself.\nYour seconds are privately held on your phone.  You never have to share this with anyone if you don't want to.  The primary purpose of this App is to help you remember your own life.  Sharing is optional.\nAbout the Developers\nAlchemy50 is an application design & development studio in Brooklyn.  Their roots are in financial software, but they broke out of their corporate shackles three years ago to pursue more freedom in the types of projects that they can apply their talents to.  They've been fantastic to work with, and have been a closer partner with me on this project than I ever would have imagined. We've had hours of conversations debating the finer points of the project itself as an exercise, and the app design is a great reflection of the soul of the project as a result of that.\nAdditional thoughts\nDigital Cameras have made it easy to capture our lives, so most people are over doing it. And just because we can, doesn't mean we should. The limitations of rolls of film used to force us to prioritize what was worth capturing & what wasn't. I believe we should record less, & live more. Ruthlessly record only what's most important.\nSure people have been doing projects like these with photographs for years, but movement & audio are crucial to remembering a moment.  A photo can't capture my dad's voice\u2026 his laugh\u2026 or the way my mom's expression changes when I surprise her.\nThis project has produced an interesting side-effect: it encourages me to do at least one interesting thing every day.\nSend your compilations directly to social networks.\nI rarely capture the best moment of a day.  A lot of the seconds you see are actually from before or after a moment I want to remember, but seeing the moment I did capture still brings me back.  Trying to record the perfect second puts too much pressure on myself, and becomes a chore.  Wouldn't it be better to fully live an experience, than risk missing it while trying to capture it?\nWriting things down on a journal just doesn't generate the same results as actually having an audible/visual trigger to jolt your memory.\nI personally don't add filters, and I almost entirely shoot in first person perspective because I want to remember things exactly as I saw them with my own eyes.\nI like to think of each second as a \"Save Point,\" as if my past was a really complex video game.  Each \u201csave\u201d allows me to return to where I was and how I felt, and to connect the dots to remember un-captured events that transpired between any 2 recorded seconds.\nMy Story\nFebruary 20th, 1981 \nI am born in Peru. \n1987 \nMy family moves to New Jersey.\n1996-1999 \nI spend my high school years making 3D computer animated short films for fun.  At this time I begin to come into the fullness of my geekdom and movie buff-ness, and develop a passion for story telling, so short animated films become my way of exorcising those creative demons.\n2000-2004 \nI move to Brooklyn and enter Pratt Institute of Art and Design as a Computer Animation major.  My time is spent in being mesmerized by extraordinarily talented artists and I am immersed in non-stop inspiration.  While other animation majors students focus on courses in that field, I can't help but explore classes in a spectrum of artistic disciplines, including film, graphic design, and photography.  By the time I conclude my last class, I\u2019ve realized a most important lesson: all knowledge is connected.\n2004-2006\nI start working in advertising.\n2007\nI discover\u2014and become addicted to\u2014TED Talks.  Like many people who are drawn into the world of TED Talks, it becomes a life goal for me to be worthy of that stage someday.  To have an Idea Worth Spreading.\n2008\nI spend my rare free time working on personal creative projects and teaching classes at schools like Pratt & NYU.  One of these projects is directing a music video composed of 45,000 photographs.  The video ends up on the front page of Digg, Gizmodo, and Wired, and is staff-picked by Vimeo.  This is an exciting, exhausting time for me, but I\u2019m not in a situation that allows me to dedicate myself fully to this kind of work.\n2009\nI'm still in advertising\u2026 constantly working long nights and long weekends. I find myself increasingly dissatisfied creatively.  My social life is nonexistent, and don't get to spend enough time with my family.\nAnother 100+ hour work week.\nOctober 2009\nI watch a TED talk by Stefan Sagmeister\u2014The Power of Time Off.  My life is changed forever.  In his talk, Sagmeister (also a Pratt alumni) explains how his creativity has benefitted from shutting down his studio every seven years and taking a year off from work.  I'm instantly inspired.  I immediately start crunching numbers and looking at my savings.  I figure out how much I will have to save in order to take a frugal year off from work, and start saving saving saving.\nFeb 20th, 2011\nI turn 30 years old! I quit my job!  I start a year off from work so I can do all those things I\u2019ve never had time for, like travel, spend time with my family, and focus time on my own personal creative ideas.\nThe first of these ideas is a project I call \"1 Second Everyday.\"  The concept is simple: every day I record one second of video\u2014something that will help me remember that day.  I then begin chronologically compiling these tiny slices of my life into a single, continuous video.\nMarch 2011\nThe 1 Second Everyday idea begins as a fun way for me to chronicle my year off, but it quickly grows into something more important.  It allows me to easily reflect on my life and to look back at my decisions.  I start re-evaluating how I approached each day.\nAfter only a few weeks of compiling clips, I\u2019m able to look at the video and identify instances when several days go by without anything remotely interesting or outside my typical routine occurring.  It starts encouraging me to wake up & seize the day.\nI decide to continue doing this for the rest of my life.\nMarch 27th & 28th, 2011\nI forget to record a second. It torments me, but I learn a valuable lesson: when you're not doing anything interesting, it doesn't occur to you to capture the moment.\nApril 15rd, 2011\nA once in a lifetime opportunity pops up on my Facebook feed.  TED decides to hold the first ever TED talk auditions. I have doubts about anything in my life being worthy of the TED stage, but I\u2019m plagued by the thought that if I don\u2019t apply, I\u2019ll regret it for the rest of my life.\nApril 23rd, 2011\nIt occurs to me that my 1 Second Everyday project might be an \"Idea Worth Spreading.\"\nApril 25th, 2011 \n(thank to the 1SE project, I now know exact dates for these notable moments)\nI post my one-minute audition video to TED with just minutes to spare before the deadline.\nMay 6th, 2011\nA dream comes true, and my life changes forever.  I receive an e-mail from TED that out of hundreds of submissions, I'm one of 17 (including Reggie Watts!) to be chosen to audition live on stage at a special TED event in New York!  \nMay 24th, 2011\nTED talk day. Many fly in from around the world to audition, but I only have to take the subway.  I've never been more nervous.  Worst-case scenario\u2026 I tell myself to just speak from the heart.  I walk off stage convinced that I was horrible.  I unintentionally close off my talk by saying that I'd like to build an App that would make this easy for anyone to do.  Ultimately, I\u2019m happy just to have done my best and pleased that I now have a photo of me with a TED sign behind me. I\u2019m convinced it'll be my last Facebook profile photo ever.\nPhoto Credit: James Duncan Davidson\nJune 6th, 2011\nI fulfill a lifelong dream to drive around the USA to the West Coast, return through Canada\u2026 and do it slowly.  My friend Schoneck and I head off, and will not return to New York until 95 days later.\nJune 15th, 2011\nI get a phone call from TED, asking if I'd like to come speak at TED2012. I freak out!  Somehow, I\u2019m able to keep it a secret for the rest of the year.\nOctober 26th, 2011\nA catastrophic event hits my family.  I don't forget to record a second every day.  It devastates me.  Learn a valuable lesson, when you're going through horrible times, it doesn't occur to you to capture the moment\u2026 but my 1SE project forces me too.  \nDecember 24th, 2011\nAfter 2 months in the hospital, my sister-in-law returns home in time for Christmas.  In the months that follow, I'm grateful that I kept recording 1SE.  Reflecting on the bad times allows me to better appreciate the good times.  Before 1SE, this wasn't easy to do.\nJanuary 11th, 2012\nThe secret is out.  TED announces the speaker program for TED 2012. Now I can tell my friends and don\u2019t have to freak out alone!\nJanuary 25th, 2012\nFinally, after a long absence, I fly back to Peru to spend time with family.\nFebruary 20th, 2012\nI turn 31. It's a wrap for the first year of my lifelong 1SE project.\nFebruary 27th, 2012\nThe TED conference begins & I'm utterly overwhelmed in every conceivable level.  I meet some personal heroes of mine included Bill Nye (the science guy).  I mention to him how nervous I am about speaking at the end of the week.  He replies, \"if you weren't nervous, it wouldn't be worth doing\".\nMarch 2nd, 2012\nOne of the best weeks of my life comes to a close as the TED conference concludes, and I give my TED talk. \nTED 2012: Full Spectrum.

I did it for a full year before I started using my own experience to design an App that would make it extraordinarily easy for anyone to do the same with their own life.\n\nWe've been hard at work on this App for several months\u2014making sure all the technical hurdles were out of the way before we launched this Kickstarter campaign, so that we could guarantee prompt delivery of the App & show it off in action.\n\nAt this point 80 - 85% of the base functionality is in the App. We still need to add that last 15 - 20%, which consist mainly of social integrations and the overlay of text on exported videos. Once that stuff is roughed in, we have to go back and polish everything in the app\u2026 the interactions, animations, layouts (so they match our designs), etc. \n\nFinally we'll put it through as rigorous a testing period as we can, trying to squash any remaining bugs before we submit to the Apple App Store. \n\nThe biggest challenges we've faced have been with the manipulation of video itself - mainly adding/overlaying text to the video. This has taken a lot of engineering discovery time, and thus far has not been solved when exporting videos. We've run into other strange things that have forced us to change course from the initial plans - a good example of this is that we initially thought we'd be able to use the native camera, but apparently it violates the Apple ToS to have an app launch the camera in Landscape mode, so we ended up having to build our own camera module. Although we believe this will work in our favor long term.\n\nA potential risk to our App delivery date (before 2013) could be the App Store approval process.

That's pretty dang cool.***\nAnd there's a little more in it for you too - if we hit $175K, we'll give every backer at the $59 pledge level and above a free Earthquake ATOM for your set (it's a vibrating motor/rumble-pack ATOM). \nFeatured In: \nMedia love ATOMS - you will too!\nATOMS give kids of any age the ability to make their toys DO things. And not just new toys \u2013 ATOMS were built to work with the stuff kids already have, like LEGOs, costumes, stuffed animals, Barbies and action figures. ATOMS don\u2019t require any electronics skills or programming experience \u2013 or supervision from a parent with an engineering degree. In fact, because of the tiny electronics built into each one, kids can make all sorts of cool stuff within 5 minutes of taking ATOMS out of the box.\nATOMS are powerful enough to challenge the curiosity and simple enough to maintain the magic of creating things for kids, big and small.\nThis crane can move up and down, turn, slow down all because of the built-in accelerometer.\nATOMS: Introductory Sets\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of the toys we\u2019re introducing at launch, with your help: \nMonster Construction Set: So you have a pet monster? But it just lays there? That's a pretty boring pet. This kit allows you to build and personalize creatures with personalities that are afraid of the light, love to hide in the dark, love to scare your mother. \nThe monster construction set can also be used to build tanks that go faster when the lights are brighter, or turn to the right when it gets dark.\nMagic Wand Set: What good is a magic wand that doesn\u2019t do anything? Not much good, really. Certainly can\u2019t compete in a wizard\u2019s duel. This kit allows you to build an ATOMS magic wand that can turn on your nightlight, move a toy, or close a door with a shake of the wand. This set also includes an exploding brick - pretty cool when you want to blow up your LEGO house just as your sister leans in for a closer look. \nThe flash on Fiona's phone triggers the exploding ATOM to bust apart the LEGO house. Yep, prank your sister!\niOS Control Set: The 18-room, 4-car garage Italian villa you just built with your LEGOs would be a lot cooler if those garage doors would open, cars could drive out, and the third floor would shake when Henry the Ghost haunts it. This kit allows you to control your ATOMS modules with an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that has Bluetooth 4.0. \nMichael plays with the iOS kit - and check out that snazzy t-shirt! Yep backers, this is what your t-shirt will look like too.\nBonus Rewards: Unlocked as We Reach The Following \"Stretch Goals\" \n$100K - UNLOCKED!  \"ATOMS on Kickstarter\" Stickers: mailed to your US address or your US-based friend RIGHT NOW. We'll also put \"I helped launch ATOMS\" stickers in every Kickstarter ATOMS set when we ship the product. \n$110K - UNLOCKED! The $29 Prankster Set: The kids quickly taught us that playing pranks is a sweet use case for ATOMS. This brand new bonus set will include an exploding brick, a battery pack, and a light sensor trigger. With a $29 price point, the Prankster Set should help us reach a larger audience and get to the next awesome Bonus Reward faster! The Prankster Set will be available as a $20 upgrade to any pledge level of $187 or higher (the combo sets). \n$125K - UNLOCKED! Add Extra ATOMS to Your Set: Up your pledge by the specified amount at any \"Set\" backer lever (Monster Set or above), and add extra ATOMS to your set. At this level, we will unlock the LED ATOM ($10), the Light Sensor ATOM ($10), the Flip-Flop ATOM ($10), and the Motor ATOM ($16).  \n$150K - UNLOCKED! Three New ATOMS Chosen by our backers, these are the three ATOMS that won the most votes: Blue ATOM: Motion Sensor ($15), Red ATOM: Not Gate ($10), Green ATOM: Tri-Color LED ($15)\n$175K - We'll make ATOMS Waterproof, and give every backer at $59 pledge and above, a free Earthquake ATOM (vibrating motor/rumble-pack ATOM).\nWhat's ATOMS University? \nWe're making toys that help kids make stuff that does stuff. It occurred to us that it would be pretty cool for a kid to see how those toys are themselves made - we know the kids in our play groups thought it was. So, we know our backers will follow along here on Kickstarter, but we hope to encourage our younger fans to follow along too. We'll be doing live Q&As on Saturday mornings throughout the campaign to give ATOMS fans as much insight as possible into the process. We'll also regularly update here and on our social networks. We want kids to understand how stuff gets made and we're committed to giving them as much information as possible. That is ATOMS University. \nATOMS University member works with Eric Budd, founding team member, to build a LEGO garage with a door that opens - using ATOMS.\nHow ATOMS Work\nWe're building 13 unique modules to be included in our first ATOMS sets. They are: motor, light sensor, sound module, knob module, battery brick, splitter, IR \"laser,\" IR target, LED, Flip Flop, accelerometer, exploding brick, and iOS control brick (yep, we\u2019re using Bluetooth 4.0). With these first 13 modules, kids can make monsters that move, wands that turn on lights, castles that blow up, and stuff we haven't even thought of yet. And you Mom and Dad, can prank your friends and each other - or the kids, that's fun too.\nThe first 13 ATOMS.\nExample 1: Driving a motor and sound from a sensor.\nThis creation will sense movement and gravity. As the signal gets stronger, it will run the motor faster and play back a user-recorded sound louder.\n1. Sensing ATOMS have light up arrows to show the signal what they are sensing coming out of the module. These arrows blink faster when the signal is stronger. \n2. Loop your signal through the battery module to power any ATOMS connected to that signal.\n3. Output ATOMS have light up \"boots\" to show where the signal comes in. Connect your signal here, and it will drive the Output ATOMS stronger as the signal strength increases.\nExample 2: Controlling ATOMS from an iOS device.\nThis creation is controlled remotely from a Bluetooth 4 compatible iOS device. It allows the user to control the direction and speed of the two motors from their iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\n1. Run the free ATOMS App.\n2. Your iOS device communicates wirelessly with the ATOMS Bluetooth 4 module, sending your commands from your iOS device to your ATOMS creation.\n3. Use the ATOMS Bluetooth 4 module to control any ATOMS. Just like all output ATOMS, the \"boots\" blink faster and the output is driven faster as the signal strength increases.\nBig Kids, Little Kids: Our World Class Team\nThe ATOMS team now includes 25 adults with related experience, and over 40 kids who believe the world needs ATOMS.\nMichael Rosenblatt loved to build stuff. So he went to MIT to build toys and robots, and then on to Apple to build iPods and iPhones. He thought that all kids that want to build stuff like he did should have the chance to do it in an easy and accessible way, so he came up with the idea for ATOMS, back in 2009. \nCreator Michael Rosenblatt hopes to help kids develop problem solving skills that will serve them well throughout their lives. And have some fun along the way!\nWhen he decided to build ATOMS, and the Seamless Toy Company, he turned to the awesomely amazing entrepreneur community in Boulder, CO. That community helped him bring together \u2013 in a little under three weeks \u2013 a team of 25+ people with backgrounds in product design and development, manufacturing, marketing, PR, operations, and pretty much anything else he needed. And oh yeah, they were (are) all PUMPED to be working on something so cool that they did it in their \u201cfree\u201d time. \nAlong with Michael, these are the founding team members building ATOMS (find out more about them in the FAQ): David Allen, Rob Aimi, Eric Budd, Shannon McCoy, Gabrielle Fuqua, and Fiona A. We also have some awesome vendor love   from Boulder Engineering Studio, Blake St. Design, VideoGoGo, and INK. \nProject Status\nWe\u2019ve gotten a lot done so far! The first 13 prototypes are up and running, and we\u2019ve already begun working with contract manufacturers to scale production. We look forward to working with the Kickstarter community closely and transparently as we go from prototypes to a polished, packaged product.\nThe first ATOMS prototypes.\nWe are already finding lots of ways to improve ATOMS as we test our prototypes and run weekly play groups with kids in the Boulder community. Here is where we will document all the issues/improvements that we catch, including feedback from the Kickstarter community that will be addressed in the production ATOMS products: \nAtoms Engineering Change List: \n[motor module] Motor output shaft should be in perpendicular axis to connectors (to avoid collision with where you would want to put wheels). \n[record-playback module] Amplifier circuit needs to be louder.\n[explode module] Make latch mechanism super reliable\u2026test thoroughly.\n[all modules] LED's that indicate I/O and signal intensity have to be brighter, and closer to transparent icon.\n[record-playback module] Use red button for record on record-playback module. \n[wires] Use much skinnier, slimmer, more flexible wires, for connections between modules, and in bright colors if possible.\n[record-playback module] Volume should vary proportional to input signal.\n[ir-transmitter] Add a red LED to the front of the IR module to visibly show when transmitting.\nOur first products \u2013 including the ones you snap up as part of this campaign \u2013 will ship in June 2013. We are committed to building a vast library of new ATOMS components in 2013 and beyond, so drop us a line if you have an idea for one you\u2019d like us to tackle. \nManufacturing and Production Plan\nThere are a lot of moving parts involved in bringing a product like this to market, both literally and figuratively. Even with the best efforts given to planning, the biggest risk is that you still don't know what you don't know. Therefore, we have designed a gate-phased production plan, intended to expose technical and production issues early. This will give us plenty of time to make changes, so we can deliver top quality products on time or ahead of schedule. Here's our plan (through Jan below - more in the FAQ): \nOctober 2012: Concept Validation Prototypes\nThese are the prototypes you see here on our Kickstarter page in the photographs and video. They are 3D printed, and have hand-assembled circuit boards made with mostly off-the-shelf parts. The goal here was to verify all the technology can work - especially the Bluetooth 4 module, since that is the most complicated module from a software perspective. \nNovember and December 2012: Play Groups with Prototypes\nStarting early November, we have been running play groups with the ATOMS prototypes, and we have about 40 kids ages 8-12 working with us to see how easy ATOMS are to use, what fails, what can be improved, and what features have been overlooked. By the end of this phase we will have over 500 kid-hours on ATOMS, and a clear idea of the improvements needed for the final product.\nJanuary: Manufacturing Engineering\nIn January, we will take all the learnings from the prototype and play group phases, and feedback from the Kickstarter community, and we will re-engineer the ATOMS sets for manufacturability, reliability and include the product improvements we've added to our \"Change List.\" \nDesigned to Create\nIt\u2019s incredibly empowering to create something. But kids don't have a lot of options today to make things that do things. We see this as a major hole in the market. And we want to fill it with great stuff \u2013 but we aren\u2019t doing so to then turn around and sell our company to the highest bidder. The Seamless Toy Company will build a massive library of ATOMS toys serving as tools that will scale as new technologies become available, and grow with the kids using them. We want to create toys that empower big kids and little ones, and in the end inspire kids to once again pursue education and careers in the STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and math.\nFiona and Michael work on an ATOMS creation.\nWe see the educational value of ATOMS as tools that can, at a reasonable price with a low barrier for entry, give children skills that will follow them for the rest of their lives. Building a magic wand that can turn on a light or a monster that knows to chase your little sister \u2013 rather than just playing with a toy someone else built \u2013 gives children an understanding of how to solve problems. We hope to change the world by giving kids the tools to become problem solvers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile our design goal is to make ATOMS as simple, usable, and intuitive as possible, the challenges associated with making this kind of integrated electronics product are significant. Here are the challenges we anticipate facing, and our strategy for addressing each of them.\n\nProduct Integration Challenges\nGoing from prototypes to working shippable products is like going from little league to the majors in 6 months. That's why we have built a team with proven track records in doing just this - uh, the product development, none of us are all that great at baseball. Michael has managed large scale product development at Apple (traveling to Asia to work with manufacturers 6-8 times a year), Eric has managed software development for high-volume hard drives at Seagate, John and Dan have worked on many challenging integration projects that have manufactured domestically, David has shipped iOS Apps for startups, and used to blow things up at Los Alamos Labs (this latter experience has not yet proved relevant, but we're still early stage).\n\nAll that experience aside, none of this is easy, and the biggest challenges are the ones you don't see coming. We are not making one product, we are making 13. So to back up the team experience, we are enlisting a contract manufacturer that has done all this before also - one that is great at managing system scale co-development. We currently have two potential manufacturing partners that meet this criteria, with whom we have been working with on costing, and we'll plan to award the business in January after the close of our Kickstarter campaign. \n\nSourcing Challenges\nTo make the best possible ATOMS products, we are going to need a few custom parts - most prominently, the connectors and the wires between modules. We can definitely make a good product with off-the-shelf parts, but that's not what we are aiming for - we are here to make a GREAT product. As a startup, this means calling up the companies that can make these custom parts, and selling them on the vision and the potential for a high-volume future that merits the initial investment of custom tooling. We think we have a good chance at this (the team has procured custom components in previous projects), and every pledge counts towards this goal - the more units we sell, the less we'll have to beg for favors with suppliers. \n\nReliability Challenges \nEngineering anything that has to be kid-tough is a challenge, and ATOMS will have state-of-the-art precision electronics embedded in each module. Further, we are setting an even high bar than \"living room safe\" - we want ATOMS to be durable enough and water resistant enough for outdoor play. Michael helped design the reliability test requirements for Apple's iPod product line, and program managed testing for one of the highest volume electronics products the world has ever seen (resulting in some of the industry's lowest field failure rates for any product). Additionally, members of the team have experience working on underwater diving electronics, medical devices, utility scale solar power plants, enterprise class hard drives, and military robotics.\n\nWe will implement an extensive reliability and safety testing program in collaboration with our contract manufacturer, and will destructively test over 60 of each component with sampling at each stage of the production development process.\n\nFCC and Regulatory Challenges\nBringing a wireless product to market can face a number of expensive and time consuming regulatory hurdles, and the specifics of these hurdles can vary by region and country. Michael knows all about this, as he was heavily involved in bringing the first iPod Touch to market during his tenure at Apple. To minimize risk here, we will be using a Bluetooth module vendor with existing certifications in the major global markets, and we will be engineering the integration to comply with their existing certifications. We are also prepared to do our own certification work should that become necessary, in which case we will use an FCC-accredited third party testing company. \n\nFinancial Risks\nEvery start-up (company or project) has significant financial risk - mostly centered around costs exceeding what was projected. This is an especially high risk for product development start-ups, because a seemingly small engineering oversight can easily blow $10,000 and 4 weeks of schedule. The only solution is to fiscally prepare for the worst case.\n\nTo prepare for such contingencies, we are working closely with the investment community in Boulder, Colorado, which is one of the nation's hotspots for start-up activity. Already, several team members have put in significant capital, and we have three outside investors. We are super excited to be working with the Kickstarter community to help us bring our first products to market, and we are using these private investments to build the safety net we need to be prepared for the unknowns, and make the best possible products for our backers.\n\nWe appreciate your enthusiasm, and your help via your involvement, your backing, and the sharing of our story to your friends.

E-books are great for spreading knowledge, but there's something special about having that tangible connection with a book.  \nI love knowing that people all over the world have a Litograph poster displayed in their home.  To me, each poster I design, print, roll, and ship signals that love for literature is stronger than ever.  And I'm proud to have worked with the International Book Bank to send thousands of books to communities in need overseas.\nIt's been an amazing experience getting to meet so many fellow book lovers, and to hear about the conversations these posters have sparked.  Now I'm asking for your help in getting our next product off the ground.\nWith Litographs t-shirts, we're creating a way to literally wear your favorite book on your sleeve.  We've worked with an incredible screen printing shop (they do the majority of Threadless' tees) to bring you a truly unique t-shirt, using designs and processes I was told time and time again couldn't work.  \nWell - we've pulled it off, and I need your help to fund the first production run.  It will take $15,000, but I know we can make it happen.  In return, I'm offering some awesome rewards, and just in time for the holiday season.  \nCheck out the details below, and keep reading!\n- Danny  \nHere's how it works:\n1. Become a backer, and choose which reward you'd like.\n2. When the Kickstarter ends, I'll mail you a handmade, letterpress gift certificate with a code that you can redeem on Litographs.com.  The gift certificate is guaranteed to arrive by 12/24.\n3. You or whoever is receiving the gift can go to our website, enter the code, choose any design from the given reward tier, and receive the reward in January.\nLike our posters, each of our t-shirt designs is created entirely from the text of a classic book.  \nLitographs come in both unisex crew t-shirts (100% cotton), and women's deep v-necks (60% cotton / 40% polyester).\nWe're starting with the following 5 books:\nWe've worked with Sharprint to push the limits of screen printed t-shirts. These are printed \"all-over,\" which means that the design -- the text from each book -- covers every inch. The text is completely legible.\nClick to zoom.\nThe Alice in Wonderland t-shirt includes most or all of the book, depending on the shirt size.  Since the screens themselves are larger than the t-shirts, there will always be some portions of the book that don't make it onto the shirts.  \nIn addition to t-shirts, we're also Kickstarting a new line of screen printed posters.  We worked with Steve Walters at Screwball Press to get these just right.\nCompared to our flatbed prints, these screen prints look and feel more hand-crafted.  They are distinct in several ways:\n+ With screen prints, the ink sits on top of the paper, so if you move your hand across the print you can actually feel the text.  With flatbed prints, the ink tends to be more absorbed by the paper.  With both, the ink is UV-resistant so will not fade.\n+  Our screen prints are printed on cardstock from the French Paper Company.  Our flatbed prints use vinyl-infused, tear-and-moisture-resistant paper.  Both are extremely sharp and durable.\n+ We offer a reward for custom-framed screen prints.  This means the prints are matted, and that the frames are built custom for these particular prints.  Flatbed prints are not available framed, but are offered in standard frame sizes (these frames look really nice with Litographs).\nWe've designed over 50 Litographs for flatbed prints (you can view the full collection on our website), each of which is available in two sizes (18x24 or 24x36 inches) and in color or black and white. The following 5 books are available screen printed, in color only, and at 18x24 inches:\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland\nOn the Origin of Species\nMoby Dick\nThe Great Gatsby\nMost Litographs fit the book's entire text on a 24x36 inch poster.  But some massive titles - like Moby Dick or On the Origin of Species - are just too huge to fit at a reasonable font size.\nFor these titles, I'm excited to announce a Kickstarter exclusive: XL Litographs.\nXL Litographs are offered in 3 sizes: 30x45 inches, 32 x 48 inches, and 36x54 inches.  \nThe complete list of XL titles includes:  \nOn the Origin of Species, Emma, Leaves of Grass, Moby Dick, The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci, This Side of Paradise, Les Miserables, Pride and Prejudice, The Aeneid, The Odyssey, The Iliad, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Three Musketeers, The Mysterious Island, The Kama Sutra, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Don Quixote, The Republic, Newton's Opticks, A Tale of Two Cities, and Walden.\nIf you're thinking of selecting one of these titles, have a lot of wall space, and would like to have a poster with the complete text of the book, this is the reward tier for you.\nLitographs make great presents, and with the holidays approaching I hope you might consider gifting your reward to friends or family.\nThe rewards themselves will ship in January, but in the meantime we're offering Gift Certificates -- exclusively on Kickstarter.  For each reward level, we'll include a corresponding Gift Certificate that will allow the recipient to choose whichever design he or she would like.  \nThe Gift Certificates were letterpressed at Repeat Press in Somerville, MA, and turned out awesome.  They're substantial - almost 6x9 inches - printed on heavy card-stock, and embossed.  \nIf you're planning on giving your reward as a holiday gift, I'll ship you a corresponding Gift Certificate, guaranteed to be delivered by 12/24.  The recipient can enter their code on our website and select their pre-paid product in any design they choose.  We're happy to either ship the Gift Certificates to you or directly to your friend or family.  We'll start shipping the products themselves in January.\nGift certificate for $40 reward tier.

We are over the moon!!!\nPlease follow us on Facebook, Twitter and join our newsletter on XVIDA.COM to receive future updates   \nPRESS\n\"...looks a lot like the mounting system we all want\"\nMORE PRESS\n\"the Swiss Army Knife of iPad stands.\"\n\u201cone of the most interesting, innovative and adaptable stands\u201d\n\u201cBoomerang stands out from the rest of its kind thanks to its wide range of applications\u201d\nBiteMyApple.co: \"Favorite Kickstarter Project: Boomerang ! \"\nThe Making of Boomerang\u2019s Standout Video\nBoomerang just flew to Paris ! Check out the photos on our Facebook page\nWHAT IS BOOMERANG?  \n(*fully compatible with iPad 2, 3rd & 4th gen. and Smart Cover)\nBoomerang is the first ever all-in-one iPad mount and stand. When folded in half It looks a bit like a boomerang, so we called it\u2026 \u2018Boomerang\u2019 \u2013 we like to keep it simple! To our surprise, with all the iPad accessories out there, someone forgot to build an all-in-one product. Accessories already on the market offer protection against scratches and bumps, others enable different typing angles and some allow you to mount your iPad on the wall or in the car. At XVIDA we wanted a product combining all of these facets in a single device, so we made one ourselves. Our founder, Uros, dreamed up Boomerang when looking for an iPad solution he could use while running on the treadmill at his local gym \u2013 they don\u2019t let you use Scotch Tape at his local gym. Being a stylish kinda guy, he wanted an iPad mount with a bit more funky design built-in. Uros teamed-up with Luka Stepan, a designer and Royal College of Art alumnae. They started with pencils on paper, and Boomerang\u2019s design emerged. Along the line, more and more people became interested in the project and they were keen to participate with their skills and expertise. To make a long story short, after a lot of research and development, we have our final prototype! Which is where you come in\u2026without your help it might stay ... well ... just a prototype.\nPRODUCT FEATURES\nBoomerang has been modeled as a stylish, lightweight, slim iPad stand, providing ergonomic typing and viewing angles. It also attaches with perfect ease to various mounting accessories via our amazing magnetic interface. Combined with Boomerang\u2019s mounting accessories, an iPad becomes a hands-free personal entertainment device on a threadmill, or in a car; it\u2019s your cooking assistant in the kitchen and your navigation device on the road or a boat. Boomerang is fully compatible with all versions of iPad (*except iPad1&iPad Mini).  It is also blends perfectly with the iPad Smart Cover.\nBoomerang Accessories:\n\u2022 Multi Mount\nmulti-mount on glass\nMulti-purpose mount. It serves as \"wall mount\", \"magnet mount\" or DIY mount.  One side attaches to metalic surfaces magnetically with up to 10lbs pull force , to polished surfaces ( like glass & ceramic) via included super-strong adhesive tape and other surfaces via included screw. The other side serves as an atttachement point to the Boomerang\n\u2022 Headrest Mount\nheadrest mount\nThe  headrest mount is super  easy to install via clips that attach to headrest support tubes.  No tools, straps required. Boomerang attaches to headrest mount via magnetic interface, so you can install or remove your iPad with perfect ease.  Once you have safely arrived to your destination, you can remove your iPad in just one quick move.\n\u2022 Air-Vent Mount\nair-vent mount\nThe air-vent mount allows you to mount your iPad to a car air vent and use many features of your iPad- listen to music, latest traffic reports, use your iPad as a navigation system, etc. Air-vent mount will keep your iPad securely in place. It is easy and quick to install, does not require any tools or screws to install. *Fits most car air-vents. If unsure please choose suction-cup mount.\n\u2022 Suction Cup Mount\nSuction Cup Mount\nIs a versatile mount, which allows you to mount your iPad on glass and other smooth, non-porous surfaces. The mount is perfectly adjustable and portable.\n\u2022 Table Stand\nTable Stand in action\nA perfect companion for Macbook keyboard, the XVIDA table stand is made from high grade aluminium and lets you mount your iPad in portrait or landscape mode and offers perfect viewing angle. Combined with apps like Air Display, your iPad on Table Stand becomes a cool looking second monitor. The Boomerang attaches to the Table Stand via the same magnetic interface as it does to the other mounts. Here's another picture of the Table Stand without the Boomerang attached:\n$50 table stand\nA little more ... About the project\nThe Boomerang has been so far funded entirely out of 2 main sources:\n- the amazing selfless support of friends who are professionals (in fields of design, mechanics, video production, etc.)  or other professionals we met along the way that simply believed this could be a big thing some day.  Together we invested a total of about 3700 working hours (of 40 individuals) from the start till now. (many of them are in the team shot in the end of the video\u2026and some couldn\u2019t make it that day unfortunately :( )\n- the rest was the founder\u2019s more or less entire life\u2019s savings + extra money from 2 friends and family who blindly believe in the product and the team\n We are extremely happy to have come this far , however we are at the point where our belief alone cannot fund this project anymore.  We have come to Kickstarter to prove to ourselves and convince others that this product really needs to exist. Of course, if we only reach the $40k goal , the earnings would cover  only a fraction of the costs we already put it. But we have come far enough that we know the $40k will certainly cover the costs of fulfilling the rewards, it will boost our belief that we are doing the right thing and hopefully bring new investors in.  We saw no reason of setting the goal higher and risking the project never getting funded at all. It would disappoint a lot of backers not to mention ourselves. \u2026 But luckily your support has been amazing so far an if we only continue at this pace we will exceed the goal more than two or three-fold\u2026which is what we quietly hope for :)  \n Thank you so much for your support Kickstarter !  \n Uros  ( FOUNDER )\nCURRENT STATUS AND WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP? \nWe believe the main reason other companies haven\u2019t yet offered the same product is essentially due to the technical challenges related to the design and manufacturing process. Boomerang is extremely slim and light; we spent over six months on development and research just to establish whether it is feasible to manufacture at a sustainable cost. We put the seed capital in, now we need to make it grow.\nIt took us an additional year of design and development work and considerable financial resources to move from theoretic solutions to the stage where we are able to start mass production. From computer simulations,  testing with the help of the most advanced 3D printers in the world, to designing tools for mass production, we love the journey, but we're not there yet. We need to finish the tooling and make the first production run. To do this, we need your help! We need you to get the Boomerang flying. It's an everyday product with great market potential and a really inspired team. Be part of it.\nPlease join the growing group of supporters by backing the project.  And please help us spread the word!\nPlease visit our website - www.xvida.com for more information. We're also on twitter (#myXvida) and Facebook (www.facebook.com/myxvida).

So the only remaining risk is the project (not) getting funded. It would wipe away thousands of hours of work and dollars. It would really be a shame.\n\nThe rest are challanges..lots of them. Luckily, we like challenges... if we were afraid of them, we wouldn't be where we are. We are currently finishing the main injection mold tool which should be ready for a small production run by the end of Nov. We then need to fine tune the machinery and build a simple assembly line.

Lewis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Great News!  We've Funded:\nAs of about 1:00 a.m. MST, The Game of Books successfully hit our initial target of $102,364.  That means two fantastic things.  1.) If we can hit $110,000 in the last few hours, we'll be able to put more Starter Kits into the hands of schools and kids!  So we're on a Quest to do that.  2.) It means this...:\nNow that we know we'll be funded, your pledges can be given as Christmas gifts without worrying about the project not being successful... well... in \"printed out Gift Card form\", at least.  We'll e-mail you a \"You're getting something cool from The Game of Books...\" graphic, if you like, that you can print and put in envelopes or stockings.  Check out this update for information on how that might work: Christmas Stocking Stuffers!\nImagine a game where you - the reader - are the main character, and every book you read earns you points and rewards. The Game of Books is a game for adventurous readers where the books you read earn you points based on what they are about.\nThe Game of Books combines the physical world of books with the digital and imaginary.  It is a website and mobile app that combines \"Foursquare for books\" and Xbox Live-style gamer achievements, earning you badges and points for the rare themes you encounter in books.\nAt its heart, The Game of Books allows those of us that love reading to earn something extra for what we already love, to become the master of themes that we visit more than others, to discover books we'd otherwise miss, and to track how we have grown as readers over time.\nThe Main Points of The Game of Books:\nReaders earn points and badges for the books you read.\nPlay The Game by yourself, or with friends locally or on social media.\nEach book in The Game has its own unique digital game card.  There are more than 100,000 game cards in the Game of Books today.\nOpen Access: The Game of Books is intended to be easily connected to existing reading communities, such as Goodreads.com.  Play The Game in the places you already read.\nI Earn Points for Reading?:\nWhether you realize it or not, you are gaining experience from every book you read.  This is pretty obvious in nonfiction; if you read a biography about World War II, you're likely to know more about WWII afterwards.  But it's equally true for fiction.  If you read a lot of Science Fiction books about space exploration, you become more \"experienced\" in the fictional concepts and conventions of space exploration.  You - in a very real sense - become an expert in the concepts and imagery of space exploration in Science Fiction.\nThe Game of Books is an innovative way to keep track of what experiences you've gained as you read.  The Game uses the cutting-edge technology of the Book Genome Project - which uses computers to analyze books for thematic and writing style make-up, similar to Pandora.com, but for books - to track what themes and experiences a reader encounters in each book.\nEach time you claim a book you've read in The Game, you receive credit for those experiences in the form of badges and experience points.\nWhat EXACTLY Do I Earn?:\nReaders earn two types of rewards for reading books in The Game of Books: Badges & Character Levels:\nBadges:\nBadges are special rewards that a reader earns for encountering particularly rare combinations of themes.  So, for example, say you've just read a book that contains both \"Vampires\" and \"Science & Technology\" in the same scene together.  This would likely earn you the rare \"Nerdy Vampire\" badge (one of the books in our system that earns this is about vampires on a NASA space station - I kid you not).  Badges have a point value that is dependent on how rare the badge is in The Game of Books.  Here are a few quick badge examples:\nCharacter Levels and ReaderXP:\nWhile badges are rare and earned only by specific books, ReaderXP is present in every book in The Game of Books.  A book earns a reader experience points (XP) based on its unique themes.  So if you read books about Vampires, you'll likely earn Vampire XP.  If you read about war, you'll likely earn Military XP.\nAs you read more of your favorite themes, you gain levels, helping keep track of your literary experiences, and giving you a clear understanding of where you stand compared to your friends or other readers.  Personally, I'm about a Level 14 Medieval Weapons & Combat Reader, because I read a lot of Fantasy novels.  I have a friend in the office that I'm competing with to see who levels up faster.\nIs This Already Built?  Sounds Complicated:\nThat's the great part.  The technology at the heart of The Game of Books is done, and we're now funding the final push to build the actual game interface itself, which is the mobile app and physical components of The Game of Books.  We're also funding the design, production and distribution of the very first Game of Books \"starter-kits\" for schools and libraries. These kits provide all the components that a librarian, teacher, or parent needs to begin playing The Game, including:\nGame Rules and Instructions\nAccess to the mobile application & website\nBookmarks Rewards for players\nBadge Stickers for players\nSpecial Item Cards\nJourney Boards for keeping track of readers' points, badges, and ReaderXP (experience points).\nMore (in product description below)\nOur goal is to fund the design, initial production and distribution of 4,000 Game of Book starter-kits to libraries, parents, and teachers across the country.  We believe we can spark an entirely new way to empower book discovery and community interaction around books, and simultaneously bring a creative and fun product to market.\nHow it works:\nEvery book in The Game of Books has been analyzed to determine how many Reader Experience Points it will earn a reader, and what badges it contains based on the unique combination of characters, events, or situations that the author has left for us in the book. The Game combines the technology behind the Book Genome Project with gaming so that thousands of books are assigned points and rewards for the content left in the writing of the author.\nThe iPhone & Android as Pieces of The Game:\nWhen The Game of Books is ready to be deployed, players will be able to access our database of game cards for each book in The Game in several ways.  The easiest will be an application for the iPhone and Android that allows a reader to scan the barcode of a physical book to view its digital game card, or to search for the book by title and author.  Doing so pulls up each books digital game card, containing information about the badges it contains and the ReaderXP it earns a reader.  You do not need a smartphone to play The Game, as the website will also let you play, but it's one of the more fun ways to interact with The Game.\nEvery book in The Game of Books has a unique digital game card that represents both the badges that it contains, and the number of experience points earned by reading it.\nPlayers will also be able to access our game deck through The Game of Books website, allowing readers to play whether they prefer physical or digital content.  Each book has its own unique game card determined by the content of the book itself.\nThere are already more than 100,000 digital game cards in The Game of Books today.  Both of the examples game cards below contain actual data for each book displayed; they are not hypothetical mock-ups.\nExample Book Cards from The Game of Books\nA reader plays The Game of Books by selecting a literary \"Journey\" - such as the Science Fiction Journey or the Romance Journey.  Journeys are completed when the reader collects all the badges that are needed to finish that particular Journey.\nWhen a reader checks out, purchases, or reads a book, the librarian, teacher, or parent rewards the player with a sticker of the badge they've earned, to be placed on their Journey Board.\nIn this way, readers have an entirely new reason to explore new types of books.  For example, to complete the Science Fiction Journey they may have to read books that earn them the Space Exploration badge, the Underwater Cities badge, and the Time Travel badge.\nPlayers of The Game use their Journey Board - physical cards that have spaces for the badge stickers they need to earn - to keep track of how many points they've earned, and how far into the Journey they are.\nPlayers can earn special \"character levels\" by reading enough of specific themes, such as becoming a Level 2 Vampire reader for reading books that earn them lots of VampireXP.\nIn addition, this will provide wonderful tools for reader advisory, as well.  Imagine being able to identify which books a reader may be interested in based on the common themes of the books they've read in the past, or the points they would earn by reading future books.\nWhen a reader completes a Journey, they earn collectable bookmarks representing that particular Journey. The goal of the game is to collect as many bookmarks, points, and game cards as possible.\nThe Products of The Game:\nEach starter kit comes with the basic tools needed for a librarian, parent, or teacher to set up the game for their readers, including rolls of the most common badge stickers, printed bookmarks to be given as rewards for each of the Journeys, printed Journey Cards, game manuals, and access to the online and digital tools to determine which books in The Game contain which badges and points. Additional supplies will be sold in inexpensive booster kits and expansion packs.\nProducts:\nStickers for each of the most common badges in The Game\nJourney Cards that players receive when starting a new Journey, serving as the game board.\nPosters and promotional materials for the library or school, including posters showing all 30 original badges, their value, and rarity.\nPosters and instructional materials that can be provided to players of The Game with rules and guidelines for how to play.\nGame manual including rules and guidelines for setting up and playing the game as a \"Game Master.\" Manual will include instructions for teachers, librarians, and for parents to play the game at home with their children.\nOnline access The Game of Books' database of digital game cards for the books in The Game.\nThe Plan:\nThis Kickstarter campaign is a big deal for us. We really, really want it to be successful. We've been connecting with the library, writing, reading, and publishing community to help rally support for the project. We'll being doing more of this, as well as posting more updates, and attempting to answer any questions about what we're trying to do.  This is a really ambitious project.\nThe response has been very positive so far, and we hope readers and librarians will help us share our goals around. Shortly after launch, we're going to try getting the word out to people that will hopefully spread the word to others.  We're also going to drag in every friend, family member, and stranger that smiles at us, if we're able (in a very non-pushy and friendly way).  :)\nWe believe that this is a cool enough project that our greatest risk of failure is that not enough people know it exists, and therefore doesn't get funded. We've set the time of this Kickstarter campaign to be longer than normal, because we're going to try to promote it through our library friends, as well as reach out to publishers, authors, and other supporters of the reading mission.\nOver the course of the next few weeks, we're going to try very hard to make sure lots of people hear about what we're doing. If you'd like to help, if nothing else, please tell your friends about the project. Send them to GameofBooks.com for more information, and friend us on Facebook (http://gameofbooks.com/facebook).\nWish us the best of luck, please. We're going to have some fun, I think. :)\nThe Mission & Team (Who are we?!):\nHello, this is Aaron, again.  I figure here's a good place to break a little bit from formality; all of the replies to questions and FAQ after the launch will generally be personal and unscripted, so we might as well get used to that now.  :)\nWe are a commercial company with a social mission.  We are readers, writers, educators, technology fans, and parents. We want to have an impact on the world of publishing and reading, but we're small and nimble.  We're data geeks and gamers.  Most of us.  Those who are not tolerate those of us that are.  The Game of Books is our first game, but we've been working hard to use technology and data to power the publishing industry for more than five years.  We're a start-up in spirit and reality, but with a reach far greater than our size.  In the past, projects like the Book Genome Project and BookLamp.org (a \"Pandora.com for Books\") have been covered by media as diverse as TechCrunch, Mashable, the Huffington Post, Popular Science, Macworld, Wired Magazine, CNET, PC World Magazine, NPR, the Seattle Times, and ABC News, among others.\nSome of us grew up in libraries. Myself, for example, had my first job at 14 years old cleaning the local library each week; I grew up reading the stacks late into the night (clean for an hour, read for an hour, clean for an hour, etc). I founded BookLamp in 2007 via a very public attempt to get Google interested in the Book Genome Project through CanGoogleHearMe.com (hello to any old friends!). That project went viral, and was a legitimate internet sensation for several months; it was a crazy time of my life.  I received thousands of good luck e-mails from complete strangers, something I cherish to this day.\nWe have members on the team that have lectured for years in the English department of Stanford University, data experts, fantasy readers, graphic designers, programmers, and book lovers. There's about 12 of us, in all, working hard all across the world, but mostly in the lovely Boise, Idaho.\nSteve Jobs' once said that extraordinary things happen when technology people intersect with humanities people, and we hope he's right. :) We want to find a way to assist the discovery process around reading WITHOUT messing with the reading experience itself.  If we can help people enjoy the discovery process a little more, to allow readers to share experiences - even reading different books - and potentially draw in a person that wouldn't have read otherwise, we will have succeeded.\nOur mission is to create a cool experience and social motivation that promotes reading, provides tools to power the literary mission, create something cool that engages the community and connects them back to the library, bridges the physical and digital, and helps demonstrate the cool data and technology that BookLamp.org can generate about books. We have both a commercial and a social mission. We want to have an impact on the world of reading, to leave our mark on an entire industry, and make friends while doing it.\nNo matter what, thank you again for taking the time to look at what we're trying to do.  Whether you end up backing the project or not, thank you very much.\nAaron Stanton\nFounder & Lead Designer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have an established team that's been working together for years, and we're used to working to deadlines.

We have demonstrated our ability to execute.\n\nAdditionally, the technology for analyzing large volumes of books for their themes and badges is already completed for more than 100,000 titles, and being used in various commercial applications. You can explore some of this work at BookLamp.org. The Game is simply an alternative form of applying data we already have, so the truly unique component of the project is ready to go. The rest is the physical execution, production, and distribution.\n\nThat said, there are some areas that we're inexperienced in, and represent risks:\n\n- We've never designed a game before. While we are all gamers to one degree or another, we could create a game that sucks and isn't fun to play. We're working to connect with game designers that we can recruit to make sure that doesn't happen, but it's certainly a risk.\n\n- The technology is ready to go, as is the initial design of the game, but some of the art direction and style of the assets are still being developed. Anyone that watched the development of Diablo III can tell you that art direction can be a big deal for people. If you're an artist, feel free to help alleviate that by introducing yourself on our facebook page. We'll try to do the best we can to create a game that will appeal to many ages, genders, and demographics.\n\n- We're not traditionally a manufacturing company. Once we design the physical pieces of the game, we'll have to figure out how to print, package, and ship the inventory. We do have people that have worked in supply chain management before, in previous lives, but most likely we'll seek to outsource this to help us scale.\n\n- We could fall behind on delivery dates. We'll try not to, because this is our full time gig and that would be embarrassing, but you never know.\n\n- Libraries might not like us. Some of us are not pretty to look at. We'll work with librarians to make sure the game is as fun as possible, and fits into existing catalog needs, but you never know. But if we get funded, I think that will be an indication that enough people think it's a good idea that it'll find players, and consequently, progressive librarians and teachers willing to help be the game masters.\n\nIn short, the danger in this project is not failure to deliver. The Game of Books does and will exist, and we're public enough in the world that we won't be able to disappear without being vulnerable to our local librarian (who would be angry at us for not getting this going). We'll do our best in the execution of the game, and try to deliver something that is fun, engaging, and that we'd love to play ourselves. But there are risks in every opportunity, and every effort. Please support us, but please support us only if you fulfill ALL of the following criteria:\n\na) You don't have a burning hatred of any of the following:\n - reading\n - books\n - libraries\n - children\nb) You can afford it\nc) You feel cognitively aware enough to support us\n\nIf you are all of these things, please help the project, fund us, and spread the word to your friends.\n\nThank you,\n\nAaron Stanton\na.stanton@booklamp.org\nProject Founder\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "The Game of Books is Refunding Our Backers", "update_content": "Late Friday of last week, in the middle of an evening snow storm that blanketed the city with about three inches of snow, we played through the first complete round of The Game of Books from beginning to end.

The eBook contains a large amount of source code to kickstart your project using the Just JavaScript approach.  The source code will be available for download in a .zip file so that you can easily incorporate it into your project.\nTopics Covered\nThe information included could easily fill four books -- advanced JavaScript, JavaScript in the browser, JavaScript on the Server and JavaScript for the database.  These technologies really shine when combined.  My goal is to give each a complete discussion and then tie them all together.  Specific topics that will be covered include:\nA look at the less used but powerful features of JavaScript\nA discussion of coding techniques that prevent and/or trap bugs\nHow to use JavaScript as the primary language to program your application\nHow to use JavaScript as the server side language of your application\nHow to use JavaScript to automate access to the database\nHow to use tools to optimize and verify your code\nHow to create a test environment for regression testing of your code\nA Deeper Look at JavaScript and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\nJust JavaScript begins with a review of the less used but powerful features of JavaScript.  It is expected that the reader is familiar with JavaScript.  Because of the nature and approachability of JavaScript many developers only understand a fraction of JavaScript's features.  This section of the book explores the features and highlights some best practices that make JavaScript code more reliable and maintainable. Topics covered in this section include:\nA look at the less used but powerful features of JavaScript\nA discussion of coding techniques that prevent and/or trap bugs\nHow to create an application framework\nHow to load additional code snippets on demand\nHow to do event handling via software timers\nUsing JavaScript as the Primary Language of Your Application\nAfter the quick primer, the reader is ready to see some powerful JavaScript code.  We start on the client side showing how web pages can be easily created in JavaScript with little HTML coding. It will be shown how this approach is more object-oriented than traditional web authoring methods. The book will show you how to create objects that encapsulate the visual representation of an object and its actionable code.\nWe will also show how to create a run-time debugging environment to quickly solve logic issues in your applications. Source code modules included for this section include:\nEasy DOM creation/manipulation via JSON\nA run-time debugging environment\nAn ajax based code loader\nA JSON based database query module\nMany utilities that extend the JavaScript language\nJavaScript on the Server\nAfter conquering the client environment, the book shows how JavaScript works equally well using the powerful node.js server based on Google's V8 JavaScript engine. In this section we will cover the async/event based nature of node. Code modules included in this section include:\nA node based HTTP server that is ready to extend via your plug-ins\nA complete user authentication module that includes password maintenance, etc.\nA database module that interacts with the client side JSON requests\nJavaScript for the Database\nMost applications consist of a browser, web/app server and a database. So, next we show how to use JavaScript, or more specifically JSON to describe the database.  Then, we will show you an approach, and a good bit of code, that allows you to automate interaction with the database using only JavaScript.\nAnd now for the punchline .... you get to interact with the database without writing additional server code.  You get to create additional client functionality without writing any related server code.  The result is obvious.  The work required is immediately cut in half.  Furthermore, when you are only writing code on the client side, the debugging becomes much more straight forward as you only have one side to look at.\nWhy KickStarter\nI have an active technology consulting practice.  I have the code and the knowledge.  In fact, this code is actively utilized in a number of projects.  Organizing this code and knowledge for an online book is going to take a good bit of time and effort.  I need to put some more minds and hands to work on that task.  I simply do not have the spare bandwidth to do it all myself. I am committed that the quality be very high and I do not want to create something that is less worthwhile because of limited attention.\nWith your support, I can create a small team to make this project happen.

What if pencils could grow?\nSprout is a pencil with a seed inside.  When it's too short to use, it can be planted at home, at the office, or in the classroom.  (If you're really excited to plant Sprout, you can do so before it's too short.)  Sprout is Made in the USA.\nUPDATE: International Shipping now available!  Please add $5 to your funding level to cover the cost of international shipping.\nThis Sprout is on its way to becoming a radish.\nFlavors of Sprout\nSprout comes in a number of delicious flavors, including:\nBasil\nCalendula\nCilantro\nCherry Tomato\nDill\nEggplant\nForget Me Not\nGreen Pepper\nHeirloom Basil\nHeirloom Cherry Tomato\nHeirloom Tomato\nJalape\u00f1o\nMint\nMorning Glory\nMarigold\nParsley\nRadish\nRosemary\nSage\nSpecial Edition Bacon\nThyme\nTomato\nWe've got lots of ideas for new varieties and would love to hear what your favorites are. Imagine a Sprout colored pencil set where the color of the flower matches the color of the pencil... did I hear anyone say \"stretch goal\"?\nWriting With Sprout\nWe really like writing with wooden pencils.  They have a tactile feel that even the best mechanical pencils can't match.  Getting up to sharpen them forces us to take a break and look around, a great way to reconnect during a long problem set.  We designed Sprout around a high quality Ticonderoga cedar pencil body.  It's a great writing experience.  And it smells really nice too.\nSprout is a joy to write with. Your words and ideas literally blossom!\nSprout doesn't have an eraser because we don't believe in making mistakes.  We've never been happy with the stock erasers on pencils, they tend to be too small and low quality.  We want every part of using Sprout to be fun, so instead of sacrificing overall quality (and adding cost and complexity) by grafting on an eraser, we scrapped it entirely.  Putting an eraser in it would have been a mistake.  There's a lot of good \"external\" erasers out there, we're happy to make some recommendations.  And who knows, we may be putting seeds in them too soon enough. \nPlanting Sprout\nWhen Sprout is too short to use, it can be planted to grow into a wonderful flower, herb, or vegetable.  \nSprout is too short to use, time to plant it!\nThe seed capsule is water activated, the first few times you water Sprout dissolves the protective capsule and starts the seed's germination. The pencil shaft can be kept in the soil as a helpful labeled planting marker or it can be removed.  We've planted dozens of Sprouts and have found that they usually sprout in around a week.\nPlant Sprout capsule-side down up to the planting depth line.\nWater daily. Sprout usually sprouts in about a week.\nWe want every Sprout to succeed so we include at least 3 seeds in each capsule to maximize the chances of successful sprouting.\nEach Sprout package comes with a helpful planting instruction card.\nThe History of Sprout\nWe met in a graduate product design course at MIT and were tasked with creating a product for the eco-friendly office of the future.  We came up with Sprout!  While Sprout is eco-equivalent to a standard pencil, we think that it's a nice way to reconnect with our environment.  We're particularly excited about getting Sprout into the hands of kids, getting them off the street and into the garden!\nThe original user interaction storyboard for Sprout.\nThe Future of Sprout\nWe've hand assembled over 100 Sprouts and have designed the tools needed to make as many Sprouts as you desire.  We have an American manufacturer lined up who's as excited as we are to make this project happen, all we need is your help to get enough volume for a production run!\nQuestions and Answers\nHow does Sprout work?\nSprout is a high quality cedar pencil with a water-activated seed capsule at the tip.  When the seed capsule is exposed to moisture it begins to degrade, releasing the seed within Sprout and starting its germination.  You can leave the pencil in the soil as a helpful planting label, or pull it out.  You can plant Sprout wherever you like, though we recommend an area that gets plenty of sunlight.\nWhat happens if I accidentally wet my Sprout?\nIf you spill something on your Sprout the tip will begin to dissolve, getting the seed ready for germination.  Unfortunately Sprout doesn't know the difference between accidental and intentional watering, so if you accidentally wet your Sprout it's time for planting.  We've worked hard to make a resilient seed capsule but it's a tradeoff between resistance to accidental spills and plantability.\nWhat if I chew on my pencil?\nIf you are in the habit of chewing on the end of your pencil Sprout will probably activate and dissolve in your mouth.  We think this is a great tool to break yourself of that habit.  On a lighter note, Sprout is entirely non-toxic!  \nIs international shipping available?\nYES!

Lewis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "CNET: \"most innovative iPhone docking cable ever\"\nENGADGET: \"from dismembered action-figure prototype to reality\"\nMASHABLE: \"on our 'why didn\u2019t I think of that' list\"\nWIRED: \"ideally suited to charging in laptops\"\n9 TO 5 MAC: \"the most versatile iPhone charging cord\"\nREAL SIMPLE: pinned to Problem-Solving Products\nCORE77 DESIGN: \"friend of Core77 and Hand-Eye Supply\"\nREDDIT: \"I thought the risotto line was pretty good\"\nIntroduction.\nThe cable that comes with your iPhone is actually a pretty nice cable. But it's so damned long!  And if you're on-the-go all the time, then you know that yanking that cable out of your bag is a hassle. It gets caught on stuff in your bag. It pulls other crap out of there too--keys, pens, other cables, you name it!\n\nSay hello to Twig.\n\nTwig is incredibly short, so it's ultra-portable. It's only 4 inches (102 mm) long, so it's the perfect iPhone cable for anyone who is on-the-go. But Twig's size isn't the only thing it has going for it. We have designed Twig with a bendable wire \"skeleton\" and three \"legs\". These bendable legs are what make Twig so amazing.\n\nBend it.\n\nThe wire skeleton inside Twig isn't a limp noodle like those bendable toys from gum-ball machines. Twig is strong. Bend a leg, and it stays bent. Bend all three legs, and make a tripod. Bend Twig and plug it into your AC adapter to make an instant wall charger dock. And when you want to hit the road, just bend Twig back into ultra-portable mode and chuck it in your bag. It's like no other cable, and it's awesome.\n\nWhat can you do with Twig and your iPhone?\n- Sync and charge on-the-go. It's ultra-portable.\n- Charge your iPhone right on the outlet.\n- Snap fun tripod photos on-the-go.\n- Pose for perfect self-timer photos.\n- FaceTime with friends: on-the-go and hands-free!\n- Prop-up those laid-back speaker-phone calls.\n- Crank-up an impromptu upright boombox.\n- Save space with the best earbud cord wrap.\n- Use it with all iPhones, touches, and nanos.\nInto production.\n\nIf you've watched the video, then you know that our crew is big on prototyping. We aren't afraid to rip stuff apart, scratch our heads a bit, and then glue it all back together in almost-unimaginable new ways. In fact, it's just that kind of design and prototyping that led to Twig. We learned a bit from each prototype and used that knowledge to make the next one better. After a few iterations, our fully-functional prototypes work great, and our 3D-printed prototypes look even better. Now the next step for this thing is mass production, and that's where we need your help.\n\nFunding for this project will pay for plastic injection molds, wire forming fixtures, elastomer over-mold tooling, and much more. Our supplier already makes cables for the iPhone, so (believe it or not) the electrical wiring and connectors for Twig will be the easy part. The tooling for the connector bodies and leg over-molding will soak up most of our production schedule, and if this thing gets funded, we anticipate shipping Twig to backers at the end of September.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nWe're a product development company in Portland, Oregon. We design and develop consumer electronics products for companies like Apple, Intel, Dell, and Nike--and we have brought dozens of products through mass production for our clients over the years. We've even put a couple of smaller projects into retail by ourselves. Our team is really excited about Twig, but launching a product like this on our own is something that just doesn't pencil-out without the right kind of funding up front. In other words, this is the perfect kind of project for Kickstarter. Thank you so much. And please share this project with your friends! If they have an iPhone, chances are that they will love Twig too. \n\nTwig features:\n- ultra-portable cable\n- bend it on-the-go!\n- photo tripod mode\n- wall charger mode\n- earbud cord wrap\n- widescreen mode\n- hands-free FaceTime\nNotes: Patents pending. iPhone and FaceTime are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Tetrafidget: it even has magnets!", "update_content": "Kickstarter,\nCan you believe it's been more than five years since we launched Twig?

The Creatures, Elly the elephant, Rory the rhino, and Geno the giraffe, are each made up of cardboard pieces that you assemble using tabs-and-slots. By turning the wire handle the creatures come alive with a simple mechanical motion.\nKinetic Creatures also...\nencourage people to build with their hands, minds and imagination. Use sustainable and recyclable materials and support local manufacturing.\nKinetic Creatures takes a complex mechanical linkage, popularized in Theo Jansen\u2019s Strandbeest, and makes it accessible through an easy assembly and friendly cardboard form.\nA collaboration between Alyssa- a Visual Arts Teacher and Artist and Lucas- an Industrial Designer, the Kinetic Creatures are intended to encourage building and thinking creatively at home and in the classroom. \nHow big are they?\nBigger than a bread box. Here are the dimensions:\nElly the elephant is 11 1/2\" tall x 15\" long, Rory the rhino is 9 1/2\" tall x 15 1/2\" long, Geno the giraffe is 21 1/2\" tall x 18\" long. \nCan they walk on their own?\nWhy yes, our gear kit allows the animals to be powered by a small electric motor and laser-cut wooden gears. The creature\u2019s insides are an open platform for mechanical and electrical additions. \nThe Gear Kits:\nBuilding the Gear Kit requires only glue.  Both Elmer's glue or Superglue work great. We will prepare and solder the Gear Kit's wires or you can let us know if you would like to do the soldering yourself!\nThe Kinetic Creatures are an open platform for paper robotics and if you are super into electronics and you want to build your own mechanism, the platform specs will be open sourced on our website. \nThe Gear Kits contain: wooden gears, a geared axel, a motor, AAA battery case with on/off switch.\nKinetic Creatures Art Workshops:\nAlyssa will be using Kinetic Creatures in her art classes and workshops to inspire and encourage youth to be builders, thinkers and inventors. Students will learn about Industrial Design, Kinetic Sculptures and the process of developing an idea into a product. Kinetic Creatures allows students to succeed through an accessible assembly of a complicated mechanical project.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nKinetic Creatures are a culmination of four years of design, research and play. The kits are ready- they have been prototyped, developed and are currently made using a laser cutter, but it takes over two hours and expensive laser time to build each kit. \nNow that the designs are done, we want to cast the patterns onto die-cut-tools at a local cardboard manufacturing facility. Using a die-press, the time-per-kit comes way down. That means we will be able to share the Kinetic Creatures with hundreds of makers and art students. \nHelp us send Kinetic Creatures into the world, and we'll mail you one of the first kits.\nThank you for your support!\nAlso, a special thanks and shout out to friends near and far & our supportive families & Elizabeth and Nicholas at Cathedral Laser LLC & Jason at Portland Bindery.\nMusic credit: Eric Steuer, Alastair Cameron & Grapes.\nThank you to Shayla, Dae'Onna, Alex, Alexander, Marco, Sofia and Lisa- my amazing 8th grade art students whose insight, creativity and humor make projects like these worthwhile.\nKinetic Creatures are recommended for ages 11 and up because they contain wire and small cardboard parts.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Send us your Creature Photos!", "update_content": "Hello everyone!\nWe have exciting news- after many months of designing, building, coordinating, soldering, lasercutting, visiting factories and kitting- we\u2019re very excited to report that we\u2019ve started shipping your Kinetic Creatures!\nThe bulk of the national orders have already shipped and the international orders are soon to follow.

Mail Pilot adds services to your existing mail accounts that it syncs between all of your devices. Your email is never stored on our servers, and is left on your current email servers. Our servers store metadata about those messages to bring to you the reimagination of email that so many have come to love. Read on...\nThe Current Email Crisis\nEmail is in need of a fresh start.  A redesign from the ground up.  With your support, mail pilot will forever change the way that we interact with email. \nMail Pilot intuitively works the way you\u2019ve always wanted to use email:\nYour inbox is now a to-do list...\nComplete / Incomplete Control Button\nAll new messages arrive as incomplete and remain that way even after you've read them. Mark a message as complete only after you finish any further action associated with that email. Completed messages are archived to decrease Inbox clutter, but can still be accessed by browsing or searching.\nYour inbox is now your assistant\u2026\nMark for Review\nWhen you don't have time for a message, click the \"Mark for Review\" button. This message disappears from your inbox. Later, when you have more time, you can enter a \"Review Mode\" session to fly through these messages.\nReview Timelines & Review Lists\nTell Mail Pilot a later date on which you wish to review a message. On that date, it will reappear in your inbox. Mail Pilot also allows you to group similar messages into custom review lists to be acted on as a group.\nThe Mail Pilot Difference...\nMail Pilot allows you to do even more with features such as:\nAccount Compatibility\nMail Pilot works with all major email services, so you don't need a new email address. There is no need to importing anything: Mail Pilot constantly stays in sync with your current email accounts.\nSingle Login\nGone are the days of having to configure all of your different email accounts on each of your devices. Link all of your email accounts to your Mail Pilot login, and they automatically sync with all of your devices.\nAutopilot\nSet Mail Pilot to automatically mark specific messages for review, skipping the inbox. For example, send all messages you've been CC'd in to be reviewed when you have more time, set weekly newsletters to be reviewed on a specific date, or automatically have responses to a job opening put into a specific review list.\nBrowse\nFind emails more quickly and intuitively. Mail Pilot automatically determines your recent top contacts, and places their icon in the browse box. Click an icon to immediately see messages involving that contact.\n...And Much More\nWe've been working on tons of other reimaginations to the email client. Intelligent Compose, Intelligent Reply, Drill Down Bar, Similar Messages, Calendar View, Pilot-to-Pilot, and many other features will be making their debut with Mail Pilot.\nWe can only do this with your help...\nWe\u2019ve been working for months conceptualizing and developing Mail Pilot for you.  We have a working prototype, but we need your support to make it through the final stretch.  Pledge to our campaign to ensure that we can reach our goal and get Mail Pilot into your hands by June.  \nFurthermore, become a part of this movement.  Stand with us in challenging the status quo of today\u2019s uninspired inefficient software.  Help us usher in a new era of smarter, more productive technology that truly works for you. Be sure to share this project with your contacts.  \nWe all have to use email, but only with your help, will we be able to use email in the most intuitive and natural way possible.\nWhere the money will go...\nWhile we have a working prototype of Mail Pilot, there's more we'd like to do before launch. Some of these things are going to cost us, including:\nHosting. We need some serious hosting space to deploy our storage-intensive services.\nNative Apps. To ensure the best experience, we plan to develop native apps for the desktop and the mobile (that's a lot of apps). We\u2019ll need to bring on some additional developers to get these done in time.\nPush Notifications. Push notifications will make Mail Pilot a full replacement for email on the mobile. They also require additional hosting, and the native apps.\nMarketing. We hope the efforts we put into our Kickstarter campaign will produce enough exposure for awhile. However, we realize we\u2019ll have to put more time and energy into marketing before we officially launch Mail Pilot.\nWhat our fans & backers are saying about Mail Pilot\nWe've been gaining some serious momentum!

Now, you can serve all your favorite dishes, from Cajun to Continental. \nCoq au Vin, Marinara Sauce, French Onion Soup...you name it! Now you can create dishes with the flavor, aroma and color of real wine, without the salt in prepared wines or the alcohol in regular wines.\nCooking with wine is an ancient tradition.

Find out more information on our latest stretch goals at Update #12.\n-Update ~ $6000 stretch goal: send CREATURES to ORIGINS!-\nThank you all so much for putting us over our goal in less than 72 hours!  Now we want to take CREATURES to the next level, all the way to the Origins Game Fair!  This is the biggest annual board/card game trade show in the US, held in Columbus, Ohio in the Spring, and we want CREATURES to take it and the gaming industry by storm.  We are asking for funds to cover the cost of a booth (~$900), booth design, airfare, hotels, lots of extra decks to sell, etc.  so we have set a stretch goal of $6000 to help fund this grand adventure.\nIf/when we hit the $6000 goal, there will be an extra special bonus reward added to EVERY backer level $5 and above-- a special, limited edition animal to be added to your deck available only to kickstarter backers!  The mystery cards will be revealed on the backer's blog upon reaching the goal.  Keep up the great work!\n-ABOUT THE GAME-\nCREATURES is a creative, strategic card game that blends friendly competition with a good laugh!  It is intended for 2 to 6 players, ages 8 and up.  The game is comprised of 96 playing cards consisting of either a \u2018FRONT\u2019, \u2018MIDDLE\u2019, or \u2018BACK\u2019 portion of 32 particular animals.  Each animal is illustrated across the three cards, and includes a fun fact about that animal and a corresponding \u2018strength\u2019 value ranging from 1-10 (e.g. a mosquito is strength-1, and a grizzly bear is strength-10). \nGameplay occurs as players mix and match \u2018FRONT\u2019, \u2018MIDDLE\u2019, and \u2018BACK\u2019 cards in their hand to create entirely new creatures, and stage attacks against the creatures in other players\u2019 hands.  For example, the \u2018FRONT\u2019 of Octopus (4), the \u2018MIDDLE\u2019 of Hippopotamus (7), and the \u2018BACK\u2019 of Armadillo (1) combine to create OC-POTA-DILLO (12)! \nThe illustrated portions of each card align to create an image of the new creature with a zany new fun fact.  A creature which conquers all other players in a single turn becomes a \u2018Champion\u2019.  Can you be the first to achieve 5 \u2018Champions\u2019?  May the strongest creature win! \n-WHY CREATURES IS AWESOME-\nCREATURES is not a veiled re-boot of existing face card games such as poker or bridge, but a refreshingly new and creative game unlike anything else.  It is a harmonious blend of the simplicity of traditional card games such as Uno or Skip-Bo with the strategy and creativity of more complex card games such as Canasta or Phase 10. \nThe game is fun for many levels, easy to learn, and difficult to master. \nWhen is the right time to attack?  Which creature should defend an oncoming attack?  What if someone holds a *POISON* creature!?  The quirky artwork and jumbled-up animal facts keep players of all ages engaged and amused.  With almost 22,000 possible CREATURE combinations, the gameplay is always fresh with every hand delt!\n-WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES-\nThe pledges YOU make will cover the costs associated with designing and printing the first edition card decks professionally, including tuck boxes, shrink wrap, etc. as well as registering the CREATURES trademark and copyrights.  Did you know it costs $40/month to list a new item on Amazon.com?  This is where your money goes!  We will also be printing CREATURES T-shirts and refrigerator magnets so you can show off your undying support of the game to friends and family.  Any amount we raise in excess of our stated goal will go toward trade show exhibitions, marketing material, additional deck printing, etc. so please continue to support!\n-MORE INFORMATION-\nPlease visit the official CREATURES website at www.CreaturesCardGame.com for more information, images, rules, etc.\nHit us up on Twitter @CreaturesGames!\nThank you for pledging and helping make CREATURES become a reality!

I live and work in a traditional neighborhood of Buenos Aires called Montserrat.\nThe old posters and signs in this place inspired me to design a typeface that rescues the beauty of urban typography from the first half of the twentieth century. The goal is to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free, under a free, libre and open source license, the SIL Open Font License. \nAs urban development changes this place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. To draw the letters, I rely on examples of lettering in the urban space. Each selected example produces its own variants in length, width and height proportions, each adding to the Montserrat family. The old typographies and canopies are irretrievable when they are replaced. \nThere are other revivals, but those do not stay close to the originals. The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful.\nAt a formal level, I do not neglect aspects of type design that are functional and contemporary. Montserrat is a geometric style of type that has subtle optical adjustments. The result is a sans serif family with multiple versions and multiple possibilities, both in the editorial and corporate realm. \nWith Kickstarter, you can participate in this project. I hope you enjoy the city as much as I do! Help me rescue these forms before there is no standing marquee left. \nThe Montserrat family is envisioned with 9 type styles, eventually. You can catch a glimpse of these display styles in the video, but they are still very early in their development. \nTo start the family, the most important styles are being created in this project - the Regular weight of the upright Roman style. I am making two fonts though, one with an alternative set of capitals letterforms to capture the variety and soul of Buenos Aires!\nMontserrat Regular\nMontserrat Regular Alternate Caps\nHere is a preview of some of the Alternate Caps:\nIf this project is funded, it will be published in Google Web Fonts! The Montserrat Project has the full support of the Google Web Fonts team, who will review its technical details to ensure it works perfectly as a web font. The font will be hand-hinted by Google too.\nThis project will take around one month: the \u2018Montserrat Regular\u2019 and \u2018Montserrat Regular Alternate Caps\u2019 families will have all glyphs required by Google Web Fonts for Basic Latin. The Project Rewards will be sent out before Christmas. \nIf this Kickstarter raises more than the target amount, I will expand the scope of the project to include more Extended Latin characters.\nPlease note that this project\u2019s funds are paid to \u2018TeX Users Group\u2019 (office@tug.org), a US based 501(c)3 non-profit who are kindly running a \u2018Libre Font Fund.'

In the days before the internet, rapid prototyping, social media, and Kickstarter, I looked into making the product and it cost too much and was very difficult to get to market.  If you like interesting design, M.C. Escher, tessellation, or just making cookies, please join me in making these pencil sketches into physical products. I'll be documenting the whole process here on Kickstarter, including all the receipts to show where the money is going.\nHow the idea was born.\nIn 1992, I was working at a deli and bakery as a delivery driver.  I spent a lot of time in the kitchen, and one day I was watching cookies being made. The baker rolled out the dough, cut a bunch of round cookies out, and carefully lifted them out on to the cookie pan.  What was left, was a lot of dough... I commented, \"If M.C. Escher made your cookie cutter, you wouldn't have all that dough left over\"... That idea stuck with me for the rest of the day and within the next 24 hours I had the first Christmas design sketched out.  I looked into getting it made through traditional manufacturing, and it was going to cost around $20,000 to get one design to market, so i shelved the idea.  Over the years I have continued to play with new designs and I think it's time to make it a reality.\nHow it will be made.\nI am a 3D artist, and I have built 3D models of some of the designs. \nThe first step is to get some prototypes made to test for size and function.   I'm going to get these prototypes made at www.shapeways.com.  They can build single samples of the product without making a mold.  \nOnce I'm happy with the design, I will work with an engineer to turn my models into production ready CAD designs.\nNext it's off to get the molds made and a run of the products made.\nFinally, all that's left is packaging.\nAre there any other designs?\nMy focus with this project is on the Halloween and Christmas designs so that I can get them in your hands before the fall holiday season.  Following that, I have some spring designs (Easter and Valentine's Day).  In addition to that, I have 4 other designs.  Each design takes around $3000 to make the molds and do the first run of products.  I'm shooting for $6000 on this project, but if we're able to raise more than that, I'll make more and include them into your pledge rewards as a bonus.\nInternational shipping.\nI am covering the cost of international shipping, there will be no additional charges.\nMakes a great gift!\nThey always say that, but please consider picking up several, the fall holiday season will be here before you know it.\nThanks again,\nKeith", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Merry Christmas!", "update_content": "Hi all, \nThe kid's gifts are wrapped and placed under the tree.

We started one year ago helping people get together to realize their ideas for social ventures, local businesses and the arts, one project at a time.\n\nWith your help we want to kick our work into high gear by creating a social enterprise cafe to host and grow our community of projects and show what networked creativity can do, even in challenging environments.\n\nHow does the Kinyei cafe work\n\nKinyei enables creativity\nIndividual / group has idea: business, art, social\nKinyei Cafe provides open space, information resources, know-how, local and remote collaborators, all critically rare in Cambodia.\nIndividual / group joins Kinyei network of creators, making it an even more powerful agent for idea incubation and social change.\n\nWhat\u2019s been done so far\n\nKinyei started over a year ago, supporting individuals in Cambodia to realise their own ideas for the future by coordinating local and international collaborations, virtual mentoring, hosting open workshops and doing one-on-one coaching. We\u2019ve supported concerts, documentary projects, animators, poetry workshops and social media seminars on a shoestring, all by fostering local, international and virtual linkups of creative folks.\n\nThe cafe building already hosts a successful grassroots peer-learning programme and co-working space that serves as a base for fledgling film, dance and community development groups. We know this kind of facilitation works, and produces amazing things.\n\nIdeas Caf\u00e9: bigger, better, more permanent\n\nWhat started as ad-hoc support for small social ventures and innovative projects has grown into a energetic fledgling community of doers and makers which requires resources in order to sustain and grow itself. To supply these resources in a self-sufficient way, we\u2019re adding a social enterprise caf\u00e9 component to the project.\n\nThe cafe will cater to foreign and Khmer tastes, generating a bit of cash to make the space independent of the need for donations. It will draw in more people from more diverse backgrounds who can view exhibitions, engage in unconferences and workshops, and generally turn Kinyei from a project-to-project facilitation experiment into a thriving, cross-pollinating community of artistic, social and entrepreneurial collaborations.\n\nKickstarter for Caf\u00e9\n\nWith funds from a Kickstarter campaign we\u2019ll be able to smarten up our space, procure a fine looking refurbished espresso machine, and train and salary four local staff to run a thriving ideas cafe.\n\nYour contribution will get some real mileage here in Cambodia. Most of the renovations are complete but we\u2019ve still got some rewiring, tiling, sink and toilet installations, cementing, painting, tools such as an internet connection capable of supporting video conferencing and staff training that can all be done with remarkably minimal funds.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhy a cafe?\nWhat\u2019s selling coffee got to do with helping creative projects? A whole lot, actually. What is critical for the generation of productive collaborations is a social space where people feel welcome to come, be, meet and share. A cafe is the perfect tool for this in Cambodia, a natural meeting place for both foreigners and locals, a common ground on which people and cultures can meet, and, importantly, one which can operate sustainably for years to come.\n\nWhat will you do if you raise more than your target?\nThe Cafe\u2019s core programs are the first port of call for additional funds; virtual collaborations, open workshops, unconferences and exhibitions. Once we have the cafe infrastructure in place we anticipate that it will be able to support its own ongoing costs so we\u2019re excited to fast-track the events that make up the soul of the project!\n\nWhat can I do to get more involved?\nIf you find yourself in Battambang the open classroom program is always looking for passionate people to drop by and run a workshop; you can watch the Kinyei site for our upcoming virtual tutoring project, and you might consider remotely supporting any of the projects which are currently working with Kinyei with volunteer help or mentorship.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Soksabike Transitions to Local Ownership!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Kinyei recognized by Wild Asia as regional leader in sustainable tourism!", "update_content": "Kinyei was named as the winner of the Most Inspiring Responsible Tourism Initiative category for the 2015 Wild Asia Awards this past month."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Sakana competes for Cambodia on the world stage", "update_content": "Kinyei cafe superstar Sakana Long recently competed against the region\u2019s best baristas at the FHA 2014 Barista Challenge held in Singapore\u2019s Expo Center between April 8 -11.

While, at the same time, helping honeybees beat the odds against colony collapse disorder (CCD).\n\nWhat's this all about?\nI'm inviting you to join in the establishment of a small community business. With your support, E.G. Flewellen's Bee Farm will produce delicious artisanal honeys and help bees thrive in good health by providing safe refuge from pesticides and taxing agricultural practices, which are at the center of the CCD crisis. E.G. Flewellen's Bee Farm will manage hives without the use of synthetic chemicals on pesticide-free land, far from conventional crop agriculture.\n\nStart-up costs for a bee farm can be prohibitive.\n\nHowever, with your support I can launch a sustainable apiary in time for the 2011 honey season.\n\n\nMeet the Bees of Crockett.\nI currently have just a few bee hives in my backyard in Crockett, CA, a quirky outpost of 2,500 people just northeast of San Francisco. Crockett is hemmed in by thousands of acres of parkland and miles of protected open space, providing a rich terrain for wildflowers. Best of all, there is no conventional crop agriculture nearby. That means healthier bees and no pesticides in the honey.\n\n\n\nWhy I need your help.\nWith your pledge of support, I will move my existing hives closer to the hills where the bees forage, and expand into an apiary of considerably larger capacity. Your pledges will make it possible for me to continue my work with healthy bees and to share their story (and honey) with a wider audience. The money you pledge will go towards the purchase of hives, bees, queens and the equipment necessary to expand the apiary, manage the hives, extract honey and package it. My Kickstarter goal of $20,000 will go directly to covering these costs.\n\nWhat's in it for you!\nIn exchange for your support, you will get your choice of rewards packages composed of limited-edition, artisanal honey, fresh from the hives you have helped establish. Rewards are offered in a variety of honey combinations and quantities to fit any budget. And each will feature custom-designed packaging commemorating this first run of honey from E.G. Flewellen's Bee Farm.\n\n\n\nConvinced?\nIf you want, you can skip straight to the pledge rewards packages conveniently arranged for you to the right of this outline.\n\nWant to know more about my honey? Keep reading!\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nWhat is artisanal honey?\nAn artisanal honey is produced by beekeepers who play a very personal, hands-on role in isolating honey with specific qualities in mind. Typically these raw honeys are neither heated nor filtered, preserving the unique flavor and nutrition of the honey. A beekeeper focuses on the blooming of a specific flower or group of flowers, allowing bees to collect from these nectar flows and subsequently extracting this specific honey from the hives.\n\n\n\nFor years I have scaled the hills and ravines of the terrain surrounding the town in every direction, following my bees to their foraging sites. I've scouted out their floral sources and when they visit them. With this awareness, I isolate specific seasonal honey according to the blooming cycle of principal floral sources.\n\nWith great attention to detail, I render three dramatically different seasonal varieties of artisanal honey with these distinct qualities:\n\nSPRING WILDFLOWER HONEY The spring honey is composed of the rush of wildflowers whose blooms capsize the rolling landscape from early February until the end of May. Among this first flush are naturalized plum, California poppies, lupines, native clovers, wild radish, mustard and a smattering of other wildflowers. By April and May, blooms of blackberry and black locust contribute to the mix. All together they contribute to a delicate and silky honey that is white-gold in color and has a pronounced floral bouquet; a crisp, bright body; and a long-lasting aromatic finish. This honey is perfect for more delicate baking and teas. It also makes a spectacular pancake and waffle syrup if you melt plenty of salted butter and stir it into the honey.\n\nMIDSUMMER WILDFLOWER HONEY This spectacular honey, produced from May to the end of July, prominently features yellow star thistle, one of the most sought-after honeys in the world, with touches of pepper tree flowers and a little buckwheat, which is just beginning to bloom. The result is a beautiful red amber honey featuring a velvety texture and a robust, rich body with distinct hints of caramel, molasses and sherry. Adding to the complexity is the hint of savory molasses from the buckwheat, while the pepper tree flowers lend a pleasantly lingering peppery finish. This is a stand-alone honey, so delicious you can just eat it straight, spoonful after spoonful. However, it also makes an awesome homemade honey ice cream.\n\nLATE SUMMER WILDFLOWER HONEY The late summer honey draws from floral sources spanning August to October. Buckwheat is in full bloom and yellow star thistle lingers on. By mid-September floral sources become scarce and the bees madly forage in a push to collect all that they can from what remains of the season's flowers. These late-season flowering plants produce heavy, dark, rich nectar and result in a similarly complex honey. The resulting honey features a chewy viscosity and a rich, savory body of bold caramel and molasses with spices. The surprise comes in a bloom of browned butter caramel at the finish. Its rich color and bold spiced flavor are perfect for the holiday season. This is the honey to dip a whole fresh apple into. Then quickly hand it to the person next to you and watch them try to eat it.\n\nThanks for taking a look at my project. With your help, I will launch a sustainable apiary with plenty of amazing honey to share.\n\nPledge. Get Honey. Bee Happy.\n\nYours,\n-Earl G. Flewellen\n\n\n\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (SOLD OUT) The $125 Limited Reward: When you choose this reward package you'll receive the following: In addition to the Extra Fancy Sampler reward, you'll get a CD of the amazing album \"Honey\" by Jonathan Segel of Camper Van Beethoven. The album features a beautiful original silk-screened cover by Michael Wertz.\n\nMore about the Jonathan Segel album \"HONEY\": This cd came about after the tragic robbery of most of Camper Van Beethoven's gear while on tour in Montreal in 2004. One of the missing pieces was Jonathan's Fender Stratocaster named Honey, a guitar he'd been playing for 20-odd years. Realizing that there was no way in this modern age to replace an ancient strat, he became obsessed with the guitar again, and played all the time. The result was a new batch of very guitar-heavy songs, recorded with Victor Krummenacher on Bass and John Hanes on drums. A few choice guitar overdubs by Myles Boisen and backing vocals from the Alison Faith Levy, Eden Daniels, Dina Emerson and Anne Hege rounded it out.\n\n\nTo learn more about Jonathan Segel and his work, click here.

And it exceeds all my expectations.\n\n\n\nThe bees will now be situated in an idyllic spot not far from where we are now. A very generous local landowner has offered me use of a beautiful plot of land in a sunny canyon with a small lake. The bees will now be located centrally within the terrain they currently access for foraging with the added benefit of easy access to fresh water, an important factor for good hive health. Bees collect water and carry it to the hives for cooling them during hot summer days. And the more convenient it is, the less stressful it is to the bees and the less it impacts nectar foraging. Further, the plot has numerous sunny locations with perfect wind breaks to protect the bees from prevailing winds, which can be quite cantankerous here.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the bees will gain considerable advantage by being set very close to Eucalyptus, a primary winter source of pollen and nectar. And the plot also sports a profuse source of early spring pollen in the form of willows, which are abundant along the wet banks of the bottom lands on this plot and others nearby. These winter and early spring sources of food are vital to healthy early brood-rearing at a time when nectar and pollen is otherwise generally scarce. An abundance of pollen and nectar in this period promotes vigorous spring hive buildup, constituting a great advantage in honey production.\n\n\n\nOnce the season kicks into high gear come May, the bees will have thousands of acres of wildflowers on which to forage without having to travel very far at all. Most of the flowers from which they will collect are within a 1/4 to 3/4 mile radius from this location, quite a luxury for honeybees who regularly travel 2 and 4 miles to reach floral resources."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "The Bees Land a Sweet Spot!", "update_content": "Dear Bees of Crockett friends,\nAn anonymous backer has offered a challenge: He will match the next $500 of pledges between now and close of The Bees of Crockett!

BUT to save me a great deal of expense I'm mailing shirts and CDs at the same time - so you'll get ONE package from me on August 30th - that's the official release day of Third World Symphony. I'll send your package out on August 26th, giving the USPS four whole days to deliver. (I'll ship overseas a week earlier.)\nNext up, advanced copies of Third World Symphony have been sent via e-mail. I sent out the link to an advance copy of Third World Symphony a few days ago, and a link to the demos for those who qualified to receive those as well.
