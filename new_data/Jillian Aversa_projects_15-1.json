[{"backer": "Jillian Aversa", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Lost Birds is a musical memorial to bird species driven to extinction by humankind. Sweeping and elegiac, it's a haunting tribute to those soaring flocks that once filled our skies, but whose songs have since been silenced. It's a celebration of their feathered beauty: their symbolism as messengers of hope, peace, and renewal. But it's also a warning about our own tenuous existence on the planet: that the fate that befell these once soaring flocks foreshadows our own extinction.\nThe Lost Birds will be sung by the preeminent British vocal ensemble VOCES8, accompanied by my longtime collaborators, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Backers will have the rare and unique opportunity to attend the orchestral recording sessions at the legendary Abbey Road Studios, as well as the vocal sessions at VOCES8's private recording facility (both in person and virtually). And just like my last Kickstarter album To Shiver the Sky, I'll be documenting in detail each phase of the creative process--from sketches to composing, recording to mixing, release to marketing-- with frequent updates, journal entries, and exclusive live streams and video content.\nThis album will be a gentler production than my previous works. The language will be pastoral and romantic; by turns soaring and delicate, but with the slightest whisper of melancholy. It will be a response to the noise of our times; a return to simplicity, clean lines, and the timelessness of hymns and folk melodies. It will be a triumph of loveliness; a soundtrack for appreciating nature, and a reminder that we must preserve its ephemeral beauty while it still exists.\n Funding and Stretch Goals\nDespite the actual cost of production being close to $200,000 we set our funding target at $50,000 because of the uncertain times that we're in.  Despite that you rallied and we hit our goal within 7 hours.  Thank you--I'm honored.  We're currently the second highest grossing classical music Kickstarter ever, and I'm hoping that by the end of the campaign we can set a new record.  So with that in mind, here are the first batch of stretch goals I have in mind for the rest of this campaign:\n$150,000: funding the a cappella versions of select movements (for the Deluxe Edition)\n$160,000: funding the instrumental suite (for the Deluxe Edition)\n$180,000: creating several music videos/visualizers\n$200,000: creating and releasing a symphonic version of To Shiver the Sky, with the vocals replaced by instruments of the orchestra\n$210,000: creating an atmos/5.1 mix of The Lost Birds \n$225,000: creating Atmos/5.1 mixes of Calling All Dawns, The Drop That Contained the Sea, and To Shiver the Sky \n(If we surpass these goals, then the rest of the money will just be kept as compensation for all my work.)\nHow I'll Be Making this Album\nPLAY\n\nThe first part of the project will be the research; finding poems and texts to set to music, then coming up with the overall dramatic arc of the piece. After that comes months of composing and orchestration, which I'll be sharing with you in great detail through live-streams and updates.\nThen comes the recording. This album will use a hybrid of traditional classical recording techniques, and the more tech-heavy and modular approach that we employ in the film/game scoring world. The vocal portions of the album will be recorded first by VOCES8 in the traditional classical manner--all singers together in one room, without guide tracks, performing around a small cluster of microphones that will capture the natural acoustic of their recording space. After the vocals are done, I'll be building a metronome map around their performance, to preserve their natural phrasing and musicality. I'll then be bringing those sessions to Abbey Road, where the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra will overdub their parts. Every player will be listening to both the metronome map and VOCES8 recordings in their headphones--all while sight reading the music. Both halves of the recording will be a stunning display of musicianship you'll want to witness.\nHere's a rough timeline for The Lost Birds:\nFeb. 2021: research and creative outlining begins\nApr. 2021: composing begins with an emphasis on the VOCES8 parts\nSept. 2021: VOCES8 records their parts (with me producing remotely from LA)\nOct. 2021: editing and pre-mixing of vocals, composition and orchestration continues\nFeb. 2022: the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra records their parts at Abbey Road (with me conducting)\nMar. 2022: mixing and mastering begin\nApr. 2022: album is completed and marketing begins\nSept. 2022: target date for release; backers receive album on launch day\nExperience the Recording\nWitnessing an album being recorded live is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's an experience you'll want to share with your friends and family, or a story you might someday tell your children and grandchildren: that you were there, either sitting in the room or watching online, as an album you helped bring to life was being captured for all eternity. So for the first time, not only are we making all the recording sessions available to attend live, but we're also making the VOCES8 sessions available to all to attend online.\nAll backers can now purchase the VOCES8 Virtual Session Pass as an Add-on to their primary pledge tier, and get full streaming access to the VOCES8 recording sessions (and music video shoots), broadcast live from their recording studio in the heart of London, the VOCES8 Centre. What's more, you'll be able to listen in as I produce the sessions remotely from my studio in Los Angeles; so you'll be hearing exactly what I'm hearing in real time, and follow along as I give them notes and feedback. (For more details about the schedule and format for the online sessions, see the FAQ.)  \n\n\nFor those who want to experience it live with the chance to meet the singers, The VOCES8 Recording Experience pledge tier gives you the opportunity to spend an evening recording with them, with the opportunity for a meet-and-greet. (I'll be producing the sessions remotely online, due to the pandemic.) Attendance will be capped to preserve that small-group feel.\n\nIf attending an orchestral recording session is more to your liking, The Abbey Road/RPO Experience is your chance to visit the legendary recording studio and sit in while I conduct the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. This premium experience is a rare opportunity to go behind those closed doors. Attendance will be limited to maintain an exclusive experience, and you'll have the chance to join me for a private reception beforehand. To read firsthand how the entire experience is from an actual backer, see this blog post. (For information about the scheduling of these sessions, visit the FAQ.)\nPremium Rewards and Add-ons\nI've curated a collection of rewards that give the ultimate music appreciation experience, as well as some one-of-a-kind collectables and life experiences that you won't get anywhere else. Almost every item is also available as an Add-on after you select your primary pledge tier--meaning you can easily mix and match any items you see in this campaign (note: if your primary pledge tier is a digital product only, then only digital Add-ons will be available.  If your primary pledge tier contains a physical product, then all digital and physical Add-ons will be available.). On top of all this, most of these rewards will be personalized in some way: the CDs, vinyl, prints, and study scores will all be signed (and in some cases numbered), and the handwritten 'Sogno di Volare' score will be dedicated and personalized to your liking--an ideal gift for a music lover. Here are a few samples:\n\n\nAbout the Composer\nI'm a big believer in music's ability to be a force for good: its capacity for shedding light on darkness, and inspiring people to become better versions of themselves. All my previous albums were rooted in this philosophy: on the surface they're simply enjoyable music, but dig a little deeper and you'll discover dialogues on cultural tolerance (Calling All Dawns), musical explorations of water conservation (The Drop That Contained the Sea), and celebrations of human achievement (To Shiver the Sky). The Lost Birds will be the same.\nTo me, an album should never just be a random collection of music. I believe in concept albums: songs built around a core idea, with interconnected musical motifs, that tell a story from start to finish. I approach my work like a film director: each album tells a different story, with different characters, and each with its own unique narrative and structure--but they're all told in a way such that they're unmistakably mine.\nRehearsing 'Calling All Dawns' at Carnegie Hall, June 2019\nMy work has won two Grammy awards, repeatedly topped the Billboard charts, and has been heard the world over: from Carnegie Hall, to the United Nations, and even The Vatican. It's been the soundtrack for many of the world's biggest events: from the FA Cup to the World Expo, and even to a landmark peace treaty signing in Mozambique. It was even a question on Jeopardy!\nThe Lost Birds will be the next chapter in that story, and while there's no guarantee that it will follow in the footsteps of my other albums, what I can say is that this music is not intended to just fade away after a season. Like all my albums, it's meant as a piece of permanence--one that will hopefully be performed again and again in concert halls for years to come. This is your chance to attach your name to its creation. I invite you to join me on the journey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've successfully recorded and released three full orchestral/choral albums in the past, including one that was fully funded by a Kickstarter campaign ('To Shiver the Sky'), so I have a wide range of resources and experience for recording and releasing this album. The album is already slated for release in 2022 via my new record deal with the legendary record label Decca Gold/Universal, so there's no way that this album doesn't get finished. The worst that will happen is that it gets delayed.\n\nOne potential challenge will be the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: at the moment the orchestral sessions are scheduled for February 2022, but that presupposes that the virus is contained well enough such that large recording sessions can take place, and I'm able to get a vaccine and fly to London. We'll keep everyone informed about the outlook, and if necessary, we'll reschedule the sessions and those who pledged to attend them will be given the option of a refund. This may cause delays to the album's release.\n\nI have a good track record with Kickstarter: my last album was the highest grossing classical music Kickstarter ever, and I gave a very thorough behind-the-scenes experience of the creation of the album, from pre-production, to composing, to release, to marketing. I take my backers very seriously!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "'Thank You' in Credits", "descp": "Receive a thank you on our website, in the study score, and in the credits of the behind-the-scenes wrap-up video.\nAdd-ons: add a VOCES8 Virtual Session Pass after selecting this tier, and watch the recording of the album vocals from the comfort of your own home.\nINCLUDES:\nThanks in the credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2022"}], "stat": ["31 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Standard Edition Download", "descp": "Download 'The Lost Birds' in your choice of three high-fidelity formats: high-res MP3s, FLACs, and Apple Lossless (24-bit/96k).
