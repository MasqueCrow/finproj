[{"backer": "Ronny Anderssen", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Engage in power struggles and build your crew\u2019s reputation. Salvage and steal to survive and endure a ruthless universe. And above all, do anything you can to get that next job.\nThis sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game takes you to the grimy blue-collar future of a universe filled with risk, but also opportunity. DEATH IN SPACE presents a vision of space where technology is broken and dirty, and society is harsh and desperate. The player characters make up a crew with their own spacecraft or station, and take on the jobs they can find, in order to earn some well-needed bucks and get ahead in the power struggles of the stellar system. \nThe people making this game are Christian Plogfors and Carl Niblaeus of Stockholm Kartell. With this Kickstarter, we hope to get the funds to print the core book for the game, which should contain everything you need to start playing. We want to continue making material for the game after the game is out, in the form of adventures and other material to use in your game. \nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or on the website. \n\nHere's a preview of what we hope the standard edition of the book will look like (the holographic foil is stretchgoal-dependent):\nDEATH IN SPACE has its roots in the OSR scene, and follows similar design principles. In terms of setting and tone, inspiration comes primarily from the gritty science fiction of films like Outland and Prospect, classic westerns and the grimy future of early 80\u2019s science fiction movies. \nIt is a game about adventure and uncertain journeys out into the darkness of space, it is about you and your crew making a home of your spacecraft or station, in tough competition with everyone else, and most of all, it is about enduring in an abandoned frontier system where your only hope of surviving is to take any contract you can find, sometimes having to put your fate in your enemies' hands.\nInspiration\nThere are a lot of great and inspiring games out there. In terms of rules and approach, we have found inspiration in some form, large or small, in for example the following games (alphabetically listed): Coriolis, Into the Odd, Knave, Mothership, Mutant Year Zero, M\u00d6RK BORG, Offworlders, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells, Mutant  (1989 edition), Traveller. Out of these, M\u00d6RK BORG, Knave and Coriolis deserve a special mention.\nMost of the inspiration for the tone and feel comes from movies and series. Some of these, that have inspired elements of the setting in one way or another, are (alphabetically listed): 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Fistful of Dollars, Alien, Blade Runner, Escape from New York, The Expanse, Firefly, IO, Moon, Outland, Prospect, Sunshine, Total Recall, The Warriors. \nVisually, much of the inspiration comes from abstract geometric art and design, and old computer interfaces and manuals.\n\nIn terms of music, one of our stretchgoals consists of a dedicated soundtrack for the game, by our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon. You can already listen to a preview of what that will sound like on Spotify (or scroll down to the stretchgoal list and listen immediately). \n\n\nStandard edition with holographic foil (not final)\nKickstarter exclusive edition (not final)\nOur main goal is to print a durable book of excellent quality that is easy to use at the table. We aim for an offset printed book with a sewn binding and possibly some fancy extras, depending on which stretchgoals are funded.\nThe book should land at about 128 pages and measure 6 by 9 inches. You can choose from two cover versions: the standard cover, and a special edition, only available in the Kickstarter.\nRegarding the covers, we plan for the special edition to be a cloth bound book, and the regular edition cover to be embellished with holographic foil (the silvery kind with reflecting colors), if we fund the corresponding stretchgoal (otherwise, the holographic parts will be a solid color). Apart from that, there are more possible upgrades to the book in stretchgoals. Basically, we don\u2019t want to pull any punches, and will try to make this as nice a book as possible.\nContentwise, the core rulebook contains everything you need to start playing immediately:\n Light-weight rules, intended to be easy to use and quick to learn\n  A system for quickly generating player characters and their spacecraft or space-station\n   60+ different modules to make the spacecraft or space-station your own\n  An introduction to the default setting, the Tenebris stellar system, its main locations and history (with many pieces of the puzzle left for you to fill in)\n  A system for repairs, where you collect spare parts to repair your stuff\n   20 cosmic mutations, representing physical manifestations of the void through your body\n  A system for spacecraft confrontations and boarding\n  An introductory scenario to jumpstart your campaign\n   40+ tables and generators packed with setting flavor\nBelow are some preliminary spreads to give you a flavor of how the interior of the book will look like:\nThe rules of DEATH IN SPACE are intended to be easy to use and hack but also to support and introduce the setting through the rules. While inspired by OSR games, the primary intent is not to be fully compatible with the rulesets and modules of old, but rather to try to capture the quickness and simplicity of these rulesets, tweak them according to our preferences and add some setting flavor (however, the rules are still close enough to other OSR rulesets that material should be possible to use with some simple conversions).\nThe basic rule when you try to accomplish something, say force open an airlock, or resist the effects of strange radiation, is to roll a d20 modified by one of four ability values, the ability determined by the nature of the task. If you roll over a fixed difficulty, you succeed. Failing checks gives you void points that you can use to increase your chances the next time you attempt something. Beware of saving up too many though, that might result in some nasty consequences. Void points are also used to activate cosmic mutations, strange powers from the void. \nThe player characters are all part of a crew with their own spacecraft or space-station, their sanctuary in a dangerous universe. Characters are generated in a quick randomized fashion, making it quick to make a new one when (not if)  your character suffers an accident. With a list of 60+ modules that provide new possibilities, the players can successively customize their ship or station and really make it their home and base of their adventures. If your ship or gear should break, you can repair it as soon as you collect the necessary spare parts. In case you encounter rivals on your travels, the rules for spacecraft confrontations determine the outcome and whether you can avoid being boarded.\nDEATH IN SPACE focuses on the Tenebris system\u2014a system of planets and objects revolving around the star Tenebris. It is a stellar system ravaged by war and strife, where a greed-fueled mining for precious gems ended in a conflict that laid waste to the intricate trade networks that ensured technological production. With no new parts to find, almost every single object built today, from weapon to spacecraft, is put together from discarded, salvaged or stolen parts. Nothing is new.\nAs if rebuilding the system after the war was not enough, there are reports from stargazing cosmologists that the universe has stopped expanding, and that it has instead begun collapsing at an accelerating rate. The news that civilization is at its end have created a sense of hopelessness and disorder, and in many sectors of the system former vassals have taken this chance to seize control from distant rulers.\nPlayer spacecraft concept by Mattias Astenvald\nIn the heart of the Tenebris system is the Iron Ring\u2014a huge, ring-like structure surrounding the moon Inauro like a belt of metal. This is the center of activity in the Tenebris system, and here miners and salvagers huddle in cramped living quarters, waiting for their next contract and a chance to earn some much needed money. In other parts of the Ring, far from the bustling market-places and common areas, there are dark, empty sectors, where shady types hide from attention.\nAmong the people of the Iron Ring, cryptic rumors are spreading about a void accelerating the collapse. A void that whispers strange sentences to the unlucky through the ever present thick static noise that grows stronger and stronger as you travel towards the edge of civilization. A void that infects and corrupts and imbues their bodies with odd powers.\nIn the middle of all this are the player characters: hard-working explorers and laborers hoping for a big score.\nThe 99% Void Safe reward level\nVoid protection. With this reward level you get the core book in print, with the cover of your choice (regular or special edition). The book will be wrapped in foil, to keep it safe from the strange void radiation. Better safe than sorry. \nThis is a mockup and not the final product.\nT-shirt. Premium cotton t-shirt from Spreadshirt. We're aiming for a design based on the book cover.\nHandouts. Two maps for the adventure in the core book\u2014Welcome to the Ring\u2014printed on high quality paper. \nStickers. One prismatic sticker portraying the spacecraft by Mattias Astenvald, and one holographic sticker using the graphics from the standard cover. These designs are exclusive for the Kickstarter. Below are preliminary designs.\nSetting location and printed note. We create a location connected to the Iron Ring\u2014an establishment, a station, spacecraft or similar\u2014and dedicate it to you. The locations are planned to be included in a table in the book. You get an individually crafted and printed thank-you letter that also includes the location name and description. \n50000 SEK \u2013 We make this book \nA high-quality offset printed 128-page book including all you need to start playing.\n75000 SEK \u2013 Holographic foil cover\nWe add holographic foil to the regular book cover and make this book glimmer.\n100000 SEK \u2013 Soundtrack\nWe ask our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon to make a full-length soundtrack for DEATH IN SPACE, that you can use as background music for your games. Every backer gets the soundtrack digitally, and it will also be made available on Spotify and Bandcamp. Here is how Helium Kid Kanon describes the soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE:\n\"Sound waves from dark, vibrating aegrine were found on a 570 million year old, volcanic island. When passed through a cloud chamber, they turn into an oozing, analog warmth, layered with sparkles of cosmic noise. These are some of the parts, arranged into a multi layered space. A composition that can trigger chronesthesia. The soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE.\"\n 150000 SEK \u2013 Pamphlet adventure\nWe make a pamphlet adventure. All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver.\n200000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add more spacecraft illustrations by artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n250000 SEK \u2013 Map poster\nWe make a map poster of the Tenebris system. For the map, we will receive some help from graphic designer and animator Gabriel Herrin. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect \u2013 one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE \u2013 so we are very happy to have him onboard! All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver. Note that logos are placeholders and will be replaced.\n300000 SEK \u2013 Bookmark ribbon \nWe add a bookmark ribbon to the book, to make it easier to find the page you\u2019re always flipping to.   \n350000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add even more spacecraft illustrations by our artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n500000 SEK \u2013 New adventure\nWe ask Rickard Antroia to write an adventure for us. The adventure will be released in pdf and all backers get it digitally. Rickard is a writer and designer who has written adventures for Coriolis and Tales from the Loop and worked with editing on Tales from the Loop, Things from the Flood, Vaesen and Alien RPG. He wants to take you on an epic journey to the edge of the universe.\n700000 SEK \u2013 Cults and factions\nPelle Nilsson - from Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games, author of games such as M\u00d6RK BORG and Barkh\u00e4xan among others, contributes to the game by providing a number of cults or factions of the Tenebris system that you can use in your game.\n\n800000 SEK \u2013 Online generator \nWe ask Karl Druid to make an online character generator for us. Karl writes material and makes virtual paraphernalia for tabletop RPGs. He is for example behind the M\u00d6RK BORG online generators scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\n900000 SEK \u2013 Printed pamphlet #2 \nWe print the adventure pamphlet by Rickard Antroia from the 500k stretch goal. All backers with physical reward levels get it (all reward levels except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver). This means that if you get the printed book, you get two different printed adventure pamphlets with it.\n\n1,100,000 SEK \u2013 Solar Fields song and Tenebris system soundscape\nMagnus Birgersson, also known under the name Solar Fields, will write and produce a track inspired by the material included in the book! Solar Fields has released 17 albums and appeared in over 60 compilations, including the in-game scores for the computer games Mirror's Edge and Mirror's Edge Catalyst. You can find his music on Spotify and on other platforms.   \nIn addition, if we pass this stretchgoal, Helium Kid Kanon will create a number of immersive soundscapes that represent various locations and environments in the Tenebris system. A perfect background to amplify your experience while exploring our world.  \nThe songs for the soundtrack and the soundscapes will be published on streaming platforms like Spotify, and backers get them digitally.\nThe majority of the money we collect will fund the printing cost for the book and any other funded print material. The remaining funds will be used to pay our collaborators for their work and costs. \nDEATH IN SPACE will be published by Free League Workshop, Free League Publishing's sublabel for externally designed games. They are responsible for shipping and distribution.\nWe plan to use a pledge manager, and charge shipping separately after the campaign has ended. See the map for our current best estimates of shipping costs*. The current plan is to ship the game from the UK as the default, but with distribution hubs in the EU and US as well. \n* This is based on shipping one book, the map and a pamphlet, and the Moon Outlaw and 99% Void Safe reward levels may therefore incur some extra shipping charges\n\nChristian Plogfors. When he is not writing for DEATH IN SPACE, Christian spends the rest of his time on the layout and graphics for the game. He has been designing worlds for computer games for 18 years, now as a senior level designer, and has contributed to games such as Battlefield, Mirror\u2019s Edge and Star Wars Battlefront. When relaxing, he likes to write material for his Into the Odd hack Into the Jungle. He has also contributed with material and layout for the Night Yeast zine.\nCarl Niblaeus. While almost every sentence of the game has been dissected by both Carl and Christian, Carl has had the last word on much of the language in the book. In the RPG world, Carl has contributed to M\u00d6RK BORG zine Feretory, the Night Yeast zine, and released one or two old school modules before that. He also helps running the so-called Old School Corner (\u201cOld School-h\u00f6rnan\u201d) at GothCon, Sweden\u2019s largest RPG con. There he referees his own and others\u2019 creations. Outside of RPGs, Carl has a PhD in astroparticle physics, and has spent many years researching the underpinnings of our own universe. In DEATH IN SPACE, this knowledge is used to inspire the creation of another.\nCollaborators\nApart from us there are a number of collaborators who provide invaluable assistance in making the game.\nJohan Nohr. As one half of the team behind M\u00d6RK BORG, Johan should be well-known to many in our audience. With M\u00d6RK BORG, he works tirelessly to make it look as great as it does, and we are very happy to have him onboard. In DEATH IN SPACE, Johan has worked with the illustrations, adding touches to give them a more personal feel.\nMattias Astenvald. Mattias is an artist located in Uppsala, Sweden, working in the digital gaming industry. For our game, he helps make reality of our spacecraft and we hope to make use of his great skills as much as we can. \nGabriel Herrin. Seattle-based graphic designer and animator. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect, which is one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE, so we're really happy have him onboard. He will help us make company logos for the map poster. Check out more of his stuff here.\nStockholm Kartell is a creative coven of writers, designers and idiots.

After the campaign we want to spend about 2 months finalising the last few details before doing a proper round of editing and proofreading with a native English speaker.

You discover the tomb is inhabited by an undead queen and her spectral knights. In your exploration you have learned that she was murdered by the patriarchal structures of her own holy order. The method of her execution has denied her eternal rest. She plans murderous vengeance against the living but offers mercy under two conditions. First, help install her as an eternal monarch upon the religious throne. Second, eradicate the bloodline of those who betrayed her. What do you do? \nDungeons & Dilemmas is a collection of system agnostic techniques for designing dungeon-based adventures that engage the players on an emotional and ethical level. The presented process approaches dungeons as their own unique narrative structure, and the encounters within them as moral puzzles.\nDungeons & Dilemmas treats deeper emotional engagement as an additive dimension of play on top of the exploration, hazard avoidance, monster fighting, and treasure collection elements of traditional fantasy adventure games. All the ideas, tools, and techniques presented speak to the strengths of existing rule systems in common use. GMs and players won't have to hand-wave away or house rule their games to accommodate this material.\nFor several years, I have been using these techniques to keep players emotionally engaged and ethically challenged with adventures that reach beyond the stereotype of \"murder hobos\" and excuses to just \"kill things and take their stuff.\" #ZineQuest has provided a unique opportunity for me to share these ideas with you and hopefully help you think about the dungeon fantasy format in a slightly unique and fulfilling way.\nDungeons & Dilemmas is particularly well suited to games like: \nTorchbearer\nDungeon World\nAny of the numerous OSR-style games such as  Old-School Essentials \nAnd, of course, the current edition of the most popular fantasy adventure game.\nProject Structure\nThe current plan is a 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched booklet with black and white interior.

It never fails to surprise me when a pop-up unfolds into 3D space from seeming nothingness. I hope you guys will have some of the fun that I had when I got to put these together. These kits are part miniature model, part 3d puzzle, and all paper-craft! As you build them, you'll be guided by the instructions and labels found in the kit, and also full instructional walk-through videos where I build them with you step-by-step. I put a lot of work into making sure these designs would work consistently and look good. It makes me happy every time I see them!\nThese pop-ups are a great way to fill your table up with neat working terrain that doesn't break the bank and is easy to carry around and store.\nThis time around, we are only offering the digital files. That being said, these files are designed to be printed on both A4 and American standard 8.5 x 11 inch letter-sized paper. All of the files (at least those that are completed at the end of the Kickstarter, including the first 5 settings) will be made available to all backers as soon as the Kickstarter funds are distributed to us (Usually within 2 weeks of the project end date).\nAfter printing, the pages will look something like this:\nYou'll need additional supplies such as a hobby knife, double-sided tape, and backing material in order to assemble your pop-ups.  Once you put them together, you will be able to combine them into fantastic miniature worlds!\nOur initial funding goal will cover the design of the first five settings and one flat terrain peice. These will include the Mageboat, the Market Square, the Traveler's Wagon, the Castle Wall, Charlie's Castle, and the Mysterious Grate Flat Hex. \n Mageboat\nThe Mageboat is a watercraft designed to be steered and propelled by magical means. At a 28mm scale it would measure 50 feet from bow to stern. Take your adventures to the high seas with this sturdy vessel!\n Market Square\nAt the Market Square, you can find food, drink, weapons, and a host of other curios. This is probably where that stolen painting wound up, now coated in a thick layer of dust, after nearly 2 decades.\n Traveler's Wagon\nThe travelers are the continent's most prolific traders, and are always a welcome sight. But this cart seems to have been left unattended. Its team of horses and usual occupants are mysteriously missing. It was probably the giant ants. Again. Yes . . . that was what happened.\n Castle Wall\nThe castle wall is the perfect place to hatch a \"storming the castle\" plot. All you need is a wheelbarrow and a holocaust robe. You probably already have both! Print out and assemble 6 copies of the castle wall and you'll have yourself a stronghold!\nCharlie's Castle\nCharlie's castle is a very small castle (more of a fort really) that is mostly used as a customs checkpoint these days. It's fortunate that you adventurers came along, you can clear out the tribe of goblins that have set up camp within its walls. \n Mysterious Grate Flat Hex\nNot technically a pop-up, this hex tile provides some space for your characters to cross on their way to somewhere else. Because is it really a journey if no one journeys? Also, what's going on with that mysterious ground hole?\nWe are excited about making as many pop-up settings as we can to be included in this kit! That's why we are going to keep adding more stretch goals as these ones are met. Our current plan is that every additional thousand dollars pledged to the kickstarter adds a setting to the digital kit!\nCORRUPTED SHRINE: $3000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nThis shrine honors the great philosophers and scientific minds that together founded the Elipsiconian council. Unfortunately, the shrine has lately become the site of several unexplained deaths. It's up to you to discover it's dark secrets! (This setting is a redesign using the basic structure of the Gazebo from our previous Pop-up Kickstarter.)\nTRINKET SHOP and WATERFRONT FLAT HEX: $4000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nWhere do all of these magic amulets and stuff come from? The trinket Shop! Full of magical whosits, whatsits, and at least 20 cursed thingamabobs, the trinket shop is the perfect place to get objects that may or may not offer any magical protection at all.\nThis flat hex serves as a transition from land to water. Here you can fish, swim, and relax as you prepare to head back into the nearby ruins.\nLONE TOWER : $5000 Stretch Goal  - REACHED!\nThis lonely tower is where the orcish sniper is holed up, shooting hapless travelers as they move along the nearby roadway. You guys should head up there and make sure he (OR SHE! Petra asks why it couldn't be a female orcish sniper. Girls can be snipers too!) is stopped. \nTHE DOCKS : $6000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nThese serviceable docks are where people are talking about when they say \"Meet me down by the docks.\" Here the men of the sea come ashore, some boisterously headed for the tavern, others slinking through the shadows like rats.\nThe Pale Tree : $7000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nIn the woods near my childhood home, there was a large dead tree. It served as a landmark for my brothers and I as we hiked through the woods to the river. I always imagined there was more to that tree. Was it truly dead? If so, why didn't it ever fall?\nThe Mausoleum : $7479 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nAlthough the manor it once served has long ago burned to the ground, the mausoleum still stands, relatively untouched by time. Recently, the villagers have been hearing an unnatural wailing that seems to be coming from within. It's probably just some surly teenage half-elves, but the mayor would like you to check it out. (The Mausoleum is a redesign of the basic structure of the wooden fort from our first pop-up Kickstarter.)\n\nThe Tavern : $9000 Stretch Goal\n(Rough prototype pictured here) The local watering hole is a great place to gather information or simply regroup after a long day of spider-fighting. This pop-up is designed so that the roof folds back, creating an upper platform and allowing easy access to the interior of the tavern. \n\nAs we reach these goals, more will be added to the kickstarter. We already have some pretty awesome stuff planned, but we also want your suggestions for the terrain you'd like to see in the set!\n$18 Recolored version of Pop-Ups from our original Pop-UpKickstarter\nThis set includes PDF files to create 8 pop-up hexes, 1 large two-hex setting, and 3 smaller diamond settings that can be combined into a single hex. This version will be recolored to match the pop-ups produced by this kickstarter. This add-on also includes files for the original colored and uncolored versions.\n$10 Retextured version of Pop-Ups from our Halfling Adventurers Kickstarter\n(No pictures of this yet)\nThis set includes PDF files to create 4 pop-up hexes and 1 flat hex. This version will be retextured to match the pop-ups produced by this kickstarter. This add-on also includes files for the original version.\nWe are excited to get these pop-up files completed and have them in your hands so you can make them too!

You further acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the order (and the project) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented on Kickstarter.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities.\n\nTypically, import duties are paid up front as part of your shipping costs (which is what \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d means), however, there are certain countries where regulations prevent advance payment by a third party, and you may be responsible to pay customs taxes directly.**\n\n**These countries include, but are not limited to the following: Central and South America (including Brazil), Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Turkey, UAE, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. All customers in these locations must handle their own tariffs, and they order at their own risk, not ours. For Brazil in particular, we suggest you have your product shipped to an address of someone you know outside Brazil who plans on travelling there to hand deliver.\n\nYou are also responsible for providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAs per the terms stated on Kickstarter, a full refund will be provided if the request is received within 14 days of the close of the campaign.\n\nOtherwise such a refund will be at our exclusive discretion and will be net of handling costs, Kickstarter commissions and credit card processing fees (15%).\n\nIf you fail to check out and pay for your order, including shipping costs, before the posted payment deadline, you may be forfeiting your products. Unclaimed games will be released after the closing date to online and retail sales since we lose money on unclaimed games due to storage fees.\n\nRefunds and/or cancellation requests will only be considered before we set the print run size for mass manufacturing with our factory in China, which takes place upon the posted payment deadline for the Pledge Manager.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "8-Bit America", "descp": "Get a copy of 8-Bit Attack that is ALREADY printed and ready to be shipped!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager.

We have some graphic design work left for the rule book and the back of the box, but we don\u2019t see any potential delays being caused by these tasks.

Roger, by the way, said not to do it! \nThe magazine covers, or fuses, content on all types of gaming including retro, modern, Indie, table top and even toys and there have been 7 issue to date that have been hugely successful with issue #1 selling over 1,250 copies and the others not too far behind.\nEach issue has bespoke artwork, not found anywhere else - it is created specifically for the magazine by Trevor Storey (issue #2 onwards) based on an article or an idea that inside the magazine. The issue #1 cover was produced by Wil Porter - he of Super Play covers for Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) magazine.\nTo continue the idea of the Crash and ZZap! 64 annuals also produced by us, the idea of a FUSION annual was always in the mind - so here it is.  \nThe annual is 120 pages in length and A5 in size, hardback and is colour throughout with high quality 135gsm glossy paper inside just like our Crash and ZZap! 64 Annuals. \nThe cover is shown below and is a Bladerunner type space scene - the first time a cover is not directly  related to content inside, it just looks great. The cover is also drawn by Trevor Storey:  \nThe quality of the annual is exactly the same as the Crash and ZZap! 64 Annual in terms of paper thickness and feel - this annual is not A4 but A5 so will fit nicely in backpacks and bags for reading on long journeys.\nWithout giving away too much of what the inside looks like, here are some double page spreads of what you will find inside to give you a taste of what to expect (remember there are 120 pages in total): \nWe also have a great interview with RJ Michael and features written by The Oliver Twins (Philip and Andrew), Dave Perry (The Games Animal), Stoo Cambridge (Sensible Software), Simon Butler (Ocean Software) and many, many more!\n\u00a310K Stretch Goal\nEach backer will get a 52-page ZX Fusion issue that concentrates just on the ZX Spectrum if we hit the \u00a310K mark.\nChris MacAuley\nChris McAuley broke into the comic book scene last year as a colourist for Marvel and 2000AD. Under the watchful eye of comic book legend John Charles he has worked on characters such as Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk and Judge Dredd. His work recently featured in the Glasgow Museum of Modern Art . Here we have 2 original images for Fusion - they will be signed by Chris and limited to 25 prints of each.\nImage #1\nImage #2\nPosters, canvasses, aluminium prints of each individual cover - just pick the perk you would like then tell us in the questionnaire sent after the Kickstarter which image you would like. I will include multiple perks so you can pick a selection of merchandise with the same image. In the Updates I will let you know to add further perks of the same kind with other images on them.\nSo as an example of the perks on offer with the imagery above...\nPicture Acrylic Block - 6\"x 4\" \nCanvas - 16 x 12\"\nCushion\nAcrylic Photo Print - 12\" x 8\"\nHere is an example of one of these with the ZZap! 64 2019 Annual:\nBoxed Framed Print - 12\" x 8\"\n\nAluminium Prints - 10\"x 7\"\nBinders\n A FUSION branded binder with issue #1 to #6 inside:\n Fusion Retro Books are responsible for producing high quality retro books that follow two distinct series paths.

Return to District 9 and relive the three days of the film from a whole new perspective. Lead your Faction through the alien slum in a search for the tech that will give you the edge. Salvage the most technology, take control of the district, and claim your victory!\nDistrict 9: The Boardgame is a Kickstarter EXCLUSIVE!\nIf this is your first time on Kickstarter - please check out our handy guide.\nThere are three phases in the game that represent the same three days in the film. There are key moments in the film which act as a timing mechanism for each phase. \nDay 1: Wikus is moving around the District evicting Prawns from their homes. When he locates and is infected by the Alien Canister the day will come to an end.\nDay 2: Wikus starts transforming into an Alien and roams the District hiding and looking for answers. Other Characters from the film appear including Christopher Johnson, the day ends when the both of them meet.\nDay 3: The Alien Dropship crashes into the District and Wikus suits up in the Mech destroying anything in his path. The day and the game will end when Players take down the Mech. \nYou need to make sure you are fully equipped before entering the District. Spend Influence to add Crew and upgrade Equipment on your Vehicle to increase your Strength and Defense stats.\nYou will need to get around the District in your search for Alien Technology. Spend an Action to move your Vehicle and Units around the District, Zone by Zone.\nTensions in the District are rising. As an action, Players may engage other Factions, Units and Prawn threats in your Zone.  There are no dice in District 9: The Boardgame, the fate of combat is resolved through the flip of a card.\nThe Evict and Claim actions allow you to pick up the Alien Technology and add them to your Vehicle. Prawn will start to emerge and may get hostile as you evict them from their homes and claim their technology. \nCheck out our Rulebook!\n5-6 Player Expansion rules\nFor more information and naming the card - see Update #13.\n\nThe scale of the pieces in the game alongside a card.

This universal resource and its collection of 70 places characters might visit in the course of their adventure went on, in fact, to become Skirmisher\u2019s most successful title and a Platinum bestseller at the popular DriveThruRPG retail site. \nWe designed City Builder as a resource that storytellers could use to create fun and believable communities, and interesting and compelling places within them, for their game settings. Altogether it contained guidelines for creating communities of all sorts and sizes and entries for dozens of different kinds of places characters might visit or spend time at, from taverns and inns to temples and guilds, organized into 10 thematic categories (i.e., Craftsman, Entertainment, Professional, Tradesman, Mercantile, Service, Scholarly, Religious, Governmental, and Underworld Places). \nAs successful as City Builder became for us, it was still one of our earlier titles and eventually did not represent what we were capable of as a company in terms of writing, editing, layout, design, art, or access to technology. Our awareness that City Builder could be even greater was, in fact, our motivation for creating what we are now calling the Platinum Edition of the book and, in doing so, taking it to the next level and turning it into a publication that is representative of where we are today. \nProof render, actual product may vary in appearance (look even better).\nWith the Platinum Edition of City Builder we have created a dramatically improved version of the original book and upgraded it in every way possible to make it more user-friendly, enjoyable to read, and visually appealing. As part of this we have: \nCompletely redesigned the book to make it full color and give it a more contemporary and accessible look; \nExpanded the book from 176 to 192 pages (which, if all Stretch Goals are unlocked, will be further expanded to approximately 222 pages); \nThoroughly revised all of the text, to include expanding and reediting it as necessary and reorganizing the contents of some of the entries or their places within the book; \nMade entries more standardized and parallel in structure; \nAdded information to entries when applicable about how they might be approached in unique ways by various fantasy races; \nAdded three completely new entries for specific places; and, \nReplaced the original disparate collection of images with a suite of more than 100 new illustrations that give the book an even nicer and more cohesive look and which have a complementary style reminiscent of Renaissance-era manuscripts like those created by Leonardo da Vinci. \nProof render, actual product may vary in appearance (look even better).\nThis new edition of our most popular title is now an even more essential asset to storytellers creating villages, towns, cities, and other sorts of communities for ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and fantasy settings. We sincerely believe that the Platinum Edition of City Builder has a place on every game master\u2019s bookshelf and have made every effort for them to want it to be. And if we exceed our basic funding goals for this project there is even more we will do with it! \nHere is a preview of what's to come.\nBackers that pledge enough for a print copy of City Builder will receive a code for an at-cost print copy fulfilled by DriveThruRPG.com \u2014 print on demand costs of $16 have already been deducted from the cost of the reward. This will allow backers to enter their shipping details and order at their leisure, and helps us keep costs down for everyone while delivering your rewards reliably and quickly. \nPDFs will be fulfilled with a complimentary download code from DrivethruRPG.com as well.\nFollowing are a number of stretch goal rewards we will provide to backers of the Platinum Edition of City Builder if we exceed our basic funding goals for it. They include a suite of 12 full-page original images by fantasy artist Amanda Kahl and a number of new places by game developers Michael O. Varhola, Clint Staples, and William T. Thrasher in addition to the 70 that currently appear in the book. \n$4,000: 12 Additional Full-Page Illustrations. If we exceed our basic funding goals by just $1,000 we will commission 12 full-page, full-color illustrations by noted fantasy artist Amanda Kahl and use them in place of the historic fine art images that currently appear at the beginning of the Introduction and Chapters 1-11. \nSketches by Amanda Kahl of some of the images that will appear as chapter heads in the book.\n$5,000: Pilgrimage Route (new Religious Place; Michael O. Varhola). Whether located entirely within cities or stretching through the lands between them, trails connecting religious places and walked by heroes, deities, and demigods can be great venues for quests of all sorts. \n$6,000: Tournament Ground (new Entertainment Place; Clint Staples). From Medieval jousting fields to athletic facilities like Olympia, tournament grounds can be places for characters to both enjoy spectacles and test their mettle against others. \n$7,000: Observatory (new Scholarly Place; William T. Thrasher). Knowing if the stars are right for launching quests, understanding constellations, and interpreting astrological phenomena are among the things that might lead characters to visit observatories of various sorts. \n$8,000: Farm (new Tradesman Place; Michael O. Varhola). Agriculture is the basis of most civilizations and farms among their most common features and are, consequently, places characters are likely to visit in the course of their adventures. \n$9,000: Caravanserai (new Service Place; Clint Staples). From fortified rustic inns to walled campgrounds in deep deserts, secure rest areas along trade routes are often vital resources for everything from merchant caravans to adventurous characters travelling from one land to another. \n$10,000: Mortuary (new Tradesman Place; William T. Thrasher). Properly preparing the deceased for burial or whatever other way their remains will be disposed of is important in all cultures (and can be even more critical in worlds where the dead do no always remain quiet). \n$11,000: Hermitage (new Religious Place; Michael O. Varhola): From hollow trees, rough caves, and lonely ruins, to neat woodland cottages, places used to shelter and nurture a spiritual environment for religious ascetics might be either deliberately visited or stumbled upon by characters in the course of their explorations. \n$12,000: Laundry (new Service Place; Clint Staples). Characters who have to look their best and rid themselves of dust from the road or the blood of their foes might need to visit laundries (which can themselves serve as venues for interesting encounters and adventures). \n$13,000: Water Feature (new Service Place; Michael O. Varhola). From natural oasis and springs to ornate fountains erected in city squares, places where people can obtain fresh water are essential to communities of all sorts and sizes. \n$14,000: Mint (new Craftsman Place; Jim Clunie). Coinage is one of hallmarks of sophisticated mercantile societies and the places devoted to creating money are among those most closely guarded from bandits, foreign agents, and other enemies. \n$15,000: Trade Fair (new Mercantile Place; Michael O. Varhola). Seasonal fairs where merchants meet to trade goods from different lands are key to the economies of communities and the countries of which they are part, and can also have important religious and entertainment aspects. \n$16,000: Animal Trainer (new Tradesman Place; Michael O. Varhola). Whether they need to purchase wardogs and mounts or have creatures like griffons and dragons trained, characters will have to visit the facilities of animal trainers of various sorts. \n$17,000: Map Maker (new Craftsman Place; Michael O. Varhola). Characters needing to navigate their way across foreign lands or distant seas may seek information about such strange places from those skilled at creating maps of all sorts. \n$18,000: Colosseum (new Entertainment Place; Michael O. Varhola): Purpose-built amphitheaters used for everything from gladiatorial combats to mock naval battles are among the places built by affluent societies to entertain their populations. \n$19,000: Taxidermy Shop (new Craftsman Place, Michael O. Varhola). Whether they want to have monsters they have slain preserved for posterity or more effective animation, or learn about obscure creatures they expect to encounter, characters might find themselves visiting the workshops of taxidermists. \n$20,000: \u201cIn the Footsteps of Hercules\u201d Companion Book. This specific example of a Pilgrimage Route will be at least twice as long as a regular entry of this sort (e.g., 3,000-4,000 words). It will include an overview of the trail and its history, synopsis of its twelve stages and the prevailing terrain and conditions associated with them, entries for all the major communities along it, and a number of adventure hooks. It will be system-free and compatible with any traditional fantasy campaign setting. \n$21,000+: For every $1,000 from this point onward we will add one new specific place that can be found along Footsteps of Hercules pilgrimage route (e.g., a Temple devoted to Hercules, a pilgrim Hostel established in the ruins of an ancient citadel, a Shrine dedicated to the goddess Hera, the Tournament Ground established by Hercules for the Olympic Games). Each will include a detailed description, information about non-player characters associated with it, a custom map/floorplan, a custom full-color illustration, and two or three adventure hooks.

Wouldn't it be nice if they couldn't wait to play around in your world? If they were pushing you to spend more time in the land you create?\nThat's why I developed these downtime procedures over decades of play and now I can share it with you!\nWhat's in it? \nSystems that motivate players\nSimple usable procedures that work\nCreativity and inspiration for adventure\nNo longer will your players wonder what their characters should do with all their gold. It includes clear, common-sense rules for everything from starting a cult, making sacrifices to gods, to hiring mercenaries and building vehicles and castles.\nGoing to an arena fight? Take seconds to determine the purse, peruse mechanics to handle the arena crowd, pick some ideas for interesting arenas, and select an opponent like the Necrourge: a master of the dark arts of necrourgy, who raises the bodies of traitors or other criminals after they have been forced to fight in the arena and died. \nI've got a vision of usable downtime procedures that motivate players and provide inspiration to Dungeon Masters collected in a published volume. I want one for my table. But I don't have the funds to hire a cover artist. So I'm Kickstarting this to pay Skullfungus (\"I draw dungeons, their inhabitants and everything in between\") to create a beautiful cover. The book is written, layout is effectively complete, and nearly all of the interior art is finished. \nWhat's it for?\nThe downtime goals give agency to players, and let them build a dynasty. Imagine a group eager to explore your world because they have their own plans! These objective procedures give players tools that fire a desire to dive into your creative world, discover its detailed history, and make their mark on it.\nIt gives your players the tools to make their wildest ideas come to life, without breaking your campaign or your suspension of disbelief, all the while driving them to adventure in your world. On Downtime and Demesnes is filled with tools that work. Build a flying ship, enchant it; or build a wizards tower and raise fortifications in the surrounding lands. All with simple, scalable, rules. \nThis is a book used in every game you run. Your next campaign, the one after that, the one after that. . . Not one wasted word. Every page is crammed with content and creativity. No filler. Tools that let players build castles and control land, without disassociated mechanics. This is the stronghold book you've been looking for. \nCurious about the content? Check out the table of contents from the book. Want to see what's written? Back the project and read the art free PDF.\nWhat are the Details?\nThere are two versions, one for basic Dungeons & Dragons, compatible with classic games, and one for 5th edition games. I play both kinds of games, and I needed rules for this while running my megadungeon using Basic and Expert Dungeons & Dragons, as well as world-spanning campaigns using 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. Both are A5 softcover, designed for portability and quick reference at the table. No one wants to lug around another hardcover to their local game. \nThis Kickstarter is also part of the Break Kickstarter promotion! Instead of providing stretch goals, you'll be going on a \"choose your own adventure\" by selecting different content for gaming creators to add to the book! Once the Kickstarter funds, find out the name of the first creative. At 1,500$, the backers will decide what they will add to the book, and we'll unveil the next creative on the list!\nStretch Goals\nWell that took off! \nEvery day, we are going to vote on new stretch goals. Will we unlock them all?\nWho am I?\nI'm an independent writer and artist, who's been producing gaming and gaming-related products for years. You've likely already read stuff I've written. My free book, Tricks, Traps, and Empty Room Design, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times; my blog Hack & Slash has been popular for years; and since I've gone full time, my high-level module Eyrie of the Dread Eye has nothing but five-star reviews.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, but the work is written, the art and layout are mostly complete, and the stretch goals are small pieces (<2000 words) of bonus content. The layout can't be 'completely complete' until the stretch goal content is in, but I've been working with Indesign for over a decade now. I have finished products like this dozens of times, and consistently receive astounding 4.5+ star ratings on my products. \n\nI have a lot of experience working with DriveThruRPG to produce printed copies. I expect all the extra content (the color art for the cover and the articles by guest writers) to be complete within 6 weeks of project completion, and checking the print proofs for sale approval to take 6 weeks. This provides an extra 8 weeks as a buffer for issues and late content. I expect digital copies to be distributed in mid-October, and print copies to be available on DriveThruRPG by the end of November. \n\nI don't suffer from depression, and I am a productive person who is online frequently. I like to work. The fact that the project is nigh complete except for the cover, all bonus content is already planned and accounted for, and the only external systemic reliance is DriveThruRPG give me a great deal of confidence I can complete this project on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Peasant", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the draft of the book, vote on stretch goals, and follow the campaign updates!\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to a copy of the art-free draft of the book\nAbility to vote on stretch goals\nFollow comments and backer updates!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["172 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Citizen", "descp": "This gives you access to a digital copy of the final book!

A few years ago, another company successfully launched an Evil Dead 2 board game campaign that was never fulfilled to its backers. This other company collected all of the money and delivered nothing to thousands of Evil Dead 2 fans that participated in their project. Because of this travesty, Jasco Games, in collaboration with Lynnvander Studios, the Evil Dead 2 licensing group, and our other partners have come together to bring Evil Dead 2 The Board Game back from the dead. We're calling this campaign a Heartthrob Campaign. What that means is if this campaign successfully funds, all of the backers of the previous campaign (that we had nothing to do with), will be getting a copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game for only the cost of shipping (that's right, free + shipping). \nReturning Backers\nWe cannot deliver exactly what previous backers pledged for, as that was not our project, however, we hope that you will all love this game and appreciate what we are trying to do for our beloved gaming community. Our Evil Dead 2 board game is an entirely NEW game designed by Lynnvander Studios and directed and tested heavily by Jasco Games and our play testers. If you were one of many backers of the previous campaign, refer to the section below called \u201cOriginal Backers\u201d  to find answers to some commonly asked questions and to verify that you are on our backer list to receive your copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game.\nNew Backers\nIf you are a new backer, we welcome you as well! You will not only be getting a fantastic board game for $59 (An $80 retail value game when it hits stores), that is completely designed, tested and ready to print upon funding of this campaign, you are also helping bring thousands of people a new copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game! They really got hurt by the other company and we, as a community, are very proud to have the opportunity to do right by those backers. \nIf you have already done the math on this, you will see that this Kickstarter campaign was designed to do a good thing. Profit is not the main purpose of the campaign, which is why we are selling the games as close to our production cost as possible while including the free game to original backers into that cost.\nSo, now that's explained, let's take a look at this beautiful board game, shall we?\nNow includes Combat Ready Ash!\n\n1. Search For Items \n2. Battle Deadites \n3. Evil Can Get In You, And Turn You BAD!!!\n4. Battle Your Former Friends \n5. Seal The Portal (Or Open It) \n6. Save The World  \nYou know how it is. You get together with your friends and decide to have a nice weekend in the woods. Maybe head up to the cabin, go for a walk in the woods. No city, no distractions, just some time with your mates and your girl. Groovy!\nAnd then some evil darkness decides to crash your party, possessing people. And before you know it, the dead start rising from the ground, looking for this magic book or perhaps just a tasty snack. The only hope to stop them is to find that book ourselves and seal the portal near the cabin. But be careful, \u2018cause the evil can get in you and turn you bad. And evil has its own plan for the portal, wanting to open it up and release Deadites on the world.\nIt\u2019s down to us to save the world.\nDetailed Model Turns (Good & Evil)\n\nHuman Ash and Deadite Ash\nHuman Linda and Deadite Linda\n\nHuman Ed and Deadite Ed\n\nHuman Annie and Deadite Annie\n\nHuman Jake and Deadite Jake\n\nHuman Bobby-Jo and Deadite Bobby-Jo\n\n Monstrous Bosses\n\nKiller Tree, Henrietta, and The Hand\nRotten Apple Head and Limbs\n\n\n                      CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK! \n\n Evil Dead 2 Cinestory - The Movie as A Graphic Novel! \n\nThis 332 Page hardcover book is a full color illustrated graphic novel of the entire Evil Dead 2 movie.

One integrated, innovative system - Infinite Creativity!\nAs Till, CEO of DUNGEONFOG, puts it: \n\u201cWe want to help Game Masters and storytellers to focus on their story, while they create a living, breathing, interconnected map system for their narratives.\u201d\nSince it our campaign story has become rather long and this has been requested: If you are looking for the ONE-TIME-BUY KEY check out our Platinum pledge level. More info can be found down in the Stretch-Goal section\nPROJECT DEIOS will allow for the seamless combination of battlemaps, city maps, regional maps and entire world maps. Our DEIOS suite will connect previously incompatible types of maps to offer an interconnected experience for boundless map-making. \nOnce we\u2019ve realized our vision, the \u201cDEIOS Suite\u201d will be integrated into the existing DUNGEONFOG Editor. We\u2019ll offer diverse packages for our users so that everyone will be able to choose the tools most suitable for their needs. \nCore Functionalities\nOur base funding includes all DEIOS Suite core functionalities that need to be developed from scratch. Other base functionalities, like brushes and shape tools, are already available through the DUNGEONFOG Battlemap Editor and are not listed here:\nThe Citybuilder coherently assembles sections according to archetypes - e.g. poor human district or elvish administrative quarters - and logically auto-generates housing structures, squares and parks.\nEach house is equipped with its own automatically generated map-notes, including residents per house, construction costs, etc. and will be used to create note-based outlines for your cities. As is customary for the DUNGEONFOG system, notes can always be edited and expanded.\nEvery section can be set to a specific archetype, which will affect the random asset-pool for buildings:\nWealth level: Poor, Average, Rich, etc.\nType of building: Merchants, homes, administration, etc.\nRace/Species: Dwarven, Elvish, Human etc.\nPlan Settlements With Just A Few Clicks\nYou can also place landmarks and buildings manually. Temples, markets, towers, etc. can be planted precisely where you want them to be at any time. The remaining space can then be filled with buildings based on the selected archetype of the section.\nPin locations and link them to battlemaps\nPlay directly on the maps with our Fog-of-War viewer\nEach building, square and street can be mapped out in as much detail as you desire and require, including battle and dungeon maps. Let your imagination guide you without boundaries!\nClever Coding For Boundless Creation\nVector-based drawing enables you to manipulate landmasses to an unprecedented extent: Select, move or resize landmasses without losing quality on the graphics. Add, subtract or even combine landmasses to create unique regions. \nVector-based drawing allows you to revisit and manipulate all objects\nNever before was composing original regions and landmasses easier and more intuitive. By cleverly balancing tool functionality and harmonic art composition, the DUNGEONFOG core mechanics offer the perfect fusion of practical application and elegant map design.\nBIOMES\nBiomes are quickly and easily allocated with an intuitive brush tool. This renders different forms of vegetations, geographical formations and landscapes effortlessly and stylishly.\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Grassland\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Forest\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Mountain range\nWith PROJECT DEIOS, you will have access to a base setting for fantasy assets that will include more than 200 assets, for biomes like:\nBiome Samples\nSince the monthly DUNGEONFOG prop packs enjoy high popularity, we will continue to develop new textures, settings and props on a regular basis.\nPROJECT DEIOS combines all your ideas, detailed maps and concepts for continents into one giant map model. Through clever segmentation and the gradual increase of detail complexity, your world creation is a stable, coherent concept without boundaries.\nAdvanced Export Functions\nEach region can be selected, viewed and exported separately, including all contained landmarks and linked maps. The scales are automatically adjusted to fit your viewport and level of zoom.\nPolitical borders can easily be drawn - the DUNGEONFOG core functions circumvent unwanted overlaps and neatly translate all attributes to practical and editable Game Master notes.\nClimate zones, water currents and other characteristics are effortlessly added with easy-to-use brushes. Each feature stays continuously editable, allowing you to change or add whatever you want as your story progresses.\nEach landmark you place on your creation is automatically attributed its individual location. PROJECT DEIOS stores all locations, landmarks and properties in a geospatial data model. This allows your creativity to venture out endlessly, because map sizes are almost unlimited.\nBuilding an entire world from scratch might seem a bit intimidating. With the community maps feature, you can form creative alliances and collaborate on your storytelling endeavors. You can also share your worlds or use and adapt maps from fellow Game Masters or authors. There is no need to hide your creativity away - be proud and enrich multiple adventures with your ideas!\nJoin A Community Full Of Stories And Creation\nThe three pillars of DUNGEONFOG have always been \u201cPlan - Create - SHARE\u201d. We will stay true to our core functionalities, even while expanding our scope to make effortless world creation a reality.\nA great advantage of the innovative DUNGEONFOG map-making toolset is the simple but crucial feature that every object, entity and map stays perpetually editable and can be reused and even shared. This enables Game Masters, Authors, Storytellers and RPG enthusiasts to collaborate, exchange feedback and help improve each others\u2019 worlds. \nYou can draw from the users' collective creativity by using community maps, adapt them to your story\u2019s needs and make your own original ideas accessible to others.\nCollaboration Opportunities\nWe\u2019ll even go a step further, and explore how we can make collaboration between multiple authors on shared maps a possibility. Collaboration is not just working together on one map - but also using other users\u2019 maps to add to your own stories. Discovering a beautiful world map will spark new ideas and with PROJECT DEIOS, you\u2019ll have the platform to add your own creative stories to existing maps and let marvellous adventures unfold.\nWe think that everybody should be able to create maps with the new DEIOS Suite! After launch, we\u2019ll offer Free Access with limited features to everyone.\nIf you'd like to have access to all of our features, consider backing us at the Bronze level or higher for access to the full DEIOS Suite. \nKickstarter only\n\n\nYou and your support through Kickstarter will bring the DEIOS Suite to life. So we\u2019re offering you special bargains as a thank you, which are only available exclusively during this Kickstarter campaign:\nKickstarter-Exclusive Art Packs\nWhen supporting our campaign at Silver (pick one), Gold (pick two) or Platinum (all) level, you will receive our additional, Kickstarter-exclusive art packs, each containing 25 assets for cities, regions and world maps.\nKickstarter-Exclusive Video Series By The GreatGM\nCreating entire worlds with manifold distinct areas and settlements offers possibilities for near endless adventures. It might be easy to get lost in boundless creativity and to lose sight of one's goals, were it not for the guidance of wise masters and the help of fellow adventurers. \nIn his exclusive 6-part video series, The GreatGM lends Kickstarter supporters (Gold level and above) a helping hand and shares his vast knowledge of worldbuilding and storytelling. Since his new series is exclusively tailored to the DUNGEONFOG system and the  DEIOS suite, all viewers can expect valuable hands-on tips and masterful tricks from The GreatGM himself.\nDUNGEONFOG, World Anvil, GreatGM and Caeora Have Teamed Up For This Project\nAt its core, DUNGEONFOG was founded to support Game Masters and storytellers on their creative journey, and to make map-making easy, intuitive and practically useful. But we\u2019ve realized that we\u2019re not alone on this quest. World Anvil, The GreatGM and Caeora also aim to transform map-making, storytelling and worldbuilding into an extraordinary experience for you. So we\u2019ve teamed up!\nPROJECT DEIOS is our shared vision - ONE system that can support ALL your map-making and storytelling needs. DUNGEONFOG was a massive Kickstarter success back in 2017, and our toolset makes the mapping process effortless, quick and perpetually interconnected. With these incredible partners, we\u2019ve formed a team of experts in the world of storytelling, worldbuilding and map-making to make PROJECT DEIOS a reality.\n www.dungeonfog.com \n www.worldanvil.com \nwww.greatgamemaster.com\nwww.caeora.com \nWorld Anvil Integration\nOur partner World Anvil brings a lot of experience with collaboration features to the table. Drawing on their expertise, we will develop a permission-based co-authoring, commenting and sharing system. Simultaneously, we have a keen eye on the smooth technical connection between DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil. \nWe\u2019ll start with basic integration features, like accessibility of DUNGEONFOG maps while editing a world in World Anvil, or accessing your written world descriptions as a resource while creating maps in the DUNGEONFOG editor. \nWe\u2019ll also pay attention to the functionality of pins: Creating locations will auto-generate pins, and therefore, redundant manual pinning will not be necessary. In addition, we\u2019re exploring many ways to integrate World Anvil\u2019s extensive Campaign Manager and their character manager, Heroes, with PROJECT DEIOS. For example, our player viewer could be integrated with Heroes, so that all party members know their location at all times, or the location of the main villain.\nEasy Collaboration\nThe joint communities from DUNGEONFOG, World Anvil and The GreatGM is a thriving community of map makers, storytellers, writers and Game Masters at your disposal. This makes sharing resources easy as never before. A thriving community also enables you to cheer for great maps by others and draw motivation from users that used your work.\nArtwork and Assets Will Be Created By Caeora \nThe assets will not only be created in his beautiful unique style, but will also pay attention to scaling & line art so that every map you create will always look stunning - whether you play digitally or export them in high resolution.\nOur dream is to help Game Masters, Authors and storytellers create entire worlds in all their detailed glory. Creating something this boundless is a huge endeavour! \nOur primary goal is to get enough funding to cover an additional developer and have enough funds to pay our partners for their work.  \nTo cover all core functionalities, we estimate the costs to be around 100,000 EUR (about $112,140). Since we launched DUNGENFOG, we managed to build up some resources that cover about 40% of the estimated development costs. Our partners agreed to help us with an additional 10%, which means we can already cover 50% of the development costs of our DEIOS Suite.\nSo we don\u2019t ask you to fully finance our dreams - rather, your support could pick us up halfway and carry us to the finish line. Therefore, we set the funding goal to 50,000 EUR (about $56,070). With additional  resources, we can hire additional developers and speed up the development process immensely, getting DEIOS into your hands sooner!\nProject DEIOS Pricing After Launch\nWe want to make sure that prices are compatible with using the DUNGEONFOG system as a hobby. At this point, we estimate the full package (meaning the \u201cDEIOS suite\u201d including the DUNGEONFOG Battlemap Editor) to cost around \u20ac 7.90 (about $8.80) per month. \nBattlemaps are included in DEIOS - so you only need the DEIOS subscription\nOur DUNGEONFOG battlemap subscription will remain untouched and will be available as a separate subscription as well.\nWe will offer monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly subscription models with respective discounts. As is usual for DUNGEONFOG, you\u2019ll always be able to pause your subscription without losing your creative work. \nWhile planning this project, it was highly important to us that we grant our supporters early access to the DEIOS Suite development stages. Therefore, our timeline includes several stages of development releases to keep waiting time short, while at the same time enabling room for early feedback and improvement. \nNow that we have reached our funding goal - let's talk about stretch goals! \nAs enthusiastic map makers and RPG adventurers, we have a full array of additional ideas we thrive to implement - so here they are:\nPortals and Planes - FUNDED!\nPROJECT DEIOS is conceptualized to evolve and grow infinitely. Our first stretch goal includes the possibility to not only build an entire world, but to conceptualize multiple planes of existence. To support even the most fantastic ideas, we will offer biomes and props to create adventures taking place in five additional settings - and it is up to you to decide which ones will be included in the DEIOS Suite. \nWhen we reached this stretch goal after the end of the PROJECT DEIOS Kickstarter, we will give backers the opportunity to vote for their 5 favorite settings, which could include:\nWe will notify all eligible (silver+) backers after the campaign where to place your vote\nOnce the stretch goal is reached and the funding is over, we will contact all eligible (Silver+) backers and ask you to help us decide on the new settings.\nIf you would like to add to that list, join us on Discord or post here in our campaign comments with the addition: \u201cSETTING -\u201d  (Example: \u201cSETTING - Candyland\u201d).\nOnce the campaign is over, we will send you a link to our voting tool and you can help us to determine what of those 5 settings will be created first.\nEach setting will include artwork for biomes, city buildings and landmarks and will contain more than 100 different assets for your worlds.\nThe setting will then be available with ALPHA 2 so you can test and review it as soon as possible.\n SOLAR SYSTEMS, STARMAPS and 3D World Mapping - FUNDED!\nEven multiple planes of existence are not enough for you? \nWhen we reach this stretch goal, you don\u2019t need to feel tied to one world alone - let your imagination venture out into unexplored galaxies and the unlimited possibilities of space. \n When reaching this stretch goal, we will add tools to create \nGalaxies\nSolar Systems\nand mapping tools to create a 3D mapping of your world as globe, disc, cylinder or dyson spheres.\nAll maps will remain linkable and you will be able to expand your creation into whole universes.\n RANDOM LANDMASS SEEDING AND CITY GENERATOR - FUNDED!\nWhile creating entire worlds and galaxies, not every village, town or region has to be created individually. Sometimes, a specific vision of a city demands special attention to detail only in certain places, while other districts could be more generally conceptualized. \nOr a story calls for a highly characteristic and specific shoreline, while the vast central plains don\u2019t need to contain that much detail. \nFear not, we have you covered: When we reach this stretch goal, we will develop a tool set to generate entire cities and landmasses randomly. All you have to do is adjust the parameters to you needs and create a randomly generated map.\n Random city generator: Adjust size, demographics and layout (medieval , western, etc.) and we will randomly populate your city map with districts and buildings.\n Random landmasses: Adjust landmass-types amount of water on you map, sizes,  island scatter and more to randomly generate world maps.\n Save the seed for your randomization and share it with your friends\nTo celebrate this unlocked stretch goal, we have added an additional +25 Asset Pack to the pool!\n\u20ac 175.000 - New Setting - FUNDED\nWith 175k funded, Caeora will now add another new setting that you can vote on at the end of the campaign.\n\u20ac 250.000 DESKTOP APPLICATION - FUNDED\nWe can now hire an additional application developer full time and finish the desktop application together with the launch of DEIOS.\nOne-Time-Buy License Keys\nAll Platinum backers (and beyond) will receive in addition to all the other rewards 1 license-key to the standalone desktop application, which will run without subscription.\nThis means, that during our extended development time and beyond you will have:\nAccess to our ALPHA and BETA (online), \nAll Kickstarter settings and artpacks (also as part of your standalone license).\nPremium Access to Online DEIOS Suite until Desktop App has been released.\n1 License Key to standalone desktop application, that you can either use to activate your standalone desktop application, or gift a friend.\nAbout the Desktop Application\nOnce released, the software will available for download to any premium user at no additional cost.\nIn addition, we will offer a standalone license, that comes without subscription.\n+\u20ac 25.000 - The Indefinite Stretch Goal x6\n\n For every additional \u20ac 25.000 beyond our 250k stretch goal (275k, 300k, etc.) we'll increase the assets for all 7 settings by: \n + 50 battlemap assets  \n  + 15 additional landmarks  \n  + 15 additional special buildings for cities\nAnd + 50 new assets for solar systems & galaxies\n(in total 600+ assets)\n\n\nStep 1 - UNLOCKED: Digital badges for DUNGEONFOG and WORLDANVIL | +1 asset\nSuccess! All backers will be able to claim these exclusive badges for their DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil profiles. And every backer will receive one additional exclusive LANDMARK ASSET added to his DUNGEONFOG account (You will be able to vote on the assets in our Kickstarter survey). \nStep 2 - UNLOCKED:  +3 month | + 3 asset\nSuccess! With all three Social Stretch Goals unlocked, we are now adding + 3 MONTH run-time to all PROJECT DEIOS subscriptions and every backer will receive three additional exclusive LANDMARK ASSET added to his DUNGEONFOG account (You will be able to vote on the assets in our Kickstarter survey). \nStep 3 - UNLOCKED: 3x +25 Asset Packs\n Wow - You have unlocked ALL our social Stretch goals!

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project has the potential to completely change the lives of all of us here at the studio, so we're putting our all into it.\n\nWe've been very open with the development of DUNGEONFOG so far and we take comments and concerns from our community very seriously. In fact, a lot of the changes in the editor came from community suggestions. We will continue to take and implement suggestions for Project DEIOSlong after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to make everything compatible with as many operating systems & browsers as possible. Due to the use of newer tech, some older computers and browsers will not be able to support all features. Please try the free version of DUNGEONFOG to see if your computer has problems running the current battlemap editor.\n\nWe\u2019re aiming for fairly regular build updates with monthly intervals, and the progress can be seen by all. When we say we will try to include something, we really will find a way to try it. We will try our hardest to make DEIOS a tool everyone will enjoy and will remember.\n\nWeb development isn't always smooth sailing and there are a lot of uncertainties (especially the programming part), so that's why we\u2019ve added a bit of a cushion to our timeline and chose Spring 2020 for the release date. This will give us a bit of breathing room so that we can get it to you on schedule... or maybe even earlier!\n\nIf it comes out early, it'll be a pleasant surprise.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*** For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Set in the heart of the Palace of Mists, the legendary comic book hero Okko and his traveling companions must hunt down powerful Oni (demons) and thwart their dark conspiracies.  \n\nBeyond the Gates of Jigoku  \nThis new expansion compels Okko and his band of intrepid demon hunters to pass through the hellish Gates of Jigoku to fight its demonic denizens in their own realm. But beware, for in the dark and desolate domain of the oni, their corruption is much more powerful than anything your adventurers have experienced in the world of the living!   \nOni Hunters \nThis expansion gives you the opportunity to play new scenarios or replay your favorite scenarios, without the need for an Oni Player by introducing both cooperative and solitaire modes to your Okko Chronicles games. Now the game is playable for 1 to 5 players ! \nMiniatures Storage Box\nA box to store all the miniatures from Okko Chronicles.   \n\n\n\nThis expansion includes several new tiles representing the hellish environments of Jigoku. \nNot bound by the physical laws of the mortal world, this nightmarish realm seems to conform only to its own twisted and devious logic.   \nAs a result, the Jogoku tiles can rotate, flip or even be replaced entirely during the course of a game, making adventures in the ever-changing kingdom of the oni an extremely disconcerting prospect...   \nThe following symbols are used on these new tiles to tell you how they are revolved: \n At the beginning of the game, each Hero takes a card to track their current level of corruption and its effects as they explore the lands of Jigoku. \nThe longer a hero remains in these accursed lands, the more likely they will be to fall under the influence of its evil influences.   \n  Fortunately, some of their equipment may mitigate the harmful effects of Jigoku\u2019s rampant corruption. \n\nOverview of the Cooperative / Solo system:    \nThis expansion allows everyone to play the Okko Chronicles scenarios as Heroes, without the need for one of them to take on the role of the Oni and its agents.\nOverview of the Cooperative / Solo system:    \nAt the end of each Strategy phase, players draw the top  card from the Adventure deck:\nThis card indicates how to place or move the Corruption tokens on the board, what Enhancements the Oni\u2019s Mortal Thralls or Supernatural Creatures will gain and any effects that will need to be resolved until the end of the round.     \nDuring the Activation phase, after a Hero has finished their Activation, the players draw a Reaction card. This card indicates which of the Oni\u2019s agents are activated and what actions they will perform.  \n\nNo SG included\nAs the various Stretch Goals are unlocked, they will be added to the Beyond the Gates of Jigoku and Oni Hunters expansion boxes.   \n\n\nOkko is a comic book that chronicles the adventures of a ronin and his companions as they hunt demons and other evil creatures across the continent of the Pajan.\n  The saga is divided into 5 cycles, each inspired by a critical element that sets the tone of the adventure\u2019s narrative: The Cycle of Water, The Cycle of Earth, The Cycle of Air, The Cycle of Fire and The Cycle of Emptiness. \nHUB, the author of the Okko saga, has created many new illustrations and unique characters that will accompany Okko and his companions in their latest adventure. \nOkko Chronicles miniatures are on average 35mm in height. This scale is based on the height to the eyes of an adult human character.\n  Some miniatures will be much larger, while others will have smaller proportions, depending on the characters they represent.\n  For us, the quality of the miniatures is a priority and you can expect a level of detail equivalent to those shown here. \nIf you wish to order more than one copy of the game, it is possible to add as many Ronin (\u20ac80), Hunter (\u20ac45) or Master Hunter (\u20ac125) pledges as you want. Shipping costs will be reduced for each additional copy added!\n  And of course, each pledge is accompanied by all unlocked Stretch Goals!\n\n\nAll costs shown are in Euro (\u20ac) and are based on the exchange rate posted at the launch of this campaign (approx. \u20ac1 = $1.13).\n  Any pledges that are confirmed after the close of the 'pledge manager' will be dispatched at a later date from our European distribution hub, which may significantly increase the estimated shipping costs above. \nThe RED JOKER is an established board game publishing company whose CEO, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Condette, has been working in the games industry for nearly 20 years.

Since then, Aslak \u2013 Eye of the World was released by Delcourt in 2011. Written by HUB and Fred Weytens, drawn by Emmanuel Michalak and colored by S\u00e9bastien Lamirand, it tells the story of a Viking\u2019s quest for new stories. \nStephane Camosseto, Valentin Zak and Patrick Masson are 3 french freelance sculptors working in the miniature and collectible statues industry.\n  They have been working in this industry for 7 years for many different games and collectibles company, like CoolMiniOrNot, Guillotine Games, Demented Games, Studio McVey, Luftkrieg 1919, etc.\n  They have created Kazama Studio in order to gather their skills and be able to propose companies high end miniatures and bigger projects.\n  It was a pleasure working on this Okko\u2019s chronicles project with the awesome concepts from Hub. \nBorn in 1974, Arnaud Boudoiron has worked in a variety of sectors: press, publishing, advertising, comics and sculpture. He began a career as a sculptor for Rackham at the end of the 1990s. He is a talented artist and a gaming fanatic.\n  After working for several years in the comic book industry, he took advantage of the increasing interest in board games including miniatures to finally find his primary passion: sculpture. Arnaud has worked on games such as Zombicide, Black Plague, Conan, The Godfather, Mythic Battles, Rising Sun and Batman: Gotham City Chronicles. \nA passionate board gamer, Nicolas spends most of his free time immersed in their worlds. When he is not busy inventing new role-playing settings, he polishes the rules of his own system, modifying or honing the game mechanics of the games or preparing prototypes (though his wife would prefer him to be doing the dishes).   \nNicolas likes big games, whether they contain small wooden cubes or miniatures, provided that the theme is strong and is conveyed well through its mechanics.     \nA fan of Hub's work on Okko, and with dungeons crawlers some of his favorite games, Nicolas could not refuse a trip into the Pajan Empire with Okko and his friends. The RED JOKER is pleased to introduce his Solo and Cooperative game modes for Okko Chronicles! \nHaving graduated in sociology and Internet & multimedia engineering, specializing in transmedia, Andoniya joined The RED JOKER earlier in 2017 as its Community Manager.\n  A gamer in her free time, Andoniya particularly likes Vampire The Masquerade. She also loves games that tell real stories and allow her to play characters of her choice. A little geeky, she loves Goldorack (Grandizer), Pokemon and the X-Men. Her favorite heroine is none other than Wonder Woman. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our sixth crowdfunding campaign and we have already successfully delivered the following campaigns, The Valley of the Kings, Fortresses & Clans, Guardians\u2019 Chronicles: The Clash of Heroes and the first printing of Okko Chronicles. Meanwhile, our most recent campaign, Highway to Hell, is currently in production.\n\nIn regard to these two new expansions to the Okko Chronicles line; many of their core components have been finalized before the launch of this Kickstarter campaign, and many of the add=ons and Stretch Goals are already well into their pre-production. As a result, these should be ready to go to print before the end of this campaign.\n\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A ZERO RISK PROJECT OR CAMPAIGN. \nWhile this is not our first game like this, there will always be unforeseen developments in manufacturing and logistics that are beyond our control, as we have learned to our peril in the past. That being said, barring a catastrophic meteor impact, a zombie apocalypse or other forms of armageddon (holy or otherwise), we are pretty sure that, thanks to our previous experience, the game is well prepared and that we have chosen our partners wisely (manufacturers, printers, freight forwarders, distributors, etc.).\n\nRefund Policy\nAll pledges can be refunded up to 60 days before they leave the manufacturer, without question.

You have already taken us past all the stretch goals.\nThank you! \nAll of these stretch goals are things we would love to put into TaleSpire one day, but take significant resources. If we get funded to these levels we can make them a priority and get them to you sooner.\nPlease note that the US dollar estimates were made at the time we set up the Kickstarter and may differ from current values. However the amount in Norwegian Kroner (nok) is exact.\nHero Crafting System (~$175k USD / 1,486,647nok) \nAn entire system for building your own minis within TaleSpire. No 3D modeling experience required!\nCustomizable Rule System (~$225k USD / 1,911,404nok)\nWe will add a customizable engine which will arm players and GMs alike with all the information they need during play. It will place the knowledge at your fingertips without forcing your hand or taking control away from the GM.\nCyberpunk Themed Assets (~$275k USD / 2,336,160nok)\nAnd they did not weep, for there were so many worlds to conquer!\nThis stretch goal funds the slew of packs that will form the foundation of a cyberpunk world within TaleSpire.\nOh and for extra fun, here is a mini trailer for the cyberpunk assets!\nTaleSpire is a beautiful way to play pen and paper RPGs online. It's a place where you and your friends build and tell stories together.\nWe are marrying the beauty and physicality you find in miniatures with the expanse of digital worlds. Our aim is to get rid of everything that gets between you and your stories. And all of this whilst letting people be together regardless of where they are in the world.\nTaleSpire is not tied to a specific game or ruleset; if it's role-playing on a square grid we have your back.\nWe have already built the alpha and have been running it with the community for 6 months. Thanks to their support and feedback we know what still needs building, and what needs polishing. The community has really shown us how far they want us to take this.\nYour support will get us to Early Access. There is a solid 8 months of fulltime work to do and this Kickstarter will make that happen.\nFrom there we will take our solid base and expand it even further, once again grounding our moves in the needs of the Early Access community in the same way we have been with our Alpha community (HUGE LOVE TO THE TALESPIRE DISCORD GANG, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE :D).\nMost importantly we believe that, for this game to be made without compromise, it needs to be independent of publishers. We have looked around and whilst this idea seems to be obvious and has clearly been discussed for decades it has never been made in quite this way. We feel that is almost certainly due to how risky it would be to do it 'right'.\nDespite bringing a pile of experience to the table, we are still a new company and we knew it wasn't right for us to ask for your money until we knew exactly what this needed to be, and could prove we could do it.\nWe have a working alpha, active userbase, over 20 updates shipped and we publish multiple developer logs per week. Even before the alpha we were experimenting with a pile of different prototypes so we are confident with what we need to achieve.\nIn short we have been doing this for some time now and we know we can keep it up.\nThe primary goal of the Kickstarter is to fund TaleSpire's development for 8 months. This includes full time wages for the core developers, server costs, creative tools and legal services required to bring this game to Early Access.\nThe timeline is aggressive. 6 months to the Beta and then 2 months to polish for Early Access.\nWe will start the timer from the end of the Kickstarter campaign. As the two full-time developers live in Norway we will have to comply with laws regarding the mandated amounts of leave companies must provide, so that will be factored into the delivery dates.\nThe goal is that the Beta will ship in February and the Early Access in April.\nEarly Access will fund and guide the next stage of TaleSpire's life. We will keep talking to you about how you play and where the game needs to expand to serve your stories.\nWith the start of the Early Access we will also begin releasing asset packs at fixed, regular intervals and ALL of those will be free. Post-Early Access the packs are how we plan to fund our future.\nIf we are so blessed as to reach the stretch goals, we will begin developing them once we reach Early Access.\n\nTaleSpire has a lot within its walls; let's go on a stroll through the main features.\nBuilding and play are one\nTaleSpire is a place where building and play happen throughout the whole play session. Want to destroy a wall to reveal a secret passage? Do it! Want to rain down piles of gold from the heavens? Sure! At any moment the GM (or GMs) can jump into building mode and change anything without interrupting anything else.\nYou will be able to build anything from tiny one shots to sprawling campaigns. Each board can be up to 30km across and 10km tall. We will be looking to make them even bigger post-Early Access.\nA campaign can have as many boards as you can build, and you can copy entire boards \u2014 which makes it easy to create alternate versions in various states of disarray if that is what your story calls for.\nBuild together\nBuilding doesn't have to be a solo activity. Grant other people GM rights to your campaign and build your world together.\n\nGorgeous sculpted scenery and miniatures\nTaleSpire gives you assets that look so good you'll want to claw them out of your monitor. \nRoll Call! Click for higher res version\n\nControl the atmosphere\nA necromancer is performing a poignant resurrection that deserves something special! With a click you can dim the lights, bring in the music and captivate your players. \nAs the GM you can store lighting, weather and music into 'environment pillars'. These let you swiftly change the mood of a moment.\nRain, snow, night and day are coming and you can wield them.  \nCustomizable dice with HEFT\nIn game dice that not only look great but feel great to roll. \n\n\nFrom play testing we found out players would do it so much that we needed a way for the GM to grab control at important moments in the story. Speaking of which\u2026 \n\n Cinematic Mode\nA foolish dwarf steps on a pressure plate \u2014 suddenly the camera snaps across the room and a necromancer strides into view.\nAs the GM you are armed with Cinematic Mode. Set up camera angles and take direct control of what every player is seeing. In that moment they cannot move their pieces and you are free to narrate the perils they have stumbled into.\nSetting up shots\n\nTools! Rulers, indicators, compass, etc\nPoint to point distance? Diagonal movement? Area of effect? No need to estimate when you can use our built in tools to tell you exactly what's what.\nGMs can do this privately or share it with the group so all are in on the plot. \nAn example size indicator used when placing tiles\n\nGM Requests\nCertain player actions request approval from the GM. This means events can\u2019t be unveiled accidentally before they make sense in the story. \nTurn based mode\nChoose the line-up, orchestrate the rounds! Keeping track is easy when you can switch to turn based mode at any time. When in this mode only the player whose turn it is can command their creatures. \nPLAY\n\n\nName and tint your creatures before bringing them into the game\nNo need to wait until reaching the board to set up your hero. Before jumping in, prep as many creatures as you like and assign them their campaigns. \n\nChanging your mini's base\nVariety == spicy life. \nWe know it's a subtle thing but dang it some days maybe your base should match your armor. \n\nFog of war\nThis powerful system keeps the path ahead obscured in a shroud until it is time to reveal it. \nPLAY\n\nNote: This video shows one of our fog of war prototypes. We are introducing a visual representation for the fog in the Early Access.\n\nScaling creatures\nNeed a bigger troll? Shrunk by a spell? The scale feature is at hand to help you. \nEmotes & spells\nSometimes waggling a piece just doesn\u2019t cut it: pick from a selection of actions and unleash sounds, animations & visual effects to really let that fireball spell send its message. \nFilter your session history\nDid Jeff move 10 feet or 15? Settle it with the session history!\nUse filters to see only what is relevant in the moment. \nGrant access with the smack of a button\nInvite codes let you easily grant people access to your campaign and are copied straight to the clipboard to they are ready to be thrown into your chat client of choice. \nShare slabs of tiles effortlessly\nSharing a slab is trivial in TaleSpire. Copied tiles are immediately available to paste as text outside of TaleSpire making it trivial to share useful chunks. Naturally this works in reverse, copy the text and paste in TaleSpire to summon the slab to your hand. \nMusic and sound effects\nTaleSpire will come loaded with mountains of sound effects, ambience, and a full soundtrack. From dripping caves to rowdy taverns, we have you covered.\nHere is an early sample from the soundtrack:\nModding! Add your own tiles, minis and more\nThe mods are fun and numerous: take this!\nTaleWeaver is the tool we use to bring content into the game. Import your models and apply the magic that lets them work in TaleSpire. \nWith the Early Access we will also ship the base of the scripting layer. To begin with, this will be focused on controlling tiles and props, but the system is going to grow in a big way as we continue to expand the game.\nYou and your players will be able to get mods from our official site (not yet live), but also from collections created and maintained by other modders. This means the power stays with the community.\nBookmarks\nBookmark Panel Prototype\nA light to guide you when all other minds go blank\n...by which we mean, save any point of the board as a bookmark and jump there with a click of the mouse\nFoam scenery blocks\nPlacing tiny tiles to build a hill is tedious; use the foam blocks to lay out large tracts of land.\nTunnel through them to make a perfect lairs for creatures favoring the dark.\nPowerful prop system\nYou can scatter not just tiles but props across the land. Props can be attached to tiles in myriad ways, and they respond sensibly when a player pushes into them. Make your rich settings without worrying about any details blocking play.\nAsset & feature suggestion sites\nWe will have official places to submit ideas for assets and features. These will be used to help guide the future of the game. We also promise not to destroy the focus by trying to include everything.\nGM Overlay: Notes, Hidden tokens/chests containing stuff useful for running a campaign\nKeep track without being swamped. As a GM you have an overlay mode where you can leave yourself notes. Place tiles, minis and prepare scenarios, all out of sight of the players.\nAnd plenty more!\n\u266b The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began \u266b\nCheck out our roadmap to see a high level overview of our plans.\n\n\n\n Concept Art\nThe following is the concept sketches for the Kickstarter Exclusive Minis and an in-game first pass at the dice.\nSee these updates for more info:\nDice: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bouncyrock/talespire/posts/2587520 \nMinis:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bouncyrock/talespire/posts/2586452 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe big one is of course time-frame. We have done a lot of experimentation to know what we need but it remains a lot of work in a fairly short period of time. We will need to leave polish and feel of some systems to late in the cycle. We can't reduce the amount of work to do so instead we will simply be as open as we can as to how things are progressing so that nothing comes as a surprise.\n\nThe other is subtler. Making things simple is complicated. There are many 'obvious' ways to do things which make for a worse or inconsistent experience. We need to keep focused and stay true to the *feel* that we are going for even if that means not supporting every imaginable feature, and especially if they seem trivial.

We started designing and printing our own tabletop battle mats 4 years ago and since then we have developed an award winning range of Wargaming/RPG battle mats and accessories in a range of materials.\nWe published our first Battle Map Book in April 2018, and have since published additional fantasy and science fiction volumes. After this we will be designing two modern day, post apocalyptic and cyberpunk themed encounter map books, and we have two additional fantasy volumes ready to release towards the end of the year.\nThis is our 5th Kickstarter for a gaming accessory and our second focused on Battle Mat Books.\nOur Collaborators \nJames Gray, (aka quigonjim), is an illustrator and artist who will be producing the cover art for each of the Dungeon books. Former clients and books include the anthologies Zombies, Robots and Westerns for Accent UK Comics, the Kickstarter backed Amnesia Agents with Jason Cobley and the upcoming Brawler anthology, card art for Oligarchy from Entropic Games and poster and T-Shirt designs for the band Dead Man's Whiskey. He also has a substantial back catalogue of Superbike and MotoGP artworks.   \nJohn (JC) is co-authoring the adventure module along with Matt.\nAnd finally thanks to the Brighton Dice Saloon, our FLGS,  for hosting our video & photo shoot. You can find out more about them here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have identified the following risks, and I outline here how we are managing them:\n\n- Getting the price right\nIt sounds basic but when costing a project there are a lot of things to remember, and they all add to the cost! We have used our experience from 4 successful Kickstarters and having our range in retail & distribution to price our books. We are able to offer our backers a good deal for coming on board early, however we have ensured all the hidden costs, as well as the basics like printing and transport, are covered in our price.\n\n- Delay\nThe first delay risk is what we term \u201cmission slip\u201d! I.e. that the project expands into new areas which add time to deliver. We have a very clear vision of the product we want to deliver, and again we can call on our experience to ensure we deliver it in a timely manner! For example the designs, while they will evolve based on feedback and new designs hopefully added, are very much underway and a long way down the road already.\n\n- Product quality\nThe main risks for producing a book to replace & improve on a standard RPG battle mat is that you end up with a product which has all the disadvantages of both. To avoid this we believe the book must lay flat and must line up next to another book to allow the adventure to flow. We have been designing and producing Battle Map Books since 2018, and we have the experience of our existing, award winning range to testify we know how to make a good battle mat book! Light and portable as well as flat, easy to use (lays flat when opened, just open & roll!) you can back with confidence that we produce the highest quality products.\n\n- Print quality\nBy using our existing printers we know exactly what we are getting, and we can produce any of our existing library as an example of the high quality of their work. We know what is required of our designs in order to produce a work of art, and our printers can deliver it with us \ud83d\ude0a\n\n- Fulfilment issues\nShipping thousands of products worldwide can be a daunting prospect, and it is the area which can easily grind a project to a halt. We will be using a fulfilment expert \u2013 GamesQuest \u2013 who are best placed to ship our products in a timely manner. They are experts in their field and able to offer fast effective service so your books will be with you as planned! This also covers risks from Brexit as GamesQuest have contingency plans in place.\n\n- We don\u2019t fund\nThis is the worst case scenario. That we don\u2019t attract enough funding to move forwards. In order to attract backers we will promote this kickstarter heavily prior to launch and throughout its live run. We have a (rather modest) advertising budget for social media and we will be calling on our network of media contacts and online influencers to help us spread the word. We have also added a number of social media goals all aimed at getting word out there far and wide. We prefer to spread the word through the RPG community as opposed to online advertising as it allows us to keep our costs reasonable and deliver more product for the money. This is the approach which has seen us successfully fund 4 previous Kickstarters.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "The Digital Dungeon", "descp": "Receive the dungeon in digital format to print at home or use online.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital dungeon - All designs from the books in digital format\nAll Unlocked Digital Stretch Goals\nD&D5e Adventure module set in The Dungeon (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}], "stat": ["477 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "The Dungeon", "descp": "Get one copy of The Dungeon at \u00a35 less than retail price.\nThe Dungeon is Two Modular 12\"x12\"Books presented as a set.\n*Shipping charged at the one set rate for your location listed on campaign page in shipping section of Kickstarter after campaign ends for any physical goods.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n \u2022 $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included.

If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required). If you open your game and see that something is missing or broken, our customer service team will work hard to get you replacement parts and make things right. Simply contact them at https://support.cmon.com/hc/en-us.\nNote: Warranty does not cover accidental damage, theft, loss, or any other event that is not a manufacturing defect.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Blood Moon Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nBloodborne: The Board Game\nExclusive Kirkhammer Hunter\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["10,376 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Blood Moon Early Bird Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nBloodborne: The Board Game\nExclusive Kirkhammer Hunter\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "11,919 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "FAQ and Updated Rulebook", "update_content": "Welcome to the Dream, Hunters...\n\nNow that the game is released and we've gathered feedback from the community, we have assembled two core assets for you:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #118", "update_userinfo": "Update #118: You've Done Well.

Final rules are currently in progress.\nStill confused about what to pledge? CLICK HERE! \nCost:  While we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. There's a lot of plastic miniatures and awesome game to pack up here, and that doesn't make it any cheaper. Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.    \nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.  \nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. With so many different pledge levels and add ons, making sure the right pieces go in the right boxes takes time. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible. Most of the work for Tsukuyumi is already done, with some small tweaks and new content to be added. Of course you can\u2019t forget about all those minis either! They are going through their final stages of revisions as you read this, and then its time to print!  At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.  \nWhat does \"Exclusive\" mean? You've probably noticed we do not say Kickstarter Exclusive but rather show a logo with our image (or another company image) and the word exclusive.  What this means is that these items will never be available in retail and only through us or the company depicted on the logo.  However, while they may be available from us in the future, they will most certainly not be given away for free.  In most cases, the cost of putting together the same package you might back in our campaign is 50% or higher afterward.\nOther: Lastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.  \nWhy back this campaign? While we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you all the exclusive unlocked content which will not be available in retail... only through us.  Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands before someone can get it from an online retailer.  Lastly, we expect the standard retail version of the game to be $99 MSRP, which won't get any of the cool exclusives that you'll get on this campaign.  If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to taking a company retreat to the moon (it's research for the next expansions for Tsukuyumi. How else would we come up with this stuff?).\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

We are confident that we will hit our release goals with no problems, shipping delays or Acts of God notwithstanding.

The Fail Faster Playtesting Journal will guide you throughout your playtesting process to ensure that you\u2019re capturing the right information as well as guide you towards improving your design. \nAt its core, the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal contains pages to keep track of 36 playtests. The journal is most useful if you dedicate one journal to each game that you are designing, but you could easily use one journal to keep track of all the different games you\u2019re designing. Each section has been tested and planned for optimal use of space.\nHere's an overview of what's included in this journal. Scroll down lower to see more details about each section of the journal. \nHere's a video of Jamey Stegmaier going into more detail about his thoughts on the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\n\nThis journal got a lot better as we achieved certain thresholds! We earned badges throughout the campaign and once we earned enough badges for a stretch goal to be unlocked, we held a poll. The poll asked if you preferred to redeem the badges for the first stretch goal, or if you preferred to wait and save up the badges for a different stretch goal. Majority prevailed! With 12 badges left at the end of the campaign, there was one more vote, but we can't edit the campaign once it's closed, so here's a snapshot of where we ended up:   \nVIDEO EXPLAINING STRETCH GOALS\nHere's a video explaining how the Stretch Goals work, in case this didn't make any sense! \nRED TROPHIES\nWhenever we made it to the end of any row in the Stretch Goal chart, we also unlocked a RED TROPHY! Red trophies unlocked more content for the journal and didn't cost any extra badges! Here's what we unlocked:\n1) Contract Checklist: A checklist of everything you need to consider before signing that contract! \n2) Blind Playtest Feedback form: A form to provide your blind playtesters to ensure you get the feedback you need. This will only be included in the PDF since it doesn't really make sense to include in the final copy of the journal. As a reminder, everyone who backs this campaign for at least 1 physical copy of the journal will also receive the PDF! \n\nFail Faster is the culmination of ideas from Jay Cormier who co-designed all of the games pictured above, with many more signed to come out soon.  He has detailed his journey on how he got his games published along with Sen-Foong Lim, at www.bamboozlebrothers.com. He teaches Game Theory at the Vancouver Film School and has done so for the last 6 years.   \nIt's possible that content and images shown below could change by the time we go to print. Mostly this will be due to listening to feedback from you, the backers!\nPlaytesters and Scores: The top left corner includes spaces for name, version, number of tests and date. Then an area to write your playtesters name - including a box to indicate if it's their first time playing the game and columns to keep track of various scores, or even times when players achieve specific thresholds.\nTimes: Here\u2019s where you can keep track of the time it took to explain rules and play your game and if you were able to play to the end or not.\nRules Changes and Focus: Do you have any rules changes since your last playtest that you don\u2019t want to forget? Write them here before you start your playtest. Then keep track of any observations you have as well as any questions your playtesters asked you while playing.\nWinning Strategies: Keep track of the winning player\u2019s strategy up here to see, over time, if there are dominant strategies. There's a nice reminder here to take a photo of the end game state. This can be useful when analyzing afterwards.\nFeedback: Feedback from your playtesters is written here. The questions that are asked vary on each page, and start by assuming you\u2019re in the Alpha phase of game design and by the end of the journal, the questions are more geared towards games in the Gamma phase. \nAdditional tools and resources\nThe journal is full of other interesting tools and resources that will help make you a better game designer.\nDesigner Progress \nOn the fold out cover, ten behaviours have been identified that, when followed, will make you a better playtester of your game and ultimately, a better designer.\nWhen you have accomplished one of these behaviours in your playtest, shade in the next box. When you reach a badge on any of the rows, flip open the fold-out cover and colour in that badge on the front.\nIf we unlock the sticker stretch goal, then the journal will come with stickers of each badge which will really pop when placed on the cover!\nYou can also keep track of your overall designer level by totaling up the number of badges you\u2019ve earned from previous journals. Write in the lifetime sum total in the top of your journal. If we reach our sticker stretch goal, then there will be stickers available to indicate your level as a designer for all to see.\nGame Idea Generator\nThe inside of the fold-out front cover contains a Game Idea Generator. Simply roll 2 dice three times to get a random Mechanic, Theme and even a Constraint. Don\u2019t have 2 dice lying around? No worries because that\u2019s also built into the journal.\nSimply flip the journal open to any page and the bottom left corner will have a random 2d6 result. This can be handy while playtesting your game if you forgot dice. Twenty-six of the middle pages also have a random letter tile on it for those games that require a random letter.\nHow to Get Your Game Published (in PDF version only)\nThere's a guide showing you how to get your game published. \nManufacturer Considerations\nThe back cover will have a page full of information from manufacturer, Panda that will help you as a designer.\nScoreboard\nThe inside back cover has a scoreboard in case you need one during your playtest. It folds out too, so you can still use the rest of your journal! It also has a metric ruler along the side. \n Goals\nThe front page has an area for you to write your own SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound), and if you work towards those goals, they too can earn you badges that you can put on the cover.\n\nProtips\nThe bottom of each playtesting page contains a different ProTip that comes from over 10 years of designing board games.\n Game Crafter Coupon\nEvery Kickstarter version of the physical journal comes with a $5 coupon for The Game Crafter - a great source for components as well as print-on-demand games. The retail version and any digital version will not come with this coupon.\nWatch Jay Cormier get interviewed by Edo about Playtesting as well as the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\nHere's an interview by Inquisitive Meeple where Jay Cormier dishes out a lot of facts and history about the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal\n\nPhotos: Dylan Hamm, www.dylanhammphoto.com\nVideo: Nathan Watkins,  nathanwatkinsfilm.com \nWeb Design: Jason Gorber, www.bearshark.com\nGraphic Design of Journal: David Mak, www.honeycombgraphics.ca\nSocial Media Consultant: Gerald King III,  ko-fi.com/mrking ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I've had numerous games on Kickstarter (Belfort, Tortuga, This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us, But Wait There's More, In the Hall of the Mountain King), I've never had to run one myself.

We will work hard to make sure it is as smooth as can be. Together David and Heath have completed a combined eight Kickstarter campaigns. Each Kickstarter project brings many valuable lessons learned. Because of our experience, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver a quality product to you.\n\nWe have allotted time to finalize the project at the conclusion of the campaign, and then we will roll right into production. We have been working with our manufacturing partners in China and the United States for months on these Elder Dice designs to be sure the manufacturing process goes as smoothly as possible. We have a strong relationship with our fulfillment partner. These relationships are incredibly important and give us confidence in our ability to deliver your rewards in a safe and economical manner.\n\nHowever, with our experience, we know that unexpected issues can arise during the production process. Final preparations for manufacturing after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. Molds may breakdown and have to be recreated. We will not sacrifice quality, even if it pushes the schedule back!\n\nThere can also be delays with shipping. Products can be delayed at sea, there may be extended customs inspections, and even adverse weather conditions may slow down local delivery. \n\nAlso, please remember that the images shown on the Kickstarter page and in the video are prototypes. The final dice may differ in detail and color. But, when you support Elder Dice, we promise to keep you up to date about its progress from the campaign\u2019s close all the way to when the dice are shipped.

Whenever I'm struggling with a design, I read the next chapter, and without fail I always learn something from the featured designer.\u201d \n-Jamey Stegmaier, Designer of Scythe\n\n\"You are asking interesting questions. These are not the standard questions which I have heard lots of times and have a spontaneous and direct answer to them. Your questions make me think a little bit more.\"\n-Reiner Knizia, Designer of 600+ published games\n\n\u201cGabe Barrett is simply one one of the best interviewers out there. He\u2019s talking with some of the greats in the game industry, giving you deep insights into their processes and perspectives.\u201d\n-Luke Laurie, Designer of The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire\n\n\u201cTons of insight from the top designers of our modern tabletop games \u2013 both inspiring and educational.\u201d \n-Sami Laakso, Designer of Dale of Merchants\n\n\"Board Game Design Advice is never far from my desk, both because it's a useful reference piece when I need help, and because it's a fun read as a fan of game design.\"\n-JR Honeycutt, Designer of Fireball Island\nExtended audio interviews with Reiner Knizia and Tim Fowers\nJames Hudson's top 3 tips for getting published\nJR Honeycutt's top 3 tips for working with a developer\n\nYou'll receive a digital copy of the book in three different formats: PDF, ePub, and MOBI. When the book is complete, you'll get an email with download links.\n\nAt this level, you'll receive a paperback copy of the book, and you'll get it several weeks before the book is available anywhere else (GUARANTEED).\nSee shipping rates below.\n\nThe hardback version of the book will not be available anywhere else and comes with a special edition cover. Every copy will be numbered and signed by the author.\nIf you order a hardback, you'll also receive a digital copy of the book, a bookmark, some stickers, and a 6 month subscription to BGDL+.\nOh, and you get FREE shipping!\nWhat is BGDL+?\nBGDL+ is a spinoff of the Board Game Design Lab podcast. \nIt provides members with extra podcast episodes, exclusive interviews, giveaways, and more. It's a way for game designers to take their work to the next level.\nMembers also get free access to design contests like the Board Game Design Challenge coming up in May.\nTypically, you become a member through Patreon and pay by the month, but if you back this campaign to receive a hardback copy of the book, you'll get a 6 month membership for free (a $30 value).\n\nIf you're a registered retailer, and you'd like to get some copies to sell at your store, this is the level for you. You'll receive 5 paperback copies of the book at a 50% discount.\nShipping costs $5 for the continental United States and $10 for everywhere else.\nYou'll also receive a complimentary digital copy of the book.\nIf you want more than 5 copies, please send me a message, and we can work something out.\n\nAt this level, you'll receive a hardback and digital book, access to BGDL+, and you can sponsor 1 week of content on the BGDL Facebook page and podcast. You'll receive:\nA banner on the BGDL Facebook page\nA banner in the weekly newsletter and podcast announcement emails\nA 90 second ad before that week's podcast\nFirst come, first served. Click HERE to see if the week you want is available before selecting this reward. Please click the \"+\" icon to add your name, select the week you want, hit \"Update,\" and select this reward immediately afterward.\nThis is a great way to tell people about your upcoming Kickstarter or game release. Typical episodes of the BGDL podcast average around 3,000 downloads.\n*All banners and ads must be approved by Gabe.  \nAt this level, you'll receive a hardback and digital book, access to BGDL+, a bookmark, stickers, and two 1-hour coaching calls done over Skype to talk about anything game design related with Gabe.\nIf you've run into some design snags, need help with a Kickstarter, want another set of eyes on your project, or just need some encouragement, this is a great reward level to pick.\nDates and times of meetings will be coordinated after the campaign is over.\n\n *The paperbacks & hardbacks are EU friendly. \nStretch goals for a campaign like this are obviously a little different than a typical project in the board game space. I can't exactly upgrade to a linen finish or add extra miniatures. So, the stretch goals are going to add more content to the book in the form of mini-interviews on specific topics.  \nHey. My name is Gabe, and in 2016 I created the Board Game Design Lab with one main mission: to help designers create great games that people love.\nOut of that mission came a podcast with over 115 episodes, a website full of resources, and an amazing community of designers trying to help each other become the best they can be.\nIt's been an incredible journey, and I can't wait to see what the future holds. If you think there's a game inside you (and I believe there is), I hope you'll come along on the journey to get it out of your head and onto a table. And don't worry, me and the BGDL will be there to help you every step of the way.\nwww.boardgamedesignlab.com\nSpecial Thanks\nI want to say a very special thanks to Drew Corkill who did all the awesome graphics for this campaign page. He also designed the covers for the book and is doing the interior layout and design.

All while charging at full speed through HyperDrive. \n6-in-1 USB-C Hub (HDMI, USB-C Data & Power Delivery, microSD, SD, USB-A, 3.5mm Audio Jack)\nPatented soft grips that secures HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro without interfering with the Apple Smart (Keyboard) Folio \nWorldwide Patent Pending\nAs slim as iPad Pro\nWorks with or without Apple Smart (Keyboard) Folio\nGrips are removable to work with other iPad Pro cases or devices \nWorldwide Patent Pending\n$1M Stretch Goal: USB-C Extension Cable\nReplace all other dongles with HyperDrive \nCompared to other dongles in the market and from the Apple Store, HyperDrive is more portable, has more features and is made of better materials. You would need multiple dongles to achieve what HyperDrive does, at a total cost much higher than HyperDrive.\nStop figuring out how to store and carry your dongles\nHaving multiple dongles means that you now have more items to manage on top of your iPad Pro, which increases the risk of misplacing them as you move around.\nWith HyperDrive, just pack and go\nHyperDrive is designed to be compact enough to stay with your iPad Pro wherever you go.\nDon't look silly with dongles. Just go with HyperDrive!\nStop hanging and juggling with multiple dongles. A single compact HyperDrive does the job of multiple dongles. Dongles never look sleeker than this.\nPrecision milled aluminum enclosure color matched to Silver and Space Gray iPad Pro\nPerfectly color matched to Space Gray and Silver iPad Pro\nThe same HyperDrive works with both 11\" and 12.9\" iPad Pro\nDesign\nWe wanted HyperDrive to feel like a natural extension of the 2018 iPad Pro with similar product lines, thickness, right angled edges and rounded corners.\nAs the 2018 iPad Pro only has a single USB-C port for the HyperDrive to latch on, we had to come up with an innovative solution to secure HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro.\nThe end result is a sleek, minimalist design that perfectly matches the 2018 iPad Pro with almost the same thickness, with removable soft grips that secures the HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro without interfering with its or the Apple Smart (Keyboard) Folio functionality. The Worldwide Patent Pending removable grip design also allows HyperDrive to be used with other iPad Pro cases or other USB-C devices and allows for future accessories like an extension USB-C cable to the HyperDrive.\nWorldwide Patent Pending\nWe decided to go with popular output ports (HDMI, microSD, SD, USB-A) most requested by users. Although HyperDrive takes up a USB-C port on the iPad Pro, it also returns a USB-C port as well, which supports USB-C 5Gbps data and up to 60W power delivery pass through charging through HyperDrive.\nFront view of iPad Pro + HyperDrive\nBack view of iPad Pro + HyperDrive\nProof of working prototype that is ready for production\nThe following unedited single-shot video demonstrates a fully functional pre-production HyperDrive with all (HDMI, USB-C, microSD, SD, USB-A, 3.5 audio jack) ports working. Using HyperDrive, the iPad Pro is able to connect to a HDMI display, connect to an external speaker via 3.5mm audio jack, import photos/videos from USB-C/USB-A flash drives and microSD/SD memory cards, all while being powered by a USB-C power source. HyperDrive for iPad Pro is plug-n-play and interfaces directly with iOS, with no additional apps required. Connecting devices to HyperDrive is like connecting devices directly to iPad Pro via original Apple USB-C adapters.\nSpecifications\n Output:\n                - HDMI supporting 1080p@60Hz, 2K@60Hz, 4K@30Hz\n                - USB-C data (USB 3.1 Gen 1, 5Gb/s) and Power Delivery (max 60W)\n                - micro SD (UHS-I 104MB/s)\n                - SD (UHS-I 104MB/s)\n                - USB-A data (USB 3.1 Gen 1, 5Gb/s)\n                - 3.5mm Audio Jack (USB 2.0 Audio, 48KHz, 16-bit Audio Input/Output, TRRS)\n Input: 1 x USB-C (USB 3.1 Gen 2, 10Gb/s\n DC/DC Efficiency: Up to 96%\n Device Operating Temperature: Less than 48\u00baC / 118\u00baF\n Enclosure: CNC aluminum available in Silver and Space Gray\n Dimensions: 3.66\" x 1.2\" x 0.35\" / 93 x 30.5 x 9mm\n Weight: 1.2oz / 34g\nRewards \nAvailable in Space Gray and Silver aluminum enclosure\nHyperDrive will be available in Silver or Space Gray.

These volumes were an expansion of the work that is presented at www.lovecraftianscience.wordpress.com, a blogsite dedicated to conducting scientific investigations into the Cthulhu Mythos that was initiated in September 2013.\nThe first volume focused on a variety of subjects, including discussions on Lovecraft\u2019s love for Science, the biology of some Lovecraftian entities, Einstein in a Lovecraftian universe, the short story \u201cFrom Beyond\u201d and mathematics in \u201cThe Dreams in the Witch-House.\u201d It also included a number of articles that backers requested such as discussions on Cthulhu, how humans and Deep Ones can interbreed and the Dreamlands. A chapbook Biology of the Old Ones was also produced.\nVolume 2 of the Journal contained a set of articles with the overarching theme of the Lovecraftian Solar System, with articles on the planets of our solar system, exoplanets, comets and meteors. Again, another set of articles were produced on questions posed by backers, which includes subjects such as the Shaggai and the Shan, Warfare of the Old Ones and What Exactly is Azathoth? The chapbook associated with the 2nd volume was titled Essays on Yuggoth.\nSO WHAT\u2019S THIS KICKSTARTER ABOUT?\nThis Kickstarter is for the 3rd volume of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science and the overall theme will be stories that Lovecraft either ghost wrote or co-wrote. Similar to the previous volumes, the 3rd volume will be approximately 135 to 150 pages in length and will include a least one illustration for each chapter. In turn, each chapter will be a discussion of scientific ideas or concepts of each revision tale. These tales will include:\n\u00b7 The Mound, with by Zealia Bishop\n\u00b7 Out of the Aeons, with Hazel Heald\n\u00b7 The Horror in the Museum, with Hazel Heald\n\u00b7 The Horror at Martin\u2019s Beach, with Sonia H. Greene\n\u00b7 Through of Gates of the Silver Key, with E. Hoffmann Price\n\u00b7 Till A\u2019 the Seas, with R. H. Barlow\n\u00b7 The Green Meadow, with Winifred V. Jackson\nAlso, another chapbook will be made available on a description of the ecosystem of Lovecraft\u2019s Venus in the tale \u201cIn the Walls of Eryx,\u201d co-written with Kenneth Sterling.  In addition, if the total amount of raised funds exceed $5,500.00, another chapter will be included in the Journal for \u201cThe Curse of Yig,\u201d co-written with Zealia Bishop. \nA draft illustration of the cover of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3\nSO WHAT WILL THE REQUESTED MONEY BE USED FOR?\nThe money raised through this Kickstarter will be used to conduct detailed, scientific investigations on a series of Lovecraft's revision tales. The articles developed for this periodical will not be available on the blog site. The Kickstarter will also cover costs for Steve Maschuck to produce at least 8 original pieces of artwork exclusively for this Volume. Finally, the Kickstarter will also cover professional editing and formatting of the periodical into digital formats. Additional material, either as new articles and/or new artwork, will be included, if higher pledge amounts are submitted (see rewards). Also, if the total amount of raised funds exceed $5,500.00, then an additional chapter will be included on the tale \"The Curse of Yig,\" which will include another illustration.\nWHEN DO I GET MY REWARD?\nThe digital and hard copies of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3 and the chapbook The Ecosystem of Lovecraft\u2019s Venus (In the Walls of Eryx) will be forwarded to all backers in March 2019.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main obstacle associated with the project is putting the text together for the proposed periodical. Fortunately, a portion of the text is already complete; this proposed project will increase the level of detail associated with each article. If funded, the project will be completed and digital copies will be submitted to all backers. While there may be some slight delay in completing the periodical, the disciplined experience I have acquired over the course of almost three years in putting articles up on the blog site on a weekly basis will guarantee the successful completion of the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital copy of Journal, Volume 3", "descp": "For $10.00 you will receive a digital copy the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3 and listed / thanked as a contributor", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital copy of Journal and Chapbook", "descp": "For $15.00 you will receive a digital copy the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3, a digital copy of the In the Wall of Eryx chapbook and listed / thanked as a contributor", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 22 or more", "title": "Hard copy of Journal, Volume 3", "descp": "For $22.00 you will receive a digital copy and a hard copy of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3 as well as listed / thanked as a contributor.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Hard copy of Journal, Vol. 3 + Chapbook", "descp": "For $28.00 you will receive a digital copy and a hard copy of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3, a digital copy and hard copy of the In the Walls of Eryx chapbook as well as listed / thanked as a contributor", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["111 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Journal, Chapbook and Pose a Question", "descp": "For $50.00 you will receive a digital copy and a hard copy of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3, a digital copy and hard copy of the In the Walls of Eryx chapbook as well as listed / thanked as a contributor.

Campbell published the novella Who Goes There?, about a team of scientists in Antarctica who discover and are terrorized by a monstrous, shape-shifting alien entity.

The published novella was actually an abridged version of Campbell's original story, called Frozen Hell, which had to be shortened for publication. The Frozen Hell manuscript remained unknown and unpublished for decades, and it was only recently rediscovered. Frozen Hell expands the Thing story dramatically, giving vital backstory and context to an already incredible tale.

The specially designed cutter together with four minutely adjustable modules offers precise control on angle and depth of cutting to save time and increase stability. It adopts conventional 9mm snap-off blades and Perfect Cut customized blades.\nSimple, Fast, Precise\nParents can make unique costumes for kids' Halloween party; modelers could do jobs quicker; designers would be able to make sketch models easier and accelerate the design process.\nVari-Angle Cutting\nThe Vari-Angle module could be adjusted for various cuts. It controls the angle of cutting down to a 5-degree interval. With the snap-off cutter, the cutting depth can also be controlled.\nCircle Cutting\nCompass cutter, which could be operated with a single hand, is capable of radius between 6 and 25 cm.\n45\u00b0 Cutting\nThe 45\u00b0 module helps users to keep their blade 45\u00b0 inclined to the surface of the material while cutting a spline free-handed or cutting along a ruler.\n90\u00b0 Cutting\nThe 90\u00b0 module helps users to keep their blade perpendicular to the surface of the material while cutting along a ruler or cutting a spline free-handed.\nSnap-Off Cutter\nSpecial designed snap-off blade cutter uses both Perfect Cut customized blades and conventional 9mm blades. It could be used for both left or right-handed and holds the blade firmly.\nDifferent from the previous model, we created the 45-degree blade so that the tip won't break easily and at the same time allows you to make precise cuts.\n30cm Ruler\nThere will be four models of the 30cm/12\" ruler:\nAcrylic ruler in the metric system\nAluminum ruler in the metric system\nAcrylic ruler in Imperial units\nAluminum ruler in Imperial units\nYou'll choose one among them in a survey after the project ends. Don't worry about it at this moment.\nThe 60cm ruler is compatible with the 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and vari-angle module. It can\u2019t be use with the compass module.\nThere will be two models of the 60cm/24\" ruler:\nAcrylic ruler in the metric system  \nAcrylic ruler in Imperial units\nYou'll choose one among them in a survey after the project ends.\n\u203b Artworks are work in progress, minor change will apply.\nCutting Materials\nTimeline\nAt this moment the injection molds are almost ready (minor modification will apply.) We are working on the ruler and the customized blade.\nRewards\n\nYou can add extra rulers by selecting a reward, adding $29 to your pledge for one additional 30cm ruler ($58 for two, $145 for six,) or $39 for an additional 60cm ruler. (If you\u2019ve already pledged, click the \"Manage my pledge\" button to change the amount.)\n\nThis deal is exclusively for Kickstarter, and no extra shipping fee will be charged. We will send you a survey to collect your choices of material and measurement unit of the rulers after the campaign.\nPerfect Cut Specs\nMore Examples\nThank You for Your Support\nTo everyone who backed and feedbacked the project \u2013 thank you. Your support and constructive feedback make Perfect Cut and Polarlab a reality, has changed my life, and now changing others\u2019. The project started in Dec 2014 when I was a design student and was one of my degree projects. Moreover, now Perfect Cut got a chance to be real after years of developing and refining.\nThis campaign is about more than designing and backing a project. It\u2019s a business model and a good way for designers or anyone who has an idea to be evaluated and realized as a product. In term of business, crowdfunding allows us not to compromise the functionality and creativity of the product, and in this case, we could treat our communities, backers, partners and our team (of 2 people) as peers.\nOnce again, thank you for your occupation, and we will continuously look to you, our community, for feedback and direction. Enjoy cutting :)\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 500+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $235MM raised between them.\n     About PolarLab  \nWe are makers, designers, and engineers.

Dark water suddenly rose from the land, invading our homes and lives. They say it came from the depths inside the Loop. Whatever it was the Flood changed everything. Nothing would ever be the same again.\nWelcome back to the Loop. Things are different now. \nIn 2017, we released Tales from the Loop the tabletop roleplaying game based on St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s first art book. That game was an instant hit, selling out its two initial print runs and winning no less than five ENnies (including Best Game and Product of the Year) as well as three Golden Geek Awards (including Best RPG).\nNow, it\u2019s time to return to the Loop and continue the story. In Things from the Flood you play Teens in the 1990s \u2013 a decade of change and disaster. You're still balancing day to day life with solving exciting mysteries with your friends. But this is a darker time, and the stakes are higher.\nWe are the Free League, creators and publishers of roleplaying games such as Mutant: Year Zero, Coriolis - The Third Horizon, Tales from the Loop and Forbidden Lands. As well as the original publishers of Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s art books. The lead writer of this book is the seasoned Swedish game writer Nils Hintze, backed up by the entire Free League team who handle project management, editing, and graphic design. \nThe vast majority of the art in the game is done by Simon St\u00e5lenhag himself. Most of the art will be drawn from the pages of the Things from the Flood artbook - many scenarios in the game are based directly on illustrations in the artbook - but the RPG will contain some new original art as well, including the cover image.\nThe book will have approximately 200 pages, in the US Letter format.\nTales from the Loop Backer? If you backed the original Tales from the Loop RPG back in late 2016, you will get a PDF of the Things from the Flood core book, including the digital stretch goals in this Kickstarter, at no extra cost. You can still join this Kickstarter to get the printed book.\nThings are different now. \nThe world does not seem so innocent anymore. \nIts the \u201890s and the once mighty Loop has been shut down, the experiment abandonded and the land bought by Krafta, a powerful corporation. You are no Kids anymore, but Teens trying to find your way in a decade of change \u2013 both within and around you. \nThe Flood has transformed the once pastoral islands into a dark marshland. Some say that the dark water pouring out of the ground comes from within the Loop itself. Machines are afflicted by a strange virus turning them unreliable and dangerous. \nStill, your lives go on as before. You go to school, fall miserably in love, try to do everything possible to fend off boredom. When you hear about other teens going missing, and even turning up dead, you realize its time to gather the group again.\nOne way or another you fill find out what these Things from the Flood really are. \nYou play Teens growing up in the 1990s, trying to balance everyday life while at the same time solving dark mysteries together with your friends. \nThe core of the game is the same as in Tales from the Loop, but the themes are different. Gone are the childlike tales of wonder and discovery, in their place are dark threats to the Teens and their world. Everything is changing, everything is falling apart. Figuring out how to deal with this is a big part of the game. \nYou are no kid anymore, the world is both more exciting and more dangerous. Teenagers can get hurt \u2013 and even die. The stakes are higher than ever.\nBoth! Things from the Flood expands the scope of Tales from the Loop to the 1990s. You can continue your campaign with the Kids from the original game or create brand new player characters. We call it a \"standalone expansion\" because everything that is needed to play the game is included in the book. That\u2019s right, no previous experience is needed at all, just get the book and start playing right away.\nIf you\u2019ve read and played the Tales from the Loop RPG, you will find yourself right at home, this book expands the setting and introduces new exciting mysteries and threats to explore. \nThe game engine of Things from the Flood is the same as the one for Tales from the Loop RPG and is based on our previous game Mutant: Year Zero, that was awarded with a Silver ENnie for Best Rules at Gencon 2015.\nThe core mechanic is the same: To make a skill roll, you simply grab a number of dice for your attribute score, skill level and gear, and roll them all together. You need at least one six to succeed, and extra sixes can give you stunts and other bonus effects.\nThings from the Flood will be available in two languages: English and Swedish. The Swedish title of the game will be Flodsk\u00f6rden and you will be able to choose your preferred language in the pledge manager once the Kickstarter has concluded.\nWith your help, we can make Things from the Flood even more amazing.

Whether you are a casual fan or a rabid one, we've got you covered. \nI loved Lovecraft even before I knew his name. His lore permeated every inch of my childhood. I didn't know, for instance, that H. P. Lovecraft was the mind behind the Necronomicon when I watched Evil Dead. I didn't know he was the grandfather of psychological horror as I binged In the Mouth of Madness, Jacob's Ladder, Aliens, and dozens of other terrifying movies in my youth. \nI didn't even know Lovecraft created Cthulhu until well after I called the Great Old One's name. However, the older I got, the more I grew to appreciate the warped mind behind some of my all-time favorite things, and I wanted to create something that could show that love, with people who loved Lovecraft as much as I did, for people who loved Lovecraft as much as me.\nAnd Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is the result of that process.\nAfter the success of my first anthology, Monsters and Other Scary S^&t, I asked my fans, and fans of the book, what we should cover next, and they told me Lovecraft. \nImmediately, I was like \"YESSSSS!!!!\" \nMonsters and Other Scary S^&t was all about how monsters can represent anything from cute to scary and everything in between, and Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is just like that, but with Lovecraft. It's 35 stories that show just how deeply Lovecraft has permeated the  essence of our culture. \nWhen I create a book, the first thing I sit down to figure out is how my book can be different from everything else on the market. After all, there are HUNDREDS of Lovecraft anthologies out there, both from Lovecraft himself and from loads of authors who have carried the torch for him in the last century. \nAdditionally, there are tons of stories told from a Lovecraftian horror point of view, dealing with the creepy, unsettling nature of humanity. I didn't think we could compete with those, nor did I want to, either. \nThere is one thing I love, though, that I haven't seen a lot previously...a book devoted to the mythology of Lovecraft's universe. \nYou see, I've always been fascinated by the gods and monsters of Lovecraft, and I never seemed to get enough of them in the stories I read. Most Lovecraft stories are filled with the horror aspect of Lovecraft, but low on the mythology. \nBut my favorite part of Lovecraft is the mythology he crafted, the gods he made, and the way that mythology differed from the myths of every other mythology out there. So that's what I set out to create.\nCthulhu is Hard to Spell is a book steeped in the mythology and gods of Lovecraft. The stories inside it's pages follow the spirit of Lovecraft, but often strays from the tone of Lovecraftian horror. \nSure, some of the stories in this book are Lovecraftian in nature down to their very core, but there are also funny stories, cute stories, fantasy stories, sci-fi stories, and much, much more which build on the Lovecraftian mythos. \nIf you love the gods and monsters of Lovecraft, then Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is going to be your jam. \nBest of all, this anthology is ALL AGES APPROPRIATE. These aren't stories made for children necessarily, at least not all of them, but we toned down the cursing (there is none), the violence (there is no blood), and there was never any sex, to make sure you could show it to your child, even if they won't understand it all. \nI've had conversations with many people at shows asking for a book to indoctrinate their children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins, etc, into loving creepy things, and I think this book is a great primer for that, while being enjoyable to people who already love the creepy, too. \nWe listened to you from the last anthology, and made sure this was: \n-Appropriate for all ages (even though we deal with some very dark topics) \n-Full color\n-Shorter stories (2, 4, 6, or 8 pages) \n-All stories are even numbers, so they begin and end on the same page throughout. \nWe used your feedback to make this anthology even better! You opinions are very important to us, and we appreciate them very much. \nBackers really loved our first anthology\nThe real reason we're doing a second anthology is because Kickstarter backers and fans loved our first anthology so much. I was hesitant to do a second anthology before the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t campaign launched. \nHowever, the response from backers was so positive that I gladly decided to go into the fray a second time. There is nothing like geeking out about something with creators and fans, and that is what our anthologies allow us to do.\nCheck out the reaction to our last anthology. We hope this anthology has an even better reaction! \nWe brought back a bunch of creators from the first book and added a ton of new faces so we can make this book even more amazing! \nWhy do the other creators love Lovecraft so much? \nWe all have our reasons for loving Lovecraft, so listen to some of our creators talk about why they got involved in the project. \nWho am I? \n My name is Russell Nohelty, publisher of Wannabe Press, a small press that creates weird books for weird people, creator of Katrina Hates Dead S%&t, Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter, and Pixie Dust, along with the editor of both the Monsters and other Scary S^&t, and this anthology.  \nI have raised over $70,000 on Kickstarter from 7 different projects, and have gotten exceedingly good at crafting amazing books which audiences love. My previous two projects, Monsters and Other Scary S^&t and Pixie Dust, both raised north of $25,000 from over 600 backers each. \nI have a simple motto when it comes to Kickstarter. I outlay all the money to get the book print ready, and then I bring it to my audience and ask if they would rather have a cheaply made paperback edition, or a beautiful hard cover edition. \nSee, I can go hit enable distribution on a soft cover edition right now, but luckily Kickstarter backers have again and again wanted the hardcover edition, printed in the most beautiful way possible.\nWhat are some of the stories in this book? \nNora (art and words by Angela Oddling) -- a dejected teenager living in an ice village sets out to find Aphoom-Zhah and thaw his cold heart. \nThe Dunwich Boys (art by Esther Pimentel, words by Eddy Hedington, letters by Nikki Powers) -- Yog-Sothoth has materialized in a house in Dunwich, and the Dunwich boys have to banish it from their neighborhood. \nThe Eternal War (art and words by Eric Young) -- A retelling of the origin story of Lovecraft's universe, translated from the Voynich manuscript. \nCat is Cryptic (art and words by Megan Hutchison) -- a retelling of the Cats of Ulthar, one of Lovecraft's most beloved stories. \nTsathoggua's Triumph (art by John Edingfield II, words by Clay Adams) -- Tsathoggua dreams of his eventual conquest of the universe. \nCleaning the Mess (story and art by Brandon Perlow, words by Paul J. Mendoza, Letters by Wilson Ramos, Jr.) -- Cthulhu has conquered another world, but all he really wants is his master to come find him. \nSong for the Harbinger (art by Brianna Gilmartin, words by Heather Kenealy) -- Ghroth doesn't understand why nobody likes his singing, all he wants to do is harmonize with planets, and they keep blowing up. \nThe Yag-Kosha Mystery (art and words by Kelly Dochy) -- Yag-Kosha, the pacifist alien, has a mysterious koan for you. \nMons (art and words by Matthew Childers) --Explorers on Mars find an ancient tome that could unlock the secrets of the universe, or unleash a Lovecraftian horror. \nThe Summoning of Brkthruslpk (art by Robin Dassen, words by Don Perkins) -- A group of kids works to summon the ancient god Brkthruslpk onto the world. \nNo DQ (art and words by Ryan Fisher) -- A weak, sickly wrestling fan gets to live out his fantasy of being a star after a mysterious stranger endowing him with an enchanted garment. \nSlumber (art by Lloyd Ladera, words by Sarah Anderson) -- After being woken up on a spaceship, a man has to escape the Lovecraftian horror chasing him. \nThat's Cthulhu to You (art by Zac Skellington, words by Leo Baxter Kiker) -- An oddities store gets a new pet: Cthulhu. \nHow to Summon the Dark Lord Hastur (Art by Cara Stemo, words by Johnny C, letters by Travis Duda, logo design by Nathan Burns) -- A card game, a tragic birth, a goverment experiment, and a violent crime all converge to release a deadly horror on the world. \nChurch of Mormo (art by Claire Leslie, words by N.S. Kane) -- Greek spirit Mormo goes door to door trying to recruit Cthulhu worshipers to her cause. \nShe Came Upon a Great Tree (art by Nick Kremenek, words by Mike Speakman, edited by Greg Smith) -- A delivery driver and part-time cultist must find a great tree to unleash Cthulhu and Hastur onto the world. \nFlycatcher (art by Dan Scalisi, words by Frank Martin) -- Even though they have been warned for years, the fly people of Dipterra are not prepared for the wrath of Yba'sokug. \nThe Rally (art and words by Mary Bellamy) -- Lucifer needs new generals, and has decided to recruit Lovecraftian gods to his cause. \nWhy is this book going to be so awesome? \n1. It's 176 pages of glorious comics! - That's a massive amount of awesome comics about monsters! Over 150 pages and 35 stories!\n2. It's gonna be in hardcover! - There are lots of comics, but how many are printed in hardcover? Not many! \n3. All the UV spotting! There's gonna be spot UV all over the cover. I love spot UV and I've gotten exceedingly good at using it over the years. There might even be a little surprise if we can blow past our regular goal on that front. \n4. Glossy art paper - Most books are printed in gloss lamination, trapping all the glorious line work under an ugly, gross, yellow film. This anthology is different. It's printed on glossy art paper, which means the ink shines on top of the paper and looks like it's simmering, just like the any other art book on the market today. After all, we believe that comics are beautiful works of art and should be printed as such. \n5. Our creators have credits from all your favorites companies. Our creators have worked with Marvel, DC, Oni, Tokyopop, Heavy Metal, Fantagraphics, Upper Deck, Sony, and more along with brands like Teen Titans, My Little Pony, Invader Zim, Ghostbusters, Horizon Zero Dawn, and more. We have creators who have been nominated for Eisners, won Glyphs, Silver Eagles, WGA awards, and more! \n6. There are just so many many Lovecraftian gods and monsters. There was only one rule in this anthology; all of the stories needed to contain at least one Lovecraftian god or monster. This book is full of different types gods you know like Cthulhu and Azathoth, and ones you've never heard of as well! \nAnd you can get the whole book, including shipping, plus a pdf copy AND audio commentary for just $40, INCLUDING SHIPPING (in the US, at least)! \nWho drew that dope cover? \n It was drawn by Aaron Alexovich, creator of my favorite indie comic of all time, Serenity Rose, a 500+ page graphic novel about a previously famous witch trying to come to terms with her powers in a very weird town. Read it. Buy it. Love it.   \nIf you've never read that book, you probably know him from his work on Invader Zim, both the television show and more recently on the comic book. \nAaron is a powerhouse in the world of indie books, and Zim is one of my favorite animated shows of all time. He also drew the cover for the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t anthology. I really wanted him to come back for this anthology too, and I was so stoked when he said yes!  \nOn top of it all, Aaron might be one of the few people on earth that loves Lovecraft, especially Cthulhu, even more than me, which I once didn't think possible.\nDid Dirk Manning really write the foreword? \nYes, Dirk Manning, an icon of Lovecraftian horror comics on Kickstarter, wrote the foreword for Cthulhu is Hard to Spell. He didn't have time to contribute, but he asked me if he could do the foreword, and I of course said yes. \nDirk has raised a ton of money for Nightmare World, Tales of Mr. Rhee, and more on Kickstarter, and that he wanted to contribute to this book means the world to me. \nHere is a snippet of what he wrote, which made me smile. \nFor now, take the time to enjoy this book.\nWhile it\u2019s (another) unspoken truth that anthologies are often a hit-and-miss prospect, I can honestly say that there wasn\u2019t a story in this collection that I didn\u2019t enjoy... which shouldn\u2019t be surprising since it\u2019s a reminder that just like you\u2019re not alone in what you know and feel, these stories reminded me I\u2019m not alone either.\nI was honored when I read those words. So yes, file under: Dirk Approved. \nWhat are some other stories in the book? \nAshes to Ashes (art by Laura Neubert, words by Virginia Drohan) --  Quachil Uttaus learns what it means to be human.     \nOne Last Chance (art by Ben Herrera, words by K.J. Kaminski, colors by Emmanuel Torres) -- Humanity has one last chance to save the universe as they fight against the forces of Zathog on the planet Zarr. \nA 10,000 Year Curse (art by Dave Lentz, words by Dave Lentz and Ryan Kroboth, Inks by Rob Simmons, Colors by Ryan Kroboth) -- Even the old gods needs a night off, but it's often impossible to find a reliable babysitter, even for them. \nThe Call of Stone (art and words by Shannon Kirkwood) -- After a woman dies, she finds her true purpose in protecting the Star Mother. \nLove Story (art and words by Christie Shinn) -- A love story about Mnomquah and Oorn's eternal love. \nBasatan vs. Satan (art by Lady Beaver, Words by Steve Waldinger, letters by T. Perran Mitchell) -- Basatan returns to the surface to take his rightful place as ruler of Earth, but Satan has other plans.\nThe Art of Losing (art and words by Nathan Leuth) -- After her family dies and the Apocalypse comes, a young woman finds strength in music. \nSunset at Sarnath (art by Wesley Wong, words by Wesley Sun) -- An old man, a young girl, and a pig discuss who was responsible for the end of the world. \nThe Marriage Counselor (art by Melissa J Massey, words by Madeleine Holly-Rosing) -- Mnomquah and Oorn go to marriage counseling, because even the best marriages fall apart sometimes. \nWhere is the money going? \nGreat question. Here is a pie chart of the distribution of the funds. This is subject to fluctuation based on pledges, but should be a good guide. \nBook production and printing - $9,000 (41.5%)\nShipping - $6,000 (27.7%)\nPins - $334 (1.5%)\nKickstarter fees - $2,166 (10%)\nCreator residuals - $2,166 (10%)\nEmergency - $2,000 (9.3%)\nYou may ask why I have such a high emergency fund, and I would respond that it is why I have been able to successfully deliver 7 campaigns, because stuff always goes wrong, and sometimes in a big way. \nWhat can you get for your pledge? \nI am not the kind of creator who offers a ton of different rewards, but I do want to offer some awesome ones. Here's what you can get for your money. \nBefore I move on, I want to point out a couple of our coolest rewards. First, I want to thank Andrew Pawley for making this awesome paper doll, which EVERYBODY who pledges even for $1 will receive! \nYou have to build it yourself, but it looks just so awesome when it's set up.\nSecond, for the first time ever, I am doing an exclusive PIN designed by Aaron Alexovich specifically for this campaign. I have this pin in hand already, and it is AMAZING. \nAlso, we'll be offering our variant white eye addition of the Monster anthology, instead of the normal yellow eye edition. I only had a couple hundred of these white eye variant Soulless eye editions made, and they are almost gone! \nThe Crush it on Kickstarter course is my introductory course about how to run a Kickstarter campaign. It will show new creators (or ones who want to up their game), how to create, launch, fund, and distribute their campaigns. As a person who has run eight campaigns and successfully filled all but this one (only because it's currently running) without going over budget, and having raised almost $100,000 on Kickstarter, I know a thing or two about this stuff. \nMore importantly, I am a seasoned course creator through my website, The Complete Creative. If you would like to see the course, you can do so by clicking here. \nMy How to Make an Awesome Comics Anthology course is one I made specifically for this Kickstarter. After my previous anthology campaign, people asked me a ton of questions about how to make a comics anthology, but I was too overwhelmed to answer them. This time, I wanted to be prepared, so I laid out my exact strategy for making an awesome comics anthology. \nI'm very proud of this course and think that whether you are a seasoned pro at anthologies or just starting out, you can learn a ton from this course.

I feel as though I have fixed all of those issues at this point with my supply chain, but there are always some more that pop up. \n\nFor instance, with the monster anthology, we had to wait an additional 3 months for the glow-in-the-dark eyes to be applied correctly, and fix errors in the covers. \n\nWith Katrina, we had to wait 8 more weeks in port due to customs than we wanted, delaying our release from July until September. \n\nThese things can and do happen, and I can't say they won't happen again. However, I have done everything possible to ensure that we will have a smooth operation and these books will be in your hand as soon as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Paper toy!", "descp": "Get a downloadable Cthulhu paper toy designed by Andrew Pawley from Galaxafreaks and Cthulhu Kids!\nINCLUDES:\nPaper toy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Lovecraft", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the anthology in .pdf and .cbz form!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["348 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Audio Commentary", "descp": "Get audio commentary of my thought process about each story, why I placed it in the book, and fun stories about the book's creation.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy\nAudio Commentary", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Hardcover edition of the book!", "descp": "**NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES!**\nGet a physical copy of the book in all its hardcover glory!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy\nHardcover copy of the book\nAudio Commentary", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["358 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Special Thanks", "descp": "**NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES!**\nSpecial thanks in the book!

Sammons for Chaosium Inc's 7th edition Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game. It has a dark tone, like most Stygian Fox titles, more akin to True Detective and American Horror Story and is written for Mature Gamers Only. The scenarios look into the dark heart of humanity and the mythos... but this book has a twist.\nOne of the problems long term Keepers can face when running Call of Cthulhu is their players becoming too jaded or blas\u00e9 regarding the Cthulhu mythos. \n\"Oh, Deep Ones? Yeah, we've killed these before. Open fire.\"\nRather than; \"Oh my God! They're real! Run!\"\nIt's difficult to maintain that suspension of belief when you have been facing the same creatures year after year. This is where Occam's Razor comes in, being a collection of scenarios where initially they seem to be linked to the mythos but they have mundane causes and outcomes.\nI have run these type of scenarios for twenty years and every time they sucker players in and help them see how paranoid their characters have become and, more importantly, when it comes time to face the actual mythos again, many players believe the adventure will have a mundane cause. When interspersed with mythos adventures this leads to some serious panic when the players realise that this is real. Used sparingly, these adventures lull players into a false sense of security and make the next real mythos encounter all the more vivid.\n\nOne of my players had his character just stand and watch as a colleague was eaten by a dark shadow in a toy store because the player refused to believe it was a mythos entity. This was a ten year veteran of the game.\n\nOf course, a separate sidebar is provided for each adventure if you wish to have actual mythos elements in your game. \nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\n Brian M. Sammons has created 6 scenarios which tease at mythos causes but will ultimately lead to a mundane resolution. A murder is just a murder, a cult site is just kids with spray paints, etc. Here is a summary of the scenarios contained within the book.\n\nDeep and Dark \u2013 the investigators find a snuff film on the dark web, but one of a pretty girl getting mauled by a Fishman monster. Did the deep ones mess up and accidentally get filmed in this modern world where everyone has a camera phone or is it something else?  \nEye of the Beholder \u2013 an art student goes missing while doing late night research in a museum with ties to the local university. Maybe it\u2019s a coincidence that the museum just got in a huge statue from South America of a little-known death god called Thul\u2019Cathul. Yep, total coincidence.  \nThe Watchers \u2013 a woman living alone in an apartment in the big city notices that people are watching her. Following her. They even broke into her home. But why? What do they want and how far will they go?  \nA Whole Pack of Trouble \u2013 a group of film school students go to an isolated, abandoned, and reportedly haunted asylum to make a found-footage horror movie and make a fortune? Whatever could go wrong with that? Well, when the filmmakers go missing the investigators will have to find out.  \nA Cleansing Flame \u2013 People are dying by fire. No one knows why and no one knows how. When the latest victim is a friend to one of the investigators and an astronomer who reportedly made a recent discovery of note, it\u2019s up to the investigators to put out these flames.  \nVisions From Beyond - Tommy is a friend who makes some new friends. That\u2019s nice. Unfortunately those friends have a strange reputation, they get up to some bizarre practices, and then one night Tommy calls one of the investigators in terror, begging for help, then the line goes dead. What\u2019s a friend and an investigator of the Mythos to do?\nThe book will be in PDF, ePub, Softcover, and hardcover formats and will be full colour.\nBrian M. Sammons - Writer\n\nBrian is a fiction editor for Dark Regions Press and the Chief Editor for Golden Goblin Press, a film and literature critic for over twenty years and has penned stories that have appeared in such anthologies as Arkham Tales, Horrors Beyond, and many more. He has edited the books; Cthulhu Unbound 3, Undead & Unbound, Eldritch Chrome, and Dread Shadows in Paradise, among others. His game work is mostly for the Call of Cthulhu game and includes scenarios for Secrets, The San Francisco Guidebook, Doors to Darkness, The Things We Leave Behind, and more.

She has been writing for Alarums & Excursions since 1991, and has written material for Unknown Armies and reviews for The Familiar, The Unspeakable Oath, and RPG.net. She has edited and proofread games and scenarios from Arc Dream Publishing, Golden Goblin Press, Modiphius Entertainment, Parenthesis Press, and Rogue Games. She has also playtested games for Evil Hat Productions and Pelgrane Press, and knows a playtest has been unusually successful when her players inform her that she is going to run the game again next week even though the playtest period is over.\nBadger McInnes - Book Designer\n\nBadger has been working as a book designer and layout artist for the Call of Cthulhu RPG since 2003, starting out under the tutelage of Charlie and Lynn at Chaosium. He has designed books for Chaosium over the years (Call of Cthulhu 7th edition, Cthulhu by Gaslight 3rd edition, Secrets of Kenya, among others), as well as other sinister purveyors of Call of Cthulhu material such as Pagan Publishing, Pelgrane Press, and Golden Goblin Press.

Corey\u2019s award-winning series of science fiction novels to the tabletop. Using the Adventure Game Engine (AGE) rules found in Fantasy AGE, Blue Rose, and Modern AGE, The Expanse takes players to a far-future solar system where humanity is divided: Martians, Belters, and the people of old Earth struggle for political power and resources, but even older, alien, forces are stirring in the universe, and human history is about to take an unexpected new turn. The Expanse applies the fast-playing and action-based AGE rules to spaceships, solar colonies, and adventure and intrigue in the far-future, where the actions of the characters may change the course of history!\nAs long time fans know, The Expanse was a roleplaying game campaign long before it was a series of novels or a TV show. We are delighted to bring it full circle with this game! And here's the best thing about The Expanse RPG: we've been working on this for well over a year and rules are done! They've been through multiple iterations and playtesting, and we've worked closely with Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham (together, James S.A. Corey) throughout to ensure we are getting The Expanse right. Now let's hear from Daniel and Ty themselves!\nPLAY\n\nWant to check the game out RIGHT NOW? Download The Expanse RPG Quickstart today! This is a 40-page PDF that includes stripped down rules, pre-generated characters, and an adventure you can play right away. The download is free. \nThe Expanse RPG Features \nThe Expanse is based on the exciting new Modern AGE rules-set, and includes many of its features, such as customized character building using Backgrounds and Professions, Drives for character engagement, and an abstract resources system. It also makes use of the Modern AGE approach to action, exploration, and social encounters, complete with stunts and systems for all of them. To get a closer look at Modern AGE, you can download the Quickstart here.   \nThe following are some of the unique features of The Expanse in comparison to other AGE games:  \nFortune: Rather than Health, characters have a Fortune score that measures lucky near-misses, close scrapes, and trivial hits before the character takes serious harm. Fortune is also useful for modifying die rolls and offering players some narrative control but, watch out! Spend too much of it and your luck could run out when you get caught in a crossfire!\nConditions: In addition to a running Fortune total, characters use various conditions to measure things like injuries and fatigue as well as tactical challenges like hindered movement or sensory abilities.  \nInterludes: The interludes in between encounters are given their own treatment, allowing players to make use of their \u201cdown-time\u201d (including long hauls between destinations in the System) to recover, do maintenance, build their connections with others, or pursue their own projects.  \nSpaceships: The Expanse RPG features a system to model and create spaceships and its own system for space combat, including the assault on Thoth Station as an example of the system in action!  \nThe Churn: The Expanse also offers something for the Game Master with the Churn: A ticking counter that measures the crew\u2019s progress through a story and just when things are going to suddenly go sideways and become even more complicated!\nTwo Editions to Choose From!\nWe are offering the core rulebook of the Expanse RPG in two formats:\nThe Standard Edition is now (thanks to unlocked stretch goals) a 224 page full color hardback with a poster map of the solar system. This is the version that will stay in print after the Kickstarter has been fulfilled. \nThe Special Edition is a deluxe version of The Expanse RPG. It features the same beautiful full color interior of the Standard Edition with a black leatherette hardcover and a ribbon bookmark. This version is a Kickstarter exclusive, so it will not be available after the close of this campaign. Thanks to an unlocked stretch goal, the Special Edition now includes a dust jacket featuring the game's gorgeous cover art!\nThe Expanse Game Master's Kit\nThis Kickstarter also includes The Expanse Game Master's Kit, which will ship alongside the book. It currently includes the following, but may expand with the unlocking of stretch goals:\nA three-panel landscape format GM Screen with vital game system reference tables on one side and three panels of Expanse art on the player-facing side.  \nA set of game reference cards, including an initiative tracker, stunt references, and action references useful for players at the table.\nNow includes pre-generated characters after a stretch goal unlock!\nNow includes an adventure after a stretch goal unlock!\nAbzu's Bounty\nAbzu's Bounty is the first campaign for The Expanse  Roleplaying Game. This series of six linked scenarios will let you kick off your adventures in The Expanse in style. All six parts were unlocked as stretch goals so the full campaign is a go! Best of all, if you back the Kickstarter for $30 or more, you get a PDF of Abzu's Bounty for free! \n\nDesign Team\nWe assembled a great team to design The Expanse Roleplaying Game. Steve Kenson is the lead designer. You may know Steve from our Blue Rose and Mutants & Masterminds RPGs, or from any of the dozens of RPG books he's worked on over the last two decades. He had the able assistance of Seth Johnson, Ian Lemke, Rich Lescouflair, Rob McCreary, Jason Mical, Neall Raemonn Price, Zack Walters, Nicole Winchester, and of course James S.A. Corey!\n\nImportant Note: Shipping!  \nWe are going to be charging shipping separately later this year when the books are almost ready, and it will be EU-, Canada-, and Australia-friendly. In our previous Kickstarters, we tried to keep it simple with just a few standard shipping costs but this has proved a poor way to handle it. International shipping can be brutal and in too many cases we were paying more to ship than we collected for it. Shipping rates can also rise after a campaign ends but before the games are ready to ship. So about a month from shipping, we will assess and collect actual shipping costs using a pledge manager. The upside is that you don\u2019t need to pay the full cost now. We also want to point out that The Expanse RPG Standard Edition will be sold through distribution and into game and book stores after backers get their books. If you are concerned that shipping is going to be too expensive, be aware that the Kickstarter will not be the only way you can get the game. If you can get it from your local game store and save yourself a lot on shipping, that\u2019s a totally reasonable decision to make. There are also special tiers of the Kickstarter for retailers, so you can also talk to your local store and find out if they'll be bringing in books that way.\nGamers and retailers may also be interested in our Pre-Order Plus Program. Basically, this lets gamers pre-order our games through their local stores and get the same special we offer on our website. You can find out more about Pre-Order Plus here. \nStretch Goals\nOur initial batch of stretch goals are focused on enhancing the core rulebook and GM's Kit, make them bigger and better. \nUnlocked!

It\u2019s not a book with adventures, spells, creatures, or magic items. It\u2019s not a book for characters at all, but a book for players! If you play or run roleplaying games, this book is for you. Inside this gorgeous hardcover book, suitable for your coffee table or your gaming table, you will find advice and suggestions for enhancing your RPG experience at the table and away from it. This is an insider\u2019s look at everything that goes into the hobby\u2014finding a group, making a character, running a game, creating adventures, finding all the right ideas, hosting a game\u2026and that\u2019s just for starters.         \nIf You\u2019re an Experienced Gamer\nYou\u2019ve been gaming for a while now. Maybe even years. You get the concepts, and you understand the rules. No one needs to explain the dice to you. Your Best Game Ever embraces the hobby you love, and provides real tips, immediately usable advice, and hands-on pointers you can use at your game table. You\u2019ll find everything here from enhancing immersion, tips for running games online, creating characters with depth, worldbuilding, designing rules, dealing with personality conflicts that arise at the table, and more!\nIf You\u2019re Fairly New to Gaming\nYour friends play RPGs. You\u2019ve maybe watched some streaming games, or given it a try a few times. You get the general idea, but where do you go from there? How do you really get into this hobby the way so many others have? This book will give you everything you need to learn how to choose the right game, how to fit into your game group or start your own group, and get you going on the fast track to being a great gamer.\nNot a Rule Book, But a Tool Book\nYour Best Game Ever is divided into three major sections: general game topics, being a player, and being a game master. There\u2019s even a section on designing your own game, and getting it published. And this isn\u2019t just a stuffy book on theory, either. You\u2019ll find actual suggestions you can use to create better characters with character arcs, real recipes you can make for game night (and even spruce them up for your genre of choice), specific suggestions for music and ambiance depending on genre, plot ideas, character ideas, and other ready-to-use material.         \nThis 240-page book will enable you to become a better gamer. You\u2019ll find ways to create and manage a great game group, tricks for game prep (and what to do if you haven\u2019t prepared!), understanding and managing game balance, and taking everything around you and incorporating it as inspiration for your game.\nMonte Cook, the principal author, has been playing RPGs for 40 years, and working on them professionally for 30 years. The MCG team, all of whom will be contributing, are an extremely seasoned group with a combined total of over 250 years of RPG experience. But we wanted to get an even wider and diverse set of experiences and points of view in this book, so we\u2019ve recruited a team of folks that will provide feedback as well as their own contributions for the book. This dream team of consulting experts includes:\nEric Campbell\nMatt Colville\nLuke Crane\nStacy Dellorfano\nTanya DePass\nAjit George\nJennell Jaquays\nEloy Lasanta\nTom Lommel\nMatthew Mercer\nSusan J. Morris\nAlina Pete\nJohn Rogers\nMonica Valentinelli\n\nThe book will also feature comics and cartoons from: \nJohn Kovalic (Dork Tower)\nVickie Lee (Dungeons and Doggos)\nAviv Or (Up to Four Players)\nBrian Patterson (d20 Monkey)\nLen Peralta (Geek-a-Week)\nAlina Pete (Weregeek)\nStan! (10x10Toon)\n\n(Scroll down for more details on Your Best Game Ever)\nIn 2011, Monte created Numenera, and with it, a game system called the Cypher System. This game system has won awards and has been lauded by gamers everywhere as a wonderfully different way to play games of any genre. In 2015, we created the Cypher System Rulebook (CSR) to help gamers use the system for any type of game they wanted to play\u2014fantasy, science fiction, horror, superheroes, and so on. You can get a copy of that book in this Kickstarter campaign, but we\u2019re also Kickstarting a new version that will come out in 2019. The new version will incorporate lots of new options for players, but perhaps best of all it will take the concepts from Your Best Game Ever and apply them directly to the Cypher System. These two books will work hand-in-hand to create the best Cypher game ever!         \n(Scroll down for more details on the new Cypher System Rulebook)\nIf you're new to the Cypher System and are curious about how it works, you can download the free Cypher System Rules Primer for an idea of how the game plays.    \nNow that the Kickstarter has funded, our stretch goals will focus on the development of various genre-focused books that will take the concepts found in the new CSR and take them one step further, with specific examples. Each of these additional books will include an entirely new and original campaign setting as well as lots of material and advice for making your own in the realms of science fiction, fantasy, and more. \nYou\u2019ve read the effusive descriptions above. Is Your Best Game Ever really for everyone? More importantly, is it for you? Maybe it would be better to just show you what\u2019s in the book. Here\u2019s a brief listing of some of the topics we'll cover:         \n                                      Click here for a closer look!  \n\nOur goal with this book is to make every game your best game ever. But we know\u2013as GMs, players, and designers ourselves\u2013that every game and every experience is unique. What\u2019s the hardest struggle you have with creating great games, either as a player or as a GM? Looking for some GM or player advice? Let us know at this link. (Once the KS is complete and we\u2019ve started working on the book, we\u2019ll look through your comments to make sure the book covers players\u2019 biggest issues and concerns.)         \nWhen we were finishing the new Numenera books, Discovery and Destiny, one of the first things that playtesters asked us was, are you going to incorporate some of the cool new material in these books into the Cypher System?         \nA valid question. And it got me (Monte) really thinking about the Cypher System Rulebook as a whole. I didn\u2019t want to change the rules\u2014I love the Cypher System, and wouldn\u2019t touch the mechanics. But developing Numenera Discovery and Destiny showed me that there was a lot we could add in terms of player abilities and flexibility, and what the CSR really needs is flexibility. The idea that you can create any campaign in any genre is fundamental to the whole idea. And I realized we could take some steps to push that idea a lot further.\nSo we\u2019re Kickstarting a brand new, revised 416-page Cypher System Rulebook. Before I go any further, though, let me say right now, if you\u2019ve got the existing Cypher System Rulebook and you\u2019re happy with it, great! These new ideas don\u2019t change the way the rules work. You still roll a d20, you\u2019ve still got difficulties 1\u23bc10, you\u2019ve still got characters with descriptors, types, and foci. NPCs have levels. PCs use effort to decrease the difficulty. Everything is still fully compatible with everything Cypher-related that we\u2019ve ever published. You\u2019ll be able to play a game with half the characters from the original CSR and half from the new CSR all at the table at the same time. The difference isn\u2019t in how the game is played, but in the choices players get to create and run their characters.         \nWhat I\u2019m most excited about are the ways I\u2019ve thought about over the last few years to make things more customizable so that you could even more easily use these rules in any setting. To that end, in this book we\u2019re dramatically streamlining the chapter on character focus, so that you can customize your character\u2019s focus to perfectly match the setting and your character concept. So if you\u2019re making a starship pilot, a superhero, or an occult investigator, you don\u2019t choose the one that fits best from a list of foci\u2014you take your character concept and tailor your focus so that it really fits what you want to do.\nBased on player feedback, we\u2019re also making what we call subtle cyphers\u2014cyphers that aren\u2019t tied to a specific object\u2014the default for all genres, and we\u2019ll be including way more of them. (You\u2019ll still be able to have cyphers as objects too.) This will make applying the concept of cyphers, which is obviously core to the system, easy no matter what kind of game you\u2019re playing.         \nAnd of course, there\u2019s all those new additions from Numenera Discovery and Destiny that add a lot of new options that just make the game better. They\u2019re not really changes, they\u2019re additions\u2014new character abilities, more choices, player intrusions in addition to GM intrusions, and more. These will all be incorporated into the new CSR. And let me say again, it\u2019s still all entirely compatible with existing Cypher System material, whether it be from the CSR or one of our settings like Gods of the Fall, Predation, or Unmasked (and of course, Numenera and The Strange).\nFurther, we\u2019ll also be incorporating suggestions from Your Best Game Ever directly into this book. So, for example, Your Best Game Ever will talk about creating character arcs to enhance play, while the specific material for creating Cypher System character arcs as a mechanic will be included in this book.\nLastly, we\u2019ll include even more genres you can use, in addition to fantasy, horror, and so on. We\u2019re going to break science fiction into hard sci-fi and space opera/science fantasy, and we\u2019ll add coverage for romance, historical gaming, and more!

Your pledge is a down payment for an order to be placed, at a retail-friendly discount, when Your Best Game Ever and the revised Cypher System Rulebook are ready to ship. You can choose as many copies as you like of the books individually. You\u2019ll pay for your order (less your $80 deposit) at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. In addition to those books, you get a free deluxe Your Best Game Ever PoP kit. MCG covers domestic US shipping.\nYou might be wondering, \u201cHow do I select an add-on?\u201d It\u2019s easy. Select the Manage Your Pledge button on the right-hand side of the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge for the amount listed for the add-on. For example, if you want Early Playtest Access, add $100 to your pledge. It\u2019s that easy. After the campaign closes, we\u2019ll be using a service called Backerkit to collect your information, and at that time you can specify the add-on that you\u2019ve already paid for.  \nWhy does Monte Cook Games use Kickstarter to fund so many of its projects? In a word, you. You're reading this right now on Kickstarter because you're an invested game fan interested in what's new and innovative in gaming\u2014and thus you're exactly who we write our products for. If MCG were a company that made its way by publishing just another adventure or just another sourcebook every few months, we would have a hard time justifying Kickstarter. But that isn't our passion. Our passion is innovation and creation, but that requires up-front capital and\u2014probably even more importantly\u2014a test of the audience to determine if our ideas meet people's needs and wants. Kickstarter provides us with that. In turn, it puts us in a position to reward those early adopters with great deals, early access, and transparency. We think it's a win-win for everyone. But we use traditional sales channels as well, so if you'd like to check out some of our other products, like Numenera, The Strange, or Invisible Sun, you can go to our online store or visit your favorite local game retailer.         \nSoon after the Your Best Game Ever Kickstarter campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.         \nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email to check your MCG Shop account, which will be updated with coupons that let you redeem your rewards for free through our online store. You decide when to use the coupon, at which time we'll ask you to provide or update your shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of your rewards to bundle them together into one shipment to save on shipping costs. We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, AND NEW ZEALAND Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge\u2014it will be an additional charge for you. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you.\nThe UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK, Europe, Australia, or New Zealand: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $62 USD, you\u2019ll pay $52 USD. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the twelfth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

Her first and most prominent work, Color Problems: A Practical Manual for the Lay Student of Color, first published in 1901, provides a comprehensive overview of the main ideas of color theory at the time, as well as her wildly original and artistic approaches to color analysis and interaction. Through a 21st century lens, she appears to stumble upon midcentury design and minimalism decades prior to those movements. \nShe was a visionary color theorist whose methods were later adopted by men and became ubiquitous in design curriculums around the world. She was an incredible artist and creative champion whose pioneering work is conspicuously absent in nearly all history books. We aim to change that with this new presentation of her seminal work. In addition to presenting the original book in an accessible softcover, we are offering a beautifully bound hardcover edition exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign. This deluxe facsimile version will not be made available again.\nEmily Noyes Vanderpoel at home (courtesy Litchfield Historical Society)\nHer remarkable inventiveness shines in a series of gridded squares, each 10 x 10, that analyze the proportions of color derived from actual objects, many of which were in Vanderpoel's vast collection of ceramics and antiques. She leaves her process relatively mysterious but what is clear, as historian and science blogger John Ptak\u202fnotes, is that Vanderpoel \u201csought not so much to analyze the components of color itself, but rather to quantify the overall interpretative effect of color on the imagination\u201d. Her square format predates Josef Albers\u2019\u202ficonic Homage to the Square\u202fby some fifty years.\nA Selection of Color Analysis Plates\nThis incredible book has long languished in antiquarian book markets.  Original copies trade hands for more than $500 and it has never received its proper audience. \u202fWe aim to change that, and with this new edition have taken meticulous measures to reproduce the original artifact at an affordable price. Largely disserved by the public domain, this vast 400 page book has been reproduced in recent years by shoddy print-on-demand services, from academically held PDFs and most tragically, only in black and white. Working with the Historical Society that Emily Noyes Vanderpoel helped establish, we are the first to invest the time, money, and love it takes to replicate this brilliant collection of color studies accurately. Using the most current digital methods and archival printing production, we aim to finally do justice to Vanderpoel\u2019s forgotten legacy as visionary and pioneer.\nWe will also be contributing an introduction written by design scholar Alan P. Bruton, who has been researching Vanderpoel and her work for decades. This introduction will serve to reflect on her incredible body of work from the vantage point of 21st century art history and women's movements, helping to illustrate that Vanderpoel remains one of the most important, underrated, and contemporarily relevant artists of her time and of the last century.\n\"Thoroughly conversant with the best scientific research of her day, Emily Noyes Vanderpoel brings an artist\u2019s eye and designer\u2019s sensibility to her prescient study of color. From embroidery and Persian rugs to ceramics and painting, her perceptive analysis reveals what was long hiding in plain sight. The remarkable illustrations are actually works of art that not only anticipate but actually compete with the best work of some of the most important twentieth-century artists.\"\nMark C. Taylor\nColumbia University\n\"Vanderpoel\u2019s delightfully inscrutable work is an artifact from out of time: abstract modernism born of the Victorian need to classify everything\u2014even the mundane. This book inspired me, and deserves this beautiful new treatment in print.\"\nLiza Daly  Author and creator of the Vanderbot \n\"This re-edition of Emily Noyes Vanderpoel's 1901 Color Problems is a fantastic addition to the library of literature that celebrates the wonders of visual experience. The writing is elegant, the information profound. How can we resist a book that opens with an exegesis on various elements of color in nature and on bird songs and Beethoven and declares \"We may aptly term color the music of light\"? The book is both a celebration and a lucid guide: to issues of luminosity and color temperature, and of harmony as well as contrast. And it is a compact dynamo of the history of color theory up to the time of Vanderpoel's writing. The many color plates are magnificent, both in the pleasures they provide and the magic they demonstrate; I feel safe in saying that Josef Albers would have been gobsmacked by this glorious volume.\"\nNicholas Fox Weber\nThe Josef and Anni Albers Foundation\nIn order to produce the beautiful objects you will receive as a backer at such an accessible price we need funds for printing and binding a large run. We aim to print at least 1000 copies, and our goal reflects the production costs for this amount, but the more pledges we get here the more we can print! As an established (although relatively young) publishing company we already have storage and distribution methods streamlined which will make for a seamless experience for our backers. \nWe also plan to spread the word of Vanderpoel's forgotten work as far and wide as we can. We need your help in righting this historical wrong. Tell your friends about Emily Noyes Vanderpoel! They will no doubt be as happy to discover her and her work as we have been. \nPDF - Each backer will receive a download of our high resolution color corrected PDF of the book.

Like the original, the text portion of our edition is printed on a soft uncoated natural stock. The 116 color plates are printed on a bright white coated paper stock to best display colors. The interiors will be offset printed with close attention to color reproduction. The book includes sewn signatures for long term durability and lay flat binding for ease of viewing.

It has never been published and almost disappeared from history after the war, but we are now restoring the pages of one of the most important documents of WW2. \nThe original 112 pages contained thorough information about everything from tidal forces to typical battle tactics and had the absolute highest security stamp during WW2: Top Secret Bigot - above Top Secret.\nIt described the German defenses and typical strongpoints, the risk of chemical attacks and was so thorough it even had an analysis of the soil type on Utah and Omaha Beach.\nThe book will contain a one-to-one copy of the original Monograph, new historical context and rare photos to explore. \nin total app 250 pages in hardcover including the original Monograph, added historical context and rare photos.\nWe will restore every single page from 1944 to its original look as it was presented in the Neptune Monograph. \nThe original Monograph will run on the right page throughout the book. Here you get a rare insight into the depth of the incredible intelligence work and literally cast your eyes on the same pages, that the allied command got in their hand for the first time six weeks before D-Day.\nOriginally the left pages were blank. Here commanders could add their notes and latest updates. We have decided to use this space to give a deeper understanding of the Monograph and add historical context and rare photos on the left pages of the book to explore and get the full picture of how the information was collected.\nThe Neptune Monograph was split into nine sections giving a deep and rare insight into the situation in Normandy six weeks before D-Day. All nine chapters will be in the book. \nThe Monograph has more than 14 pages of charts, maps, and graphics showing predicted German troop movements, tidal charts, and graphics of the layout of typical German strongpoints in Normandy as well as charts of the naval threat from warships and mines. The maps, charts, and folios will be restored and be in the book in full color.\nStretch goals are set up to allow us to expand the book into a package complete with full-size maps and a very rare addendum. This is quite expensive, but we would love to add it to the Neptune Monograph (see below for more information about our stretch goals, and how you can help expand the scope of the project).\nHenrik Elling has worked for more than 15 years teaching history and as an Editor in Chief at Scandinavia's best selling history- and science magazines.

In her spare time, she is a talented artist with a special love for painting collages and creating posters.\nThis document is a unique testimonial and insight into the risks, challenges, and fears the allied force faced before the invasion as well as a testimonial to the incredible work by allied intelligence units before D-Day. \nIt was compiled - with extreme risk - by commandos, naval intelligence, French resistance groups, air surveillance and weather and astronomical experts. \nToday only a few full copies exist worldwide and by reproducing this book we preserve one of World War 2s most important historical documents and make it available for a broader audience for the first time since it was finished in April 1944 and in time for the 75th anniversary in 2019. \nLean back and enjoy your copy of one of the most unique World War 2 books ever made delivered in time for Christmas.

We got the helicopter away from CENTRAL with a dozen or so survivors, our Chief Scientist included - although naturally he spent the entire flight complaining that we'd rescued his lab assistants instead of his research notes.\nThat's where the good news ends, I'm afraid. The political situation is continuing to worsen - NORAD is reporting something with Soviet transponder codes buzzing the Eastern Seaboard, but I know for a fact the Soviets don't have any jets in the area. If we let the aliens run around unopposed for much longer we're going start seeing mushroom clouds on the horizon...\nWe'll have ATLAS Base online by the end of the day. In the meantime, you need to figure out a strategy for rebuilding our organisation, bringing the political situation under control and defeating a vastly superior foe that we know almost nothing about. Best get started, eh? There's coffee in the pot.\nXENONAUTS-2 is a turn-based \"strategic planetary defense simulator\" that puts you in charge of a clandestine military force attempting to protect the planet from extraterrestrial invasion. It is the sequel to the acclaimed Xenonauts, successfully Kickstarted way back in 2012!\nWe are building a hugely complex strategy / tactics game that gives you total control of your organisation all the way from the command staff in your base down to the troops on the battlefield. The formula will be familiar to anyone who has played the classic X-Com games from the 90's (or the modern reboots), but Xenonauts-2 expands those foundations to create something deeper and more distinctive!\nThe action takes place in the modern day - but in an alternative timeline where decades of alien interference has prevented the end of the Cold War, leaving NATO and the Soviet Union teetering on the brink of a catastrophic nuclear war. Can you hold humanity together long enough to end the alien threat forever?\nXenonauts-2 is not a chronological sequel to the first Xenonauts but rather an updated portrayal of similar events. The game is in development on Windows PC and is expected to launch on Steam & GOG in late 2018; we will hopefully natively support Linux and Mac on release but cannot yet offer a firm promise of this (please see the FAQ for further details).\nWe've been developing Xenonauts-2 for three years now and the game is in an advanced state. If you want to check out how things are progressing, you can download a free demo of a single tactical combat mission at the link below. Bear in mind this is still an alpha; expect it to improve a lot before release!\nAh, Commander - so good of you to finally make an appearance. I will refrain from commenting on the (pathetic) attempts of Military Division to defend my laboratory, as I was still able to collect sufficient data during the extraterrestrial attack to validate my theories.\nThe aliens are indeed using a form of matter translocation to deploy their forces. Although I hardly expect you to understand the science, I have now devised a method of tracking the quantum waveform deformation caused by this process to within a ten mile radius.\nOne would hope that providing this organisation with the exact time and location of these alien incursions would be sufficient to allow our soldiers to finally begin collecting the samples and specimens I need to proceed with my work on ENDGAME ... but my experience thus far has taught me to expect otherwise.\nThe Geoscape is where you control the Xenonaut campaign against the extraterrestrial invaders. Alien UFOs and ground teams will conduct hostile operations all across the globe, threatening your funding regions and bringing the world ever closer to nuclear war - that is, unless you stop them!\nYour interceptor squadrons can challenge UFOs in the skies and the soldiers stationed at your base can respond to ground missions, but they cannot be everywhere at once. You will need to choose your missions carefully, maintaining control of the strategic situation whilst also ensuring you recover enough of the alien technology and materials to advance the cause.\nThe alien forces will grow steadily stronger as the invasion progresses, but so too will you. You will gradually learn more about your opponents and develop exotic new weapons, equipment and aircraft to aid you in the fight ... but can you hold out long enough to complete ENDGAME? Or will the Xenonauts see Earth consumed by nuclear flame?\nThe soldiers at your command on the Geoscape are persistent staff who gain combat experience and skills in battle - assuming they live long enough! As well as being deployed to deal with ground missions as part of your strike team, your soldiers can now also be deployed into funding regions as Field Agents.\nField Agents give you a way to influence regions directly - increasing your Relations, rooting out alien infiltrators, covering your organisations' tracks, etc. This is vital work, but it is a highly dangerous occupation in a world riven by paranoia - even before the aliens start getting involved!\nThe Geoscape has been significantly expanded since the first game with the intention of giving the player more choices to make and offering them more freedom. Field Agents are just one example of this - if you're interested, there is more detail on the other changes here!\nThe US built ATLAS back in the sixties as part of Project Iceworm. They didn't bother telling the pesky locals - after all, they might have objected to housing American nukes on their soil. Needless to say, ATLAS was abandoned in a hurry less than a decade later and its existence remains classified at the highest level.\nThat's all rather convenient for us - it's much easier to borrow something if nobody knows it exists. I had a backup command room and a cache of emergency supplies installed a while back, but unfortunately there's no getting around the fact that our new home is a derelict missile silo full of 60s-era junk. Expect fixing her up to take some time.\nIn the meantime, I hope you're fine with cold showers, cold food and... well, cold everything.\nThe loss of CENTRAL Base leaves the Xenonauts operating out of an abandoned missile silo in a remote area of Iceland - but you will need to reclaim and rebuild ATLAS if you are to create a global organisation capable of defeating the alien menace!\nATLAS is where you house the soldiers, scientists and engineers that serve your organisation. Each of your staff can serve in a variety of roles dependent on what structure they are assigned to - e.g. a scientist becomes a researcher in a Lab, and a doctor in a Medical Room.\nThe simulation of your base is deeper than the first game - not only are you juggling living space and working space for your staff, but power capacity, storage space, food consumption and much more. Fresh supplies and new staff are flown to ATLAS by your helicopter, but this prevents it from deploying combat troops - so time your supply runs carefully!\nATLAS is also where your research and development efforts occur. Your scientists study recovered alien technology and draw up designs for all kinds of battlefield equipment for your engineers to build - assuming you've built the facilities and recovered the alien materials they need to do so!\nThe tech tree is much wider and more varied than in the original game. We're adding new types of \"development\" research that improve and upgrade existing equipment (keeping it relevant for longer), working hard to make the different tiers of gear more distinct from one another, and generally trying to add more \"game-changing\" items that keep the combat feeling fresh and novel throughout the campaign!\nIf you're interested, you can read more details about the changes to ATLAS Base and the new Research mechanics on our forums.\nIf our resident brainboxes really do have a way to track the ETs ... well, we might just be able to turn this war around. The tiltrotor can land our troops almost anywhere they want, but we've never had enough intel to locate the aliens before they vanish back to wherever they came from.\nI don't much rate our chances against the assault team that hit CENTRAL this morning, so we should keep a relatively low profile until we've figured out a way to even the odds ... or at least until we've built some defenses that that might help us survive an attack on ATLAS.\nThe aliens must have some soft targets we can take advantage of - I suggest we lay an ambush and try to bring something back for Research Division. At least then we might find out what we're dealing with...\nDeploying a team of soldiers against the aliens on the Geoscape begins a turn-based tactical battle where you are given direct control of your soldiers and tasked with achieving the mission objectives - which could be anything from capturing a downed UFO to capturing (or eliminating) a troublesome VIP!\nThese missions are a deep and challenging tactical experience. We have retained the Time Unit system from the first game that gives you a huge amount of freedom in how you choose to interact with the battlefield (virtually all of which is destructible). We're giving the player even more tactical possibilities this time around - for instance, even the hulls of crashed UFOs can now be breached using the right equipment!\nThe effectiveness of your soldiers depends heavily on what you equip them with - and there is an expanded variety of different weapons and equipment to pick from. You will need to choose your loadout to suit the mission at hand - clearing the confined spaces of an alien base may call for heavy armor and shotguns, but you may find sniper rifles more valuable if a crashed UFO has come down in an open desert!\nAll of these battles are dynamically generated based on the strategic situation - e.g. if you shoot down a Scout UFO in an Arctic region, you'll be presented with a ground mission where you can attempt to capture a downed Scout UFO in a polar environment!\nThere are a wide variety of missions and environments for you to experience as you wage your global war against the aliens, all rendered in a high-fidelity 3D recreation of the classic isometric visual style. We are focused on minimizing map and mission repetition in order to maximise replayability - we want this to be a game you can pick up and play for years to come!\nThe alien species you face on the battlefield are deadly foes that each pose a different set of tactical challenges. We are working to imbue them with more character for the sequel, giving the returning faces a visual upgrade and updating their combat mechanics to ensure they feel unique!\nIf you are interested in reading more about the changes we have planned for the ground combat, you can do so here.\n We can't risk dealing with funding regions directly, Commander - too many infiltrators. We rely on a network of individuals willing to 'misplace' things in the name of the cause ... a few crates of supplies, the odd helicopter, maybe a few million dollars here and there.\nThere's risks, of course - mostly revolving around getting murdered by aliens - but someone has to do it. Each individual person plays only a small role, but everything we do relies on their collective support. Our backers are just as much a part of this war as we are.\nWe're a small team working on a really big idea - and we need your help! \nSo far we have been able to fund the development of Xenonauts-2 from the sales of the first Xenonauts, but we simply don't have enough money to include everything we want in the game. Instead of trying to raise money from publishers, we're turning to the people who have always supported us when we needed it most - our fans!\nRaising additional funds would allow us the breathing space we need to properly polish the game up before release. Some of this will be spent on adding cool new features and neat little touches to the game, but we'll also use it to ensure there is an extended period of community playtesting that will allow us to iron out countless balance issues, bugs and usability problems.\nThe \u00a335+ tiers allow you to put a custom soldier in the game with your name, nationality and a unique face generated from our portrait editor!\nYou can see all the cool rewards available to backers to the right of this page. As well as getting access to the game on Steam or DRM-free on GOG, higher tiers give players digital copies of the soundtrack and access to our closed beta.\nThose willing to back at \u00a335 or above can put a custom soldier in the game with their own name, nationality and a unique portrait created from our free Portrait Generator tool (see FAQ for full details). This soldier will appear in your starting squad every game!\nBacking our highest tiers gets you a custom portrait hand-painted from a photo by our portrait artist!\nThose willing to back at the highest tiers can have a custom portrait painted from a photo by our portrait artist. You can see an example of the results above, painted from a still in our Kickstarter video!\nAs we're asking for your help to add extra features to the game, we thought we should let you choose the order of the stretch goals! \nFor the first week of this Kickstarter, we will be running a vote to set the order of the stretch goals, with the most popular features becoming the first stretch goals!\n\u00a350,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #1 (unlocked by hitting our funding goal!)\n\u00a375,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #2\n\u00a3100,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #3\n\u00a3150,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #4\n\u00a3200,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #5\n\u00a3250,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #6\nThese are the features that you'll be able to vote for - click the link if you're interested in more detail on what each one involves!\nMARS Weapon Platform & Sentry Guns\nModular Weapons\nLocational Injuries\nOrchestral Soundtrack Recording\nAdditional Xenonauts-2: Community Edition / Modding Support\nReaper Hives\nWeather Conditions\nGeoscape Situations\nThese are all features we'd like to experiment with, so we may implement some of them even if they don't make it as a stretch goals - this vote is just to let us know the ideas you think are most exciting!\n\"We had a bad day at the office today, folks. Let's all take a moment to thank the big man up in the sky for watching over us. You know who I'm talking about ... SKYRANGER's got your back!\" \n- Removed from ATLAS noticeboard\nThanks for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter!

This is a turbulent time, with bandits lurking in the wilds of the countryside, and pirates roaming the high seas. Evil taints the hearts of men, and many give in to temptation. Many, but not all. Against this tide of corruption stands Solomon Kane. This mortal hero fights his lone crusade, aided by the silent might of the immortal Virtues. Together they fight against the implacable Darkness. This is the fearless opponent who tries to thwart our hero at every turn, and who must be overcome by the players if Solomon Kane is to emerge victorious.\nDarkness has emissaries too, and these Shadows are also attracted by Solomon Kane\u2019s faith. Shadows are not physical beings \u2013 they are the essence of the nameless horror that hides just out of sight, the lurking danger you think you glimpse from the corner of your eye, or the secret dread that sends shivers down your spine. This can drive lesser men to madness, and even Solomon Kane could be overwhelmed, for whilst his faith is strong, Darkness is powerful too. Solomon Kane can see neither Virtue nor Shadow, yet he can feel both, and he has his faith. This tells him that Good must triumph over Evil. It is up to the Virtues to ensure that he is right.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\u201cSolomon Kane\u2026 considered himself the fulfiller of God\u2019s judgment, a vessel of wrath to be emptied upon the souls of the unrighteous.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe central figure in the game is Solomon Kane himself. He is a dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs who roams the world, fighting against the ungodly and evil works of men and foul magic alike. He follows no master save his conscience, though that alone drives him to the ends of the Earth to fulfil his quest. All his life he has travelled, aiding the weak and fighting oppression. From the bleak moors of England, through the damp forests of Germany, to the sweltering jungles and savannahs of Africa \u2013 even to the shores of the distant New World of America.\nSpace Marine (Warhammer 40K), Warrior (Rising Sun), Vampire (Solomon Kane), Conan (Conan), Solomon Kane (Solomon Kane), Leonidas (Mythic Battles), Bandit (Solomon Kane), Khorne Warrior and Stormcast Eternals (Shadespire)\nHe neither knows nor questions why he is driven to do this. It simply must be done. To Solomon Kane, he is doing God\u2019s work. To his enemies he is a relentless fury, armed with flintlock and rapier, and armoured in unshakeable faith. The knowledge of the rightness of his cause makes him unstoppable, and gives him the ability to overcome any fiend or demon. At least, it does when the Virtues are on his side.\n\u201cHow I overcame it, I know not, for the battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe Solomon Kane core box comes with 4 complete Adventures: one each in 1 Act, two in 2 Acts, and one in 3 Acts. These stories are the Rattle of Bones, Skulls in the Stars, Death's Black Riders, and the Blue Flame of Vengeance - all based on original tales from Robert E Howard. We unlocked three 1 Act original stories, the Witchfinder General, L'Ogre and Beast of Bordeaux. With 10 Chapters per Act, this gives you 110 Chapters to explore, about 60 hours to play these stories once, and many, many hours of replay value.\nWe have many stretch goals planned for this Kickstarter campaign, adding new miniatures, Adventures, and other surprises. All stretch goals that we unlock during this campaign will be added FREE to every Puritan pledge, and every additional copy of the core box you pledge for.\nSOCIAL STRETCH GOALS\nThe Puritan Pledge contains many, many hours of game play, and stretch goals add even more. However, if you\u2019re enjoying Solomon Kane we will be revealing some additional content during the campaign that you may want to add to your pledge. If you\u2019re interested in purchasing any add-on, just click the Manage your Pledge button at the top of this page, and increase your current pledge amount by the amount of the extra items that you\u2019d like to add. Kickstarter doesn\u2019t let you specify what you want at this stage, so we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed. The system we use for this is called a Pledge Manager, and all backers will be sent a link to this after the Kickstarter campaign closes.\n(To find more about All-in bundles, click here)\nRED SHADOWS\nTHE ART BOOK OF SOLOMON\nThe Right Hand of Doom\n(To find more about this expansion, click here)\nHEART OF AFRICA\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAGAINST THE VAMPIRES\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAMERICA - THE NEW WORLD\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nEach player takes the part of one of the four Cardinal Virtues: Courage, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, each with a special combination of abilities that reflect their unique role. Together they must help Solomon Kane achieve his mission.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nCourage\nCourage is bold and sometimes reckless. She cannot sit idly by, and encourages Solomon to resolve everything with action! Her specialities are Moving and Fighting.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nPrudence\nPrudence tries to keep an eye on everything. She helps the other Virtues as well as Solomon, providing vital support to both.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nJustice\nJustice is willing to listen to both sides. She is fair and balanced, and is expert at finding a solution that benefits everyone. Her areas of skill are Talking and Influencing a situation for the better.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nTemperance\nTemperance keeps a sharp eye and a clear head. She encourages Solomon to keep his wits about him, and be aware of what is going on around him. Her speciality is exploring the environment, and avoiding nasty surprises.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\"The battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell. \"\n Allied Mortals\nSolomon Kane is a loner, and only begrudgingly accepts the aid of others in his quest. However, when others need his aid he is quick to come to their assistance, and this means that his Adventures against the Darkness sometimes include companions. \nN'Longa is not included in the Core Box. But you will see him soon!\nN'Longa and Solomon Kane, blood brothers\n Solomon Kane\u2019s only regular companion is N\u2019longa \u2013 a self-styled \u201cmighty worker of nameless magic\u201d. Despite their significant differences in outlook, they get along perfectly, saving each other from death on more than one occasion. It is hard to say which one of them relies more on the other. \nJack is a hot-headed, somewhat naive, but well-meaning young man, whose main goal is to protect Mary and her honour. He falls in with Solomon Kane when the Puritan comes to his rescue.\nMary is the archetypical damsel in distress. If Jack can't save her, then Solomon Kane will always be ready to protect any innocent in peril.  \nThe wrong place at the wrong time, that\u2019s the best way to describe the unfortunate traveller. He really should have waited for daylight to cross that moor\u2026\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n Darkness is the natural opponent of Light. It is a combination of all the secret, unsavoury feelings and deeds which men are capable of. It lurks in the blackness, moulding the essence of the night into its minions, and sending them to plague the mortal world.\nShadows  \nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nThe main servants of Darkness are the mist-like Shadows. They are not really creatures at all, more embodiments of a terrifying idea. One that can drive mortals to insanity and death.\nMortals  \nThrough his many Adventures, Solomon Kane encounters a wide variety of misguided, malevolent, or just plain evil individuals who all do Darkness\u2019 bidding \u2013 whether they realise it or not. These range from simple thugs, through cannibal tribesmen, to otherworldly and magical creatures. Solomon Kane must overcome them all.    \nSolomon Kane and Jack Hollinster ready to confront Fishhawk and his pirates\n Latest Rules Playthrough - The Blue Flame of Vengeance - 3rd July\nPlease note that components and rules used in this video are not final and are subject to change.\nSolomon Kane\u2019s lifelong fight against Darkness is told in a series of Adventures, based on the stories and characters created by Robert E. Howard. Adventures are broken down into 1-5 Acts, depending on their length. Each Act is itself broken down into 8-10 Chapters. A gaming session will typically be a single Act, or part of one. Depending on the time you have available, you may play through a whole Act, or be able to complete only a few of its Chapters. If this is the case, you simply use the game\u2019s save function to remember where you have got to, and you can return to complete the rest of the Adventure another day.\nChapter 1 - \"Skulls in the stars\"\nWhen you play through an Act, you naturally start with the first Chapter. One player reads the narrative text aloud and follows the instructions on the card. The players then do their best to help Solomon Kane overcome whatever challenges the Chapter throws his way, and then they move onto the next one.\nEach Virtue Turn, the controlling player rolls their Fate dice to see what resources they have available to pay for actions. These dice can be donated to other players, or saved for later Turns, as well as buying actions immediately, and deciding how to coordinate these actions and share these resources between the players is a big part of the game. Solomon Kane takes the concept of cooperation very much to heart, and the players need to be discussing and working together throughout the game. Even when it is not your Turn you are involved in vital decisions.\nAllocating dice during your turn\nAfter each player\u2019s Virtue Turn comes a Darkness Turn. This is where the AI deck acts to thwart the players and destroy Solomon Kane. It can move its minions on the board, trigger unpleasant events, or simply sap the will of the mortals to carry on.\nThe Act continues with the players resolving one Chapter card after another, with their Adventure unfolding as they do. After many trials and obstacles, a final Chapter card will tell the players whether their actions have been enough to achieve victory, and whether they have won or lost. Solomon Kane is a pure co-op game, and players either all win together, or all lose together.\nCARDS\nSolomon Kane uses a number of different card types to tell the stories. These are:  \nChapter Cards  \nThese tell the steps in the story. Each Chapter number has a number of different options represented by different cards, some easier to complete, some near-impossible. This is a little bit like going through a choose-your-own adventure book, but instead of simply picking what you want to do, the players have to achieve a particular effect with their actions to decide what happens next. \n(To find more about Chapters, click here)\nChapter cards come in two main types: Story and Scene. A Story Chapter contains the next piece of the tale to read aloud. A Scene Chapter contains the map layout, miniatures, and objectives to play it out on the board.\nDarkness Cards \nThe Darkness deck is what drives the player\u2019s opponent. Each card is divided into several sections, each applying in a different circumstance. This allows the AI to be flexible and to react differently to each situation. Using them is simple: just flip the top card of the deck at the start of each Darkness Turn and do what it says.    \nEvent Cards  \nWhen a Shadow triggers an Event, the next card in this deck is revealed. This is usually bad, though not always. Occasionally the Light shines through the Darkness and a brief reprieve is granted to Solomon Kane and his companions.   \nVirtue Cards\nEach Virtue has their own unique 10-card deck of Virtue cards. These cards list the possible actions for that Virtue, together with the cost in Fate dice to perform each one. In principle, any Virtue can do any action, though only some of the actions will be available at any one time. During the game, players must carefully manage their decks, ensuring that their active cards give them the most useful range of options for the task at hand, and work well alongside those of their companions.\nDiscovery Cards  \nThere are many secrets in Solomon Kane, and whilst the Adventures are based on Robert E. Howard\u2019s tales, they have been greatly expanded. Where Solomon chose one path in the original works he now has a choice. That is, the players collectively have a choice to decide, by their actions, which path to take. Discovery cards hide many of the possible outcomes from the players, and keep the elements of tension and surprise: you must decide before you know for sure what will happen next. This means that even if you have played the Adventure before, there will be fresh elements each time. \n(To find more about Discovery cards, click here)\nMAP TILES\n Each Scene Chapter has a map, made up of 1 or more of the many double-sided tiles from the box. Maps vary in size and shape, each offering a unique puzzle for the players to unpick. \nFATE DICE\n Each Turn, a player rolls 3 Fate Dice to see what energies are available. The fate dice show Bravery, Determination, Fear, Pain, and (of course) Faith.\nEach of the Virtue cards has a number of slots for these resources, and the action on that card can be bought by filling those slots with matching results on the Fate dice. The ability to save some rolled dice for future Turns, and donate much-needed resources to other players makes for a lively discussion. What is the best thing to do?  \nDASHBOARDS\nVirtues\nEach player has a dashboard for the Virtue they are playing. These are all different. They include unique actions, effects of the Virtue\u2019s aura, and spaces for reserved and donated dice.  \nCourage Virtue dashboard with attached Virtue cards\nAdventure track\nThere are four game values that are tracked throughout the game. Three of these are measures of Solomon Kane\u2019s abilities: Strength, Clarity, and Compassion. Each of these is linked to a specific type of test: Strength to Fighting, Clarity to Exploring, and Compassion to Talking. As the game progresses, these tracks may rise and fall. In addition, there is a fourth track: Danger. This monitors the overall Danger of the situation. The more it rises, the more perilous the situation gets.\nEach of the Virtues is linked to one of these tracks. Their actions will often draw upon it, and in the process can lower or increase its value. However, these tracks apply to every Virtue. Even if it is Courage who is most tied to the Strength track, all Fight tests triggered by any Virtue will apply its modifier to them. So, whilst each Virtue looks after its own track, their management of it will impact every player, requiring them to work together.\nMINIATURES\nSame scale, different sizes!\nSolomon Kane includes a huge selection of beautiful 35mm scale miniatures, ranging from the man himself, through dastardly foes and innocent bystanders, to the towering Virtues who aid him. Although nominally 35mm (the height of an average man), the miniatures are all different sizes depending on the individual they represent. This gives us a range from 27mm tall children to the 90mm tall Virtues. Each miniature is a carefully-sculpted masterpiece, full of character. To further enhance this, and to give the painters among our backers even more to enjoy, each sculpt also has its own unique scenic base.\nEach model has its own unique scenic base!\n KANE'S CRUSADE\nThe Mythic Games Ambassador Programme has over 30 Ambassadors across six countries who tirelessly share out games with board game communities. We have already hosted over 60 events and demonstrations while also attending major conventions such as Cannes and UKGE. We have over 50 more events planned already which you can find listed on our Facebook page including attending Paris est Ludique, Origins, Gen Con and Essen SPIEL.\nSeveral hundred public demos organised for Kane's Crusade\nSolomon Kane is a simple fellow, and to reflect this we have only a single core pledge level: the Puritan.\nHowever, we also believe in rewarding our most loyal fans, and those who believe in us the most. For this reason, backers who pledge for Solomon Kane in the first 24 hours have the option of a Puritan pledge with an extra Early Bird bonus!   \nIf you are a board game retailer and are interested in Solomon Kane, please click here. \nPour d\u00e9couvrir cette page en fran\u00e7ais, cliquez ici\nAll pledge levels are available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language you prefer in the pledge manager, after the campaign. This campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations.

Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect your address information via our pledge manager, after the campaign ends. The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard core pledge of Solomon Kane. This is based on the costs for our last campaign and the assumption that the final weight will be comparable. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose. If the game is significantly lighter than Joan of Arc, then some of the higher end costs may drop.  \n\nUSA: $32\nCANADA: $35\nEUROPE (EU): $32-$40\nEUROPE (non-EU): $40-$65\nLATIN AMERICA: $100-$150\nOCEANIA: $40 to Australia. $80 to New-Zealand\nASIA: $40-$70\nREST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $100-$150\nOur fulfilment process aims to be as fair as possible. For this reason, rewards are sent to all backers (including any retail backers) at the same time. Due to the unpredictability of the postal services we cannot guarantee the order in which they arrive.  \n\n\nThis is the latest Mythic Games team photo we could find.

Producing thousands of complex products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date. \n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon began delivery earlier than originally planned, and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc is currently on schedule to hit its planned date. We are confident that Solomon Kane will deliver on time too. \n\nThat brings us to communications: we think they are very important. During this campaign we will post at least one update every day. Afterwards, we will continue to keep you regularly updated with all the latest info in our famous weekly \u201cWhat\u2019s up Wednesday\u201d updates. This means that you\u2019ll always know what\u2019s going on in the adventurous world of Solomon Kane!\n\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy. \n\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date. \n\nIf you apply for a refund more that 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\n\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available. \n\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will also be in USD.\n\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Road, MTB, CX, Gravel, E-bikes. One universal, we all suffer flats. A dependable and user-friendly pump is the most critical piece of equipment a cyclist can carry.\nIntroducing The Stompump, foot pump.\nFlat tires happen. The Stompump is the first compact, foot actuated inflator. The Stompump stows neatly on your bike, your car, motorcycle, or backpack. This is why we've created the Stompump, so you can easily and safely inflate a flat tire. No need to fiddle with Co2 inflators or unreliable and clumsy frame pumps.\nThe Stompump mounted to bottle-cage bosses using the Frame Dock\nThe Stompump will come complete will all accessories pictured\nStompump has a maximum pressure of 90 PSI\nStompump Weights & Dimensions\nDo you Need a Stompump?\nEvery cyclist will experience a flat tire. Traditional hand pumps, CO2 inflators, and mini pumps are cumbersome, require a lot of strength and energy to use, and most importantly do not work well. The Stompump can inflate a tire 3 times faster than a hand-pump, using far less energy. It\u2019s also not as risky as a Co2 inflator, or as challenging as a mini pump. Do you want to struggle with 'the get-it-perfect or you\u2019re stuck' scenario with a Co2 cartridge?\nThe Stompump will inflate a 29er MTB tire 3 times faster than a hand pump\nThe Stompump was born 2 years ago after a miserable experience on the side of the road in a freezing rainstorm fighting a mini-pump for 20 minutes to fix a flat. We needed a solution. Since that time, we have spent countless hours perfecting a pump for all types of cyclists.\nMany cyclists are using higher volume tires, from mountain bikes and fat bikes to gravel-road bikes and even traditional road bikes. The higher volume/larger tires means better ride quality, traction and efficiency. With these larger tires comes the need for a pump that is optimized for pumping more air per compression. This is where The Stompump excels! The Stompump also works with many other inflation applications.\nStompump Mounted with the Frame Dock on a Gravel Grinder bike.\nThe Stompump is a great tool for all areas of your life.\nInflating a Fat-Bike tire 3 times faster than a handpump.\nThe Stompump includes some features that most portable pumps do not. We've incorporated a cylindrical storage compartment, 22.2mm x 53mm. very handy for a patch kit or any thing else of similar size. We've also engineered an air filter for the intake. This keeps The Stompump's internals clean of dirt and debris and working smoothly.\nThe integrated Storage Compartment: you can put anything you want in here. Pictured with tubeless repair Plugs.\nThe integrated Air Filter, keeps the incoming air clean and your Stompump working smoothly\nThe Stompump is completely serviceable as well as rebuildable and repairable. We've built this pump to never need any significant service, but should you need to it's simple to disassemble and clean.\nEasy to disassemble for servicing should you ever need to\nThe Stompump is Compatible with both Presta and Schrader valve stems.\nIf we reach our funding goal early we'll open up a Reward that enables your choice of colored hoses!\nThe Creators of The Stompump have been the brains behind bringing hundreds of products to market over the last 30 years. Most recently we launched the Bar Fly brand of products. We've designed and manufactured OEM Products for companies like Cycliq, Cervelo, Specialized, Sigma and more. Not to mention the work we do with other companies like the Longnow Foundation, and Universal Sonar Mount. We\u2019ve spent our lives innovating and creating things that make our lives easier! We've compiled much of the IP that's gone into The Stompump through our hobby as Battlebots competitors, winning 7 championship \"nuts\" over several weight classes.\nBronco, the latest in a long line of our Battlebots, winning against Stinger\nMedia Coverage\nReason Bradley & Woody Tate", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Stompump Patron", "descp": "Pledge anywhere from $5 to $5000, you'll get updates, our eternal gratitude, AND a Stompump sticker!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Colored Hose", "descp": "1 Hose for Stompump.

We aim to create a highly unique collection of board games for an international audience using high-quality design and production standards.\nGamebook is not like most books\u2014it\u2019s interactive. People have been playing games for all of recorded history, and there is evidence to indicate we played them before recorded history, too. We believe that games have always been an important tool for human social interaction, and Gamebook is designed to encourage this. Each game included in the Gamebook has multiple variations requiring different strategies and approaches, making each game yours to play and explore in your own unique way.\nGamebook is a collection of ancient abstract strategy board games: Surakarta, Tablut, Pachisi, Alquerque, Mu Torere, Senet, Nine Men\u2019s Morris and Stern-halma.\nWe have searched the rich history of board games for untold stories. Gamebook contains eight abstract strategy board games, carefully selected from the rich world gaming heritage. Gamebook encompasses history, theory and practice of selected board games.\nAssemble four boards of the Gamebook to create a new board game specially designed and developed for this edition!\nWho is Gamebook for?\nGamebook contains board games ranging from two to six players. The board games were chosen based on their difficulty, from basic board games to ones requiring more complex strategies. Gamebook is appropriate for many different ages, so don't worry about who you invite to game night! :)\nOn the left side Hana and on the right side Ema Jesih are playing board game Alquerque.\nAesthetics and Design\nAll selected games are re-designed to a unified graphic language, built of basic geometrical forms by a limited range of colours. Each game has been refined to include only the essential elements necessary for gameplay, and each game board is treated as abstract art based on the textures of different drawing materials.\nMagic Binding\nGamebook features two innovative designs - the box for game pieces is also the book's backbone that holds the pages together with simple and very effective magnetic binding. Every page is simply plucked out when you want to play, and put back in; you can arrange the book as you like.\nFigures, sticks and a dice\nGamebook includes everything you need to start playing any of the board games. The backbone of the book contains a concealed department for all small figures, six two-sided sticks and a dice. Before the invention of dice, most board games were played with sticks, stones or cowrie shells. The flat side of the stick is the \u201cheads up\u201d side. Different combinations give different scores, giving a totally different dynamic to certain games.\nBooklet of History and Rules\nWhere did board games come from? How did our ancestors play board games? Which abstract strategy board games concepts have spread around the world? The answers to these questions can be found in the booklet of History & Rules. The booklet is included on the back page of the book. You can pluck it out and read it separately so it won\u2019t disturb the game flow of the game you're playing.\nRewards\nStretch goals\nGamebook trilogy\nResearch about board games has revealed a whole new world. The history of board games is full of mysteries, myths and secrets. We have created a collection of forgotten board game classics. These games are the foundation of so many modern board games. We have chosen eight board games for the first edition of Gamebook, but we would love to continue our investigation and search for lost board games around the world. There are so many more games to find, explore, study and publish. We want to make a Gamebook collection \u2014 possibly a Gamebook trilogy.\nHibird Books\nOur goal is to establish our own publish company called Hibird Books. Our vision is to publish extraordinary books and to connect unseen combinations of media and materials. Hibird Books main interests are special editions, interactive books, book-objects and artist\u2019s books. Help us bring our Gamebook project to life and many more unusual books will follow. Only time will tell where the path will end. Join us! Back us up. :)\nBook Specification\nBook dimensions: 32 x 28 x 2,2 cm (12.6\"x11\"x0.86\") \nGame boards dimensions: 28 x 28 cm (11\"x11\") \nWeight: 1,2 kg (2.64 Ibs)\nMaking Gamebook prototypes\nPLAY\n\nGamebook is mostly handcrafted. We have made several prototypes to find the best materials and a suitable shape for the book. Almost the entire book is made using recycled materials. The core of the pages and box are cardboard, and we used recycled paper for the pages and for the History & Rules booklet. The figures and dice are made of wood. The rest is a secret! If you are interested in the story of Gamebook\u2019s creation, especially the making of Gamebook prototypes you can follow us (Hibird Books) on Instagram or Facebook.\nPeople behind the project \n Founders:\nHana Jesih (founder of Gamebook) is a book designer & illustrator who loves to make mind-maps, travel and is taller than Peter. You can see her other book design projects on her website or you can take a look at her gallery space on her Instagram page.\nPeter Plantan (cofounder of Gamebook) is an architect who hates and loves everything at the same time and is a fan of Anthony Bourdain. You can get to know his world view on his Instagram page.\nVideo Credits:\nNejc Gazvoda is a film director and writer. He was in charge of the script and directing the video. He wanted to use slider in the video, we made his wish come true.\nMarko Pirc takes credit for photography and shooting the presentation video. His favourite sandwich is chips with sausage and chips on the top.\nVoice over: Michael Manske\nSong: \"Jadranje\", from the original soundtrack for the film \"Pot v raj\" composed by Andi Koglot and Laren Polic Zdravi\u010d.\nSpecial thanks to NEJC GAZVODA, friend no.1. Big thanks to STA\u0160 STANKOVI\u010c and MARKO PIRC from LUMULABS for all advices. They also let us work on the presentation in their office and lent us their equipment and gadgets. MARU\u0160A HREN for all her tips and help with bookbinding, MILENA JAKOVLJEVI\u010c from MEDIODROM for tips in mediamarketing, JURE TURK for IT support, NIKO KLAN\u0160EK for business support, GREGA PLANTAN for legal advice, SAMO KRALJ for producing wooden playing sticks, IVO VESELI\u010c for his own versions of texts and our FAMILY for moral support and food. Thanks also to all other friends who helped us in any kind of way. ;)\nTimetable\nWe have spent the last year researching board game history and designing and testing our Gamebook. All aspects of our designs have been thoroughly considered at each stage of the product creation process, from concept design, materials and technical aspects to numerous prototypes. It\u2019s been a wonderful journey, and now we\u2019re almost ready for the manufacturing stage. Only with the help of Kickstarter and, most importantly, our backers will we finally be able to bring our Gamebook project to life. If you know any friends, family, colleagues or random strangers who may be interested in our project, please help us spread the word! You can expect to receive your order by November 2018.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDuring the process of making the Gamebook prototypes, we collaborated with different print shops and book manufacturers. On a technical level, the pages and binding, even though they are innovative, shouldn't present any major manufacturing difficulties. The final look and materials may change a little bit in the production process, but only to improve the durability and sustainability of the product. The main task will be to manufacture a box for figures and dice that satisfies the level of craftsmanship we stand for. Considering all the facts, we believe that everything is possible if you stand by your goals and believe in your product. We believe in ours. We will try to keep the process as simple as possible.

Lost in thought, you remember the first time you came across a Spanish Galleon. Few of you managed to escape that mess with your lives, but that marked the moment when you began forging your destiny as a pirate. Now, your reputation precedes you wherever you go, instilling fear among your enemies. Nothing will get in your way of becoming the most infamous pirate to ever sail the high seas\u2026\nMake your own destiny and become the terror of the seas in Skull Tales: Full Sail!\nSkull Tales: Full Sail! is a pirate adventures board game with miniatures. Set sail on the Southern Lady and explore the beautiful Caribbean sea, ripe with fearsome enemies and amazing treasures. Fame and fortune await you!\nChoose among twelve starting characters, each one with its own unique miniature, to be used on the different boards as you play through the game. Find all the information you need to start playing on their character sheets.\nIn Skull Tales: Full Sail! You\u2019ll be able to play individual scenarios or embark upon an immersive campaign that threads several different scenarios together into one captivating storyline.\nSkull Tales, created by David Illescas, is a semi-cooperative game for 1-5 players aged 14 and up. The approximate playing time in Campaign Mode is between 60-90 minutes for one scenario and about 150 minutes for a complete chapter (Voyage, Adventure and Port). The game also includes 52 miniatures - not counting stretch goals!\nDuring the Voyage Phase, which simulates being on a pirate ship, we\u2019ll be managing the crew that makes up our ship while we explore the map on the way towards our objective...or objectives! But, the Captain might have a hidden agenda that he/she is keeping from the rest of the crew\u2026\nThroughout this phase, characters will take on different jobs: steering the ship, managing boarding actions, cleaning up, or even fighting sea creatures. The idea is to gain the confidence of the crew, which will depend on where you place your character and how good he/she is at dealing with all the dangerous events you\u2019ll be facing together. The Captain will be able to assign different tasks to the crewmembers, but watch out - the other pirates can conspire against him/her!\nUnfortunately, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of things that can negatively affect crew's morale: hunger, losing battles, unexpected events, etc. If morale suffers too much, another pirate can organize a mutiny to take over the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges\u2026\nCharacters will earn Trust Points as they carry out duties on the ship, and these points will turn into Prestige Points once the Voyage phase comes to an end. This way, your pirate will start to gain a fearsome reputation!\nIn the Adventure Phase you\u2019ll explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, and abandoned temples. You\u2019ll also have the chance to pillage colonial villas and find legendary objects. However, there are frightening creatures and challenging enemies to face along the way.\nThe Adventure map develops as terrain tiles appear randomly according to the specifications of the scenario, making each game different!\nOn the Adventure board you\u2019ll be able to see how much time you have left to carry out the mission, as well as the current danger level\u2026\nEnemies have cards that outline their characteristics and a corresponding miniature. Also, every opponent you face will have a behavior or AI that generates reactions at unpredictable times, making each adventure a challenge.\nIn the Port Phase your character can acquire new abilities and equipment by interacting with the residents of Tortuga Island and visiting its different locations. But be careful, this place hides secrets that can make a pirate\u2019s fate take a turn for the worst.\nEach player will have time units they\u2019ll use to carry out actions, while making sure they are ready to go when the ship sets sail: heal wounds, learn abilities, make bets, listen out for rumors, equip and improve the ship, etc. Each location has an Event Deck, and there are also independent decks for Rumors and Captain Assignments.\nThe following list has everything initially included in the base game, not counting components that may have been unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe base game box also comes with a quick-start 10 chapter campaign (Campaign I) and a couple of special scenarios.\nThe new Skull Tales miniatures have been completely remodeled and will be made with a high quality plastic that is flexible, easy to paint, and allows for more clearly detailed figures. We have already started testing and the results are spectacular.\nThe scale of the miniatures is approximately 30-32mm up to the eye-line and not including the base.\n (Images courtesy from Icue)\nPIRATE contest! (Unlocked): Share videos, photos or audio files of your family and friends with a pirate theme. If we get 200 interactions, between Twitter & Facebook, we will include a sliding chest box to store our booty (80x80x50mm) for all the backers of the game.

They were strong, muscular women with a height that surpassed our tallest men. They seemed taken by some strange trance, as their rage was supernatural\u2026 The true Amazonians arrive, whose legend gave name to one of the most famous rivers in the world. These warrior princesses are willing to fight to the last woman, and woe the man who stands in their way! 6 Amazonian miniatures with enemy card.\n$438000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New cards for the incident deck, adding 4 new dangers to our adventures.\n$445000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): We are changing four small tile designs into two large tile designs to give scenarios more variety. This double-sided tile is like the Village tiles in that it is 4 times bigger than the smaller ones.\n$460000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New Enemy: Stranglers (4 miniatures). We came ashore in the midst of a frightful fog \u2013 you could barely see your hand in front of your face. The vast mounds of seaweed were beyond anything natural, suggesting that the tide in this area was stronger and pulled any marine life from the depths of the sea onto the beaches. When the seaweed began to move, I felt as though someone was strangling me to death. Fear overcame me, especially when I saw our pistols did little damage against the shapes covered in seaweed. Another enemy comes to join the rest of the abominations. On this occasion, we\u2019re releasing 4 Strangler miniatures and their enemy card.\n$467000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards (2 models). You won\u2019t believe the beauty that I found on the last galley captured by the Brotherhood\u2026 Our market keeps on receiving new merchandise to equip your pirates with the best against their enemies. 2 x Light Blunderbuss: able to fire at adjacent enemies, but with a shorter range than pistols. 2 x Poison Vials: choose a melee weapon at the beginning of the adventure. That weapon inflicts an additional wound.\n$487000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Tarantula Anansi (Giant miniature). And Anansi came from the shadows, wrapping that pirate up in a cocoon of silk, making quick work of the poor lad\u2026 The powerful tarantula Anansi has arrived to Skull Tales: Full Sail! the Caribbean will never be safe with the presence of this supernatural beast. This time, we\u2019re adding an enemy that brings new game mechanics with enemies that take up four spaces. The Tarantula Anansi is represented by a miniature the size of 4 spaces, and comes with her corresponding enemy card.\n$494000 (Unlocked, Base Game): 5 Port Events. The chapel was quieter than usual, the silence falling over the silhouettes as they brought their offerings. This didn\u2019t feel right\u2026 Five new events to add variety to the Port Phase.\n$509000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Campaign V complete. The Brotherhood has received what at first was thought to be a Royal order. After the initial refusal to carry it out, it has become an ultimatum. They have been accused of being behind a series of supernatural events that is reducing the free labor population in the colonies and negatively affecting profits from the slave trade. Either the Brotherhood takes charge of solving this mystery, or the British Empire will bring down all its might upon Tortuga Isle. The only clue that we have involves the appearance, however strange, of huge amounts of spider webs after each event\u2026\n$516000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards. You have asked us on many occasions and our armorer has listened\u2026we\u2019re adding one more copy of the Net, Hook, Bandoleer, and Shovel cards.\n$530000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Character: Swordsman.  \"He spent years searching for his mother\u2019s assassin. But, although he is a master fencer, his sanity is fading away, and he now spends most of his day accusing anyone who crosses his path: \u201cYou killed my mother... prepare to die!\"\nWe\u2019re going to add 6 Final Boss designs to the enemy cards. Each boss will have its own personalized characteristics with different behaviors and abilities. Tlanchana, the queen of the mermaids; Oggum, herald of Yemay\u00e1; Charles Vane, Captain of the Black Sails; and Anansi, the avatar tarantula. We kept rummaging through our last treasure chest and we\u2019ve found a pack of more than 5 cards that are being added to the ones already unlocked.

We've been working days and nights with manufacturers over the past 4 months and have fully set up our supply chain.\n\nWhere we are heading:\nThe biggest challenge we face in this project is tooling. It takes about 6 weeks to make the molds we need and then we begin the process of refinement. We won't stop until it's perfect and we've padded our timeline to account for multiple rounds of tweaking. We just can't know for sure how long it will take to reach perfection. We will have Josh, our lead Industrial Designer and modern-day MacGyevor, to thank when we've cleared this hurdle. \n\nWe've had over 900 SuperStraps Ambassadors help us refine various designs on SuperStraps, but we want to get your input too.

You become a member of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (BPRD), ready to investigate occult threats that threaten our very existence. You will explore gothic locations, hunt down clues, discover artefacts, fight horrific creatures and face off against terrifying bosses.\nFor more details about the 'Box Full of Evil' click here.\nFor full details of what's included in the Darkness Calls expansion, click here.\n For full details of what's included in the Hellboy in Mexico expansion, click here.\nRESIN MINIATURES\nFor more details on the resin miniatures, please check here.\nDesigned by James M. Hewitt - the brains behind the likes of Blood Bowl 2016, Necromunda: Underhive, and Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower - Hellboy: The Board Game features incredibly detailed, pre-assembled PVC plastic miniatures that capture the unique look and feel of Mike Mignola\u2019s visionary work.    \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nHellboy: The Board Game gives you the chance to take control of an iconic member of the BPRD. Choose from Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Johann Kraus before equipping your agent with additional items that will help in the mission ahead. Each trinket, charm or weapon costs money though, so you\u2019ll need to spend wisely.    \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nEach of the missions in the core game begins by reading a BPRD Case File. This will set the scene for the investigation ahead and give hints about what threats you may encounter. The contents of each Case File are top secret, so the first time you play you'll have no idea what you're about to face!   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nDuring play, agents must carefully balance the Information Gathered track against the ominous Impending Doom track. Information Gathered represents the clues you uncover about the monster you\u2019re hunting, while the Impending Doom track marks how close humanity is to the brink of destruction.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nDo you spend valuable time investigating the scene to find a vital piece of the puzzle that could expose a crucial weakness of your foe, but risk the Impending Doom track reaching its devastating finale? Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. See below regarding import duties and taxes.   \nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\nUK: \u00a39\nUSA: \u00a312\nEurope: \u00a312\nCanada: \u00a314\nAustralia/New Zealand: \u00a325\nRest of World: \u00a325\nAll add-ons outside the core pledges will have their shipping calculated and charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has finished.\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.    \nInformation about the Hellboy retailer pledge can be found here.\nHellboy\u2122 \u00a9 Mike Mignola. All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components. \n\nWith this project, the rules are currently in testing and will require more playtesting, however we have a dedicated team of playtesters to help with this. Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Duelosaur Island X-Treme Edition", "descp": "Pledge for the brand new stand-alone 2 player game Duelosaur Island!\n*Shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Duelosaur Island -

This first foray brought together Reiner Knizia and \"the Grand Shaman of Games\" himself Greg Stafford, for the family game Khan of Khans set in the mythic world of Glorantha. Now we're back with a Kickstarter for our first Lovecraftian board game since 1987! I'm excited to be working with Reiner again, exploring the world of horror in a fast-paced, fun-filled, push-your-luck game.\n\nSet in the treacherous and terrifying Restricted Collection of Miskatonic University's Orne Library, the game features grimoires, elder signs, academic politics and madness \u2014 and that endlessly renewable resource, graduate students! We hope you'll join us on our journey by supporting this Kickstarter and make the Miskatonic University game a reality!\nThe Details\nThe game comes in an awesome box (8\" x 6\" or 20cm x 15cm), disguised as a book. Very appropriate for a game about libraries!\n What's in the box?\n5 Player Desk Boards \n80 Library Cards\n5 sets of Defense Cards \nScoring Cards \nRule Book  \nThe Story \nThe game is a quest.  An extremely dangerous quest. Dr Henry Armitage, Chief Librarian, needs you to search the perilous Restricted Collection for fragments of lore from among the grimoires, and recover pieces of a particular sigil.\n\nIt all began when, as leading scholars at Miskatonic University, you were gathered together to discuss who would be awarded the coveted position of Head of the Library Committee. Suddenly tragedy and horror struck\u2014a monster had been unleashed, presumably by some foolish graduate student! Dr. Armitage leapt into action and asked for your help. He needs you to gather the necessary tools to banish the foul abomination.\n\nYou explore the Restricted Collection for the grimoire fragments and sigils he needs. However it is a perilous journey and you must be prepared to flee before you are driven mad! The victor is the professor who finds the most sets, while retaining a semblance of sanity. Also, look out for hapless wandering graduate students as they can aid in your defenses!\nHow to Play\nThere are five rounds in the game. Each round continues until no-one is left in the library, having left \"voluntarily\" or having been expelled. \nBasic play consists of taking turns to select a Library Card and placing these cards face up on your player mats.\nThere are three types of Library Cards. Sigil Pieces, Grimoire Fragments and Graduate Students, that fit neatly into the player mat:\nThere are two ways to exit the library. Choosing to leave or being expelled:\n Defense cards are a key part of the game:\n You win by having the highest score:\nGame End \nThe game ends when the final fifth round is played. \nYou then add up all the score cards they have received and the one with the highest score wins! \nThe winning scholar will become the head of the Library committee! And armed with the sigil pieces and grimoire fragments you collected, Dr. Armitage heads out into the night to take on the monster. He beckons you to follow him . . .\nVideos\nOur Board Games Line Editor, Susan, shows how the game is set up to play\n.\nPLAY\n\nSusan discusses how the game unfolds...\nPLAY\n\nHere is actual play of the game, recorded in the chapel at Schloss Neuhausen, Germany in October 2017. Please note, the game components used here are a prototype, but the game play and rules are exactly the same as in the final version that will go to publication. Playing, from left to right, are Neil, Susan and MOB from the Chaosium team. \nMany thanks to The Kraken, the \"baroque gathering of international gamers, gamemasters and game creators\", where this video was filmed.\nThe Design and Development Team\nGame Design: Reiner Knizia\nDevelopment: Susan O'Brien\nAdditional Development: Mike Mason\nGraphic Design: Ian O'Toole\nArt: Victor Leza, Goomi\nMiskatonic University: The Restricted Collection is \u00a9 Dr. Reiner Knizia and Chaosium Inc 2018.

Miskatonic University is the registered trademark of Chaosium, Inc.\nStretch Goals\nIt wouldn't feel like a Kickstarter if we didn't have at least a few stretch goals and surprises in store as we go forward. We will announce these as the campaign proceeds...\nRewards\nYou'll see in the pledge levels, aside from the game itself we have some extra rewards.  Here's some more details about these:\nPledge Levels\nWe have 10 different pledge levels, starting at student and progressing up to Dean of as yet unnamed new departments. Along with the basic level of professor, where you get the game, we have opportunities for you to join a fraternity or sorority where you can nominate the name of those graduate students wandering the Restricted Collection!\nOr you can choose to be a valedictorian, with a special plaque to prove it! There are vacancies for the Vice Chancellor, the Chancellor, or even a prestigious position as a member of the Board of Trustees. \nSHIPPING\nWhat about shipping? We hate the high cost of shipping, and have worked hard to set up the fulfillment of the rewards so they get shipped as quickly and inexpensively as possible. We do not expect to make any money from our shipping charges. However, we also cannot afford to lose money on shipping. The way it will work is after the campaign we will send out a survey to gather your addresses. We will use this data to get the most detailed shipping pricing we can based on our actual cost to ship your reward level to your home and then charge you that amount. We will ship from fulfillment centers in the US, Canada, the EU, and Australia. More locations may be added based on where backers are located. The approximate weight of the game will be under one kilogram (under two pounds), including the shipping box and packing material. We are also likely to use BackerKit to help us with fulfillment and final order processing.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChaosium has learned a great deal from its past Kickstarter projects. Our last board game Kickstarter, Khan of Khans, was delivered to backers on time as promised. Again, every item for this project has been created. There is no writing, editing, layout, or art to be done for the core game; ALL of those things are done. \n\nMiskatonic University: The Restricted Collection is ready to go to the printers, and we are only waiting to see if we can eek out some more fun from a few simple stretch goals. Needless to say, there is always the potential for production and delivery issues to crop up, but we have faced such hurdles before and will triumph.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Student", "descp": "Show your support for the University by enrolling as a student.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["99 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Professor", "descp": "Receive the full printed boxed game with all expansions and stretch goals.\nNote: Shipping will be calculated when game is ready for shipment.\nINCLUDES:\nPrinted boxed game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,249 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Librarian", "descp": "Receive two copies of the full printed boxed game with all expansions and stretch goals.\nNote: Shipping will be calculated when game is ready for shipment.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Printed boxed game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["285 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 125 or more", "title": "Book Repository", "descp": "Receive ten copies of the full game with all expansions and stretch goals.

So I started to draw symbols, and it ballooned into a massive project of now over 750 symbols in categories ranging from Alchemy and Astrology to Norse, Slavic, Celtic, Egyptian, and Mesopotamian Mythology, to Cults and Hobo Code. \n\nThe current version, without the webfont format, is available for purchase on my website.\n\nStage 1: Hermetica\nI've already finished the entire set in the dark weight, and all that's left is to finish making it into a webfont.\nStage 2: Hermetica Light\nNext I will produce the 'light' weight, a hairline version of all 750+ symbols in the 'dark' weight.\nStage 3: PostersI will design a poster as a reward (see below), as well as 25 custom posters as a more expensive reward.\n and... T-shirts!  XS,S,M,L,XL. Screen printed on American Apparel tees.  Available in white or black.\nand the Hermetica screen-printed canvas tote bag!\nStage 4: (Stretch Goal: $10,000)\nIf I raise more than $10,000 I will research and produce an oversize coffee table book that you can buy.\nNot the real layout - mock-up only!\nWhy are you making this?\nBefore I made Hermetica, I couldn't find a single complete, cohesive set of symbols to use for my projects. Other symbol resources were an ugly hodge podge of different styles and qualities, scattered across many different sources. What's more, sources often disagreed on the name and design, and no one offered these symbols as vector artwork.\n\"There ought to be a 'Helvetica' of Symbols\", I thought - standardized, simple, beautiful - and vectorized. And so over the course of a few years I devoted myself to researching and designing these 750 beautiful symbols to share with you - graphic designers, artists, tattoo artists, fashion designers, ceremonial magicians, activists, and aesthetes and symbol-lovers of all kinds.\nB007 Celestial Objects \u203a Saturn\nWhat about symbols of Hate?\nThis was an ethical question I asked myself while creating Hermetica. I decided to keep a select few symbols that have come to be associated with hate groups, because the symbols can also be useful to people who are using them to fight hate groups. For example, an anti-fascist group has just as much need for a Nazi swastika as does a neo-fascist. And in some cases, symbols with a long cultural tradition and different meaning in another culture were later appropriated by hate groups.\nD007 Alchemy \u203a Sulfur (Alternate)\nWhy didn't you include __________?\nI tried to be as comprehensive as possible, but after working on this for years, I needed to draw a line (no pun intended) and just finish it. In the future I would like to add more American Indian/Mesoamerican, African, and Indigenous Australian symbols.\nI also found that a lot of these symbols don't lend themselves to the \"Helveticization\" that I employed in creating the other, mostly 'western' symbols.\nI003 Celtic \u203a Triquetra\nThank you for your support!\nK001 Egyptian \u203a Khephra", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've already completed the first stage, and I'm on my way with the second.

(This is your chance to participate in this celebration!) \nMissed the campaign? You can enter our Late Pledge Manager by clicking the above image. The Late Pledge Manager opens May 8th, and supplies are limited.\nNow the whole Street Fighter Universe is literally at your fingertips! What are you waiting for?!  \nHelp Ryu on his journey to surpass all Stretch Goals! Each one we unlock is added to your pledge for Free! We've planned for 12 additional fighters & battle decks to be unlocked during the campaign! With all those unlocked you get TRIPLE the size of a Base Pledge at the Street Fighter Level!\nWe wanted to make our miniatures so good that even if you didn't play the game at all, your pledge would still be fully worth it for these impressive works of art alone - and at their Collectors Scale, they are wonderful pieces to display around your home or office!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game uses a unique scale, the brand new \"Collector's Scale\"! This giant-sized scale has your models large and in charge from 65mm tall all the way up to 85mm tall on some characters all on a standardized 58mm base! We will be offering this scale for all our future Universal Tactics System Games.   \nThis size offers tons of advantages:\nThe miniatures are more like small collectable statues and makes them great for displaying around the house even if you don't play the game at all!  \nThe larger the mini the better the pre-paint process, our pre-painted miniatures are simply the best the industry can currently offer, rivalling that of action figures and full sized collector statues!  \nPlaying with larger miniatures on a board with 3D terrain gives amazing table presence when you pull this game out at any gathering! You'll be the talk of the town!  \nWe believe its quality over quantity, why have buckets of tiny miniatures if they don't get played packed away in expansion box after expansion box? These miniatures will get a lot of table time as your sole representation on the battlefield!  \nTake a look at our featured miniatures video below!\nLet us get a detailed look at each one of our fighters included in the Core Set!\nAdding a NEW DIMENSION to Street Fighter!  \nDestructible Stage Terrain adds a new exciting element to the Street Fighter experience and it adds a new layer of strategic depth to the game as you attempt to out outmaneuver your opponent and set them up for extra damage!  \nEach round the terrain is reset and the fighter positions swapped as to offer an equal opportunity to both players, plus its just more fun to crash into more stuff. Smart awareness, positioning and baiting your opponent can easily win you the day!  \nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME. IT'S SIMPLE!  \nWe wanted anyone to be able to jump right in and play! So we had to make learning the game simple, but yet still have the depth to please experienced gamers and fighting game fans. This was an extremely challenging task for sure, especially when you consider the game system is built not only for Versus Mode but also Free for All and Team Games, essentially three games in one! However after 2 years of development we've believe we have found the right balance between accessibility, strategy, luck and fun factor!  \nIt's as Simple as.... DRAW. MOVE. FIGHT!\n1. DRAW! - Draw 2 cards from your Battle Deck as you start your turn. Skipping this only for the first turn you take.\n2. MOVE! - Move your character up to their Movement Value in any direction.\n3. FIGHT! - Take 2 Actions in any order and in any amount from these Actions:  MOVE, DRAW, or PLAY A CARD.\nOn defense your choice is even easier but yet still an important tension filled decision. Do you BLOCK or COUNTER-ATTACK?\nBLOCK - Roll two default Battle Dice and apply results vs opponent's attack roll.  You may also discard certain cards with defensive dice values to \"BOOST\" your Block Roll.\n-OR-\nCOUNTER-ATTACK - Play a Counter for a Strike, Special or Projectile, if successful discard opponents card and perform Counter-Attack Ability, usually causing damage during your opponents turn!\nAnd that's how the game works! \nAs you roll your Battle Dice & play your cards you will gain meter results which contribute to your Meter Gauge allowing you to enhance certain attacks or save these for the powerful Super and Ultra Combos that can finish your opponents instantly! Best 2 rounds out of 3 WINS!\n CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK!\nClick the Image above to Download the BETA Rulebook!\nThe Boss Expansion adds in two extremely powerful Street Fighter Bosses. The power level of these bosses is so immense that other players will need to team-up to defeat them in a near hopeless final battle! Here's what's in the set in more detail!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game Boss Expansion includes everything you need to introduce extremely powerful Boss characters. This expansion also includes the Boss Mode game rules in which one player controls the boss in a battle against a team of three rival players! Can you and your friends stop this evil-doer's dastardly plan?  \nBOSS EVENT DECKS  \nEvery Boss comes with a unique Event Deck that can change the battlefield conditions dramatically, forcing the players to cooperate and strategize to deal with the new threat! Each new boss game is a different experience as only 6 to 8 of these events are drawn each game on average!\nBOSS FIGHTER BATTLE DECKS\nIn addition to the Boss Mode, the Boss Expansion includes normal 40-Card Boss-Fighter Decks so that the boss can join in with the rabble and fight on a more even level with their opponents in Versus, Free For All, and Team Modes!\nIf you would like to purchase any of these optional add-on's, please click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on this games Kickstarter Page and in the pledge manager add the total amount of the items you'd like to get to your total pledge.

Please enjoy this Documentary detailing the history of the game from the 25th Anniversary!  \nWe view this as a premium product for fans of Street Fighter, tabletop games and collectable products. The costs of manufacturing a game like this are extremely high due to a number of factors including:  \nIndividual \"Collector Sized\" pre-painted special FX's miniatures that are comparable in size to (\"Nintendo Amiibos\") that can retail for around $14.99 each! And we are packing 8 of them into a single box! 24 in the World Warrior Pledge!\nWe have planned at least 12 Stretch Goal Fighter Miniatures and their Battle Decks as unlocks, each one of these are at no cost to our backers! This cuts heavily into our margins and makes offering this many free mini's impossible at Retail! So get them while you can!\nThis game has among the highest number of full sized top quality playing cards in a single tabletop game ever! 428 cards in the Street Fighter Pledge and each new character unlocked in Stretch Goals adds another 40 cards, an extremely expensive and costly inclusion! With all Stretch Goals unlocked and the World Warrior pledge that's over 1,548 cards! A ridiculous amount and again impossible at Retail!\nCountless pieces of professional & unique artwork for each type of attack and event cards in a Character Deck!\nThe only way a game like this is made possible is to sell directly to our passionate backers who are looking for a premium and high-quality product. As lifelong fans of the franchise, we simply wanted to make the best possible game regardless of the cost! So jump in on this exclusive opportunity, you never know how valuable these limited pieces can become in the future!\nIf demand is extremely high we may consider in the far future making a retail version of the game with a lower amount of miniatures, perhaps unpainted and at a smaller scale.\nIf you miss the kickstarter the game may only be available at conventions and direct from Jasco Games in limited quantities.\nDo you want to help spread the word about this exclusive limited edition celebration of Street Fighter?

All other games and accessories included within the pledges will be shipped separately in September. All other countries will receive everything in one delivery in September. See more details in the FAQ section.\nDesigned in Italy, MUtable is the design-oriented alternative to your child\u2019s everyday play table, but paired with the flexibility and durability of a table that will last your family for years.\nPLAY\n\nMUtable 2.0 offers so many playing options that your kids will never stop having fun!   \nMUtable 2.0 includes 4 double-sided playboards that stack on top of each other.     \nEvery MUtable includes all 4 height options, enabled by easily switching the table's legs. This way MUtable grows with your kid, all the way up to 8 years old!\n * MUtable is certified as toy for use from 3 years old\nMUtable and its chairs come in five different colors, Mauve, Mint, White, Dove Gray and Tiffany, that you can mix and match according to your interior design style. \nWhen playtime's over, kids can easily push all the toys into the hole in the center to drop everything into the toy storage bag underneath. \nWhen they want to change games, they just need to flip the board and change bag. You can even organize different toys into different Toy Bags!\nOn each side of the table there is the option to attach up to 3 Side Toy Holders, a convenient cup-like container to store pencils and small toys. \nThe Lego \u00ae Tower is an extension of the Lego \u00ae base, enabling kids to play on up to 3 different levels of Lego \u00ae! Every level is double sided and compatible with both the Lego \u00ae Duplo \u00ae and classic Lego \u00ae. \nMix up the interchangeable scenarios to boost your kids' creativity!  More scenarios to choose from will be available after the campaign.\nPretend play has never been so much fun: with just one playhouse you will get 4 different environments to play and up to 24 rooms! No screws are needed to build the house and so it can be easily stored flat when is not used! You can choose between 2 different play houses:\nDolls House: includes a family house, a playground, a kindergarten and a museum!\nHeroes House: includes a police station, a fireman station, a superhero cave and a mountain lodge\nBoard games are a fantastic way to exercise logic and tactical skills... but they can also be a way to learn new things! We developed 3 board games on 3 themes that are important for kids.\nDISKcover Geography: On the double-sided map board, your child will travel around the globe and learn some of the main cultures and animals in the World! \nDISKcover History: Jump on your time machine and take a journey through time discovering some of the most relevant characters of human history! \nDISKcover Fruit & Vegetables: Two different games on one single board! On one side, an orchard where your child will take an adventurous trial picking fruit from trees and protecting it from spiteful insects, and twists. On the other side, a vegetable garden where to discover and grow many different vegetables! \nPuzzles are the best way to stimulate your kids creativity and critical thinking! We developed 6 round puzzles that perfectly fit the MUtable puzzle base. \nMore space for more fun! The extension is a steady additional panel that will increase the surface of your MUtable. Up to 6 kids can play or have a seat at the same time...for twice the fun! Use the extension to let your kids play with their friends, have a meal or just have fun with bigger toys. And it is super easy to assemble; just place it on top of the table and fix it with the solid locks below. \nIncluded with the extension you will receive an additional disk to store pens and small toys and leave the surface even. \nWith the cover, you can protect the MUtable and let your kids play without worries. This silicone top perfectly fits MUtable and shields it from any kind of damage from colors, water, food... \nAdditionally, when you don't use it, the cover can be a convenient holder for all your MUtable disks!\nNot only do MUtable chairs match perfectly with the table color of your choice, but they will also adjust to the four different heights with the table, ranging from a seat height of 23.5cm to 36cm. \nA backrest is included with each chair, but it can be removed to transform the MUtable chair into a stool comfortable for grown up players as well. \nYou can add as many chairs as you wish with your MUtable... they are optional as we know that kids love to play in different ways! \nAlso featured in: \nMUtable is 71.6cm large and each playboard has a diameter of 54cm. The extension is 98cm (38.5in) large.\nHere you also find a table with all possible heights you can adjust your MUtable and chairs too! \nWe are so thankful for checking out our project and helping us spreading the word!\nSave", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks are very low, as most of the risk has been dealt with in our previous campaign.\n\nWe have a full production line in place with the best producer of wooden toys in the world, Hape Toys. \n\nWe've delivered our MUtables to customers worldwide for months, and together with HAPE have set up a solid and trusted distribution system.\n\nMUtable and most of its accessories have already been produced in high quantities and they are now fully certified for children use around the world.\n\nRegarding the new games and accessories they have all already prototyped and ready for production.\n\nWe will deliver the same level of quality as we have already done in a timely manner!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "CUSTOMIZED BUNDLE", "descp": "FOR PREVIOUS BACKERS ONLY -\nIf you already own a MUtable, you can buy here your personalized bundle of games and accessories!\nFollow the instructions shared by email and make your pledge!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["358 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac169 or more", "title": "JUST MUTABLE", "descp": "Designed with love in Italy, you\u2019ll get one MUtable with all 4 Heights and 4 different, double-sided Play Boards.\nChoose MUtable color after the campaign.\n* Add \u20ac29 or multiples to add one or more extra Toy Storage Bags and/or Side Toy Holders *\n** Add \u20ac39 or multiples to add one or more Chairs **\n*** Add \u20ac59 to add a Table Extension ***\nRetail - \u20ac199\nIncludes tax in the US and EU\nINCLUDES:\n1 MUtable with 4 Heights (choose color after the campaign)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["128 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac249 or more", "title": "BASIC KIT", "descp": "Designed with love in Italy, you\u2019ll get one MUtable with all 4 Heights, 10 different Games and 2 Storage Accessories.\nChoose MUtable color after the campaign.\n* Add \u20ac29 or multiples to add one or more extra Toy Storage Bags and/or Side Toy Holders *\n** Add \u20ac39 or multiples to add one or more Chairs **\n*** Add \u20ac59 to add a Table Extension ***\nRetail - \u20ac329\nIncludes tax in the US and EU\nINCLUDES:\n1 MUtable with 4 Heights (choose color after the campaign)\n10\u00d7 Games\n1 Toy Storage Bag\n1 Side Toy Holder", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["263 backers", "Limited (7 left of 270)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac299 or more", "title": "STARTER KIT", "descp": "Add the Lego Tower to the Basic Kit! 3 levels of creativity and a fun scenario to play.\nChoose MUtable color and Lego tower scenario after the campaign.\n* Add \u20ac29 or multiples to add one or more extra Toy Storage Bags and/or Side Toy Holders *\n** Add \u20ac39 or multiples to add one or more Chairs **\n*** Add \u20ac59 to add a Table Extension ***\nRetail - \u20ac399\nIncludes tax in the US and EU\nINCLUDES:\n1 MUtable with 4 Heights (choose color after the campaign)\n10\u00d7 Games\n1 Toy Storage Bag\n1 Side Toy Holder\n1 Lego Tower with 1 Scenario (choose after the campaign)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["192 backers", "Limited (8 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac349 or more", "title": "STANDARD KIT", "descp": "Protect your Mutable!

It's a privilege to be entrusted by so many people to bring this project to life. We will work hard to make sure it is as smooth as can be. Together David and Heath have completed a combined seven Kickstarter campaigns. Each Kickstarter project brings many valuable lessons learned. Because we have so much experience, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver a quality product to you.\n\nWe have allotted time to finalize the project at the conclusion of the campaign, and then we will roll right into production. We have been working with our manufacturing partner in China for months on these Elder Dice designs to be sure the manufacturing process goes as smoothly as possible. We have strong relationships with our international fulfillment partners. These are incredibly important and give us confidence in our ability to deliver your rewards in a safe and economical manner.\n\nHowever, with our experience, we know that unexpected issues can arise during the production process. Final preparation after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. We will not sacrifice quality, even if it pushes the schedule back!\n\nAdditionally, we will be freighting the Elder Dice around the world to our fulfillment partners who will then send the rewards to you. Shipping delays at sea, weather conditions, extended customs inspections, and more could potentially delay the project at this stage.\n\nAlso, please remember that the images shown on the Kickstarter page and in the video are prototypes. The final dice may differ in detail and color.

Secrets of the Lost Tomb, our first title, now has 14 SKUs including expansions and miniatures.\n\nThat means we have produced an astounding amount of different boxes of game product for our past campaigns.\n\nWe endeavor to please our backers in any way we can!

READ ABOUT THE BOOK FURTHER DOWN\n Welcome to Metropo with its gleaming spires and forgotten depths. A city so vast and dense it almost feels alive. Artificial or otherwise, its denizens struggle with familiar heartache and tackle questions we are only beginning to ask.\nThis \u2018slice of cyberpunk life\u2019 collection takes us into the hearts and minds of these denizens, presenting eight stories from the lives of those in the unending city.\nMETROPO eight stories from the unending city includes these stories:\nRaindrop Hatch (comic)\nThe Fierce Code (prose)\nTemporal (prose)\nAutomobile (comic)\nWalkways (comic)\nDrowning (prose)\nEvery Moment is a Moment Forward (comic)\nSunrise (prose)\n                               Raindrop Hatch // Vivian Truong\nAutomobile // Rob Croonenborghs\nEvery Moment is a Moment Forward // Naomi Franquiz\nWalkways // Mary Safro\nspot illustrations // Emerson Dimaya\ncover art // John Jamtli\na taste of the layout//design\n\nPLEDGE//LEVELS\nShipping included on all pledge levels.\nIf you'd like to order up more books (w or without slipcases), send us a message and we'll help you out.\nFOR APPAREL//MERCH, PLEASE VISIT DESIGN FROM THE UNENDING CITY:\nmetropo.threadless.com\nWHY//KICKSTARTER\nBecause of you! We have the opportunity to link up directly to your brain, whether you are android or human (or somewhere in between). Not only do we want to give you a memorable cyberpunk sci-fi experience, but, if you so choose, a top-of-the-line physical book to hold and cherish. We are children of rampant digitalisation, but we are firm believers in the exquisiteness of a good ol\u2019 printed book.\nThe stories, the art and the design, are all completed and the book is ready to go to print. Eight lyrical and haunting 'slice of life' cyberpunk stories, coated in a design even a malevolent AI could love.\nWe have all worked hard to build and wire the stories contained within METROPO, and by coming to Kickstarter we hope to raise funds for the printing and distribution of a book that you will be proud to have sitting on your shelves. In addition to the regular book we have a premium citizenship slipcase edition at a higher pledge level.\nWhen the campaign is successful we have our warehouse-bots and digiworms raring to go to deliver METROPO eight stories from the unending city right to your doorstep or your inbox. This, of course, falls to you dear citizen. Plug in and pledge to one of our rewards and tell your friends, your synthetic companion, or your android neighbour all about it!\nTo crunch some numbers for all you sentient account algorithms out there, the breakdown of the campaign budget looks like this:\nWe would like to express our gratitude to the Norwegian Arts Council and their branch Fond For Lyd og Bilde for the grant that made the art production of this book possible. If not for them, this pie chart, and financing this book, would be impossible.\nPRINTING//SHIPPING\nWe're partnering with a tried and trusted megacorporation from Sector 5 in Metropo\u2014KrakenPrint. Our HQ have used them for both printing and fulfilment for the Spiral Kickstarter campaign, as well as printing the Earthlock one-shot comic. With more than satisfactory results.\nSOCIAL//MEDIA\nAll Metropo visitors and citizens, artificial or otherwise, are encouraged to join the construction of the unending city on our newsletter & social media sites.\nCREATORS//\nMagnus Aspli // A robot from Norway who has written comics and screenplays for nearly a decade. Magnus is currently working on building Metropo on several fronts, while also being involved in a few film and TV projects, plus a game. He\u2019s been shipped and updated at universities in both Brisbane and London, but now lives in Trondheim with his family, raising kids and raising hell.\nVivian Truong // Vivian says she\u2019s a short Chinese artist from London, but as you can tell, she might be a digital self-representation of a cartoon character. Rumour claims she\u2019s a rogue AI, but the fun and benevolent kind. Vivian has a Patreon you could hack into to discover more of her work.\nMary (Cryoclaire) Safro // Mary is a Russian cyber-junkie comic artist, saving the Queen in the UK. She\u2019s the co-creator of Drugs & Wires. A retro-90s Eastern cyberpunk webcomic about everything going wrong. It updates on Mondays and you should head back to the 90s to check it out.\n John Jamtli // John is our cover artist. He\u2019s a wide-ranging illustrator mainly working in comics. His most recent work is Sabot\u00f8r [saboteur]\u2014a historical romp behind the scenes of a controversial part of the resistance movement in Norway during the Nazi Occupation of WWII\u2014which\u2019ll be out in spring 2018. Unfortunately, for most of you, it\u2019s in Norwegian. Fortunately, for all of you, it looks absolutely stunning. Follow John on Instagram for more.\nEmerson Dimaya // Emerson is our spot architect, putting the spice in our Metropo book soup. He has traveled the megalopolis and made some sketches from his dronetaxi and on foot. Emerson\u2019s an illustrator and comic book artist from the Philippines. He\u2019s the artist on Spiral and the Earthlock comic book.\nRob Croonenborghs // Rob is from Belgium and one of the builders of Metropo. His rough and organic style a lovely and ironic juxtaposition to the perfect system in his story Automobile. (We suspect Rob is actually a generative design AI prototype.) You can find more of Rob\u2019s comics on Comixology and more of his art on DeviantArt.\nNaomi Franquiz // Naomi, according to her neural net, is a freelance illustrator, comic artist, and reprobate. (We\u2019re still not sure if she\u2019s an android or not.) She built Every Moment is a Moment Forward\u2014the final short comic in Metropo\u2014with her brilliant flavour and style. Make sure to check out her comic Misfit City, published by Boom! And do point your cybernetic eyes on her tumblr!\nDan Hill // Dan is the hidden architect behind the facade of Metropo. A writer and editor, Dan is making sure all is well with the book and that every story, every sentence, every word, is its best hologram of the intended idea.\nDan has edited titles such as Deer Editor, Headspace, Mitch Hammer and Black Canvas from Black Mask Studios. His one-shot comic Go Home, together with Andrew Herbst, about how war haunts us, is available on Comixology. You can find Dan on Twitter and you can jump on his newsletter A Pleasurable Headache here.\nSPECIAL//THANKS\nA special thanks to the Norwegian Arts Council for initial funding. To my collaborators in this book. To Jacob & KrakenPrint. To Aaron Marshall for the music. To Sander and Pekka for being part of building another quadrant of Metropo. To Breach VR for curiosity and possibly a unique future. To WorkWork for a creative environment and inspiration. To my family for patience, love and gravity. To all those of you who have assisted in wiring and adjusting this book into one piece, with feedback and sharp minds. You know who you are.\nHOW DOES KICKSTARTER WORK?\nFor those of you who have recently uploaded your consciousness to the Internet and are new to Kickstarter, a few pointers:\nMoney from your card/account will be withdrawn only after the campaign ends and only if it's successful.

This piece of traditional western knife making is perfectly balanced and is a perfect cooking knife.\nNagasaki Chef's Knife blade angle\nThe knife is ideal for cutting meat, fish, vegetables, fruits and what ever you can think of. Our new knife series feels really good in the hand and we have placed a great deal of research to their form & structure which makes this series a winner.\n   Technical details: \nBlade characteristic: Chef's knife\nThe blade is 8 inch / 20 cm long\nAt its base the blade is 0.8 inch / ~2 mm\nVG10 stainless steel core with 67 layers of damascus\nWith a rockwell Hardness of 59-60 HRC\nCryogenic nitrogen treated blade for extreme sharpness\nNew smaller logo etching\nLaser tested blade angle with Razor sharp properties\nSharpened using Solinger D\u00fcnnschliff\nThe knife weighs ~0.45 lbs / 205 g\nMicarta handle in black, brown or black with three ring inlays (1st stretch goal)\n      Nakiri knives are Japanese vegetable knives. They are ideal for cutting vegetables and fruits. \n   Technical details: \nBlade characteristic: Nakiri\nThe blade is 7 inch / 18 cm long\nAt its base the blade is 0.8 inch / ~2 mm\nVG10 stainless steel core with 67 layers of damascus\nWith a rockwell Hardness of 59-60 HRC\nCryogenic nitrogen treated blade for extreme sharpness\nSharpened using Solinger D\u00fcnnschliff\nThe knife weighs ~0.50 lbs / 225 g\nMicarta handle in black or brown\n     This knife features the same design as our Nakiri knife, but adds another unique feature: a hollow edge. The unique characteristic of a hollow edge are several small cavities that get hammered into the blade in close proximity to each other. Like with the hammered surface on our Santoku knife the purpose of these cavities is to prevent the adherence of particularly thin, greasy or otherwise sticky clippings. \nThis property is due to the reduction of the blade surface which comes into contact with the cut material. In the case of pure cheese knives, there are even holes in the blade instead of the cavities, which achieve the same effect. However, since soft or very thin material can be entangled in the holes, holes are not universally applicable. Cavities, on the other hand, are a good compromise between reducing the surface of the blade and stabilizing the cut material.  \n   Technical details: \nBlade characteristic: Nakiri\nThe blade is 7 inch / 18 cm long\nAt its base the blade is 0.8 inch / ~2 mm\nVG10 stainless steel core with 67 layers of damascus\nHardness of 59-60 HRC\nCryogenic nitrogen treated blade for extreme sharpness\nSharpened using Solinger D\u00fcnnschliff\nThe knife weighs ~0.49 lbs / 223 g\nMicarta handle in black or brown\n     Sample of paring knife, the label on the blade is not correct\nA last minute addition to our family is a paring knife, which is a small knife with a plain edge blade that is ideal for peeling and other small or intricate work (such as de-veining a shrimp, removing the seeds from a jalape\u00f1o, 'skinning' or cutting small garnishes). It is designed to be an all-purpose knife, similar to a chef's knife, except smaller. \nTechnical details: \nBlade characteristic: like Chef's knife\nThe blade is 3.5 inch / 9 cm long\nAt its base the blade is 0.8 inch / ~2 mm\nVG10 stainless steel core with 67 layers of damascus\nHardness of 59-60 HRC\nCryogenic nitrogen treated blade for extreme sharpness\nSharpened using Solinger D\u00fcnnschliff\nThe knife weighs ~0.13 lbs / 58 g\nMicarta handle in black or brown\n     Nagasaki Hammered Knife with Improved Features\nThis was our original Nagasaki Solingen hand-hammered Santoku knife! It still features its classic design, but we updated our branding, so it is not as dominant as it was on the original.\nThe new versions blade is thinner at its spine, features a reduced weight as well es improved hardness of 59-60 HRC.\nThe Santoku knife is the Japanese equivalent to the western chef's knife. It is used in a similar way, but provides less room for a rocking motion which is typically for western knives.\nThe hammered finish on our Santoku helps to release sticky clipping from the blade without having to peal them off or prevents clippings from sticking to the blade at all.\n  Technical details:\nBlade characteristic: Santoku\nThe blade is 7 inch / 18 cm long\nAt its base the blade is 0.8 inch / ~2 mm\nVG10 stainless steel core with 67 layers of damascus\nCryogenic nitrogen treated blade for extreme sharpness\nHardness of 59-60 HRC\nSharpened using Solinger D\u00fcnnschliff\nThe knife weighs ~0.49 lbs / 220 g\nMicarta handle in black or brown\n   As with our first campaign we want to enable everyone to experience high quality kitchen knives. By expanding the collection of Nagasaki knives we provide you with affordable kitchen tools that will aid you for a long time. \nOur whole team is excited to add up our new special designed gadgets to your kitchen and hope you will feel our efforts in your hands!\n     What do you get in return for your support? - Some really nice knives! \nSingle\nYou'll get one full size Nagasaki knife of your choice! \nTwin\nYou'll get one full size Nagasaki knife of your choice plus one Paring knife! \nTrio\nYou'll get two full size Nagasaki knives of your choice plus one Paring knife! \nNagoya\nYou'll get two full size Nagasaki Nakiri knives of your choice plus one Chef knife! \nFamily\n All five Nagasaki knives in a family pack!

Read more\nWhether you\u2019re new to the Pathfinder\u00ae universe or you\u2019re a seasoned veteran, Pathfinder: Kingmaker\u00ae is the CRPG you\u2019ve been waiting for. \nHere at Owlcat Games, we love and are inspired by classic isometric computer RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Arcanum. Our dream is to rekindle the thrill of playing those games for the first time. Building your hero, exploring the unknown, getting to know your companions, experiencing the adrenaline rush of your first battle (and your last), delving into mysterious dungeons, and\u2014most importantly\u2014seeing your protagonist and your world change through your actions.\nWe've always been big fans of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\u00ae from Paizo, Inc\u00ae, so we thought: How cool would it be to do this in the beloved Pathfinder setting? Paizo agreed, and with your support, we hope to bring a brand-new fantasy saga to life.\nWhat the press says\n\"If the alpha build was any indication, then there\u2019s plenty of opportunities to shape your own identity and leave your mark on the world.\" - Gamespot\n\"Almost everything I asked about in terms of story seemed to have a layer beyond what I expected--the advantage of having years of tabletop playtesting, perhaps. If these different aspects of Kingmaker can coalesce into a dramatic whole, this could be special.\" - IGN\n\"For fans of the tabletop game, this will be a great opportunity to translate their fantasy adventures to their desktops.\" - Game Informer\n\"First impressions from in and around the bandit lord's fortress; the game looks incredible. The in-progress menus are attractive and orderly, the environments lush and vivid, the character portraits appealing and refined. What voice acting there was, was convincing and professional.\" - mmorpg.com\nThe Game World \nPathfinder: Kingmaker is the first single-player computer RPG based on the acclaimed Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The game invites players to Golarion, a world rich with history, mystery, and conflict, and gives players the chance to claim part of this world as their own.\n\"Follow the white rabbit, Baron\"\nPathfinder has considerable depth, not only in its lore, but also in its game mechanics, and in the freedom it offers you to develop your own unique character. You can customize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities.\nUse night to your advantage \u2013 and see the world change.\nThe Story\nIn the north lies the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries. Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark\u2014by building your own kingdom! To do so, you\u2019ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations\u2026 as well as threats within your own court.\nThe only easy day was yesterday.\nPathfinder: Kingmaker is based on Paizo\u2019s award-winning Pathfinder Adventure Path of the same name. You certainly don\u2019t need to be familiar with the story, but if you are, you will encounter characters you know and love. Either way, you will experience a host of brand-new events, companions, allies, and threats that expand and enhance the original Adventure Path. With help from Paizo and their authors, the story and quests have been expanded by RPG writer Chris Avellone and the Owlcat team, allowing for even more adventure in the already rich narrative of the Stolen Lands.\nWhile Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a single-player game, you won\u2019t be adventuring alone. Pathfinder: Kingmaker features a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You\u2019ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you\u2019ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\nMore than 10 companions to watch your back\u2026 or stick a knife in it.\nYour Kingdom \nWe chose to adapt the Kingmaker adventure path because it features a host of open-world mechanics, allowing players to experience the story at their own pace as they explore the Stolen Lands, which will challenge you as both an adventurer and a ruler.\nYou never know what's around the next bend.\nMost importantly, the game allows you to claim these lands as your own, letting you carve your own kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and the ability to lead troops in the field are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins\u2014and while dealing with politics in your own court.\nThere are many ways to manage your Kingdom, and many rewards to be gained.\n As you\u2019ll discover, building a kingdom goes beyond simply building a stronghold: Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor\u2014and to test your strength.\nIf you fail, your kingdom will be destroyed, but if you succeed, you\u2019ll have made a nation where countless others have failed.  \nYour kingdom awaits! Do you have the strength to rule it?\n\nAre you a benevolent ruler or a ruthless tyrant?\n Expanding depth and richness of kingdom gameplay is so important to us that we\u2019ve made it our initial goal for the Kickstarter. Every pledge made toward our initial funding target will result in more features, more content, and more polish for your growing nation. Our goal is to let you build a kingdom that fits your play style. Perhaps you want to control every single activity in your kingdom by yourself, or perhaps you are more of a top-level ruler who wants to spend time exploring the wilderness and fighting dangerous beasts. Either way, we will give you the life you want to live. You are a king, after all!\nWe are excited about the kingdom mechanics and we have carefully planned all the features we would love to implement if you support us. All funds will be distributed according to the following pie chart:\nExpanding the kingdom is our first goal for the Kickstarter, but it\u2019s not going to be our only goal. With your support, we can improve every aspect of game. We\u2019re prepared to announce additional stretch goals to diversify the characters you\u2019ll be able to build, including the introduction of archetypes (at least a couple for each of the classes), additional classes (we have been asked about Magus several times\u2014and some Owlcats really want to play this class!), and additional races. We also want to develop the storyline further, expanding it beyond the Adventure Path, and we would like to include even more companions, each with their own alignment and agenda (including a companion that\u2019s dear to hearts of Pathfinder fans). We also want to bring you even more locations to visit, including an epic dungeon. We want to enhance our game with more voiceover and music. And we want more players to experience our game by adding additional language localizations, and support for OS X and Linux!\nWe don't just want to reward your support through stretch goals alone. You can now unlock backer achievements by joining us on social media and get access to exclusive rewards.\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PathfinderCRPG/ \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/OwlcatGames \nOfficial game site: https://owlcatgames.com/ \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo1yuqm85x6iyko4dKhZPiA  \nEach achievement you unlock with your fellow backers will move the reward progress bar. With enough achievements reached, the following prizes will be received by all backers of the appropriate tier:\n Achievement gained: 6. \nRewards unlocked: Wallpapers, Silly cheat codes\nLet's have a look at the above graphic for clarification. Take the reward 'New soundtrack in the city tavern' for an example. This one is unlocked when 8 community achievements are reached. Everyone who pledged for the $40 tier for the premium digital download or higher, will be eligible for this reward when it unlocks. As another example, if 12 community achievements are reached, the 'Small faerie dragon as a non-combat pet' will be unlocked for every backer, regardless of pledge level.  \nCooking in the camp  \nTo make things clearer, here is a short description for \"Cooking in the camp\":  \nYou can cook various dishes in the camp from the components you gathered or got from your hunter. Dining on those meals will provide your party with different small and pleasant bonuses.\nOwlcat Games was formed by developers who have the experience, resources, and - above all - the passion required to make Pathfinder: Kingmaker a truly amazing game.\n We are a new studio, but we are not new to the industry. Many of us worked on these games as part of Nival Interactive and My.com:\nWe can't deny ourselves the pleasure to name just a few games Chris Avellone worked on:\nOwlcat Games team.\nPathfinder: Kingmaker has an existing schedule, an existing scope, and an existing budget, and that budget will allow us to achieve that scope on schedule. We already have a full team of people working on it, and we're committed to doing it regardless of what happens with this Kickstarter. So why are we asking for your help? The answer is YOU\u2014we need YOU to decide how big Pathfinder: Kingmaker is going to be. Success in this Kickstarter will allow us to increase the budget and the scope, delivering a bigger and deeper game on the same schedule.  \nAll of us\u2014RPG fans and developers alike\u2014deserve a game that demonstrates the richness of the Pathfinder universe. There are so many interesting things in the world and in the rules that we can\u2019t fit into the current budget, yet our desire to add them to the game is practically unbearable. We dream of more companions with added depths to their stories, new classes, new dungeons, more wilderness to explore, more kingdom events, and even brand-new quests and custom content by famous Pathfinder and CRPG authors. With this Kickstarter, our only limit is your support and your faith in us. Help us make Pathfinder: Kingmaker the product we all want it to be. Help us kick the epicness to the stratosphere!\n\nLooking to customize your reward tier a bit?

Lovecraft. \nIt's about the things we fear, amplified until they are unbearable. It's about stories that genuinely creep you out, not well-worn tropes and creatures you've seen hundreds of times before.\nAnd it's about bleak horror, in which humans are powerless when confronted by hyperintelligent alien horrors. You can't beat them. You can't fight them. You can only watch, run, hide and fear.\nIf you love Cthulhu games already, then this is Lovecraftian horror at its most intense. If you're new to them, then Cthulhu Dark is a great place to start. You'll enter a world of stories that are both terrifying and terribly human.\nThe rules are incredibly short: they're tightly focussed on horror and they drive the game.\nHave a look at these samples of the book: the rules, the start of the Keeper's section and one of the settings, London 1851. And here's the cover. \n  \"I love Cthulhu Dark - it combines economy, thoughtful design, and a rare respect for the source material that really gets at the core of what's fun about the combination of impersonal, unknowable horror and a ragged, unstoppable descent into madness. It's the best Lovecraftian game I've ever played, and I have played them all.\"\nJason Morningstar, designer, Fiasco\n\"Cthulhu Dark is Lovecraftian gaming in its purest form. By cutting away everything except investigation, revelation and consequence, it provides a simple, cruel mechanism for driving protagonists to madness and destruction.\"\nScott Dorward, writer, Call of Cthulhu 7th edition\n\"Cthulhu Dark gets to the heart of what I love most about Lovecraft's work. It is a clean, simple system which has a laser focus on investigation and the increasing stress on your mind and soul from the horrors you see. Graham has a deep and rare understanding not only of the Mythos but also of the pacing and structure of the stories themselves. Nothing will feel closer to Lovecraft's awful truth than a game of Cthulhu Dark.\"\nBecky Annison, writer, Lovecraftesque\n\"Cthulhu Dark packs more than its fair share of evocative wallop  into less than its fair share of pages. It's designed to work hard, but unobtrusively, with an easy faith in both its players and its genre.\" \nVincent Baker, designer, Apocalypse World\n  Cthulhu Dark is a hardback book, 8.5 by 11 inches, about 200 pages long. The cover, by George Cotronis, is in full color. The interior is beautifully laid out, with stunning black-and-white art by Matteo Bocci.\nIt starts with the Player's Section, which consists of:\nThe Rules: Cthulhu Dark's tight, focussed two-page ruleset, which you can see here.\nThe Rules In Detail: How to use the rules to best effect in your games, together with a range of tips and tricks.\nThen comes the Keeper's Section, consisting of:\nIntroduction: An introduction to cosmic horror and all the essential elements of a Cthulhu Dark mystery, including the Themes, the Threat, the Final Horror, the Setting, Creeping Horrors and the Power.  You can see the start of the Keeper's section here. \nWriting a mystery: A step-by-step guide to writing Cthulhu Dark mysteries. This takes you through every step of making an effective horror story to play through, starting with the things you fear and ending with the full horror.\nRewriting a mystery: Ten different ways to look at a mystery, which help you sharpen and polish it, until it's as good as it can get.\nPlaying a mystery: How to play a Cthulhu Dark game, including how to explain and use the rules, how to describe horror and how to find a dramatic ending.\nThreats of the Mythos: A guide to the creatures, artifacts and other unspeakable things that haunt the universe, explaining how to use these things to enhance the story you want to tell.\nThen you get four settings, taking Cthulhu Dark into different times and places. Each comes with a full scenario to play.\nLondon 1851: Terror in dirty, twisted Victorian London, where evil hides in the dark and the stink. Here's a short extract. Plus the scenario Screams of the Children.\nArkham 1692 (by Kathryn Jenkins): Fear and superstition in Lovecraft's iconic city, in a time of witchcraft. Plus the scenario The Doors Beyond Time.\nJaiwo 2017 (by Helen Gould): In modern-day Africa, corruption lurks in the ruins of the British Empire. Plus the scenario The Curse of the Zimba.\nMumbai 2037: Stories of cyberpunk India, in the city where dreams, wealth and power meet. Plus the scenario Consume.\nIn all these settings, you play Investigators who don't often appear in Cthulhu games: in London 1851, you play thieves, beggars and other residents of the slums; in Arkham, you play rural villagers; in Jaiwo, you play people from that African country; and in Mumbai, you play Indian workers.\nEverything above is written and, after final editing and layout, it's ready to go. You'll get most of it just after the Kickstarter ends, in a preview edition called Cthulhu Dark Zero (see below).\n  I'm Graham Walmsley, an award-winning author and game designer. I won a Gold Ennie for my work on Trail of Cthulhu for Pelgrane Press, which included Cthulhu Apocalypse and the legendarily bleak Purist adventures (collected as The Final Revelation).\nI wrote and published Stealing Cthulhu, a book about how to write stories of Lovecraftian horror in games. I also wrote Play Unsafe, a book about how to tell stories and play better. (If you've read either of these books, you'll be glad to know that Cthulhu Dark's guidance on Writing A Mystery and Playing A Mystery is almost all new.)\nAs well as that, I've written for many roleplaying games, including Doctor Who: Adventures In Time And Space, Fiasco, The Laundry and many others. That's me on the left below.\nI'm joined by some incredibly talented co-authors.\nHelen Gould, who wrote Jaiwo 2017, is a professional writer and long-time gamer. Kathryn Jenkins, who wrote Arkham 1692, writes regularly for Vacant Ritual Assembly and the blog Final Thoughts of a Murdered Guard. Both are relatively new to RPG writing and that's deliberate: I wanted to give new writers a chance to shine. \nAnd then there's Chris Spivey (right), a Cthulhu old hand, who you might know from his work on GUMSHOE One-2-One and his immensely successful Harlem Unbound. He's written an exclusive mystery, The Whole Is Greater, which you'll get if you back at a level that includes the Season Pass.\nThey've all delivered fresh and excellent takes on Lovecraftian horror. I'm looking forward to showing them to to you. \nThe cover art, which you'll find near the top of this page, is by George Cotronis. The beautiful black-and-white interior art, which you can see throughout this page, is by Matteo Bocci. The cartographer is Stentor Danielson: he's done a map for every setting and you can see his wonderful London 1851 map as part of this extract.\nThe preview video, which you can watch above, is by Banana Chan. I wanted something different from most Kickstarter videos and she's given me that and more. If you haven't watched it, you really should. \n  When you back Cthulhu Dark, I hope you're investing in the project, rather than just buying a book from me. Thanks for your support. In return, I'll make the final Cthulhu Dark rulebook as good as I can get it.\nThis is what you'll get.\nWhatever level you back at, you'll get both the preview version, Cthulhu Dark Zero, and the final version, Cthulhu Dark.\nCthulhu Dark Zero contains everything you need to play, including the full Player's Section, Keeper's Section and the London 1851 setting, and comes with special cover art. This is all written, edited, laid out and ready to go, and you'll get it just after the Kickstarter ends.\nCthulhu Dark Zero is a PDF and I'll give you a DriveThruRPG code if you'd like to print it (at cost). I'm doing it this way to avoid doing two print runs and keep the Kickstarter simple. It lets me put my energy into the final product.\nCthulhu Dark contains everything above, plus any stretch goals, plus the final three settings, Arkham 1692, Jaiwo 2017 and Mumbai 2037. I'll make this book as good as I can get it, depending on how much we raise in the Kickstarter: it'll definitely be hardback and I'll upgrade the printing if I can (say, adding a dustjacket). It'll be beautiful and you should get it before Christmas.\nHere's what the two books will look like. On the left is an early proof of the Cthulhu Dark rulebook. On the right is Cthulhu Dark Zero.\n  If you back at the Digital level, you get PDFs of Cthulhu Dark Zero and Cthulhu Dark.\nIf you back at Digital + Season Pass, you also get the Season Pass. I haven't done this before and I'm excited about it! I'll send you all the settings and other material as they are finished, so you'll get something in your inbox at regular intervals until the book arrives. I'd love your feedback on anything I send. This means you get an early look at everything that goes in the book, plus you get an exclusive scenario in PDF, which won't appear in the book: Chris Spivey's The Whole is Greater, set in France in the First World War.\nIf you back at The Book, you get Cthulhu Dark in hardback. It'll look wonderful.\nIf you back at Signed Book & Season Pass, you get Cthulhu Dark in hardback, with a signed bookplate. You'll also get the Season Pass, including that exclusive scenario by Chris Spivey.\nIf you back at Leather Book & Ominous Letter, you get a leatherbound copy of Cthulhu Dark. I'll also send you a disturbing letter from a fictional correspondent, which warns that dire things will happen if you read Cthulhu Dark. \nIf you back at a higher level, you're seriously investing in the project. I appreciate this so much. I'm offering some fun things in return, but really you're backing Cthulhu Dark and making it better for everybody. Thank you.\nAs for shipping, I've tried to keep this as low as possible, starting at about \u00a36/$8. It helps that I'm shipping both from the US and UK.\nFinally, I should mention that Kickstarter makes me charge in British pounds. If the backer levels look like strange amounts of money, that's because Kickstarter is automatically translating them to your currency. Don't worry about this: it's exactly like backing any other Kickstarter, except the dollar amount isn't a round number.\n  Cthulhu Dark's streamlined rules (which you can see here) are designed to tell stories about mind-bending horror. Here are some of their best features.\nYou can roll for anything, even if you don't have a skill in it. Want to try to remember something from your childhood? Or sense the mystical pattern behind ancient symbols? Or control your dreams? In Cthulhu Dark, you can always roll for it. The higher you roll, the more you find out.\nBut, if you roll too high, you find out too much and glimpse the horror. You never know when the horror will hit you: whenever you're investigating and you roll a 6, you'll get more then you wanted to know.\nYour Insight into the Mythos - which, to the outside world, looks like insanity - increases slowly at first, then quickly later. At the end of the game, you're on a knife-edge, where one bad roll will tip you over and make you lose your mind.  \nWhen your Insight gets too high, you can lower it by destroying evidence. You could burn photographs, deface carvings or even kill other Investigators. The only way you can recover your mind is if you leave no trace of the horrors you've seen.\nFinally, you can't defeat any Mythos creature by fighting it. Try running or hiding instead. But, ultimately, you know that the horror will win.\nThose are just some of my favourite parts of Cthulhu Dark's rules. You'll find more as you play. And I'll explain the best tips and tricks under The Rules In Detail.\n  As I mentioned above, I want to focus on making the final book as good as possible. That means I'm keeping this Kickstarter simple, without many add-ons.\nHaving said that, there are some extra things I'd like to do, so...\nNow we've hit \u00a310,000, I'll add a section on \"How To Hack Cthulhu Dark\". This will take you under the hood of Cthulhu Dark, showing you how it all fits together. It'll show you how to write your own games based on Cthulhu Dark.\nNow we've hit \u00a340,000, I'll add beautifully-written handouts to the book. That means I'll get all the letters from the scenarios handwritten and add some extras too. It'll give you something beautiful to hand your players when you run Cthulhu Dark.\nNow we've hit \u00a350,000, I'll release my design notes for Cthulhu Dark and put them in the book. These will help you get inside my head - if that's a place you want to be - telling you exactly why I designed Cthulhu Dark the way I did and how it's changed from the original version. If you want to write your own Cthulhu Dark stuff or publish Cthulhu Dark hacks, this is essential stuff.\nNow we've hit \u00a365,000, you'll get Good As A Feast by Mo Holkar, a new mystery in the Dust Bowl of 1930s America. It's a story about food, hunger and flesh.\nIf we reach \u00a375,000, you'll get Now We Are The Sons Of God, a mini-campaign by Scott Dorward in London 1851. It's in three parts, each focussing on a different aspect of Victorian London: Walk In The Light Of Your Fire uncovers a cruel and deadly factory; The Brightness of the Firmament sees shooting stars fall on a London rookery; and The Truth Shall Make You Free finds dangerous knowledge in a ragged school.\nIf we reach \u00a385,000, I'll link all the main Cthulhu Dark scenarios into a mini-campaign. That is, I'll give you the tools to play The Doors Beyond Time (Arkham 1672), Screams of the Children (London 1851), The Curse of the Zimba (Jaiwo 2017) and Consume (Mumbai 2037) in one time-travelling mystery.\nThe How to Hack guide, handouts, design notes and instructions to link the scenarios into a mini-campaign will go in the book. Good As A Feast and Now We Are The Sons Of God will be in PDF. \n Oh, and finally, I'll be using BackerKit for Cthulhu Dark, and they've asked me to display their logo. I'm happy to do so and delighted to be using them. Here it is!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter has risks, but I've designed this one to keep risks to a minimum. That's why I'm not offering lots of stretch goals, extras or things to be added to the book. I want to focus on delivering one main product, which is the Cthulhu Dark rulebook.\n\nLots of work has gone into the book already. All the text is written and has had some editing. The art is done. The layout for most of the book is done. After the final bit of editing and layout, it is ready to go.\n\nFor printing, I'll use the same printers I used for my last book, Stealing Cthulhu. They are CPI Antony Rowe, a highly-professional company, and they haven't let me down yet. They'll ship books to my fulfillers, Indie Press Revolution for the United States and Kixto for everywhere else. Both of them are highly experienced and have fulfilled many Kickstarters.\n\nSo, I've anticipated everything I can. For everything else, I'll rely on my years of experience publishing and promoting RPGs. I've left enough contingency, both in terms of time and funds, so that I'm confident that I can cope with everything that comes up and deliver you something that's really special.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Digital", "descp": "A PDF of Cthulhu Dark.\nPlus, just after the Kickstarter ends, a PDF of the preview version, Cthulhu Dark Zero.\nINCLUDES:\nCthulhu Dark, PDF\nCthulhu Dark Zero, PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["275 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a324 or more", "title": "Digital + Season Pass", "descp": "For people that want everything in a digital format: a PDF of Cthulhu Dark.

P. Lovecraft.\nThrough investigation, puzzle solving, time travel, knowledge of the Mythos, situational music, timed events and horrible scenes, the players will experience an interactive and unique scenario\u2014an epic mini-campaign playable in one (long!) gaming night.\nThe setting is London 1927, though the investigators will soon discover the need to dig deeper into England's occult past. The scenario may be played as a standalone event or incorporated into an ongoing campaign\u2014preferably its end, as the very world itself may collapse should the investigators fail.\nPuzzle solving: The players need to draw a powerful sigil to keep the dark powers at bay, but the sigil consists of several symbols in a special pattern. During the scenario, more pieces of the puzzle become clear, but do they have the skills to fit them all together and complete the sigil before the world ends\u2026?\nSituational music: At three key events during the scenario, music plays an important role. Three specific soundtracks heighten the mood and accompany the situation, as well as function as a time limit for the investigators to complete certain tasks. The soundtracks are not provided with this Kickstarter but are easily found on any musical service like Spotify, iTunes, Google Play or YouTube.\nKnowledge of the Mythos: As stated, this is a scenario meant for experienced players. They need to have some scenarios under their belt, as well as some basic knowledge of the Mythos. If they have never heard of R'lyeh before, then this scenario is not for them. Yet.\nCultural knowledge: The players will meet famous and historical persons of the time. They will also dig into England's past to uncover some horrible truths. Any real knowledge of persons like Christopher Wren, Aleister Crowley or a certain J. R. R. Tolkien could prove useful. Though such knowledge is not necessary, it could prove to tip the scale towards saving or ending the world...\nEpic: From a small and seemingly irrelevant situation, the players will soon find themselves facing the horrors of great Cthulhu himself. As they discover more and more of the past and its shocking implications though puzzle solving and investigation, they will soon feel the burden of humanity's future on their shoulders. They have never, and will never again, be this close to total destruction.\nPlaying time: Initial playtesting of the raw material suggests a play time of about six hours. This could easily be expanded, as the scenario will come with optional false leads and expanded situations to suit your needs. This versatility may easily expand the scenario into a mini-campaign.\nTwo endings: In the very last moments of the scenario, it becomes up to the GM to decide how it ends. The \u201cnormal\u201d ending will (hopefully) result in the players as victorious against the dark powers\u2014this is a satisfying option for the players since they have fought hard with brains and skills to achieve their goal; huzzah! The \u201cother\u201d option is something completely different; this is an ending that will turn upside down everything the players have found out and believed throughout the scenario. This is an option that will leave their jaws dropping and produce \u201cI did not see that coming!\u201d reactions. It\u2019s your choice. You're the GM.\nAction-oriented or not?: Some players (or GMs) may want to solve some situations using muscles & guns, though this scenario is meant to be completed without firing a single shot. For those players (or GMs) an \u201calternative action approach\u201d (AAA) is included where relevant.\nSkill use: The purpose of the scenario is to create a special atmosphere where the Mythos feels eerily alive everywhere. As such, rules and skills are less emphasized so as not to \u201cdisturb\u201d this purpose. The scenario may be played almost exclusively using the character's knowledge and ideas; only a few skill rolls are necessary. So how does it work? Let's say you find a strange book entitled The Book of Eibon. You are not meant to do a skill roll to discover what this book is; you're supposed to have heard about it before, both as a player and character. And if you stumble upon a lot of clues in a pile, you're not supposed to roll a Search, Luck or Library Use to find the \u201ccorrect\u201d clue; you're supposed to use your own wits and investigation throughout the scenario to figure out which are the correct ones. The use of skill rolls will be needed from time to time, but only to give alternative approaches to different situations, and never to interfere with the atmosphere.\nContent: In many RPG scenarios, there exists an elaborate description of the NPCs, their history, their minds, plans, surroundings... You will not find much of that in \u201cPax Cthuliana.\u201d We've read too many scenarios where the relevant information is somewhat \u201chidden\u201d in too much description. Don\u2019t get us wrong; it's entertaining to read about the family background, accent, tattoo and shoe size of the local bartender, but if his only appearance is when he gives the investigator a letter, that info is not very relevant for the players. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d tells you what you need to know; the rest is up to you.\nMature content: What stands the Lovecraftian world apart from many other themes is the atmosphere of fear and horror; if played well, both for the investigators and the players. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d follows this pattern; the fear is always lingering, but the \u201chorror level\u201d may be adjusted to your taste. The scenario may be enjoyed fully without a single drop of blood spilled, or you may choose to adjust some scenes to incorporate the ultimate horror targeting both your character and your own sanity. As such, it could potentially resemble the \u201calternative action approach\u201d (AAA) mentioned above. Call it AHA if you'd like (please don't).\nFact and fiction: The scenario combines the real world with the Mythos. The characters you meet and their story/surroundings are mostly historically correct, mixed with the occasional Mythos element. A complete Fact & Fiction section at the end of the scenario keeps you up to date, but is yours to bend to your own will...\nQuality: This is in a full-color page layout in US letter format! This scenario is a delight both to read and play.\nAbout the creators\nJarle Haktorson is the writer behind \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d. He bought his first CoC rulebook (5th ed) back in 1993 and was intrigued. This was totally different from his former RPG experiences playing mostly AD&D (2nd ed). During his later studies, he realized he fit the classic CoC investigator, as he studied Latin, Greek, Coptic, history, religion, etc. It also helped that he worked in a mental institution during his studies, and so understood how sanity really works (and doesn\u2019t work). He is currently the general manager of the Epix Haven gaming company (www.facebook.com/epixhaven), the leader of the local gaming club, and plays board games and RPGs as often as he can, at least once a week. He is proud to be a geek.\nEven Vinjor R\u00f8ssland is the creative mind behind the Insight Fantasy RPG and several other publications at drivethruRPG.com. He started playing RPGs back in the late 80s, slaying kobolds in D&D. Taking the GM-role some years later, he has entertained countless people through genres such as fantasy, sci-fi and horror. Even is in the creative advertising market, and has done all the layouts, book binding, advertising etc. for this scenario and campaign. Even is a gamer and a dreamer, and one of his dreams is this game.\nJoseph Diaz has created the heart of this scenario with his superior illustrations. He has previously worked as a concept artist for productions like Game of Thrones, Warcraft, Europa Report and Sleepy Hollow. Never has Cthulhu himself felt so threatening or near as in \u201cPax Cthuliana.\u201d\nTwo Starving Gnolls (TSG): When Jarle and Even sit down to talk, their heads spin with ideas. TSG was created to set those ideas into motion. As such, TSG functions as a development team to convert RPG ideas into playable material. \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d is the first such idea made a reality.\nWith help from you, this scenario could become even greater.\nNOK 18.000 (about US/EUR 2000): Scenario map over London\nThe players will travel around London gathering clues, slowly understanding the graveness of their search. This period-accurate map will help both the GM and the players better navigate the world; there is one version for the players and another for the GM.\nNOK 27.000 (about US/EURO 3000): More artwork and quality upgrades for clues\nMost of the cost creating this scenario is related to the artwork. We wanted more, but couldn't risk this project not become a reality. This stretch goal will add more artwork to the scenario and upgrade all the clues, making the horrors come even more alive.\nNOK 45.000 (about USD/EUR 5000): Custom-made soundtrack!\nYou read it right! Unlocking this goal enables us to create a custom-made soundtrack for the scenario! It will be available for ALL backers through download!\nNOK 63.000 (about US/EUR 7000): Art book\nA FREE art book to ALL backers containing all the sketches, images, clues, etc. used in the scenario, complete with discussions, \u201cbehind the scenes,\u201d etc. Sent as PDF via DriveThruRPG.\nNOK 90.000 (about US/EUR 10.000): Physical puzzle option\nThe players need to draw a powerful sigil to keep the dark powers at bay, but the sigil consists of several symbols in a special pattern. During the scenario, more pieces of the puzzle become clear. This stretch goal will give backers an option to receive a physical puzzle as an add-on. More on this as the campaign progresses.\nNOK 135.000 (about US/EUR 15.000): Another scenario!\nThe world may be saved from destruction this time, but what about the next\u2026?! This Stretch Goal will provide a completely new FREE scenario to all backers! More on this as the campaign progresses.\nNOK 200.000 (about US/EUR 22.000): \u201cCan we make it?!\u201d\nMore on this as the campaign progresses.\nFAQ\nWhat game system works with this scenario?\nThe short version: any (see the \u201cSkill use\u201d section above). Skill rolls play a minor part of the scenario. Where deemed necessary, a percentage system is used, like those found in CoC. It is easily modified to suit any system you'd like. We would also like to mention \"Cthulhu Dark\" by Graham Walmsley, as this is a rules-light system created to play Lovecraftian horror at its most intense.\nMust the scenario be set in exactly 1927?\nNo, you could tweak it some +/- five years or so if you'd like. Some historical characters need to be adjusted somewhat though; the scenario includes relevant information on how to do this.\nWhat does the title actually mean?\nIt's Latin for \u201cThe Cthulian Peace.\u201d You do not want that to occur and neither do the investigators, so help them out!\nIs this a production licensed by Chaosium?\nNo, and we are very aware of that. Hence, we only use our own illustrations and ideas, finding inspiration in H. P. Lovecraft's work available in the Public Domain. We do not use material (signs, symbols, characters, spells, etc.) owned by Chaosium. This scenario is a homage to Lovecraft's dark world.\nHow do you send the PDF files?\nWhen the campaign is finished and the scenario is ready to play, you'll receive an e-mail; this will include a link for your free download of \u201cPax Cthuliana\u201d at DriveThruRPG, the largest RPG download store.\nWhat does \u201cPOD\u201d means?\nIt means \u201cPrint on Demand,\u201d so if you pledged for the PDF version only, but decide to have a soft-cover version later, you may POD; that means that DriveThruRPG will print and ship a soft-cover version to you. You will need to cover those costs, though (they are included in Reward #2).\nMay I choose any name/picture in the story?\n(Concerning Reward # 4-5)\nWell, we do not know you personally, so you're free to supply us with the name and picture you want\u2014who are we to judge what people are called or how they look? :) We would hesitate though to supply names like Biggus Dikkus or provide photos of a badger (apologies to all people who look like a badger). Your name will of course also be mentioned in the credits!\nMay I provide any idea for the story?\n(Concerning Reward #6)\nYes, by and large, you may. This scenario is designed using unique storytelling techniques, but the main story may be altered along the way should the right ideas come up. This reward is also the only option to be given the story beforehand\u2014you'll need this knowledge to be able to think out and discuss your ideas with me. Your name will, of course, be mentioned in the credits!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPax Cthuliana is currently in a developing stage.

In it, he weaves and reinvents the works of H.P. Lovecraft through historical events. It is both a sequel and prequel to Neonomicon, and the resulting masterpiece owes a great deal to his artistic partner, Jacen Burrows. Dreadful Beauty: The Art of Providence is a celebration of the amazing work of Burrows. Over 15 years of his works are featured here, all showcasing Burrows' original pencils and inks. Included is a complete cover gallery -- from The Courtyard to Neonomicon to Providence -- as well as choice pages, designs, and lots of unused and never-before-made-public art! For fans of the series, this is a wonderful companion volume showcasing the haunting artwork and painstaking labor that went into bringing it to life. We offer a special hardcover edition for your support that you won't want to miss. But don't just take our word for it -\n \"Jacen Burrows, somehow combining immaculate Swiss-watch precision and wrenching human emotion, is a contemporary master of comic-book art with an instantly classical style that looks like it\u2019s surely been around forever; a timeless line that is as distinctive and original as anything the medium has ever produced. And while I am admittedly biased, I believe his astonishing work on Providence to represent a new level of accomplishment in the career of this already stellar artist and craftsman. A unique and genuinely remarkable talent.\" - Alan Moore \nAnd what better way to showcase this incredible series than with the Providence Complete Slipcase: A beautiful set of all the related works in hardcover editions in an exclusive slipcase with new art by Burrows. The Slipcase Set includes five volumes: Neonomicon, Providence Act 1, Providence Act 2, Providence Act 3, and Dreadful Beauty: The Art of Providence. This incredible set is limited to just 1000 units and none of the volumes within will have further hardcover editions.

It turns out this was ready to start packaging later than we hoped, another late project needed to start at the same time, and the beleaguered warehouse was in the middle of a third already.  A perfect storm of... well... making everyone unhappy.  Huzzah!   Now Comic Cavalcade, our warehouse/shipping sister company, is a small firm, just like Avatar.  We done gone and broke it with all this at once.  But at no point are we willing to sacrifice the quality of care taken with each order.  There is also the reality that new orders are constantly coming in.  Someone who orders two recent comics this week isn't really interested in waiting for over 1000 orders for various Kickstarters to get filled first.

Our big goal here is to include West Berlin and Alev as a new female player agent in the game. Our current stretch goal is called TOILETS!\nHow have we not introduced toilets to the clubs yet! How unrealistic! Everybody knows a video game's critical acclaim stands and falls with the state of its toilets. So if we reach this stretch goal we will add toilets to the game and add toilet relevant activities for player agents and clubbers. Extra Janitor staff is needed to keep the place in ordnung, and we'll add a new mission type that requires the privacy of a bathroom stall. For more details, check out the announcement update.\nOur next major goal is to bring Act 2 and West Berlin to the Closed Alpha. This will double the campaign length, introduce a new character with new abilities, and feature an intense Finale mission at the TV-Tower itself!\nIf we reach this new major stretch goal and raise a total of EUR 75 000 on Kickstarter, we\u2019ll be able to include all of West Berlin and Alev as part of the Closed Alpha. That will allow us to iterate on it with you all and really nail the new abilities and the setting with your feedback.\n  The Cold War never ended. For 150 years both sides have used time manipulation technology to observe and counter each other\u2019s every move. Now this fragile state of affairs is approaching a breaking point, as a rogue nuclear strike will send the world into turmoil. Both sides have scrambled to send agents back in time to find who is behind the attack and how to prevent it. If they fail, the whole world will turn to ash, forever.\nAll Walls Must Fall is an isometric tactics game where actions happen to the pulsing beat of the music. You control time travelling secret agents as they jump and loop through a single night in the city of Berlin. Using a pausable real-time system, carefully plan your decisions and use powerful time manipulation abilities to your advantage, as you carry out your mission in the shadows or in plain sight. Levels are procedurally recombined using a bespoke system developed by inbetweengames, giving All Walls Must Fall a highly replayable campaign structure, while still offering individually crafted components and set-pieces.\nAll Walls Must Fall takes inspiration from genre classics like X-Com, Syndicate and REZ, as well more recent indie games like The Banner Saga, Braid, SUPERHOT and Crypt of the Necrodancer.\nWe are three former AAA veterans who worked on Spec Ops: The Line, Dreadnought and Dead Island 2 at YAGER in Berlin. Collectively, we have been working in the industry for over 30 years. In summer of 2015, yet another of our AAA projects, work we dedicated years of our lives to, Dead Island 2, was handed to another developer. We decided that this couldn\u2019t go on, something had to change. To deal with our situation we joined the Ludum Dare game jam and made The Mammoth: A Cave Painting in 3 days. Some people liked it, so we formed inbetweengames as a small studio in Berlin to make a game we really wanted to make. That game is All Walls Must Fall.\nMusic is very important to the concept of All Walls Must Fall. So before we really get into more details we would like you to start and listen to some of the tracks you'll be hearing in the game while browsing the rest of the page.\nThe music in All Walls Must Fall uses a procedural music mixer that recombines electronic music loops to create a soundtrack that reacts to the game as you\u2019re playing. What you are hearing here is just a small sample. Check out the full playlist on soundcloud.\nIn All Walls Must Fall, a dystopian, divided Berlin in the year 2089, gives us the perfect setting for a futuristic film noir story. We have chosen to tell this story through the lens of a Tech-Noir Tactics game, but what does that even mean?\nAll Walls Must Fall is an isometric tactics game that uses a pausable real-time action system. Time is paused while you\u2019re making your tactical decisions, and is unpaused once you\u2019ve chosen a course of action. That action is played out, and then the game pauses again. Beyond spycraft and infiltration, your agents also have access to time manipulation abilities that allow you to experiment with possible futures and rewind to the past.\nThe Breakdown\nWe think of the game as X-Com meets Braid, with a bit of Syndicate sprinkled in for good measure. However, one of our first inspirations was actually Rez, the classic Dreamcast shooter where your shots add to the beat of the music. In All Walls Must Fall, actions and the music are synced together to create a rhythm-action effect. All actions are measured in beats of the music, but you can still take your time to make tactical decisions!\nThe Drop\nPLAY\n\nIn combat, you use the pause mechanic to plan out your strategy and take down your opponents. While you have the luxury of time manipulation, for everyone else on the ground, this intense firefight has only lasted a few seconds. Once you take out all your opponents, the game rewinds back to the beginning of the combat sequence and replays the whole thing in real time. This sequence is called The Drop; the music gets turned up to 11 and all the gunfire, shouts and explosions happen in time with the beat. It\u2019s an audiovisual ballet of intense music, violence and pyrotechnics!\nThe Campaign\nA single campaign consists of a number of missions, taking place in the same night in Berlin. Missions are not scripted, but give you a clear goal. It\u2019s up to you to decide on how to best achieve it within the sandbox of a Berlin nightclub. A single campaign will take a few hours to play through, but each one will contain different missions and may have different outcomes.\nMore than Combat\nCombat isn\u2019t the only way to approach each mission objective, and is often not the wisest. For example, using persuasion techniques gets a lot easier when you can go back in time to try a different chat up line! You will also have the possibility to hack objects in the environment to fulfill your mission goals. All Walls Must Fall encourages you to experiment by giving you the ability and freedom to try different strategies.\nOur initial funding goal is to introduce Kai as the player agent in All Walls Must Fall. Ideally, we don\u2019t want to stop there, stretch goals will allow the inclusion of two more agents from different factions - Alev and Glenn. These agents are not just awesome characters, they will also have their own time abilities, mixing up the gameplay and creating even more opportunities for experimentation!\nKai\u2019s been doing this a long time; time may be relative, but he was young when he started and he\u2019s feeling his age now. Kai is your classic action hero type, and he represents the past. With his cybernetic arm and large bulk, he cuts an intimidating figure, and although his manner is soft and charming, he\u2019s not afraid to use force when necessary.\nNever in a hurry, Kai specializes in forms of time manipulation that involve manipulating the past such as UNDO (which undos your last action and all its consequences), REWIND (which rewinds the world but not you), and TRACE BACK (which rewinds you but not the world).\nAlev is a cyber-warrior with West Berlin's CTA agency, and she represents the present. Her brand of time manipulation revolves around the present moment. She specialises in abilities like FREEZE (where the world stops moving but Alev can still act) and SPLIT (where an avatar copy repeats the first set of Alev\u2019s actions while she performs a second). Like all agents, she also is an expert with UNDO.  \n  Thank you for your support, dear visitor! We'll keep you up to date on how the campaign is going!

We're Rafal, Isaac, David and Almut. We are inbetweengames.\nRafal Fedro - Artist\nRafal got into games development at legendary Polish developer Metropolis Software. At Yager he worked on Spec Ops: The Line, Dreadnought and Dead Island 2. His specialties are 2D art, UI and FX, but as a generalist artist he's able to cover all our art needs.\nIsaac Ashdown - Programmer\nIsaac Ashdown has ported more games to more platforms than many players own, which eventually gave him programming superpowers. After shipping Demolition Inc at Berlin indie studio Zeroscale he joined YAGER to work on Dead Island 2. Isaac now handles all programming tasks on All Walls Must Fall.\nJan David Hassel - Designer\nDavid worked at YAGER since the beginning of Spec Ops: The Line and on various other cancelled projects, culminating in Dead Island 2. David has worked as QA Tester, Technical Artist, Technical Designer and Game Designer. Now he serves as the team's designer and jack-of-all-trades.\nAlmut Schwacke - Audio Designer\nWe first met Almut while she was doing some freelancing work for Dead Island 2 at YAGER. Her game credits include Curious Expedition and Rainbow Skies, and she has extensive experience as a Mastering Engineer, Foley Artist and Sound Designer. She joins inbetweengames as freelance audio designer and composer for All Walls Must Fall.\nWe\u2019ve already received funding from a few sources to get the project to this point, all of which will have gone into the game to allow for a few more months of development.\nWe received \u20ac 70 000 funding from the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, matched by our own savings and working-for-less-to-no-money. We also got a \u20ac16 000 Unreal Dev Grant from Epic Games. This has been a great help and allowed us to take the game up to the state it\u2019s in now. With your help, we want to take the game to the next level and make the game all it has the potential to be!\nWe\u2019ve been in full-time development on the game since April 2016, and have been running a pre-alpha for friends and family for a few months. We now think it\u2019s time to open that up to a wider audience. A game like this needs feedback from the community to really become something special. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to start a closed alpha, exclusively for Kickstarter backers, that will begin in May this year if we reach our funding goal.\nWe've also spoken to a few publishers to help get the game to the finish line, but none of these talks went anywhere. Most publishers think of the game as too niche, too hardcore, too complex, too old school, or too political to make the kind of profit they expect. This is why we have come to Kickstarter. We are not in this for profit. We are in this to make the kind of game we believe in, the kind of game that you don\u2019t see that often. However, it\u2019s also the kind of game that could potentially resonate with a group of people looking for something a little different, in a genre that has a lot of potential for unique gameplay ideas.\nAll Walls Must Fall is an ambitious game. While we already have a basic version of the game, there is so much more we want to do with it! We are certain we will be able to ship it in some form already. But to make it what it truly can be and deserves to be, we will need you help!\nMoney raised from Kickstarter will be used to run and support a closed alpha exclusive to Kickstarter backers. During this alpha we will be incorporating feedback, implementing additional features, adding more music and creating more content. The goal is to get a better, open alpha version ready, to be published via Early Access on Steam, without having to rely on publisher support.\nThe detailed breakdown is that 19.3% of the money will be spent on programming, art and design respectively. 6.7% will be spent on sound effects and audio design. 10% will be spent on music, although we additionally also give 100% of all profits attributable to the OST to our composers as revenue share. 10% will be spent on Kickstarter related fees. Finally, 15.3% will be spent on office costs, software and equipment.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur plan to begin a Closed Alpha of the first act of the game for Kickstarter backers in May, is relatively low-risk. We\u2019ve been running a closed test on itch.io, and the game is already playable with a campaign representing about one-third of the intended complete game playthrough length. We\u2019re very confident we\u2019ll be able to launch the Closed Alpha and run it with regular updates to the game.\n\nHowever, all game projects carry risks while they are in development. We were originally planning to release the game on Early Access earlier than now, but weren't happy with the quality of the game. So if we are able to and it seems necessary, then it is always possible that final delivery of the game may take longer, in order to get it to the quality we want it to have. But even during that time, Kickstarter backers will have access to the current alpha version and will receive continuous updates.\n\nAs we\u2019re a self-contained team, we don\u2019t have too many dependencies on external organisations. However, we do rely on marketplaces such as itch and Steam to host and deliver our game. While unlikely, unforeseen changes to these platforms may cause complications for us.\nWe\u2019re using Unreal Engine 4 to create the game, and while we have extensive experience using the engine (more than 20 years between the three of us), it\u2019s always possible that unexpected bugs or delayed features may in turn delay our ability to ship the game when we intend.\n\nPhysical reward fulfillment and add ons are also something we are getting professional help with, from Backerkit and Teespring. We hope that they'll help us to get through the thick of it. Since we are such a small team, we don't want to spend too much time on mailing out keys and packages. We should spend as much of our time and effort as possible on making the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Visitor Visa", "descp": "Thank you for your support dear visitor!

Truth is not more accurate or more deceptive than anything else. It just is.\nThere are many \u201ctruths\u201d about the darkness and the occult. Countless prophecies, texts and tomes about the unreal and the bizarre that pierce through reality and leave dismembered souls and withering minds in their wake. However, there are few insights that cover it all, and the certainty can always be questioned. Often they are a small part of a great mystery, or a conspiracy in a greater context.\n\nShrouded in darkness and buried for a thousand years in lies, the \u201ctruths\u201d come through from time to time. Facts, built upon dogmas, institutions, science, rituals, covens, only God knows what. The fundamental principles that are considered so true, that the bare thought of them being exposed would bring down dooms of death.\n\nConspiracies are boiling beneath the surface, the covens gather in dark rooms, knowledge switches owners and occultists dig deep into the mysteries to uncover the secrets.\n\n\n\nThis is the twilight of the gods - welcome to LexOccultum, an 18th century horror, mystery and occult role-playing game.\nOur goal with this Kickstarter campaign is to translate and launch Sweden\u2019s \u201dGame of the Year\" game into English.

This campaign will take the heroes from the streets of Paris to Versailles, to southern France and all the way to the hidden chambers of the ultimate secrets of all, what's hidden inside Mont Tombe. Roi de Rats, is a zoologic phenomenon also called Rattenk\u00f6nig (german) whereas a number of rats whose tails are intertwined and bound together form an entity. The campaign is not for the faint-hearted or hack-and-slashers, it's complex and demanding for both players and the game master.\nSoftback or Hardback (stretch goal), approx 150+ pages.\nOur goal is to deliver the core rules along with the campaign Roi-de-Rats at the end of 2017 or beginning of 2018, depending on how long translation and printing take.\nPlease note that this is a funding campaign, and portions of the work are set to take place after we know if we are successful in the funding or not. This means that we have to engage writers, editors, printers etc, after the campaign ends. The delivery date is therefore an estimate, not a fixed science.\nEurope, 18th century. The church is losing its grip on men struggling with old beliefs and dogmas. Alchemists, occultists and secret societies dig deep into old mysteries and ancient obscurities. Enlightenment is not only about breaking free from old institutions and structures, but also about discovering what has been hidden for hundreds of years, even millenniums. Illuminati, Freemasons, the old Templars and other secret societies hide in dark chambers plotting for a new world order, or to just uncover the dark arts and ancient wisdoms.\n\nThe nobles and aristocrats is a dying breed living in full decadence and excess while the common people suffer in poverty. This is the era of Enlightment, but also ignorance. Few know anything about the growing darkness; the vampires and offspring of the devil, and while conspiracies grow under the surface, kings and priests preach about submission and obedience. But who is to save men from the twilight of the gods, from falling into the darkness and be consumed by evil? Is it true that the apocalypse is soon to come?\n\nLexOccultum takes place in a fictive historical 18th century, where the occult and supernatural is real but not yet in full bloom.\nThis is a game about flintlock pistols, filthy grave diggers, lanterns, werewolves, wine and decadence, secret societies, conspiracies and mysteries too dangerous to uncover. It\u2019s a game about explorers battling the raging seas, the truth about the Templars, holy bloodlines, a quiet war between men and beast. Discover the corrupt Paris, the smoke filled London, \"gin craze\" and alchemists search for the Philosopher's stone. Dig deep into the cabbala system and ancient mysteries of old Egypt.\n\n\u201dListen up, ya dragger-tails and butter-bags, our friend is to be stabbed with the Bridgeport dagger and will hang in the morning together with all blue-tape drinkers and innocent game pullets. So grab ya flats and sharps and let\u2019s walk down to that crown office and snab those red hats.\u201d\n\nInspirations building this property have been:\n\nThe movie Brotherhood of the wolf\nSolomon Kane\nQuicksilver\nHoly Blood and Holy Grail\nAssassins Creed\nThe perfume\nDracula\n...and all the templar-secret-societies-horror-vampire-books-and-movies, out there!\n  LexOccultum is a skill-based BRP-clone (basically the same game-engine as Trudvang Chronicles) with archetypes such as Occultist, Highwayman, Vagabond, Soldier, etc. and a set of Character Traits (Health, Charisma, Perception, Intelligence, etc.).\nSkills are divided in \u201dGeneral skills\u201d, \u201dDisciplines\u201d and \u201dSpecialties\u201d. General skills are broad and general, Disciplines are more focused and Specialties are a very specific expertise. Total skill value is measured from 1-20 (1 low, 20 max). A Skill measure between 1-10, and then Disciplines and Specialities can raise to a maximum of 20.\nExample: Natural Philosophy (Skill). Transmutation (Discipline). Alchemy (Specialty).\nAll skills are built upon a D20 system (roll below your Skill-level to success).\nCombat mechanics center around actions and modifications for difficulty and Skill level.\nCombat example:\nA character that has Skill value 7 in the skill Combat, level 2 in Discipline \u201dClose combat arms\u201d and level 3 in the Specialty \u201dOne handed weapons\u201d (right hand) has a total Skill value of 15 (7+1+1+2+2+2). This value is \u201ddynamic\u201d and can be distributed for the number of Action(s) the weapon allow. If the character carry a rapier he/she can attack and/or parry with the rapier 4 times in one Action round. The Skill value of each attack or parry is up to the character to decide as long as the sum is not higher than the total Skill value.\nThe combat system includes, initiatives (taking turns), actions and hit points. System is quite deadly and mortal. Wounds are divided into different blocks. Once entering a higher block modifications kick in. There are five levels for physical damage, and five levels for mental damage.\nRolls for damage is \u201copen-ended\u201d, meaning if you roll 10 you roll again.\nEven though it\u2019s unusual and difficult, characters can learn \u201cmagic\u201d from the Secret Arts, divided into: the Dark Arts, the Holy Arts and the Scientific Arts. Every \"spell\" or \"ritual\" requires individual skills and learning and there is no rule system cover them all. Some \"spells\" and \"rituals\" are very powerful, some not.\nInfluence in areas such as: Underworld, Politics, Military, Occult etc, plays an important role in the game. The more influence a character has in a specific area, the more likely to get power and credibility that can be used in the game. Influence is gained thru play and can also be acquired thru Adventure points given after fulfilling an adventure.\nVouge (meaning clothing and appearance) and \"first impression\" also play an important role in the game. Characters with high Vouge value are more likely to be helped and listen to than those with a low value. There is a set of rules deciding the Vouge value of clothing pending on how old and up-to-date with fashion they are, as well as the quality and detail of the clothes.\nThis will be the 3rd version of the previous G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung rules, updated from the latest version currently online in our online RPG service.\nLexOccultum is an easy game to learn, but has the depth to attract the experienced gamer.\nSample Archetypes\n  LexOccultum is an existing game.

The book will be filled with all the secrets about the Freemasons, the Witch Cult, Illuminati, Odd Fellows, Sodalitium, and many more. And remember: this is the true version, not the one you\u2019ve been filled with before.\n\nCharta Monstrum\nCharta Monstrum - Bestiary\nCharta Monstrum is the monster-book for the game, including detailed info about vampires, werewolves, golems and many, many more.\n\nIf you have a hard time convincing yourself, boyfriend, girlfriend, mom, dad, pet, bank account, shelves already filled with nice games\u2026 whatever, to help us with this project .

Thank you guys, I hope this is only the first of a long series of masterpieces! Very glad to pledged your kickstarter\u201d \nA few words on production pace, priorities and what to focus on.\nSome potential backers may ask how we can release a new kick-starter for a new game when we have not delivered Trudvang Chronicles yet. So let us be clear, it's two separate teams working on these lines even though the core of our team (Theo and Magnus) will supervise both. Launching LexOccultum with have little effect on Trudvang Chronicles and vice versa. Having said that, should we be successful in this Kickstarter we will still always prioritise what's \"next in line\", in this case Trudvang Chronicles that will be out summer 2017.

We\u2019ve reached both our goals for this campaign. It\u2019s truly amazing!\nThe funds are important, but the great start to our community for \u00abMy Child Game\u00bb is invaluable. This campaign has given us so many new friends and ambassadors, both as backers and followers on Facebook, Twitter and our newsletter. We\u2019re looking forward to sending out the rewards we are making for you!\nThis is just the beginning of our journey - we aim to launch the game this autumn and have an exiting period in front of us. So to all of you who are visiting this page after the campaign is over, please follow our project on Facebook ( www.facebook.com/MyChildLebensborn/), Twitter (twitter.com/MyChildGame) or sign up for our newsletters (www.mychildlebensborn.com).\nWith all our hearts, thank you!\nElin & Catharina\n       PLAY\n\n \nYou play as the ward of a seven year old child. You are a single parent, struggling with a tight budget while taking care of your child. Together, you live through a linear story beginning with the child starting school. \n But your kid\u2019s first meeting with the local community is troubled. You are challenged to explain and help the child as the problems deepen, while also uncovering their background and the cause of the difficult situation. The playthrough will be around 4 - 5 hours and you can choose if your kid is a boy or a girl.\n  Meet Klaus/Karin, a kind and creative child living in a small town in Norway in 1951. Learning to know that they are different from the other children \u2013 a deep feeling of shame grows within them. \nFortunately, they have a kind and loving adoptive parent - you.\nAfter years of occupation, your local town is recovering from the emotional and physical scars left after a long war. \nBut there are some scars that do not heal. \n   Within this town is your home and your child\u2019s sanctuary. \nYour home will be the main interaction point with the child, as you care for, nurture and work through the problems Klaus/Karin faces.\n Other nurture games, like \"Tamagotchi\", have traditionally presented the player with a one dimensional pet to care for. \nIn our game you build a relationship with a child that has a complex character and individual personality. What you say and how you care for the child feeds into a mood system, directly affecting the child's emotional state.\nThis is reflected in facial expressions, body language and also in the way the child responds to you. So - instead of a pet, you interact with a complex and interesting character that we think will give you an immersive and engaging game experience. \nWe use an intimate format, relying on the mobile screen with touch based controls, to create a stronger emotional experience.\n  Balance meagre resources and emotional needs\nTime is the main currency in the game. You are free to choose how this time is spent, either by working to earn money (letting you buy and do more, but leaving the child alone), or to spend with the child (supporting the child's development, but having less for food or rent).\n  Influence the child\u2019s personality, emotions and views                                                   How you interact with the child will affect their emotions and wellbeing. It respond differently to you based on the choices you make, and ultimately their view on the world will change. \n\n\nMake tough choices                                                                                                              The story will be experienced differently from one player to the next and will take you through an increasingly emotionally challenging experience. \n   We are inspired by the true stories of Children Born of War, with enemy soldiers as fathers. Children of the enemy are born in all conflicts. We tell the dramatic story of the \"Lebensborn\" children in Norway, which is one of many such groups.\n We are working with surviving Lebensborn-children, now in their seventies, to ensure that the events that we are presenting are representative for the difficulties they faced growing up.\n  My Child Lebensborn features scores from experienced and renowned film composers, who have worked on subtle scores for emotional content. \nKetil Vestrum Einarsen and Lars Fr\u00f8islie are making music that color and follow the child's emotional state, using acoustic instruments that fit the historical context. \nFor sound design we are working with Dan Wakefield, who recently got acclaim for his work on \"Through the Woods\".   \n  In order to create a believable and complex character with individuality and personal traits, we have worked with writer Sofia Lersol Lund. She has brought her experience with character development for film and TV-series to the project. \nWriter Ozan Dr\u00f8sdal from Perfectly Paranormal is bringing his experience in effective dialogue for games.\nWe also wish to thank author Nicolai Frobenius, game author Ragnar T\u00f6rnqvist (Dreamfall) and experienced game designer Richard Lermarchand (Uncharted) for their excellent advice and support.  \n    We have some wonderful pledge rewards for you that we hope you find interesting. Your help and support will really make a difference. Supporters, such as yourself, who\u2019ll follow and share our project are so important to the success and visibility of the game. \nEven a one dollar pledge matters and shows us that we have people willing to support our cause.\n        Delivery dates\nWe will work to fullfill delivery of the tiers as swiftly as we can, and mail out digital rewards as they are produced. The physical part of a tier will be posted in one shipment as soon as all the items  belonging to the tier are completed.\nInternational shipment *)\nWe have included international shipment by post in the prize of the perks, but the supporter will be responsible for any tax or customs in their local countries. We will ship the tiers marked as marketing material and with the metal value of the hearts. \n  My Child: Lebensborn will be launched as a premium game for mobile platforms. Release estimated autum 2017. \nWe have funded most of the development of the game, however we need your help to ensure the game gets the full attention it deserves. \nWe lack funds for refining and marketing, and both are really important elements to be able to give the game the love it needs. And most importantly - to be able to get the game out to people.\nYour support will be used in the following way:\n  (This is an estimate, based on a theoretical number of supporters and mix of tiers)\n  This project is a collaboration between two companies, Teknopilot and Sarepta Studio.\nIndie game developers Sarepta studio, with their team of 10 employees and CEO Catharina Due B\u00f8hler, are the creators of award-winning PC and console game \"Shadow Puppeteer\".\n\nTeknopilot is a production company working with innovative, digital storytelling, headed by producer Elin Fest\u00f8y.\nElin and Catharina met at a seminar in 2013, whilst Elin was working on the Lebensborn material. She wanted to explore the possibility of making a game that lets you experience the story instead of \"telling\" it in a traditional format. To use the game format to build empathy through immersion, interaction and emotional engagement. \nThe two companies have since been hard at work developing this concept into reality. \n  Please follow our project - we are posting updates on many platforms. Follow them all to get the full picture :-)  \nFacebook   \nTwitter   \nSnapchat   \nYouTube - Gamedev blogs   \nInstagram   \nE-mail updates   \nwww.mychildlebensborn.com\n\nOn behalf of all on our team, we would like to thank you for the interest you have shown in this project. The development of the game, as well as the opportunity to tell the unknown story of the\" Lebensborn\" children, has been a dream of ours. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for sharing our dream and supporting us.\n  Kind Regards\nFrom Elin and Catharina\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we have secured some funding for our game, we know that we will be able to finish it. However our current funds for polishing and testing are extremely limited, and we fear that we won't be able to do the game justice when it comes to the end product. The marketing funding - and ambassadors - from this campaign will mean a lot to the future of the project. \n\nThe risk for the backers of this campaign are very limited. The game will be finished, and the physical and digital perks that we offer will be financed by the funds from the rewards. \n\nWe aim to release the game for Android and iOS, and will need to get accepted into Google Play or Apple Store. There is a risk that there will be a struggle in getting accepted because of the heavy topic.

A place where technology is magic and newcomers are revered or hated.\n         The denizens of this new world will range from tribal punk hunters to retro inspired robots.\nMark and Don will experience this strange and wondrous place with you.\n    A never before seen African post-apocalyptic setting.\nA dramatic science fiction story inspired, in both look and design, by the 80s, with a futuristic twist.\nExplore a beautiful wasteland to discover villages, destroyed cities, and uncover the secrets of strange and abandoned technology.\nA synth inspired soundtrack. \nMultiple characters and companions.\nA classic adventure game whereby you solve puzzles, combine and use items, discover clues and work your way through an epic story.\n        PLAY\n\nLINK TO PHOTOGRAMMETRY VIDEO: https://youtu.be/Ya_loZo-okk\nWe are using photogrammetry to capture the beauty of Africa. In this process, we take hundreds of photographs of a scene or object and, then using specialized software, we generate 3D models and textures from the photos themselves.\nEvery screen in BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION has a real piece of Africa in it - most often due to changing winds and ocean tides it is something that will only ever exist in our game.\n  Classic science fiction films still hold up today because of their extensive use of real locations and miniatures. \nWith BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION we want to capture the feeling of true science fiction through the use of intricately painted miniatures also captured with photogrammetry.\nA post apocalyptic world gives us many incredible opportunities to work with scale models. We can explore an decrepit battleship, hulls of long abandoned cargo planes and urban graveyards of rusted cars... All the elements we so love about the post apocalyptic genre.\n  By aiding us in the crowd funding of BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION we would like to reward you with an array of goodies. \nPledge $5 or more:\nPledge $19 or more:\nPledge $33 or more:\nPledge $69 or more:\n Pledge $78 or more:\nPledge $119 or more:\nSTANDARD BOX DESIGN\nEXCLUSIVE TO OUR BACKERS\nTo celebrate BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION we have created a one-of-a-kind box design.

The design pillars are:\nBase & team management\nTurn-by-turn combat\nSanity loss & perma-death \n   Our project is somewhere at the crossroad between XCOM: EU, Eldritch Horror and The Call of Cthulhu. We seek to design a game that has the accessibility of a video game, the tactical challenge of a board game and the flavor of a good old-fashioned tabletop RPG. \nPlanned release : October 2017\nGame mode: single-player offline\nLanguage: English (more languages to be announced)\nSupported platforms: PC, Android, iOS \n     The year is 1929. A dismal Cult is sprawling around the world. Blinded by their folly these madmen seek to awaken one of the Elders - an alien abomination buried deep below the sea.\n   You control a secret society whose sole purpose is to prevent the awakening. Send your Investigators to travel the world, study ancient texts and forbidden relics, find a way to contain this evil. \n   Do not linger, your time is running out!\n    We want to make this game because we believe there is another angle to Lovecraft's works. Indeed, if you take Lovecraft\u2019s books one by one then you might see a series of horror tales. But if you look at them as a whole, the global picture becomes way more epic: you will find yourself contemplating an alternative universe with its own mythos and lore, an encyclopedia of bizarre creatures, a pantheon of alien gods, a fragile mankind perpetually on the brink of destruction\u2026 And that\u2019s the angle we want to capture. A game in which human life is ephemeral, where madness is lurking at every crossroad, where a strange Mythos is developing in the shadows. \n      The game is organized around two game phases\n  You control several Investigators that you can send all across the world to investigate strange cases and establish new contacts in your headquarters.\n   Each Contact gives you access to a specific action. For instance, the Sanatorium will allow you to recover from Insanity, the Underworld will give you access to the black-market shop and the Airfield will give you access to air routes.\n    The essence of each Investigator is its Occupation. As of now, we plan to have 9 Occupations, but make sure to check out our Stretch Goals for more!\n  The Occupation defines the overall balance of your Investigators:\nDreamers are fragile but have a high Sanity. That makes them excellent spell-casters, but vulnerable to mental disorders.\nEnforcers are of strong Health and good Dexterity. They are good at taking and dealing physical damage.\nScholars have average stats except for their outstanding intelligence. Their rationalism protects them from Sanity damage.\n  Every Investigator has a highly functional character sheet, giving you a quick and clear overview of its core stats (Health, Sanity, Dexterity and Intelligence).\nInventory on the left. Character Sheet on the right.\n   Each Investigator has 15 open slots that will be filled progressively with Afflictions, Skills and Spells. These attributes will define your character's personality and create endless gameplay possibilities.\n     The game is built around a turn-by-turn combat system. Every Investigator has a pool of Action Points that can be used to move, attack and interact with the environment.\n   To prevail against the wicked Cult, your investigators will have to use Artefacts and blasphemous Spells at the cost of their Sanity.\n       If your Investigators take too much damage they die permanently. Damage can be dealt both physically and mentally. If either your Health or Sanity reaches zero, your character is gone... forever.\n     Sanity is a crucial resource, that your Investigators spend whenever they face nightmarish creatures, investigate terrifying facts, study abnormal relics and cast blasphemous spells... But manage them wisely, for loosing too much Sanity could result in a mental Disorder.\n   Each Disorder has the ability to trigger disruptive random events. Here are a few examples:\nAn Investigator who suffers from Gambling can potentially be ambushed by Loan Sharks in every city he sets foot in, resulting in a dangerous combat situation. \nAn Alcoholic Investigator can end up in jail if he stays idle for too long which will require you to post bail!\nTreat disorders rapidly to avoid misfortunes.\n         We have plenty of content to add to our game, in case we exceed our initial objective: new Occupations, exclusive Weapons, new Environments... And ultimately, the cross-platform cloud saving.\n   Introducing new Occupations: the Inspector, the Writer, the Architect.\n  Gain access to exclusive WW1 military supplies: the Stick Hand Grenades, the Heavy Machine Gun and many more!\n   Introducing new Occupations: the Boxer, the Priest, the Librarian.\n   Explore a new environment - the Tropical Jungle! It comes along with 10 new turn-by-turn adventures.\n   Introducing new Occupations: the Thug, the Musician, the Archaeologist.\n Enhance your thriving headquarters with additional contacts.\n  Explore the oneiric world of the Dream Lands! This new environment comes along with 10 new maps for turn-by-turn adventures.\n Create a secured cloud account to store your save file so you can share your progress between PC and mobile! This requires a lot of front-end and back-end work. It's a complicated task that comes with high cost, but we would love to make it happen.\n         All backers will appear in our game's Credits. The position of the names will be based on the different pledge tiers.\n   Minimum Requirements: Android 4.0.3, 1GHZ Dual Core, 1GB RAM, 800*480 pixels screen resolution\n   [Edit: we added 2 pledges specifically for iOS versions.

We love playing good games but we rarely have the time to do so. This has two negative consequences:\nWe unwillingly cut down on good gaming experiences because they are too time consuming. \nWe find ourselves playing more and more mobile games not necessarily because we like them, but simply because they are convenient to use.\nTherefore, we built the DNA of our games around a blend of both platforms:\nFast to load: we want the player to be able to dive into his game as quickly as possible and resume his progression. That\u2019s why we chose 2D graphics over 3D graphics.\nFast to play: we avoid huge chunks of dialogues and replace text with icons whenever we can in order to make our User Interface as intuitive as possible.\nA short but extensible game loop: we are putting together small bits of adventures so you can play the game for several minutes or a couple of hours.\nHighly replayable: instead of a complicated one-time story line that\u2019s hard to keep track with, we want you to experience your own stories by creating a dynamic sandbox. As your characters progress throughout the game, this sandbox will fill with unexpected events.\nFully mobile friendly: most games are either designed for mobile-only or ported to mobile after being successful on another platform. We are designing this game to work on both PC and mobile right from the start \u2013 hence the top view for instance.\nPremium model: no advertising, no in-game purchases, you can play offline and never need to wait for long downloads to finish. \n     Francois has been around video games for over a decade, working in various management positions for Ubisoft, 2K Games and Gameloft. He is the twisted mind behind this project so he is the one to blame! For his defence though, he\u2019s been under the influence of role-playing games and board games ever since he was old enough to read rules and throw dice.\n   David is a veteran coder who served 10 years in the industry working for Ubisoft and Rockstar Games. He contributed to worldwide successes like Grand Theft Auto and Assassin\u2019s Creed. His love for the code can only be matched by his love for outdoor activities\u2026 If he doesn\u2019t answer your mail then he\u2019s probably out there, camping somewhere in the wilderness.\n   Robin is an experienced coder who started on the wrong side of the force, making tools and algorithms for Financial institutions. Thankfully, he turned Jedi 4 years ago when he joined 2K Games to produce the mobile versions of XCOM Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. After that, he started coding his own games among which some interactive adaptations of child books\u2026 Now he is all about making the world a better place!\n   Like most artists Seb has been drawing ever since mother nature gave him two arms and a consciousness. Most of his craft has been channelled towards fantasy books and RPG artworks which is a perfect match for the art direction of our game. In his free time, Seb likes to chain-watch movies and worship the eighties\u2026 One day, he\u2019ll make one of these pixel-based games full of flashy colors and synthesizer sound effects. Check out his work at http://www.sebastienecosse.com/\n   When you look at Ben, you are looking at 16 years of professional experience in the field of graphic design and menu navigation. Websites, flash games, mobile apps\u2026 He\u2019s seen it all! Needless to say that he is the mastermind behind the User Interface of our game. Thankfully his current work is not impeded by his passion for red wine. Check out his work at http://frak.fr/\n   Brice is a our fearless young blood, coming straight out of the game design school. As a student, he contributed to many indie projects and board game designs, and even worked on Fear Effect Sedna during his internship. His obsession for meticulous game mechanics and his fresh ideas are invaluable to keep the project up-to-date with our time. He is not only a fan of game jams but also of musical jams and owns enough instruments to equip a whole band!\n     The whole audio (SFX and musics) will be produced by Red Forge. Check out their work at http://www.redforgemusic.com/ or https://redforge.bandcamp.com/ \n     Rise of the Elders: Cthulhu has been in development for a full year already. Like most indie game projects we got this far by tapping our own personal savings. We are now reaching out to Kickstarter in order to produce the remaining content.\n   Our studio Strange Matter is full of new ideas and original concepts. But in order to continue, we need Rise of the Elders: Cthulhu to be a success. So if you want to inject some new blood into the gaming industry thereby refreshing your gaming experiences, then now is the moment to mobilize! \n   Whether you can afford to pledge or not, we would like to thank you for your interest in our project. We would be even more grateful if you could spread the word to help us reach our funding target. Let them know we're here!\n   Thank you so much.\n  To follow the development of our project, join us on our Facebook page or follow us on Twitter @EldersRise.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have set the funding goal to \u20ac51.000, a value that we have carefully calculated to allow the completion of the project and that ensures our unconditioned dedication to the release and beyond. That said, game development is always full of challenges, sometimes unexpected ones. But looking at the current shape of our project after a full year of development, we are highly confident that we will successfully deliver a good game.\n\nThis confidence also stems from the combined experience that our team members have gathered in the industry over the last decade. We feel enthusiastic as \u201cRise of the Elders: Cthulhu\u201d is our launch pad into independent game development and we feel motivated as it will guarantee the forthcoming of our freshly formed company.\n\nWe\u2019ve set the estimated delivery to September 2017. Although estimations are a difficult topic in the software industries, we\u2019ve done the uttermost to set the right release date for our game. The estimation will slightly vary based on the amount of stretch goals achieved. But with a bigger funding, we can also get more people on board to ensure a quick development.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Strange Matter\nFirst created

They are all bound by hand, and the content, while originally hand-written, will be printed on the pages except for in the top two tiers.  The pages are heavily inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft (see the video and some example pages below).    \nDeer Hide Hickory Wood Option:  Thickest and heaviest, it is covered in deer hide over 1/4\" thick hickory wood panels, with a raised Elder Sign, metal protective corners, and extra thick spine.  \n  Deer Hide Wood Cover Option\n  Gold Stamped Option: Imitation leather but good thickness and gold stamped Elder Sign on the cover (see video).  It has a flat spine.   NOTE:  There are two rewards with this cover, a blank journal / sketch book with regular paper, and the printed spell book.\nGold stamped option\nGoat Hide Option: Thin and light (see video), but with a nicely dyed goat hide cover and a raised Elder Sign. We've worked to make this the least expensive option and hopefully accessible to most fans.  NOTE:  The Elder Sign in off center in this prototype but will be centered in the final version.     \nGoat hide option\nThe Pages: The intent behind the book is that it is a tome of spells, rituals, prayers, and history from those who favor the Great Old Ones and that it has been passed down generation to generation with additions along the way.  The book is divided into four sections\nAncient Section: This is the biggest section, and consists mostly of Latin and other ancient languages.  Many of the passages taken directly from the Necronomicon were translated into Latin and written here.   \n17th Century Section: This section was added around the time of the Salem witch trials.  It is written in the English of the 1600s with different handwriting, and by someone with low spelling and grammar skills.  It contains a scattering of ancient magic mixed in with the English.   \nVictorian Era Section:  Added in the mid 1800s, this section is a much neater handwriting, and generally better English.  It adds a few questionable arcane choices, which in turn lead to the fourth and final section.  \nVictorian Era Deranged Section: It is unclear if this section was added by the previous author, or by their heir, but for certain this relatively short section shows a distinct degrading in mental stability.   \nSample Pages: Here are the pages CURRENTLY available as the \"A single rolled A3 sized spell book sheet (a left and right page combo) on cotton paper\" reward.  We will add more options as stretch goals (and potentially some free pages)\n  Page 750-751 of the Necronomicon\n  Essential Saltes\nA Note on CUSTOM PAGES: For the options with custom pages (Mage $400 and higher) I will work with you for what you want, but I am a fairly limited artist.  What you see in other pages is what you are likely to see more of, just, customized to what you want.  I can do words and runes and symbols and simple designs, but I can't, for example, draw realistic characters or horrifying monsters, although I could attempt to copy one by hand if you had something for me to use as a guide.  \nThe Game\nThe Game: From the Back Cover\nAugust 1st, 1883, a Great Old One rose out of the Pacific Ocean and armies of cultists, half breeds, hybrid monstrosities and creatures built from the stuff of nightmares pulled off their disguises and prepared to herald in the coming age of their Master. Ultimately the Old One and the hordes of \u201cAeonists,\u201d as they called themselves, were defeated.  \nUnfortunately, your kind were  on the side of the Old One\nYou are an Aeonist, one of the Leftovers of the Apocalypse, and for the last decade you and your people have been hunted down, imprisoned, or worse. Your religious beliefs misunderstood, your people mocked and hated for their differences, and your history and your culture banned or destroyed.  \nThe year is now 1893. The camps are closing, Aeonists are rebuilding their lives, and sunlight has returned to the fields and farms. You may choose to move closer to the Higher Powers you know are out there, or deny their existence. You may attempt to renounce your heritage, or to serve it faithfully, to avenge your people or to help rebuild civilization. The one certainty is that there is no going back.  \nRulebook Cover\nThe Ruleset: This is a ruleset for a Role Playing Game with complete guidelines on how to play it as a Live Action Role Playing (LARP) Game, and a Table Top RPG. It is 260+ pages long, and contains  \nBackground History and Current World \nSimple Character Creation Process \nBoth LARP and Table Top rules mechanics \nThree sets of 72 Damage Cards (printed on paper for copying and using on card stock etc. The actual decks of playing cards are sold separately) \nGM Resources like Spells, Items, NPCs \nA complete introductory scenario which can be played as a Table Top game or a LARP.\nSample page1\n  Sample page2\n  Sample page3\nThe Add-On Damage Card Decks: There are actual playing-card sized card decks available for the combat system.  They aren't required (copies of all of them come in the ruleset) but make a great playing aid.  \nSample Blades and Bullets\n  Horror Sample\n  Reward Matrix\nNew Add-Ons!\n+ $150\nA reprinted version of Poligraphia, by the Monk Johannes Trithemius\nThis is the scanned text of the actual book published circa 1499 now reprinted on antiqued paper and bound in goat hide.  It was listed as banned by the Catholic Church from 1609 to 1900, and is mentioned in the H.P. Lovecraft story \"Dunwich Horror\".  Approximately 276 pages long, it will be printed on thinner paper than the Spell Book, but the paper will still have deckled edges and will be yellowed as parchment paper.  \nAnother great addition to an Lovecraft inspired library.  \nPoligraphia\n+ $150  \nA reprinted version of De Furtivis Literarum Notis by Giovanni Battista della Porta\nThis is the scanned text of the actual book published circa 1563 now reprinted on antiqued paper and bound in goat hide. It is a book about cryptography and is mentioned in the H.P. Lovecraft story \"Dunwich Horror\". Approximately 256 pages long, it will be printed on thinner paper than the Spell Book, but the paper will still have deckled edges and will be yellowed as parchment paper. \nAnother great addition to an Lovecraft inspired library.\nDe Furtivis Literarum Notis\nWant them both?\n+$275 - Get BOTH antique reprinted and hand-bound books as a single Add-On!!\nADD-ON INSTRUCTIONS:  To add an add-on to your pledge, follow these steps:   \nPress the 'Manage Your Pledge' Button above.  If you have not pledged yet, it will say 'Back this Project'.\nIncrease your pledge in the 'Pledge Amount' box by the total of the add-ons you want to add.  If you want multiples of the add-ons, just pledge the amount for the total number of add-ons.    \nAfter the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so that you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned.  \nStretch Goal\nStretch Goal UNLOCKED - Stretch Goal $20,000 - Spell Book in Color PDF!  \nI hesitated to do this because I was being a little overprotective of my work, but it is clear backers would get the most use out of the Spell Book if they could also have it as a color pdf so they could print out their own scrolls, separate pages, and other options as props in games or just to have around. So, there you have it.  \nStretch Goal UNLOCKED - Stretch Goal $25,000 - FREE Pinkerton Government Services Official File  \nPinkerton File\nWhat is this file you ask?  \nIn general - This is a custom printed prop folder filled with loose pages analyzing the content of the spell book. It will have the look of a rough document from a fictional government organization with handwritten and typewriter typed commentary (Not a font. I actually bought a manual typewriter for this)  \nFor those getting a book - It will translate all the Latin text, and all the R'lyehian text, while also interpreting a few of the diagram or mystical symbol pages. It will cover 30 of the interior book pages (mostly from the Ancient section). There will still be a few untranslated pages in the book in other languages, but the Latin and R'lyehian will all be translated.  \nFor those getting a game and not the book - Each of these pages in the file can be used as a prop in a game to reference a book, even if you don't have the book physically on hand, and make a great addition to either a Table Top or LARP scenario.\nStretch Goal UNLOCKED $30,000 - More Pages to the Pinkerton File!  \nThe Pinkerton Sketch Files and a 200+ word dictionary of R'lyehian!\nThe game rule book already contains all of the Pinkerton Sketch files, but many of them are 1/4 page size. We will reprint them here as full size individual pages. Example  \nNightmare at Dawn\nHowever, since that is not new content, merely higher quality content, we will also be adding a printed 200+ word R'lyehian ancient language dictionary in a short academic paper as well.  \nR'lyehian (or Cthuvian) is the language used in this famous quote \"ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.\" which translates into \u201cIn his house at R\u2019lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\u201d  \nMost R\u2019lyehian (or Cthuvian) dictionaries online have approximately 86 words translated from the language originally created by H.P. Lovecraft. I\u2019ve taken those dictionaries, and expanded them to 200+ words by taking a logical look at the syntax and using that to build new words. For example  \n ep = after  \n hai = now  \nTherefore ephai = Later (literally \"after now\")  \nIf you add agl which = place Then ephaiagl = Future (literally \"place in the after now\")  \nWith this as a guide, I was able to more than double the existing vocabulary without having to create anything wholesale.  \nStretch Goal UNLOCKED $35,000 - Another Antique Book Add-On!\nWe have two antique book add-ons as it stands now, if we hit this goal, we'll add another $150 book to the options, printed on the same style paper and goat hide binding at the first two.  \nFourth Book of the Occult\nBuying all three add-ons would normally be $450, but we'll make the Library in a Box deal $425 only for Kickstarter backers.  \nNOTE: Stretch goals apply only to pledge levels of $45 and higher.  \nWe will continue to add more stretch goals as we unlock the current ones.  \nThe Lovecraft based Spell Book and RPG just got more interesting...  \nTell your friends!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe hand-made books are the most challenging, and take the most time.

It has been written for Call of Cthulhu and will be updated for the 7th edition of the rules. \nBack in 2007 I answered a call from famed Call of Cthulhu\u00ae writer and editor Keith \"Doc\" Herber to submit ideas for his upcoming The Outer Gods scenario book. He had specific ideas about making the book different from other scenario collections, and he had a high bar he wanted each scenario to reach. We worked together on the scenario over the next 1.5 years until his untimely death in 2009, but before that, he approved Sun Spots for inclusion in The Outer Gods. His specific words were: \"I think we have a winner here, and one with a lot of fun possibilities. Nice job...\" I hope this project will do his vision justice.\nRight now, I have written nearly 28,000 words for this scenario, play-tested it multiple times (both with friends and at conventions), and have commissioned art by seasoned Cthulhu veterans Jason Eckhardt, Reuben Dodd, Caleb Cleveland and Chris Huth. I'm also bringing back most of my team from my previous Kickstarter (He Who Laughs Last): Gregory G. Geiger for design and layout, Jake Coolidge for maps, and Cynthia Douglas Chernoff as my editor. \nThe funding for this project will be used for completing maps and art, finishing the design and layout of the books, and having the book edited, produced and delivered into your nice warm hands! I can't wait to show you!\nHere is an amazing illustration from Mr Dodd!\n   Now that we're funded, let's talk about stretch goals. I've thought carefully about them and want to make sure that they add to your game but will not impact the scope of the project. \nHere are the stretch goals we've got planned:\nFUNDED $7500: More Art -- Add four more b/w half-page illustrations by our amazing artist Reuben Dodd.\nFUNDED $8500: GM Kit Part 1 -- Provide Playtest notes illuminating the various lessons learned throughout the years of playtesting this, as well as provide a full transcript of the first playtest from 2008. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above.\nFUNDED $10,000: Red Valley Visitor's Guide -- I will work with Gregory Geiger to incorporate Jake Coolidge's hand-drawn map of Red Valley into a 1920s-style visitor's guide handout. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above, and will be provided as a print copy for the Deluxe level ($70) and above.\nFUNDED $12,000: GM Kit Part 2 -- I'll create 6 pre-generated Call of Cthulhu PCs and put them with the playtest notes. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above.\n$14,000: Headshots -- Reuben Dodd will illustrate 10 b/w headshots for various NPCs to go directly into the book. \n$15,000: Director's Cut -- One really fun and interesting scene that I worked on extensively with Keith Herber, but was cut from the final product, will be added as an addendum, to be used by GMs at will. We'll also have Reuben Dodd add two half-page b/w illustrations to this chapter as well. \n\u201cDave Sokolowski\u2019s Sun Spots harkens back to the classic Call of Cthulhu scenarios that we all love and dials up the danger with a number of intriguing twists including a new take on an old god. Detailed, multi-layered, and engaging, Sun Spots shines with interesting characters, nefarious plots, and ancient evil. Sokolowski has another winner on his hands.\u201d - Stuart Boon, author of the award-winning Call of Cthulhu book Shadows over Scotland\n\"Dave Sokolowski submitted Sun Spots to Keith \u201cDoc\u201d Herber for his planned epic scenario book, The Outer Gods. Doc worked with Dave to tweak, build, and perfect it, and was proud of the final result. Sadly, in a blow to the entire community, Doc passed away suddenly long before the project could be completed. It should be noted that Doc\u2019s vision for The Outer Gods contained the following requirement on the spec sheet, \u201cEvery scenario in this book has to be great.\u201d Those who knew Doc and his considerable work for the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game were aware that nothing got approved unless it was truly excellent work. This was the man behind H. P. Lovecraft's Arkham, H. P. Lovecraft's Dunwich, Keeper's Companion, 1920s Investigator's Companion, Spawn of Azathoth, Trail of Tsathogghua, Fungi from Yuggoth, and New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley to name only a few. Keith \u201cDoc\u201d Herber shaped Call of Cthulhu and made it a truly wonderful game. And if he thought Sun Spots was great, what\u2019s your excuse?\" - Tom Lynch, co-founder of Miskatonic River Press \n\"In presenting a new interpretation of an Outer God, Sun Spots brings an uncaring and elemental influence to bear down on New England, but this is pleasingly manifest in an all too human a fashion\u2014pride, belief, and religious mania that are as much a threat to the investigators as the Daemon Sultan is himself. Sun Spots is a delightfully balmy investigation into the dangers of sun worship.\" - Pookie, Reviews from R'lyeh (the full review is here: http://rlyehreviews.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/shining-for-cthulhu-dark.html)\nWe have the following levels of pledge available:\nThanks ($1): Any amount of pledge (from $1 up) will see your name on our Kickstarter Supporter list. Many thanks indeed!\nDigital ($10): This level receives the Sun Spots PDF from DTRPG, as well as any and all stretch goals! All levels from $10 up will receive the PDF copy.\nSoft-Copy ($30): At this level backers will receive a soft-cover copy POD Sun Spots book, plus the PDF and Thanks.\nDeluxe Hard Copy ($70): This level of backing will receive a hard-backed copy POD Sun Spots book, signed by me, plus the PDF and Thanks. These backers will also receive hard-copies of the three maps and any handouts designed for the scenario (this is what makes it \"deluxe\").\nCharacters ($100): In addition to everything at the Deluxe level, I will create 6 Call of Cthulhu 1920s-era PC sheets to your specifications, and then give you both digital and hard-copies of them.\nEntitled ($120): Get everything at the Deluxe level, then choose from a list of 20 NPCs and locations in the scenario that you can name to your liking (scenario-appropriate, please). People can choose in the order in which they chose this option (e.g. first backer at this level chooses from the list first).\nClose Traveler ($250): I will travel within 100 miles of San Francisco to run the scenario for you and your friends. You'll get the personalized PC sheets, 1 hard copy (for you), and 6 digital books plus handouts (for you and your friends). It will be a good time. I'll bring snacks.\nTraveler ($1300): At this level, I will travel anywhere in the USA or Canada, bring 1 hand-signed hard-back copy of Sun Spots, 6 digital books plus handouts (for you and your friends), and run a game for you and up to 5 of your friends. I'll also bring snacks and my gregarious personality. (You will also receive the Deluxe handouts and PC sheets).  \nAdd-Ons\nDue to popular demand, I will make additional soft-cover POD books available at the $30 pledge level. And if you\u2019ve already purchased one book, I will subsidize part of the shipping. Here is what you can do if you want to add-on a softcover POD book to your existing pledge:\nIf you live in the USA or UK: Add $35 total\nIf you live outside the USA/UK: Add $40 total \nShipping\nFurthermore, for shipping of the physical books, I have tried to strike a balance for both myself and backers. I will subsidize part of the shipping, as well as streamline the shipping rates to avoid confusion. \nUS backers will pay $5, UK backers $10 and other international backers $20 for the soft-back copy reward shipments. Hard-copies will be a bit more for UK, as I have to ship all the boxes to my house first, before shipping them out (except where I meet you in person). I hope this will be a middle ground where shipping doesn't overwhelm the budget but backers don't have to absorb the entire cost.  \nI have play-tested this game multiple times since I completed the first draft back in 2009, and it has been honed and edited down to a very clean and crisp story. What used to be a very wide sandbox game with very few boundaries for the investigators now has clarity and focus. There is still a very strong sandbox feel, but the scenario now has guides and structure to get the players heading in the right direction before letting them go.\nWith this much playtesting, I was forced to pull a couple of scenes that I had worked on with Doc, but ultimately got in the way of the best possible scenario. With enough funding it might be possible to clean up this content and get it back in the book in an Appendix. We might even be able to do some art for it.\nI have run this game at multiple conventions (Dundracon, Celesticon, and Big Bad Con) as well as with local gaming groups. I believe it is finally ready for you.\nThis scenario has been around a long time and I really want to get it into your hands, to finally realize Doc's vision, but I need help with funding to get it over the finish line. I want the book to look and feel like the Cthulhu gaming books of the 1980-90s, specifically in the vein of Escape from Innsmouth, which Kevin Ross and Doc created with a host of talented artists and writers. Most importantly, I want this book to be something Doc would love.\nI need funding now to finish the book. To finish the art and maps, to get professional design and layout, and then have it edited so it all comes together in one amazing package. If you pledge now, then we can make it happen together. \nFinally, while the Kickstarter project is live, He Who Laughs Last in all formats, as well as the GM Kit and Short Fiction, will be on sale with 33% off on DTRPG here. \nCall of Cthulhu\u2122 is a trademark of Chaosium Inc and is used under licence.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe scenario has been written and playtested multiple times. Multiple art pieces are complete and more are in progress. This leaves design, layout, editing and production.\n\nThe biggest risks have to do with people and life. Right now, the team is working hard at the project and the book is scheduled to be delivered well on time. I spent many years as a professional project manager, and I have the skills and understanding to keep a project on track. \n\nThe key to any good project is communication. Expect at least monthly updates from me, and I will strive to be transparent in all aspects of my business dealings with my backers. Things may and do happen that can sidetrack a project. But with transparency and accountability we'll still get the book in your hands in the best possible manner.\n\nPlease refer to my previous project He Who Laughs Last if you want to see my communication style first-hand.

We've incorporated years of play experience. We are also able to redesign the visual look and feel of the book with new illustrations and designs.\n\nAlso, for the first time, the book contains Unnamable, a new Lovecraftian-style roleplaying system designed by John Wick along with conversion notes for each adventure. I designed Unnamable because I wanted a Lovecraftian system that better fit my own GM style. While I am a life-long fan of the Call of Cthulhu game, Unnamable is a more narrative system, focusing on the choices and sacrifices characters make in Lovecraftian fiction.\nWhy the Yellow Sign?\nWhile most Lovecraftian games and adventures focus on the pulp style of story (looking for clues, solving puzzles, deciphering old books), Curse of the Yellow Sign focuses on something different. I love the kind of \"weird tale\" that inspired Lovecraft in the first place and I wanted to write adventures that were like them. Stories meant to make the reader feel a sense of dread and unease. Presenting a mad world that seemed out to get them. There are no clues to uncover, no puzzles to solve. Just the horror of a universe that looks down upon them... and laughs.\nThe concept of a book that drives the reader mad started with The King in Yellow. The blasphemous, cursed play that caused riots and murders, that was banned in France after a single performance. I loved the concept of an idea that could kill. An idea passed on from one mind to the other. And with that concept, I ironed out the trilogy of adventures that makes up Curse of the Yellow Sign.\nAct I: Digging for a Dead God\nIn May of 1939, somewhere in the jungles of Africa, a small band of soldiers have stumbled across something ancient. Something terrible.\nAnd they are about to suffer the consequences.\nIn Act I, the players take the roles of soldiers during World War II in Africa. They unlock, and thus, unleash a dangerous idea that takes the form of a German folk tale and slowly drives the soldiers mad.\nDigging for a Dead God contains:\n1 map\n6 pre-generated characters\nTons of advice and playtest notes\nAct II: Calling the King\nAt the turn of the century\nIn an abandoned hotel\nIn the dead darkness of winter\nSix actors sit to read a cursed play\nIn Act II, a famous theater and movie director puts together a cast for the reading of The King in Yellow. He has an ulterior motive... but then again, so does the play.\nCalling the King contains:\n6 pre-generated and illustrated characters\nExcerpts from Act 1 of The King in Yellow\nTheories on the ever-mercurial, seemingly shapeshifting play\nTons of advice and playtest notes\nMap of the hotel\nAct III: Archimedes VII\nArchimedes 7 is a colony ship traveling form our solar system to a distant world. A small piece of tin protecting its inhabitants from the dangers of the void.\nBut the real danger is already inside the ship.\nWe've been to the past, to the present, and now we reach the future where the horrors that have been unlocked finally reach out to the stars.\nArchimedes 7 contains:\na map of the ship\n6 pre-generated characters\nTons of advice and playtest notes\nWant to See the Adventures?\nYou can!\nJohn Wick Presents published all three Acts previously.

It's a game of unspeakable Lovecraftian horror, kind of a Call of Cthulhu-heartbreaker.\nSince it was first published in Wicked Words Magazine, it's undergone a few changes (some thanks to podcaster/game designer Rob Justice). You'll see those updates and changes in Curse of the Yellow Sign. \nIn the game, your character sheet has two sides: a Sanity side and a Madness side. In order to deal with the eldritch horrors of the world, you trade traits from the Sanity side of your character sheet for the benefits of the Madness side.\nIf you'd like to see the original version of Unnamable (before the updates), go ahead and click here.

Just like a Lovecraftian narrator, we will slowly discover the truth behind the cursed pages. And as our progress grows, the dreaded horror will follow.\nFragments will be from different sources. Some will be in English, others in French, and a few... there's no telling where they came from. Mysteries abound.\nWhen collected together, we may get a glimpse of the vision that burned down a theater in Paris and caused the play to be banned in so many countries. We may piece together the truth behind the madness. We may complete something awful.\nAll pages will be written by John Wick and designed by Jessica Kauspedas (World of Dew, Blood & Honor, Wicked Fantasy, Play Dirty). Although, depending on how things go, we may get some guests involved\u2026 secret knowledge comes from strange sources.\nWe will release the Fragments as PDFs for all $10+ backers. If you\u2019re part of the project, you\u2019ll be exposed to the whole damned thing.\nThe Fragments\nUNLOCKED! The First Fragment ($3,177) - The Castaigne Fragment\nBurned pages from the 1895 Paris production reveal a story about a decadent court facing the end of the world, a collection of unnamed nobles flirting with the darkness. Is this the opening act? Scholars disagree on whether this addition is authentic or made by a clumsy con artist.\nUNLOCKED! The Second Fragment ($4,345) - The Castro Street Production\nIn 1972, an experimental San Francisco theater known for risque and difficult works attempted a production of the play. Pages discovered within the walls of the abandoned theater years later speak of a figure named Touissant who warns the court of an impending threat. What drew these Castro Street activists to these pages?\nUNLOCKED! The Third Fragment ($5,444) - The Unfilmable Pilot (by Rob Justice)\nIn the late 1980's, a major premium cable channel decided it wanted to expand it's lineup of original content with a horror anthology television series. One of the treatments was found so offensive that the executives ordered the script burned. What happened after that first commercial break? And whatever happened it the script's writer, Jack Scott?\nUNLOCKED! The Fourth Fragment ($6,525) - The Gintong Alay Project (by Tobie Abad)\nIn 1981, a tiny high school in the Philippines somehow got a hold of the play and attempted to localize it for a class production. Calling it Gintong Alay (Golden Offering), the production never finished its first staging. The subsequent tragedy leading to the gruesome suicides was then blacked out of any media coverage. Remnants of the research conducted by Rolando Gabriel and his documentary team have been found after their subsequent disappearance while investigating the said event.\nUNLOCKED! The Fifth Fragment ($7,662) - The Hollister/Carcosa Text\nMontclair, MN. Feb. 22, 1968: When investigators arrested Ralph Hollister under suspicion of a number of killings, they found a hidden room under his home. The word \"Carcosa\" was written on the door leading to the room and the tiny chamber was a place of absolute horror. Among the items recovered were thousands of pages in a barely legible scrawl. But a few of those pages were different. A different hand-writing, a different voice entirely...\nUNLOCKED! The Sixth Fragment ($8,433) - The Ladero Mass Grave (by Mark Diaz Truman)\nIn 2007, immigration officers find a mass grave on the US/Mexican border. The bodies appear to be both immigrants and members of a prominent drug cartel. Among the documents discovered is journal detailing the journey. Stuck in the middle of the journal are the pages of the play. What happened here? And why is a Mexican national carrying the pages of the play, buried alongside dozens of other bodies on the Mexican border?\nUNLOCKED! The Seventh Fragment ($9,238) - The Jacques Ferrand Fragment \nPages found in physician Jacques Ferrand's own personal journal in which he was compelled to record a patient's \"poetry\". The patient's identity is unclear but experts suspect her to be a young and immature Charlotte-Marie de Lorraine. The cast of characters is revealed through the young patient's madness, and the erotic tone is undeniably disturbing.\nUNLOCKED! The Eighth Fragment ($10, 253) - The Kaifeck Papers (by Benjamin Woerner)\nKaifeck, Germany: On the evening of Friday, March 31st, 1922 the six inhabitants of the Hinterkaifeck Farm, roughly 70km north of Munich, in Southern Germany, were murdered with a mattock. The farmer, Andreas Gruber, his wife Claudia, their widowed daughter Victoria, her two children Josef, Cazilia, and the maid Maria Baumgartner were all killed in the barn in a gruesome manner.\nIt wasn\u2019t until they discovered a series of pages from a play written in a stranger\u2019s hand, letters written by Victoria\u2019s husband, killed in the trenches of France after his supposed death, and a series of drawings in the childrens\u2019 room and in the barn that the true horror of Hinterkaifeck began to reveal itself.\nUNLOCKED! The Ninth Fragment ($11, 444) - Fallon's Ballet\nSergei Fallon's ballet, A Stranger in Carcosa, made its way to the stage despite many tragic setbacks. The production never made it to the stage but his notes reveal much about both the cursed play and his troubles.\nUNLOCKED! The Tenth Fragment ($12, 532) - A True and Accurate Account & Fragments of the King Paperback!\nIn 1544, Abraham Trask published his book, A True and Accurate Account of the Cursed Play, wherein the Author Views The Visitor to Carcosa and Those Whom Lay Claim of Witchcraft. While all copies of the book seemed destroyed when James I took the Crown of England, a few pages escaped the fire. These pages demonstrate the existence of a play strangely similar to The King in Yellow suggesting it pre-dates the presumed author.\nAlso...\nIf we hit this stretch goal, we unlock the Fragments of the King Ad On!

P. Lovecraft. This point-and-click adventure is a faithful and painstakingly researched adaptation of The Case of Charles Dexter Ward \u2014 a perennial favourite among hordes of fans and the only novel Lovecraft wrote in his lifetime \u2014 which happens to be the first of its kind in the video game industry. Join us as we tell you all about this groundbreaking project, the documentary The Shadow Over Providence hosted by S. T. Joshi, the inconceivably amazing rewards, and what may become a full series of officially sanctioned H. P. Lovecraft games. I\u00e4! I\u00e4!\n    The Case of Charles Dexter Ward invites you to explore mystery-laden Providence and uncover its enchanting secrets, research ancient history of witchcraft and occultism in shadow-blighted Salem, and sneak into an eerie Pawtuxet farm to meet unspeakable horrors lurking underneath in one of the most memorable sequences in Lovecraft\u2019s oeuvre. Take the role of both the inquisitive Charles Dexter Ward and Dr. Marinus Willett in a race against time to save Providence (and possibly humankind) from the evil warlock Joseph Curwen, who has made a pact with powerful forces of ineffable cosmic hideousness to exert his abhorrent influence across centuries.\nFrom visits to dusty libraries where awaits the hideous Necronomicon, through excursions to nightmarish cemeteries where time-worn bones tell of horrible past events, to sojourns in the old Salem-Village of crumbling gables and clustered gambrel roofs where wizards of yore still prowl, this is a blood-tingling project bound to stimulate the pineal glands of fans of adventure games and supernatural horror alike.\nAdventure games are the ideal medium to tell Lovecraft\u2019s stories. If you think about it, his protagonists rarely encounter their horrors \u2014 and whenever they do, the consequences are devastating \u2014 yet there are countless so-called Lovecraftian games where you must pit your strength against amorphous creatures or the mandatory slimy tentacles. And nothing wrong with that, but we\u2019re looking to do things differently this time: in Charles Dexter Ward there are no weapons, no enemies, no jumping, no running, and no dying. If you believe it\u2019s impossible to make a scary horror game without those features, then we encourage you to ask people who have played Scratches about the infamous boiler scene and why they\u2019re still clamouring for Agust\u00edn\u2019s head.\nIn Charles Dexter Ward we\u2019re going to focus strictly on story and mood. That is what we love about adventure games and Lovecraft, and we have no intention to compromise his powerful, brooding narrative for the sake of cheap scares. It feels like only yesterday that we first read the novel, and even brief passages such as the oneiric sunrises in Prospect Terrace will be forever embedded in our minds. Lovecraft\u2019s skilful pen transported us to a bygone time of witchcraft and unguessed horrors, magically interweaving historical facts and fiction, and we at Senscape are ready to do justice to this classic work.\nSpoiler alert: there are no tentacles in this game. None.\nFollowing repeated readings of the story over the past year, we have absorbed its mood, analysed its structure, and taken copious notes. Every aspect of the novel has been exhaustively researched, and we have the assistance and expertise of S. T. Joshi to ensure we get historical facts straight and bring Lovecraft\u2019s vision to video games as faithfully as possible. We even meticulously considered Lovecraft\u2019s entire output of fiction to understand how Charles Dexter Ward fits into that chronology and how certain aspects of his popular cosmology evolved over time. The game is already fully designed, and we know for a fact that you\u2019re going to love it. The best way to describe it is as the long-lost classic horror game by LucasArts.\nIt took years to bring this project to you \u2014 the realisation of a dream \u2014 and today we invite you to be part of it.\nCoupled with this Kickstarter is an ambitious production that is both a behind-the-scenes feature on the making of Charles Dexter Ward and a documentary on Lovecraft\u2019s life in Providence. Acclaimed scholar S. T. Joshi will be joining Agust\u00edn Cordes as they travel to Providence and scout the remaining locations that were key in Lovecraft\u2019s lifetime, including the John Hay Library, Moses Brown School, the \u201cactual\u201d home of the Ward family, and the queer building that inspired Curwen\u2019s old house in Olney Court. Time will stand still as we retrace Lovecraft\u2019s footsteps around his beloved home town and find the places and moments that inspired Charles Dexter Ward, with Mr. Joshi guiding us through the journey, revealing details about the fascinating persona of our favourite writer. Just as we intend to deliver the ultimate adaptation of his inimitable work, our plans for this rigorous and informative documentary are sure to satisfy even the most passionate Lovecraft aficionado.\nAnd you can join us too on this journey to uncover the immemorial secrets of Providence! Our top tier \u2014 Cthulhu \u2014 is your ticket to an unforgettable weekend with Mr. Joshi and Senscape while we film portions of this documentary. Of course, this project is not just about Lovecraft but you as well! Thus, all the travellers who embrace the repellent gelatinous mass of Cthulhu will be interviewed in the documentary as part of our efforts to establish why Lovecraft\u2019s work has influenced an illimitable legion of fans. The filming will take place early next year and we\u2019ll make sure to arrange for the date to suit everyone involved.\nDo you get the feeling we\u2019re dedicated enough to bring H. P. Lovecraft\u2019s legacy of unutterable terrors to the masses? Well, hold that thought, because we haven\u2019t even told you about our stretch goals yet!\nWe know you love stretch goals, but we have mixed feelings about them: our main goal is exactly what we need to produce the Charles Dexter Ward game of our dreams \u2014 no less and no more than what is required to fulfil our vision and bring you the ultimate adaptation of an H. P. Lovecraft story. We don\u2019t feel like \u201cartificially enhancing\u201d this vision by adding unneeded content or features to satisfy the tradition of stretch goals.\nBut we can do something else. Because this is already a Kickstarter campaign of Cyclopean (and non-Euclidean) proportions, our stretch goals will be suitably ambitious and bold \u2014 what if we told you we can secure licenses to adapt at least two more Lovecraft stories, provided that we meet the budget? This is the full scale of our dream, and the Kickstarter community has proven that virtually nothing is impossible:\nOur crazy dream.\nSo which other Lovecraft stories do you think would make great games? Can you guess our picks?\nIt\u2019s no secret that we at Senscape love horror. We really do.\nOur games.\nScratches, released in 2006, went on to become a cult title among fans of adventures and remains hailed as one of the best Lovecraftian games, especially when it comes to its haunting conclusion that compelled players to theorise about the multilayered mystery for months. Serena, released to critical acclaim earlier this year and developed together with colleagues and fans, had a similar effect. This short adventure proved a surprise hit on Steam, fascinating countless players with its bittersweet mystery reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s tales. And we\u2019re still working on Asylum, which was successfully Kickstarted last year and is in the final stages of production (we promise, it\u2019s really coming!). Asylum is the spiritual successor to Scratches, a dedicated work of passion that will have taken five long years of our lives and is poised to become a cutting-edge adventure game with its stunning visual effects and atmosphere \u2014 not to mention a disturbing storyline that is Lovecraftian through and through and promises lots of sleepless nights.\nSome of the crazy folks working at Senscape.\nSharp observers may have realised that the body of our work comprises first-person adventures, but the truth is we love all kinds [Edit by Agust\u00edn: except Myst]. We believe the third-person perspective is ideal for Charles Dexter Ward, which is a more character-driven story than our previous efforts. And it turns out we have plenty of experience with the format, having worked on Federal Cases: Risk Profile, a huge educational adventure created for the government of Argentina and released in 2008. Distributed throughout hundreds of schools and acclaimed by thousands of players, the game remains one of the largest productions in the country\u2019s history.\nRisk Profile, the third-person adventure we developed.\nIf you\u2019re as enthusiastic about H. P. Lovecraft as we are, then you\u2019re probably disappointed in how poorly his writings have been translated to other media. Most movie adaptations leave a lot to be desired, and games have only tangentially assimilated the full cosmic horror of his work. We want to change that, and so devoted are we to his legacy that we have restlessly pursued the rights to officially adapt his stories. This is an opportunity we can\u2019t let pass.\nIn addition, part of our team is concluding work on the graphics for Asylum and is ready to move on to a new project. Many Kickstarted projects tend to outsource their development, but we prefer to work together because that\u2019s the best approach for our games. It\u2019s the teamwork and affinity achieved in a daily office setting that allows us to bring a unique quality to our projects and fulfil our vision. However, guaranteeing the continuity of a stable team across projects is one of the most critical problems in the game industry, especially when the games being made are rich in content and length. Thus, it makes a great deal of sense for us at Senscape to overlap the production of two games and avoid letting part of our talented team go. The budget we requested in last year\u2019s campaign was strictly meant to complete Asylum, so there would be no point in maintaining artists on staff if we couldn\u2019t start work on a new game. Unfortunately we need money for that, which is why we\u2019re launching this Kickstarter to secure funds for Charles Dexter Ward.\nIt\u2019s very important to point out that production on this game will start upon successful conclusion of this campaign and won\u2019t be tied to the progress of Asylum. Should we surpass our goal and secure funds for additional H. P. Lovecraft games, then we are ready to expand the Senscape family as needed to keep weaving captivating stories and conjuring debarred visions of creeping nightmares.\nThe sheer awesomeness of our rewards cannot possibly be comprehended by feeble human minds, but we\u2019re going to try and describe them. For our boxed edition of the game, we\u2019re taking the approach that was so well received with the Asylum campaign: with the wonderful Infocom packaging of yesteryear as our inspiration, the box will be the perfect size and shape to feature on your shelf. It will contain physical goodies such as a Moses Brown School ID card with your name on it, a vintage postcard from Providence, and more to be confirmed! This item also includes the abridged version of the Necronomicon, a booklet that\u2019s part art book, part game manual:\nOur Infocom-style box with booklet attached.\nThe hardcover edition of the Necronomicon, though, is another story. This lavishly designed collector\u2019s item is going to be expanded with developer\u2019s notes and even more artwork, and will feature pages of the \u201cactual\u201d Necronomicon as described in Lovecraft\u2019s stories.\nDisclaimer: we\u2019re legally required to state that the Necronomicon is a fictitious book. Seriously.\nAnd there\u2019s so much more! A lovely T-shirt, a soundtrack reminiscent of vintage Hammer horror movies, a Blu-ray edition of the documentary The Shadow Over Providence, and what proved to be a very popular reward with the Asylum campaign: in-game presence! Become a renowned citizen of Providence, a student in Moses Brown School, a book author in John Hay Library, or a nefarious wizard or witch in Salem-Village.

P. Lovecraft\u2019s The Case of Charles Dexter Ward and (who knows!) maybe even more adaptations. We love hearing from you, so make sure to follow us on your social network of choice. We also invite you to join our ever-growing community of adventure game and horror fans in our forums.\nWe would like to extend our thanks for the invaluable assistance of Phoenix Online Studios with the creation of this Kickstarter campaign, especially to Weldon Hathaway who co\u00f6rdinates administrative tasks in the United States. Huge thanks as well to Simo Sakari Aaltonen for his masterful revision of all texts related to this campaign, Eriq Chang for his remarkable take on the game logo, Alessandra Bertoldi for her formidable Latin expertise, Serena Nelson for being awesome and charming as usual, Melissa Kell for filming Mr. Joshi in Seattle, Hern\u00e1n S\u00e1ez for the careful production of our main video, Daniel Vierna for further proofreading, and Alina Graziani for coping with Agust\u00edn\u2019s insanity.\nAnd of course, thank YOU, our awesome and supportive backers, for being part of our crazy dreams. For you we would ride with the mocking and friendly ghouls on the night-wind, descend to meet the noxious nightmarish terrors crawling in the catacombs of Nephren-Ka, surrender to the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth\u2019s will, and lose our minds in the nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity.

Yet game development is not an exact science. No project is immune to risks or delays, as seen with our own Asylum. We are aware of this and have maintained a strong, constant dialogue with our backers. Our updates are unanimously well received because they are informative and fun, and backers understand that we\u2019re putting everything we\u2019ve got into creating games that will be remembered for aeons to come.\n\nWe understand backers may be concerned about the possibility of eventual delays with The Case of Charles Dexter Ward as well; however, these games differ greatly in scope and style. Whereas Asylum is huge and lets the player explore an extremely detailed virtual asylum at leisure in first person, Charles Dexter Ward is a more focused and traditional third-person adventure. They complement each other in style and mood but are strongly linked by H. P. Lovecraft and our past experiences with Scratches and Serena.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of Charles Dexter Ward is to ensure a faithful and strong adaptation of Lovecraft\u2019s beloved work, as well as the unique atmosphere he strove to achieve. We are more than ready to deliver in both regards, as attested by our past and current games, as well as the tremendous assistance and insight provided by S. T. Joshi. Potential delays are always a risk but we have learned a lot; thanks to the extraordinary support we received for Asylum, we are now a larger team working together in a physical office. We are as organised and focused as ever, and with your help we can start a thrilling new chapter for our company.\n\nWhen you support us, you become part of our team \u2014 part of Senscape.

The first book in this series \u201cHorrors of War: A Covenant with Death,\u201d is a sourcebook and scenario anthology set during the Great War, 1914-1918. We are launching this Kickstarter to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War on August 1st, 2014.\nFor the past seven years John H. Crowe and I have been designing and running Call of Cthulhu scenarios set during the Great War. You may have heard some of mine recorded as actual play podcasts over at Role-Playing Public Radio. Now we\u2019re ready to begin releasing, what we expect will be, several Horrors of War volumes focused on the Great War. Later volumes of Horrors of War will focus on other conflicts in other times.\nThis first book, \u201cA Covenant With Death,\u201d will be a generalist book on the Great War and will include 8 scenarios, sourcebook material on the weapons and gear of the Great War, Air-combat rules, rules for creating both professional and citizen soldiers, and a Great War timeline, glossary and an extensive bibliography. All eight scenarios use the 6th Edition rules for Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu role playing game.\nThe book will be produced as an 8.5\" x 11\" softcover, with glossy color exteriors and grisly grayscale interior artwork. Right now the edited material tops out at just about 200,000 words. While the scenarios are written and playt ested, Horrors of War still needs to be laid out, illustrated, proofed and printed. The money we raise here will go towards commissioning art, paying layout artists, and, finally, printing and shipping the book to our backers.\nOur intention is to release \u201cHorrors of War: A Covenant with Death\u201d by February of 2015. In the interim, we will be releasing, exclusively to our backers, a PDF sneak peak of \u201cHorrors of War\u201d in the form of \u201cDeath From Above.\u201d This fully illustrated and laid out PDF document will include a scenario set aboard a zeppelin, another scenario set aboard a bi-wing bomber, air combat rules and aircraft templates. \u201cDeath from Above\u201d will be made available to our backers by December 24, 2014, just in time for the Centennial of the 1914 Christmas Truce on the Western Front.\nWe\u2019ve tried to ensure that the players can represent every nationality involved in the Great War. We have scenarios where they can play British, Belgian, French, German, Russian, American, Italian, Austro-Hungarian, Czechoslovak, Portuguese and Serbian characters, with Romanian, Bulgarian and Turkish options in the works. Most of those will be represented in the first book, \u201cA Covenant with Death.\u201d\nCheck out our rewards and our stretch goals. And keep checking back. There may be additions made over time.\nAs mentioned earlier, you can check out the Great War Call of Cthulhu games I recorded with the folks from Role Playing Public Radio at the following URLs. Click here for \"Dig to Victory.\" Click here for \"Uboote Heraus part 1\" and here for \"Uboote Heraus part 2.\" Here for \"The Night Mission.\" Here for \"Shadows of Leuven.\" Here for \"The Iron Devil.\" And here for \"The Lord of the Peaks.\" Not all these scenarios will appear in \u201cA Covenant with Death,\u201d but feel free to chime in and let us know which ones you\u2019d most like to see. And do keep in mind that these are playtests. The final products may be quite different.\nWe also have three stretch goals!\nRight now we have three stretch goals\n$18,000.00:Every print copy of the books gets a two-page, fold-out diagram of the L-58 Zeppelin for the scenario \u201cThe Last Flight of the L-58.\u201d\nThis first goal has been met! The final product will include the fold-out diagram of the L-58 zeppelin!

That's two complete scenarios free to everyone who bought in at least at the $20.00 PDF edition level.\nThis second goal has been met! Everyone who pledged at least at the $20.00 PDF edition level will receive sneak previews of two scenarios that will appear in future volumes of Horrors of War.\n$32,000.00:The second volume of Horrors of War for FREE! If we reach $32,000, then everyone who pledged at the softcover print edition level ($45.00 for domestic backers and $60.00 for foreign backers) will receive the print edition of the second volume of Horrors of War for free, including shipping.

You'll get your PDF edition of the second volume of Horrors of War for free too.\nI can\u2019t give an exact release date at this time, but if we raise $32K then we should be able to get it out before the end of 2015.\nThank you again, and I look forward to delivering to you \u201cHorrors of War: A Covenant With Death,\u201d the first installment of our Horrors of War series.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs far as risks go, there aren't many.

We've melded the best features we loved from these games and added our own ideas to create a unique but familiar experience.\nEpic Story, Deep Mythos & New Mysterious World \u2013 The epic story of Graywalkers spans more than 2000 years of background history, providing a deep and rich world, flavored with new takes on old legends, and mysteries waiting to be discovered.\nEmergent Gameplay \u2013 We wanted to create a game where the player's decisions and actions have the ability to change and affect the world in profound ways.\nCommunity Interaction \u2013 One of the reasons for us being here on Kickstarter is to build a community behind this game. We want them to be a part of the development of this game as much as is reasonably possible. Part of this is our Crowd Content initiative where we will be willing to accept Content for the game as donations such as 3D models, animation, 2D art, Music, Sound, Effects and others.\nPre-Alpha Prototype V1 Real Time Movement Screenshot\nAnother team of Graywalkers\nGame Type \u2013 It is a 3D 3rd person role-playing game with strategic and tactical elements. You can toggle between Isometric and Perspective views.\nGame Modes \u2013 There are 2 Game Modes; Campaign is the single-player epic storyline, Freeform is a single player experience where everything is procedurally generated and your measure for success is affected by influence, resources and power. \nDistribution \u2013 We are planning on distributing on as many digital platforms as we can get on, including Steam, and hopefully GOG, Desura and others. Steam Keys will be available.\nCurrent State \u2013 The game is in the Pre-Alpha stage and we currently have a combat demo. If successful, we aim to release the game in 18 months. We do plan to release an early access version when we have a solid playable full alpha version.\nLanguages -  The base game will be in English but will also be localized to Russian, German, French, Spanish, Japanese and Chinese. This localization does not include voice overs.\nPlatforms - The game will be created primarily for the PC (Windows, Mac and Linux). Additional platforms may be added depending on stretch goals. Potential platforms where we will port the game are PS4, PS Vita, XBox One, Wii U, Ouya and High-end Tablets (iOS & Android)\nBuilt Primarily for PC (WIndows, Mac, LInux)\n  Pre-Alpha Prototype Real Time Movement Screenshot\n STRETCH GOALS\nThe game will have an expansive list of exciting features:\nWIP 3D Model Sample to be used in the actual game\n  Custom Hero \u2013 Your player character is a special one, even among Graywalkers. He is your fully customizable avatar in the world, where you can choose his or her gender, race, appearance, path, skills and special abilities. Lastly, you choose how he will save the world.\nRaces \u2013 You can be Human or one of the Hybrids, like the Cambion, Nephilim, Dhampir. Additional possible races are the Wolfkin, Faechilde and the Hunterborne\nRecruitment \u2013 Find, convince and recruit your Graywalker team members from a pool of at least 40+ playable NPCs, each with their own style, personality, motivation, relationships and history.\nLevels & Experience \u2013 Gain experience points through missions and improve your characters skills and abilities each time you level up.\nStrategic Management \u2013 Manage your resources, personnel, influence, technology, research, crafting and scavenging. \nExploration \u2013 Explore a country sized island with different regions, each filled with interesting locations to visit, scavenge in, influence and control.\nResources \u2013 Scavenge for resources, rebuild lost technology, recover ancient relics of power, and research entirely new technologies that fuse the powers of ancient magic and known science.\nCharacter Paths \u2013 \"Paths\" are the equivalent to classes in typical RPGs. Choose a path to take such as the magic-wielding Arcanist, the weapon master Armsmen, the stealthy Agents, the spiritually blessed Diviners, the firearms expert Soldiers, the hand-to-hand specialist Martialist, the perceptive Scouts, the versatile Adventurers, the intelligent Techs, and the dangerous Slayers.\nEnemies \u2013 Encounter many kinds of enemies such as zealot cultists, rival gangs, dangerous criminals, demons, fallen angels, feral vampires, rabid werewolves, zombies, ghosts, witches and other supernatural creatures of legend.\nCombat Choices \u2013 When in combat, you can choose the quick and easy Strategic Combat or the down and dirty Turn-based Tactical Combat.\nStrategic Combat \u2013 Resolve combat quickly and automatically especially when fighting enemies you know you can overwhelm.\nTactical Combat \u2013 Control up to 6 characters per team, and have multiple teams working in concert to execute tactical maneuvers against many or more powerful foes.\nSpecial Abilities \u2013 Each character has a list of special abilities which are dependent on his Race, Path and Style.\nIn addition to the core features, there are several features which may make the game stand out\nWyldekarde RPG System \u2013 The game will utilize a simpler version of the upcoming generic table top rpg system.\nEmergent Gameplay \u2013 What you do and don\u2019t do will affect the world and have consequences which will change it as well. This is common in strategy games but is rare among tactical turn-based games.\nProcedural World \u2013 The game will rely on procedural content for the Campaign but most heavily in the Freeform mode of play.\nCrowd Content \u2013 This initiative will allow people to share their talents to the game by contributing content such as 3d Models, 2d Art, music, sound effects, animations and others. \nThere will be a special rewards structure for crowd content which we will reveal more after the campaign is successful.\nPre-Alpha Strategic Map \"Regionscape\"\nRegionscape \u2013 This is the view where many of the strategic decisions are made from. It is an overhead map showing you where you and your teams are on the map. From here, you can control where your teams go, manage time movement, view strategic information and sometimes even see enemy movement.\nAreascape \u2013 This is the 3d map where your characters can move in real time either individually or as a group. \nStrategic Management \u2013 When not fighting, you need to coordinate your teams, gather and manage resources, negotiate with the various factions, and spread your influence. Ultimately, you need to gather enough forces to drive the demonic invaders out of the land. But how you do that is up to you. For example: Do you side with the disreputable crime lords of Lost Vegas? Or the well-equipped but bigoted human supremacists?\nFactions \u2013 Like in a 4x Strategy Game, each faction in Graywalkers has its own agenda to pursue, with or without the player\u2019s help. They decide on their own, and depending on the circumstances, may engage in war against each other. You will find the faction\u2019s territorial lines moving back and forth, as each wrestles for control of valuable commodities. How you interact with them will determine your Influence Factor with these factions.\nMissions \u2013 There are many kinds of missions to engage in. Some will push the story forward, some will convince recruits to join you, some will improve your relationship with a faction.\nStrategic Combat \u2013 Resolve combat quickly and automatically especially when fighting enemies you know you can overwhelm.\nPre-Alpha Strategic Map with Astral Rain ongoing\nCombatscape \u2013 The combat map or what we call Combatscape uses a square grid 3d map which you can rotate freely to see all sides of the action. This map looks similar to the Areascape except that movement is limited to the grid and by turns. \nTactical Combat \u2013 Control up to 6 characters per team, and have multiple teams working in concert to execute tactical maneuvers against many or more powerful foes.\nAction Points \u2013 The combat system uses Action Points. A character can perform several actions in one turn, as long as he has enough Action Points to spend. This is in contrast with other tactics games that allow a character to perform only one move action and one attack action per turn. This grants a greater depth of tactics, allowing the player to perform more elaborate and concerted attacks on the enemy. \nPersonalities \u2013 Character personalities play a big role in combat and may influence how they interpret your commands. Discover who works best with who because some Graywalkers don't see eye-to-eye with each other. If characters in your team hate each other, make sure to keep them separated when fighting or you may just find one of them hitting your teammate \"by accident\"!\nMusic and sound is one of the most important things in a game. We've been lucky enough that we've partnered up with a great sound studio called Otherworld Agency based out of Australia.

They came to be known as Graywalkers, and you are to be the greatest of them. \nMost of the previous Graywalkers were gone. The apocalypse came to pass and the whole human race is at the brink of extinction. It is up to you now to forge a new generation of Graywalkers and turn the tides of the war against the evil that has taken root in the world.\n There are many dangers and enemies on Purgatory that you may encounter such as Demons, Devils, Rogue Angels, Rabid Werewolves, Feral Vampires, Zombies, Gangers, Mobsters, Cultists, Bandits, Mercenaries, Monsters and more. \nOrcus\nPurgatory was forged during the cataclysmic event called the Rupture. It merged parts of Heaven and Hell with our world. The result is, the locations where these parts appeared mystically displaced what was there before to different corners of the world. Many of these displaced lands were \u201ccaught\u201d by the area known as the Bermuda Triangle and this new land mass was formed. \n20 Years later, Purgatory and its people have survived and thrived. They have been protected from most of what happened to the rest of the world and were hidden by the same energies that protected the Triangle the way it always has. Unfortunately, Purgatory has finally been discovered and denizens of Hell are slowly moving into it. \nThe status quo on Purgatory is slowly changing and you will now decide the course of what will happen for its future. This place is where your adventures and legend begins.\n Though there are many locations on Purgatory to visit and discover, there are several key locations that every neophyte Graywalker should know.\n With the Rupture, mystical energies flooded back into earth bringing back magic in all its glory.

Though we did decently during that time, we still didn't make our target. Since then, many things have happened and our reason for being here has slightly changed. \nWe're currently on Kickstarter for several reasons: \nThe first is we want to build a community and following that will allow us to know what they want exactly in what we are building for them.\nNext is though we're currently funding development of our game, we know we need more funds to get this done quickly while maintaining quality. Because of this, we are in talks with several investors and the amount that they will put in will be dependent on how much support we get from the fans to prove how viable this project is. The more money we make here on Kickstarter, the stronger our position in getting more investment funding.  \nThough we are no longer fully dependent on the KS to ensure that the game will be made, the funds will help speed development and allow us to build the game the way we originally planned it. \nYou may also donate more to get more add-ons to supplement your reward tier.

Where every single level is completely randomized and totally unique every game.  A game where you never feel in control without being frustratingly unfair.\nThe crux of horror games is the unknown, never being able to rely on your previous experiences. Welcome to the world of Phantasmal, a procedurally generated game that will feel like a new experience every single time!\n      http://bit.ly/Y6Lbyx\nWe are all old-school gamers, and some of our fondest memories of horror games are the classics like the original Silent Hill and Dead Space games.  The player always had the option of fighting, but they would need to weigh up the consequences of doing so, e.g. would they be badly injured after doing so, or would they deplete too much ammo to be able to survive later encounters?  This balancing act combined with the creepy setting always created a wonderful feeling of dread and tension. \nOne problem with many of our favorite horror games was that we would only experience peak fear the first time we played through.  Subsequent playthroughs would inevitably be far less scary (sometimes not at all) because we would know where the scares would be coming from.  Even during the first playthrough, with many horror games the player would figure out patterns of where the jump-scares would come from, which would also lessen the fear factor.\nWhat we want to do essentially is to balance giving the feeling to the player that they are never in control without making the game unfair. The procedural level generation isn't just a convenient means of generating levels, it is the very backbone of maximizing the fear and dread.\nOur dream is to eventually create a game which is completely unpredictable - where the environment, creatures, items and weapons are randomized, yet at the same time tailored to the player's specific fears so they can never predict what they will be facing every game and every level.\nIt's an ambitious goal, but we have already partially achieved this with our procedurally generated levels built on a component level rather than the traditional room by room template basis.\nThe Binding of Issac (another roguelike game) captures the essence of randomized gaming, and fear through uncertainty - it has been a great source of inspiration for us.\nFor the time being for this kickstarter, our primary objective is to complete the current work-in-progress demo and flesh it out into a full game.\n  Infinite Replayability - Every room and corridor in the building is created from the ground up on a component basis, i.e. the floors, ceilings, walls, stairs, etc. No level will EVER be constructed the same - almost every room and hallway will be COMPLETELY unique.\nInsanity system - fighting the creatures will slowly drive you mad, and you will suffer the effects of your slowly eroding sanity. \nSelf Defense - Defend your life with anything you can find from wooden boards and pipes you rip from the walls. If you're lucky you may find a gun locker, but on each level there will only be one!\nStealth - Fighting is a last resort tactic. Sneak past your enemies as much as you can.  Each action you take will have a consequence and creating too much of a ruckus will wake The Sleeper.\nLight - Make sure you use your light sources wisely - your own torch will sometimes be your greatest liability.\nCharacter Progression - Death is not the end. You will accumulate XP every playthrough which will allow you to grow your character and come back stronger.\nYou play as John Hope, a veteran of the Vietnam War, who suffers from extreme Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). \nDuring one mission you witness a horrific napalm attack on innocent villagers. You try to help them, but it is no use. The sight of women and children burning alive, unable to quench the flames slowly burning the life from their bodies etches itself into your mind. Soon after returning to base you experience a severe emotional breakdown, and you are sent home.\nAfter a time, you finally recover, although you still suffer from severe night terrors and severe relapses of PTSD. You drink, you haven\u2019t been able to keep a steady job, your wife left you and took your kids away. Down on your luck, an old army buddy does you a favor by offering you a job as a night shift janitor at a local university.  You have few skills outside of the military, and you\u2019d rather not be around other people for the time being.\nFor a time, things work out well.  You enjoy your solitude, and simply keeping yourself busy.\nUnfortunately one night at work a storm suddenly sweeps in.  A tree is blown over, severing a power cable, and the university is plunged into darkness.  Ominously you begin to hear voices in the darkness even though you should be the only one at the university. You decide to investigate...\nWe're hoping to infuse a strong Lovecraftian sense of dread to our game. Cthulhu has been and always will be a massive influence!\nAs an indie project, we can't complete this game without you.  We value all your input, and we want to keep you involved throughout the development process.  As such, we will be conducting regular polls and gathering general feedback which will influence the final game.\nIf our first milestone is achieved, then we will aim to complete the game including beta testing before the end of March 2015.

Your choices each become part of the myth, joining your tribe's pantheon of heroes. How will you be remembered by your tribe in generations to come?\nMoon Hunters is a 1-4 player action RPG with a rich, ancient world that's different every time you play. Build your mythology as you play, solo or with friends, every action and choice contributing to your legend.  \n  An ancient, occult world: the gods and their creations yet walk among us, and our prayers do not always go unanswered, for better or for worse. \nLocal co-op like never before: playing alone is fully supported. But if you invite your friends, you won't just be bashing enemies, you'll be creating legends together. \nBuild your mythology: Your actions show if you are more of a Trickster or a Saviour or something else entirely. At the end of your journey worthy heroes become a constellation in the night sky, your deeds recounted for the ages. \nDifferent worlds, persistent myths: Seeing one aspect of the mystery in its entirety only takes a couple of hours, but to truly understand what's happened, you'll need to play a few times. Meanwhile, each time you play, the constellation of your character's legend carries over, as part of your tribe's developing pantheon.\nYou could describe the game as \u201cLegend of Zelda meets Castle Crashers\u201d, or maybe \u201cKing of Dragon Pass meets Gauntlet\u201d. We empower players to experiment with their personality through the reputation and tribe-management, while combat challenges punctuate the journey as chances to prove their skill.\nWe already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC and Mac, due to our previous success with Shattered Planet. A DRM-free version will be available on the Humble Store. We're hoping to release Moon Hunters in Summer 2015. If you want to be notified of Moon Hunters updates and development progress, sign up here!\nIf you're a little confused, you can also try out Dungeons of Fayte, by Brent Ellison and our designer Tanya Short, available for free download. It has the co-op action RPG and town-management components. We're taking the Dungeons of Fayte design as a base, adding mythology/reputation and a randomised world as icing on top, like a delicious RPG cake!\n More stretch goals will be revealed as the campaign progresses!\nEach \"journey\" takes only a couple of hours, allowing you to explore one small aspect of the story. Upon completing each journey, if you're worth remembering, your hero will be remembered as a constellation in the night sky, symbolising their contribution to the world's history.\nAlong your journey, your decisions show your personality and create your reputation. Donating blood to a dying stranger shows you are Selfless. Flirting shamelessly with everyone demonstrates you are Flirtatious. And so on -- we will support over 50 different personality traits in the final game, each of which has its own effect on the world around you.\nIn the real world, as in Moon Hunters, legends are rarely about merely defeating villains. More often, folktales are the story of the Clever hero that tricked the gods into giving humans fire. Of the Loyal hero that ventured into the underworld to save a loved one's soul. Of the Brave hero that declined a god's advances, and suffered for impertinence.  \nYour choices determine how you are remembered, and what you embody to those who hear your story in ages hence. The reason why you do something can be as important as the act itself.   \nIn the world of Moon Hunters, the holy Moon is the source of all life and good, worshipped by every tribe as the central goddess of the pantheon. When the Moon does not rise one evening, heroes across the land take up the search, hoping to uncover the truth before the evil Sun's power grows too strong.\nThe world of Moon Hunters is randomly generated every time you play, but there are certain key elements of the setting and lore that are constant.\nFor example, while the individual members and conflicts of the Dustfolk village will be different depending on your generated world, the Dustfolk will always be the tribe of the sands. Learning their general beliefs and customs will give you an advantage in negotiations.\nThere are three major biomes (desert, mountains, and forests), and one minor (cave systems), each with their own local tribes:\nThe Dustfolk tribe keeps turkeys and camels when prosperous. The deserts are unforgiving, but the Seeker's Blood magic mastery helps the tribe find life-giving water.\nThe High Tribes live in wind-blown canyon country, looking down on the rest of creation from their high vantage point. The mountains are desolate but rich in minerals.\nThe Wolf Clan is the most secretive of all tribes, closely guarding their knowledge of Wild magic, so as not to lose the trust of the creatures they ally with.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Celestin are nomadic traders, following the rivers from source to mouth and back again in annual patterns. They are said to have over a thousand rituals to govern their decision-making, but most are invisible to outsiders.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Reefwalkers follow the Moon's tides and bring a wide variety of ingredients and goods to trade from their distant island homes.\nCalled the First People by some, the Silkhood are the only non-humans in the world of Moon Hunters. Although they welcome visitors, their customs and hierarchies are nearly incomprehensible at first.\n All player character classes wield all of the elements, but start with an affinity. You can customise your character's name and colour palette from the start. As you play you'll discover new special attacks to choose between.\nThe Witch trains under the Dustfolk Seeker in the ways of Blood magic. Blood is the element of life and death. When the world was created, the blood of the Goddess flowed to form the rivers and oceans.\nThe Witch has a basic melee attack and a high-damage ranged attack, making her useful in just about any situation.\nThe Spellblade learns the art of Bronze magic from a High Tribes expert smith. Bronze magic allows the shaping of metals, following the rhythm and grace of war as technologies develop. When the world was created, the bones of the Goddess broke to form the mountains and metals.\nIn combat, the Spellblade is a fierce melee fighter and has the highest endurance.\nThe Occultist's connection to Shadow magic allows her to bend the fabric of space and time to suit her whim. Somewhere between math and poetry lies the truth of the human condition. When the world was created, the Goddess's hair draped over the world, darkening the night sky.\nThe Occultist is a long-range, quick fighter with the most control over enemy positioning and movement.\nThe Druid is the prodigal child of the Wolf Clan, who closely guard all secrets of Wild magic. Wild magic is the primal knowledge from before fairness and language, back to the laws of instinct. When the world was created, the Goddess told stories and from her words, all of its wild creatures sprang forth.\nDruids are the most flexible fighters, sometimes even shape-shifting to meet the unique demands of each encounter.\nStretch goal unlocked! As an initiated priestess of the Moon, the Songweaver understands each of the elements, bringing together Wild harmonies, Blood rhythms, Dark dissonance, and Bronze strength. When the world was created, we invented music to remember and mourn.\nThe Songweaver is a complex support class. It is not technically impossible to play as her alone, but without a friend, you're in for a challenge.\nAs for non-player-characters, Teller Roa is the most widely-respected priestess of the Moon. It is she who decides whether your journey's tale is worth keeping for future generations, and what role you play in the legends of our time. Moon worship is a largely oral tradition, depending on the telling of stories to keep its ancient knowledge alive.\nMeanwhile, self-appointed \"King\" Mardokh believes he has seen a greater Truth than the Moon has to offer, and his fine writings have caused chaos in nearby territories. \nThe music is nearly as important to us as the art style, and luckily, we have some unique talent lined up. The soundtrack will be an all-original collaboration by Ryan Roth and Halina Heron, combining orchestral compositions with delicate vocals and a wide variety of percussion.\nThe trailer offers a sneak preview of the main theme song, \"G U I L T Y M O O N\": \n If the embedded track above doesn't work, or you want a more permanent bookmark for continuous repetition, here's a Soundcloud link!\nIn our latest update, we also included two more track previews.

So we decided we would create our own, paying homage to some of our favorite titles while innovating and adding some of our own spinto the genre.\nFor the past year we have primarily focused on designing and delivering an engrossing PC version of Fallen: A2P Protocol. \nWith your help and support, we will not only accomplish that goal, but through stretch goals we hope to deliver a much larger, much more beautiful, immersive and rich experience, including on other platforms \u2013 Mac, Linux, Tablets, and ultimately on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\nPlease take a look at some screenshots from our Pre-Alpha Prototype...\nFallen: A2P Protocol takes place in the near future in a drastically altered world. Seeking to fuel continuous expansion and quench a thirst for Human mastery over their domain, a new source of energy was required. \nIn 2125, corporate giant GENKORP unveiled A2P, a newly discovered energy source, more powerful than anything previous created by man. While touted as completely safe and environmentally friendly, there were those who foresaw the danger of A2P and opposed its harvest from the beginning. This opposition organized ARKANE, a rebel group bent on stopping GENKORP's plans to develop A2P.\n\nPLAY\n\nGENKORP quickly branded ARKANE as a terrorist faction and an enemy of all good and upstanding citizens of the world. In control of such a powerful life-giving (and taking) source of energy, GENKORP develop into a massive private military complex, holding the key to life on earth as we know it.\nBut very quickly A2P\u2019s dark side manifested itself. Earth\u2019s weather was altered forever, with \u201cnatural\u201d disasters ravaging our planet, reshaping it and turning much of the world into what is now simply known as \u201cThe Dust\u201d.\nFierce endless fighting persists between GENKORP and ARKANE. Meanwhile, those that have not aligned with either faction are branded as bandits and outlaws. Loyal to neither GENKORP or ARKANE, they fight for their survival, etching a difficult existence in \u201cThe Dust\u201d.\nAlready having invested significantly into the creation of Fallen: A2P Protocol, we seek your support to complete the game with all the features, graphics, gameplay and details expected of a high quality self-published title.\nMost importantly, we seek to create a relationship with you, our backers, to help us make key decisions, prioritize some of the features so that we can make a game truly created for and by the fans.\n\nWe are asking only $75,000 (USD) as our initial goal because we have invested our own money and time for a year to design, iterate through concepts, create key art and develop an early alpha stage version of the game. \n\nHowever, with the community\u2019s support we\u2019ll be able to ship the game even sooner and with your involvement the game will get even better.\n\nWhile the initial goal will get us to early access, your support for our stretch goals will fund many advanced features and enable us to deliver the game on additional platforms, fully localized in key languages and offer a much deeper feature set, additional content and enhanced graphics.\n\nWhether through your generous support, your collaborative feedback or through sharing Fallen: A2P Protocol\u2019s Kickstarter campaign with your friends and peers, we are grateful, and cannot do it without you. \n\nWe are committed to a fully collaborative development process, partnering with you to create the most fun to play game, prioritizing those features most important to you. \nWe are not looking to reinvent the genre, but rather to offer players a great, contemporary take, adding a few unique twists to gameplay and presentation to build on the rich lore of amazing games.\nIn the process of development we iterate a lot, change priorities along the way, make important decisions, brainstorming meetings, etc.\nWe will ask you to take part as much as you want in the process of developing the game by providing feedback, getting first early glimpses at features and voting for priorities. Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll do the heavy lifting and make sure we stay on track. But if you would like, you are very much invited to help us craft the game you always wanted to play.\nFallen: A2P Protocol gameplay is both strategic and tactical.\nAs a turn based tactical combat game, Fallen: A2P Protocol has a deep choice of actions that can be performed each turn. Each mission will have different challenges to overcome, and random events will occur that force you to change your tactics if you want to survive.\n\nResources are always scarce, so you must use the environment to your advantage. But the environment can change and be your ally or a deadly, indiscriminate enemy. Quick adaptation to unstable weather may be required, as fluctuations affect gameplay, reduce movement, hamper accurate aiming and even cause damage.\nAmmo will be limited, so use it wisely if you don\u00b4t want to end up throwing rocks and knives at your opponent... unless that\u00b4s the way you choose to play.\nOn the strategic side of the game, you will have to drive and manage your caravan through this devastated world, constantly searching for supplies, upgrade weapons and armor and make other key decisions about how to tackle your next mission.\nKey Features\nWould-be survivors must master strategic planning and employ a wide range of turn-based tactical combat factors, including destructible environments and limited ammunition\nA vast and inhospitable world, complete with hostile weather and vision-impairing day-night cycles, requires careful exploration to recruit allies and gather scarce resources\nCharacter progression and customization, as well as armor and weapon upgrades, showcase player-focused RPG elements and offer a high replay value\nA dark, dystopian lore provides a rich backstory to create a world in which the player\u2019s actions have lasting impact, with the fate of humanity determined by their personal choices and combat capabilities\nWe started crafting the game long time ago and wanted to share with you some early inspirationals...\nWe share with you some of the concept artwork we created for Fallen: A2P Protocol. Much of this we have already translated into in-game content. But we have a ton of additional concepts that, with your support, will create an amazing amount of additional game content. We will also include this artwork in our art book, which is offered as a backer reward.\n\nWe've put a lot of thought into crafting cool rewards for each backer tier, so please take a look and let us know if you like what you see.\nKeep in mind that by adding $10 USD to any tier (starting at $15) you can get an additional digital copy of the game. For example, if you pledge $50 and want two more copies of the game, just throw in an additional $20.\nAlso, if you support us, please share and spread the word through social media and among your friends and fellow gamers. The more backers we can have, the better the game will turn out for all of us.\nWe have big plans for making this game be the best it can be.\nSince this is to be a collaborative project, we\u2019re unveiling the initial stretch goals. As those are reached, we will involve you in determining which of our planned options you most would like to see, and will make those available.\nRed Katana is a small but experienced developer from Argentina.

It is a singular community driven experience unlike any other. Players take the roles of brave Heroes and devious Masters battling it out against each other for Gold and Glory as the world around them evolves and grows. Don't just play the game. Master it! \nGame Master is not just a single tabletop game with a single goal. Tons of unique tables with their own game boards spanning across multiple themes will be available to the players. Each one has numerous goals and ways to achieve them all by using game pieces from the vast Game Master collection. Building your own boards is not just easy and intuitive, but is a core part of the Game Master experience with real gameplay rewards for ingenious game masters.\nAny fan of table-top gaming will tell you that the hardest part of his hobby is organizing a game session. Keeping track of all the dice, miniatures, tons of boxes and stacks of rulebooks. And the hardest of all - getting everyone together at the same time, setting up the table and cleaning up afterwards. All of this has nothing to do with actual gameplay and can consume a lot of your time and money.\nGame Master streamlines this particular aspect of table-top adventures and evolves the whole concept by bringing it into the digital age. Setting up the board of your dreams is just a few taps away. Gather up to 4 friends around a single device or go online and find others to play with. Share your creations with the Game Master community, earn stacks of gold and become the ultimate Game Master!\nGenuine Tabletop feel - all the things you love about tabletop gaming without any of the extra work and expenses.\nCreativity and customization - endless ways to make every experience unique and custom-tailored for the player.\nOnline community - fully gameplay-integrated and lots of social features without disrupting your Facebook, Twitter etc.\nTabletop Multiverse - our gamepieces not only span multiple genres but are all interchangeable and fit together like legos.\nGame Master Toolbox - easy and intuitive to understand but deep enough to allow fully-fledged adventure creation for the truly dedicated.\nTurn based gameplay - action packed combat and puzzle solving in a unified turn-based system.\nEpic pre-built campaigns - tons of replayability, quests and endings for all pre-built adventure sets available for offline play.\nSingle Device Co-op - up to 4 players can go adventuring together on a single device.\nMultiplayer modes - ad-hoc or online, Game Master will let you play with your friends or find new ones easy and stress-free.\nRunic Dice - our unique Runic Dice System will make any dice roll exciting and customizable.\nSmart matchmaking and leaderboards - you will always be able to find other player of the exact skill and experience level that suits you.\nEasy to learn, fun to master! - highly intuitive gameplay for the whole family.\nOne of our proudest features is the Game Master\u2019s toolbox. A lot of games have level editors but not a lot of them are used. We have devised a two-fold solution to this. First of all, our toolbox is intuitive and easy to use. If you\u2019ve ever played with legos, chances are you will feel right at home being a Game Master. Second of all, using the toolbox is directly tied to the core gameplay as all of your creations will earn you more gold and unlock more content!\nAs soon as you start placing tiles simply by dragging and dropping, the world will come alive immediately on your screen. No programming or scripting will be necessary as a lot of tiles have automatic unique effects that can be turned on or off by a simple tap.\nPeople of all ages will be able to use our toolbox without a hitch, but of course those who want to delve deeper will have that opportunity with extra advanced features that will actually let you tell stories and create truly unique content.\nWe know that eternal gratitude is not enough to feed the brave flaming hearts of our heroic backers. Praise the gods, we came prepared with a ton of rewards to those who pledge to our tabletop banner.\nClick on the image to ZOOM!\nMost of the rewards above will be available exclusively to our backers and will not be obtainable after the project is funded.\nWe are especially proud of our forthcoming adventure sets that come in huge digital game boxes each packing a collection of boards interlinked by gameplay and story. Opening an adventure set will get you exclusive miniatures, gamepieces, dice, paints and all kinds of awesome stuff. Everything inside the box can be taken apart and used in any other gameplay sessions as Heroes or Masters.\nStretch the Goals!\n\nClick on the image to ZOOM!\nHow do I play it?\nGame Master caters to a multitude of play styles and difficulty levels while keeping everything interconnected. The two main styles are Hero and Master.\nAs a Hero you can take on an endless supply of quests and visit a variety of magical worlds, distant planets and curious dimensions. Go alone or take your friends and family with you. Up to 4 players can play on a game board at the same time, all on the same device! Gameplay is turn-based and all actions are resolved as they would be in a tabletop game with cards, dice and smart decisions. You earn gold by completing a board. Gold allows you to upgrade your miniatures with skill cards, paintjobs, dice roll modifiers or get new exciting heroes to join your cause. More and more dangerous and rewarding boards become manageable as your party of heroes becomes truly legendary.\nAs a Master you are able to create your own adventures from thousands of different game pieces. And the coolest part about it is - it actually earns you gold! Hapless adventurers who fail to outwit your devious traps are your prey.\nThe rewards for captured heroes are directly tied to how powerful those heroes were. But be careful! After completing your game board, players will be able to rate it. Make it hard, but make it worth it! Popular game boards will make you more gold than any hero can ever imagine. Mix and match all the worlds and game pieces to create your own unique world!\nWhenever you want a challenge or to sit down for a casual play session with your family - the world of Game Master is the place to go. Multiple difficulty levels, Glory and Gold based leaderboards, smart matchmaking and our own pre-built adventures allow everyone to have as much fun as they want. Playing is easy to learn and rewarding to master, while creating your own game boards is as easy as playing with toy blocks but allows for a wealth of creativity and possibilities.\nEndless gameplay opportunities\nGame Master is to tabletop games, what Minecraft was to first-person adventures. We welcome creativity and provide everything to help our players along. Game pieces interact with each other in many ways, making each adventure exciting and fresh for both Players and Masters. You get extra gold for all quest-items that went unused at the end of playing through a game board. Create your own challenges and find creative ways of completing a board using your wits and character abilities and you will be handsomely rewarded.\nTabletop Game Multiverse\nWhat is a Tabletop Game Multiverse exactly?\nImagine a table set up for a game with a bunch of people playing on it. Now imagine there are thousands of tables all having individual games but all in the same virtual room, using game pieces from the same set.You can come up to any of these tables with your own painted miniatures and participate in any adventure! You can build your own tables and invite people over. Whatever you do, everything works and fits together. Some tables host fantasy themed dungeons and quests, others take place inside spaceships or steampunk cities, while a select few host crazy cross-over adventures using pieces from all of the sets. People of all ages and gamer experience are welcome in this virtual room and will find a corner to call home.\nA tabletop game come to life\nOur goal is to recreate the feel of pen and paper adventures and tabletop games as closely as possible while evolving the concept for the new age. Everything in Game Master is like a real table inside a touch screen device of your choice.\nDigital Shadow Box for your Miniatures\nAs a player you collect hero miniatures, skill cards, dice, world tiles, enemy figurines, traps and all the amazing little bits and pieces that make tabletop games fun. Actions are resolved as they would be in a tabletop game with cards, tokens and all kinds of dice.\nThe game is turn-based and allows you to take it in at your own pace, carefully planning your every move. You can even paint your miniatures and game pieces any way you want, making the experience even more unique and customized for each player. Offline gameplay for up to 4 players on a single device is also instrumental to capture the fun and excitement of gathering around a table with your friends.\nA world of infinite possibilities\nFantasy, sci-fi and steampunk themed boards and game piece collections are just the beginning of the ever expanding tapestry of Game Master. Thankfully, we use a unified system where everything fits together like legos, meaning endless creative potential. Going on crazy turn-based adventures with your friends, or designing perilous quests for others to master has never been easier. Epic pre-built quests are coming out regularly and provide a lot of fun, replayability and even exclusive game pieces that can be used as either a Master or a Hero.\nA library of epic adventures\nWe\u2019re not just planning to use our community to create content for us! We have hired a team of storytellers and tabletop dungeon-masters to create a library of pre-built adventures for you to enjoy. Plenty are available and comprise a collection of game boards for players of all ages. \nMiniature Progression Concept\nMiniatures are not just figurines you use to play a tabletop game. Each has detailed stats, equipment and can be customized by a multitude of accessories and colors allowing you to paint your miniature any way you like. Every miniature levels up like an RPG character and gains new skills and powers. Build your own band of daring heroes and take them on adventures across the multiverse!\nMeet the miniatures!\n ...these miniatures are just a glimpse of what awaits you in the final game!\nNo matter what you do in the world of Game Master - you earn gold. But what is gold if you cannot spend it? Thankfully, we have created amazing booster packs, chuck-full with more digital goodies! Hero\u2019s Boosters are filled with weapons, armor, spells, laser guns, mechanical contraptions, potions and everything you will ever need to conquer the game board.\nMaster\u2019s Boosters yield game tiles, monsters, traps, NPCs, quest items and a multitude of other surprises that will help you create the most intricate and amazing adventures. Don\u2019t like what you have? Break it down into gold! You get to keep the blueprint and re-craft anything you ever had! Don\u2019t have enough trap doors? Craft as many as you like with gold!\nIt\u2019s not all about how wealthy you are! All gold earned by completing quests and capturing heroes adds to your Glory Rating. We also track your alignment in the world of Game Master. Will you be known as the dreaded hero that destroys all of his opposition or the most devious Master that promises mountains of gold but leaves no one alive to reap the benefits. Glory is not just a number used for bragging rights and matchmaking. Great in-game rewards are unlocked as your Glory rating rises. \nBy spending gold, players will be able to purchase booster packs and take their game to the next level. These are digital boxes filled with all sorts of goodies to enhance your experience. Two types of booster packs will be available at launch. Game pieces have different rarity ratings and every booster pack is guaranteed to have at least one rare item.\nDigital Booster Packs\nHero\u2019s Booster\nAn assortment of miniature paints, weapons, armor, potions, weapons, spells, runes and everything you will need to make your band of heroes the best in the land!\nMaster\u2019s Booster\nTiles, monsters, traps, NPC characters, chests, quest items, treasure, contraptions and all sorts of things to help you make the most sought after board in the game.\nOne of the products of our long history of playing tabletop games is the Runic Dice system. During our play-sessions we always wanted to evolve the idea of throwing dice and make it personal and customizable for each player.\nEach miniature comes with it\u2019s own runic dice that you get to use along side all the other standard dice. Runic dice are designed by you! Each side can be customized to provide exciting gameplay effects and turn the tide of battle.\nWe will be very proud to unveil more details about this system during the campaign.\nThe many worlds of Game Master\nFantasy\nBeyond the snowy mountains, in a valley kissed by the sun lay a kingdom of vines and cobblestone. Both the villagers and the townsfolk lived in peace and harmony until an old greedy dragon the size of a castle arrived in the valley threatening to eat every maiden in the kingdom unless he is presented with all the gold he can carry.\nSteampunk \nIn the seedy underground of Dampfburg, all hail the Queen of Cogs. No shady deed slips through this enigmatic matriarch\u2019s fingers and no man ever found a way to her heart. That is, until an investigative journalist attempts to infiltrate her hideout and get an interview.\nSci-Fi\nThe Galactic Alliance has fallen. Trade routes are no longer safe and piracy is at an all time high. A behemoth class transport vessel is assaulted by a band of young pirates hungry for loot. What they didn\u2019t know is that this ship\u2019s cargo are test subjects of a dangerous interdimensional experiment.\nModern Horror\nJust beyond the corner of your eye, lies a sinister world of ancient beings that have preyed on humanity from the shadows for ages. Their tendrils reach out across the world controlling all aspects of society. The fate of humanity lies in the hands of a group of paranormal vigilantes.\nPulp Adventure\nThe temples of the old gods, lied in ruins for thousands of years. Rarely are they visited by a living soul, and only the bravest dare to take a step inside only to never be heard from again. Will history repeat itself for our daring archaeologist or will he be the one to reach the City of Gold.\nCyberpunk\nA city engulfed in neon-light where information is the most prized commodity stands tall in the middle of a mutant-infested wasteland.

We love playing games as much as we love making them. And the only thing we like even more is to play games that we have made!\nSince our early childhood we have always been big fans of Role Playing Games. We endured sleepless nights playing D&D, collected and played Magic the Gathering cards and spent a lot of fantastic hours crawling in the dungeons thanks to board games like Descent or Hero Quest as well as many others.\nWith the overwhelming success of the iPad and other touchscreen devices, it became possible to transfer the table top board and card games as we know them to the digital realm. A lot more accessible and easy to setup but still as much fun and joy as the real ones. We at K-Gaming took a shot at it and created Demons vs. Wizards - a card game for touchscreen devices. This game is so easy even a small kid can play without reading the rules, but deep enough to allow for high-level strategies! \nThe reception of the Demons vs. Wizards card game was very warm and we\u2019ve had a ton of positive reviews. Continuing our quest to make great games for touchscreen devices was an easy decision afterwards.\n\nOur company motto - Our games must look and feel perfect.

For each God, we want you to answer this question:\nIf this God was to help you on your journey through Purgatory, what buff or gameplay advantage would they give you?\nTell us in the comments!\nBaldr, the God of light, purity, joy and innocence!\nFreyja, the God of love, beauty, fertility, war and death!\nLoki, the treacherous God of fire and mischief!\nTyr, the brave and courageous God of law and heroic glory!\nHel, daughter of Loki and lord of Helheimr, the resting place for those who have died of disease and old age!\nFreyr, God of virility, prosperity, holy judgement and sacred kingship!\nBragi, the Norse God of poetry, wisdom, bards and the power of speech!\nHeimdallr stands on the burning rainbow bridge that leads to Asgard, protecting the Gods from the jotun. His mighty horn, Gjallarhorn, signals Ragnar\u00f6k and the death of the Gods!\nNj\u00f6rd is an ancient God of the Vanir, father of Freyja and Frejr. He is God of the wind, of the sea and of wealth!\nThor is the slayer of giants and wielder of Mj\u00f6lnir. He is the mighty God of thunder, oak trees, strength and the protector of mankind!\nFrigg, Queen of Asgard, is the prescient God of motherhood, childbirth and constellations!\nOdin is the God of war, battle, victory, death, wisdom, poetry and magic. He is the Allfather, patriarch of the Gods and ruler of the nine worlds!\nThank you for sharing your gameplay ideas and we'll see you in purgatory!\nYou can download all the Norse Gods here!\nIn Jotun, you play Thora, a Norse warrior who has died an inglorious death and must face the challenges of Viking purgatory to prove herself to the Gods and enter Valhalla.\nJotun's core loop revolves around collecting Runes to summon and fight the jotun, gigantic Norse elementals. The game focuses on the balance between atmospheric exploration and ferocious combat. Imagine the mysterious romantic mood of Journey mixed with the scale of the boss fights in Shadow of the Colossus in top-down 2D.\nThe world is randomly-generated and filled with different areas to explore and environmental puzzles to solve. Traveling to the far reaches of Purgatory is key to finding Runes, Shrines to the Gods and many more Viking mysteries.\nThe combat in Jotun is fast-paced and brutally hard. Using only your massive two-handed axe, you take on foes that are hundreds of times your size. Every hit from a jotun's attack will take out a huge chunk of your health.\nFeatures:\nBeautiful 2D hand-drawn art style\nEpic boss fights against the mighty jotun\nA vast and mysterious randomly-generated world to explore filled with environmental puzzles based in Viking culture and mythology\nAn overarching story to discover for both Thora and Purgatory itself\nShrines to the Viking Gods\nAn amazing musical score, specifically composed for every gameplay moment\nWOW, we were Greenlit in under 6 days!!!\n Which means we'll be on:\nJotun's gameplay is a love letter to classic games such as The Legend of Zelda. It has simple controls, action-packed boss fights and a mythic Viking world to discover. Jotun is not a \"hack-and-slash\" RPG. We prefer to avoid numbers and text when possible: there are no experience points and few stats. Like the Vikings, you must prove your valor to the Gods using only your wits and your skill in combat.\nControls\nJotun can be played with a keyboard or a gamepad. Your basic actions are attack, move and dodge. You control Thora from a top-down perspective and can explore the world in any direction. Thora has both a fast and a \"charge-up\" attack; the attack's power is determined by how long you hold the attack button. Dodging is crucial to avoiding traps and incoming attacks from the mighty jotun.\nCombat\nInspired by the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls, the combat in Jotun is fast-paced and organic. Fighting the jotun requires the ability to dodge projectiles, use proper positioning and attack at the right moment. The jotun have several attacks and defenses. Recognizing them is key to executing your strategy. When in combat, the camera zooms out to give you a full view of the battlefield.\n More details on combat:\nJotun's music is core to the game's experience. Every gameplay moment is accompanied by an appropriate piece. Whether it's a fight against the mighty Frost Jotun or a peaceful contemplation of a beautiful vista, the music is an integral part of Jotun's mood, atmosphere and experience.\n\"When the prospect of writing the music for Jotun came along, I was filled with excitement at the idea of putting the vast universe Thora will explore during her journey into song. The characters, landscapes and story behind Jotun have already inspired many musical themes that I can't wait to bring to life!\" - Max LL\nWe chose Kickstarter because we want to involve you in the development process. We want your feedback, comments and critiques. Whether you love or hate Jotun, we want to know why. We want to build a community of passionate people all rooting for the same cause. We want you on board with us for the entire journey!\nJotun was born from our love of mythology and epic literature. From Greek mythology to Beowulf, we've always had a fascination for centuries-old stories. Jotun is a tribute to Viking mythology and to classic, honest gaming. We are a passionate and experienced team who can bring the game to fruition. We hope that you'll join us, connect with the game and that you'll enjoy your time with the Jotun family! \nFrom left to right:\nWilliam Dub\u00e9 - Design, business, code - http://willdube.com/\nAlexandre Boyer - Animation, art - http://vimeo.com/user8478050\nMax LL - Music - https://soundcloud.com/max-ll\nWe will be adding another full-time programmer to our team when the campaign is successful!\nCollaborators:\nAlex Mass\u00e9 - Code\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bilodeau - Sound Effects\nFrom left to right:\nJo-Annie Gauthier - 2D artist - http://www.jo-annie.net/\nAnnejulie Painchaud - 2D artist - http://antilamon.carbonmade.com/\nDarnell Lysius-Dicette - 2D artist - http://glitch-this1.tumblr.com/\nMarianne Vincent - Logo design - https://www.behance.net/mariannevincent\nVideo Team:\nMaude Plante-Husaruk - Director, editor - http://husaruk.com/\nJames Dub\u00e9 - Camera man\nOur goal is to reach alpha within six months, beta within nine months and full launch within twelve months.

We want you there with us from the start to influence the game's content and design.\n\nUltimately, video game development is extremely complex.

They\u2019d been hired to steal data, but the bloody dissection tables & the occasional vat filled with murky liquid hadn\u2019t been part of the job description.\nOut of morbid curiosity, Rachel turned her gun-mounted flashlight onto the nearest vat. It was massive, at least two meters tall & filled with an opaque green fluid. She approached & peered into the murky depths. \"What could possibly be growing inside these?\" she whispered.\nSMACK!\nRachel stumbled back as she received a partial answer. A black claw, bigger than her head, had reached out of the liquid & slammed into the glass wall of the vat. Just as abruptly, it disappeared back into the depths of the tank.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Rach,\u201d Maximus grunted, barely glancing at the source of the disturbance. \u201cNothing can bust out of those vats. They\u2019re made of two-inch-thick transparent synth steel, it would take\u2026\u201d\nMax & Rachel\u2019s hearts simultaneously skipped a beat as they both heard the crunching noise of something breaking underneath Max\u2019s huge combat boots.

With everything you will need for players & game-masters (GM). The book will also include loads of art, short stories & more from the game universe.\nThe Antagonist Archive 1: A high quality, 140 page, full colour, hardcover supplement book. Jam packed with information about the darker side of the Haven System. With NPCs, faction and locations for your players to contend with.\nThe Antagonist Archive 2: Similar to the Antagonist Archive 1, but will be slowly built over multiple years until it is the same size as the Antagonist Archive 1. Every time we release a new book and expand this setting, we will add to this book. We will also be gathering ideas from our community and placing the best ones inside (with professional art, writing and editing).\nAdventure 'Let Sleeping Gods Lie': 40+ pages, Softcover, black and white interior. Ideal introduction to the Fragged Empire setting.\nAdventure 'Genetic Spectres': 40+ pages, Softcover, black and white interior. Ideal for low to mid level characters.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSetting primary themes: Cultural tension, biological technology & exploration.\nRules primary focus: Non setting specific rules (though it comes with a setting), 3d6 skill rolls, nonlinear character progression, long sandbox games & tactical miniature based combat.\nAfter expanding throughout the galaxy, terraforming millions of planets & creating electronic wonders beyond our imagination, humanity became apathetic & faced extinction due to Genetic Erosion. Unable to save themselves, they engineered a race to inherit their fallen empire: the Archons.\nRather than treading in the footprints of humanity, the Archons pushed into scientific fields that their creators had barely explored: genetic engineering & the creation of scores of new species, all in an effort to make the \u2018perfect\u2019 race.\nOver thousands of years, the Archons built a mighty empire & created hundreds of species. But they played favourites, lavishing their love & generosity on some while entirely neglecting others.\nEventually they created what they initially thought was the \u2018perfect \u2018 race, naming them Xion. When the Archons attempted to rescind the title of \u2018perfect\u2019 the Xion fought back. The Archons eradicated the Xion. That is, all but one, who escaped far into uncharted space.\nTwo hundred years later the lone Xion returned with its own genetically-engineered army (the Nephilim). The ensuing war lasted six years & spelled the destruction of the Archons, their created races & empire. Vindicated, the lone Xion again disappeared, abandoning its army. Small pockets of survivors were scattered across the galaxy, unknown & alone.\nNow, a century has passed since the Great Xion War & descendants of the survivors have started to emerge. They have begun to rediscover space travel & are just now making tentative contact with one another in a small star system named \u2018Haven\u2019. You are one of these descendants who find yourself stepping into so much unknown\u2026\nCorporation\nRejected by their creators (the Archons) as inferior, the Corporation (formerly known as Vargarti) have grown to love the Great Xion War as it freed them from an existence of insignificance & irrelevance. They are now eager to prove themselves. Not a nation in the classical sense, the Corporation is a massive corporate entity comprised of millions of smaller, affiliated business enterprises; a purely capitalistic society.\nKaltoran\nBorn with the genetic memories of their ancestors, Kaltorans are an innately gifted & flexible race. They are eager to make a new future for themselves, though they struggle with the \u2018genetic memories\u2019 of not only the Great Xion War but the extreme measures taken by their ancestors to survive it.\nLegion\nA physically imposing race, hastily created by the Archons to fight their losing war against Xion. The Legion now struggle to create a stable society & to find meaning with no war to fight. In recent times the Legion have formed a close economic relationship with the Corporation, acting as enforcers for hire.\nNephilim\nA junk-word term used to describe the diverse descendants of Xion\u2019s genetically engineered army. Created to wage war on the Archons & their creations, before being abandoned by their creator, Xion once the war was won.\nThe Nephilim have an eclectic, primal & often violent society that is supported by advanced biological technology. While publicly no longer loyal to Xion, their pursuit of genetic perfection at any cost is pervasive.\nFree Ambient Audio Files (created by www.tabletopaudio.com):\nNephilim Lab\nKaltoran Spacecraft\nLight, Fast & Flexible non Combat rules: We don't want rules to slow the role playing down.\nPlayer Creativity is Encouraged: We balance the math by telling you what roll needs to be made but not what skill needs to be used. Your approach to a problem will give you bonuses or penalties.\nEncouraging Player-Driven Goals: Help players be invested in your world.  NPCs\u2019 opinion of your character have a statistical effect on your stats; not everything has to be done for money. You can also be a merchant or scientist, plan trade routes or research new or forgotten technologies.\nTactical Personal & Spacecraft Combat. Build or modify your own Weapons & Armour.\nBuild your own Custom Equipment & Spacecraft. Will you make a gunship for fighting, a cargo ship for trading, create labs & workshops to modifying weapons or perform research or do a bit of everything? The choice is yours.\nSee an explanation of Spare Time Rolls, plus Research & Trade Goods:\n See an example of Character Creation:\nPlease see our YouTube page for more rules videos.\nNon Setting Specific Rules\nFragged Empire comes with a setting, but rules are flexible & robust enough to be adapted to almost any science fiction setting.\nSimple 3d6 Resolution System\nSkill rolls are done with a simple 3d6 +/- bonus or penalty vs a Difficulty Value or Target\u2019s Defense.\nNonlinear Character Progression\nCharacters have a pool of options available to them, with no set ability or equipment progression path. This allows Characters to quickly specialize or diversify & to create unique combinations of abilities & equipment to suit your play style.\nLow Level Characters can be a dangerous threat to high level Characters due to specialization. Even if two Characters have very similar Attributes, Skills or Equipment, they can function quite different due to Trait selections.\nChoose any path you want; Cunning Mercenary, Black Market Smuggler, Archeological Treasure Hunter or Power Mad Scientist. All are balanced.\nBest for Long, Sandbox Games\nFragged Empire works for short games but is in its element in long, sandbox-styled games.\nBeing in a post, post-apocalyptic setting, you will regularly have to make the most of what little resources you have, including balancing short-term & long-term options, making short-term sacrifices for long-term gain, & so on.\nTactical Miniature Combat\nFragged Empire presents intuitive, tactical combat where you will need to not only react to your environment (cover is your friend), but also to respond to your opponents\u2019 Actions. There are also optional rules for non-miniature based combat, if desired.\nPDF, pledge $20aud or more.\nWhen the project is complete, you will receive a PDF copy of the complete book & access to the PDF version via DriveThruRPG. This will allow you to freely download any future updated versions of the book.\nThe PDF will be available before the book.\nKS Exclusive Wallpapers.\nWe will be making up a full set of High Res wallpapers. These will remain exclusive to our backers for 6 months after we post out to all of our backers (then I will most likely just put them up on my website for free).\nAdventure: \"Let Sleeping Gods Lie\".\nExplore the remains of a (possibly) dead, ancient, biological Nephilim warship as it floats through space. This small adventure is ideal for new players and a great introduction to the Fragged Empire setting.\nWe have expanded this Adventure to now be 40+ pages long, and it will no longer be a KS Exclusive Adventure.\nReference PDF\nA handy PDF with Trait, Equipment & NPC stat blocks.\nPhysical Copy, pledge $75aud or more.\nFeaturing 384 pages, full colour, offset printed, hardcover book.
