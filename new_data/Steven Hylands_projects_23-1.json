For full text of the statement, visit the link here.\n\"... In The Infographic Energy Transition Coloring Book, Ellery Studio and the Institute for Climate Change, Energy and Mobility (IKEM) communicate scientific information about climate change in a unique way.\nThis is especially important in the digital age, because access to information is one thing; understanding its complexity is another. That\u2019s why we need materials like the IETCB, which can facilitate a cross-generational understanding of fundamental issues. The writers and designers behind the coloring book have developed an innovative format to illustrate the measures and strategies needed to achieve the energy and mobility transition.\nThe IETCB presents basic facts and figures on climate change and the energy transition in a playful and creative way. Schools, in particular, should take advantage of this format in order to introduce comprehensive climate education in schools as early as possible.\"\n It\u2019s official: the Infographic Energy Transition Coloring Book is one of the world\u2019s top infographic publications \nThe first edition of the IETCB won the Gold Award (Criteria Innovative Format) and the Main Award for Climate Change and Environmental Commitment Best Graphic at the prestigious Malofiej Infographic Awards (World Infographic Summit) \u2013 ahead of media giants like The New York Times. \nFEATURED BY:\nIKEM's Anika Nicolaas Ponder wrote an op-ed article for Medium - \"An energy transition for everyone\". \n... and more!\n1. Playful comic-style illustrations break down the complexity of the energy transition\nThe IETCB makes complex climate- and energy-related issues accessible to people of all ages, inspiring engagement and enabling effective action. \n2. Colorable infographics debunk myths about renewable energy\nThe book is packed with expert content based on the most up-to-date statistics from sources including the International Energy Agency (IEA), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), and the Natural Resources Defense Council. The IETCB covers topics ranging from sustainable mobility to Germany\u2019s Renewable Energy Act and offers recommendations for reducing our carbon footprint. \nWho knew learning about energy subsidies could be so fun? \nThe IETCB is designed to spark dialogue on climate change. The innovative coloring book format opens doors to new audiences \u2013 including change-makers at the top of our government. IETCB team members have personally given coloring books to politicians like Chancellor Angela Merkel and Environment Minister Svenja Schulze.\nEllery Studio Co-Founder Eugen Litwinow with Chancellor Angela Merkel\nIt's your turn: \nThe IETCB offers a great way for you to engage with your own local representatives, communities, and decision-makers.

The teams joined forces to research, write, and design the first edition of this self-published book.\nIKEM is an NGO that conducts interdisciplinary research exploring energy transition pathways toward a sustainable society, with an emphasis on the policy framework driving Germany\u2019s Energiewende. \nhttps://www.ikem.de/en/ \nEllery Studio for Creative Strategy is an award-winning team of designers and strategists on a mission to boosts creativity and excitement in renewable energy, sustainability and social responsibility.  \nhttps://www.ellerystudio.com \nThis project grew out of our passion for environmental protection and our drive to build a sustainable future.  \nAmid the onslaught of disheartening news about the future of our planet, the prospect of taking action on climate change and the energy transition can feel daunting at best. But the truth is that we are making progress, and recent breakthroughs have made this an exciting period of change. \nWe believe it\u2019s important to communicate a feeling of hope and excitement about the future of the energy transition. Meaningful change starts when we draw everyone into the discussion \u2013 so we invested our personal time, energy, and funds to create a book that does just that. \nIdeating and testing\nTesting \"How to color\"\nWe hope you\u2019ll enjoy reading and coloring this book as much as we enjoyed making it. \nElements\nOptions\nThe coloring book will be delivered by December 2019!\nBased on our current production schedule, the book should be printed in time for delivery in December 2019.\nWe're estimating a four-week shipping time worldwide.\nAll  shipments will be tracked.\nOf course we'll keep you up to date with important milestones along the way!\n\nShow your love by not only backing the project, but sharing this campaign to your friends, family, colleagues, and all your loved ones! \nIf you don't feel like sharing, that's alright.\nFollow us on Facebook & Instagram and subscribe to our newsletter for exciting updates and news, including the campaign launch date for our upcoming German edition of the IETCB!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause we\u2019ve already released two editions of the coloring book we expect the production process to go smoothly. Still, nothing is risk-free! Potential challenges include:\n\nHitting the budget: There\u2019s always the chance that we\u2019ll fall short of our crowdfunding. But this doesn\u2019t pose a risk to our backers: since it's an all-or-nothing campaign, if we don\u2019t reach our set goal contributors will get their money back. In this case we won't be able to release a new, updated version of the coloring book but the previous editions will still be available in our online shop.\n\nHitting the buzzer: Research has shown that, if we don\u2019t act now, the effects of climate change will be irreversible. Ultimately, the greatest risk is that we won\u2019t have time to create effective change before the buzzer goes off. By publishing and distributing this book, we hope to get the message out ASAP and give the energy transition the chance it deserves.

Yes it\u2019s terrifying. But you don't have to be paralyzed by your fear, grief, and other painful feelings. You can use your pain to transform yourself, your friends, and your world. You can become the hero humanity needs. I want to show you how. \nI am the founding director of The Climate Mobilization. Our mission is to initiate a WWII-scale mobilization to protect humanity and the natural world from climate catastrophe. We develop and pioneer the strongest and most aggressive policies and strategies for reversing climate breakdown. For example, our Climate Emergency campaign\u2014with the help of our partners like Extinction Rebellion\u2014sparked more than 500 declarations of Climate Emergency in local governments in the U.S. and around the world. Scotland, Wales, and the United Kingdom have become the first countries to declare a climate emergency.  \nJeremy Corbin announcing that the Climate Emergency Declaration had passed\nOur papers, The Transformative Power of Climate Truth, and Leading the Public into Emergency Mode have inspired thousands of readers, and laid the groundwork for the movement breakthroughs we have been experiencing.  \n As Bill McKibben put it, \"We are in an emergency. That's why the work that Margaret Klein Salamon's work and  the work of others at The Climate Mobilization is so important.\nThere are so many incredible books out there about the climate crisis, including books by my friends \u2014David Wallace Wells Uninhabitable Earth and Bill McKibben\u2019s Falter, for example\u2014lay out the stark, painful truth for all to see. \nMy book is different. In it, I show you what to do after you\u2019ve read those gut wrenching books and can\u2019t sleep anymore. My book offers an answer to our collective questions: What can one person do when faced with a problem of this magnitude? What is my responsibility? What the hell do I do now?\nThe Climate Mobilization has been instrumental in spreading the \"Climate Emergency\" campaign\nI'm in a unique position to help. I have a PhD in clinical psychology from Adelphi University and a BA in social anthropology from Harvard. Through my experience as a therapist and my work at TCM, I know that many of us want to do something\u2014anything\u2014to stop the climate crisis. But we feel paralyzed by our fear, by our anxiety, by our sense of being overpowered by this abstraction called \u201cthe climate.\u201d We\u2019re also paralyzed by our suspicion that we\u2019re utterly alone in our despair. \nAddressing artists, entertainers, and influencers in Hollywood.\nI am here to tell you that you are not alone, and although you may feel paralyzed, you are not powerless. \nInstead of hiding, you can grieve your losses\u2014including the nice, regular future you thought you had\u2014and accept your terror, anger, guilt, and other feelings. As a therapist, I know that this work is not optional if we are going to mount the heroic effort needed to save humanity. Once you have processed your feelings, you can bring your whole self\u2014your skills, resources, and passion to the Climate Emergency Movement. \nMy book supports you in this transformation. It helps you face and process your fears, and it guides you through your grief. It urges you to go \u201call in for all life;\u201d to become the climate warrior we need to save our home, and to bring others in your life along in this \u201cAll Hands On Deck\u201d mobilization.\nOnward!  \nNote: all proceeds from Transform Yourself with Climate Truth will go to Climate Mobilization Project, The Climate Mobilization's 501c(3) affiliate.\nUpdate: First Excerpt Published-- and shared over 3500 times! \nUpdate: Margaret's psychological perspective featured in the New York Times! \nMy Blog-- The Climate Psychologist", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is already a complete draft, but piloting the self-assessment survey and discussion group formats will help me make the tools even more useful. \n\nThe biggest challenge will be to get the book adequately \"seeded\" so it can grow organically and reach millions of people.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Early Ebook", "descp": "Be one of the first readings of Transform Yourself with Climate Truth!\nINCLUDES:\nEarly access to Transform Yourself with Climate Truth Ebook", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["106 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Pilot Self Assessment Survey", "descp": "Margaret has developed a self-assessment survey to help people find their place in the Climate Emergency Movement.

Keeping this in mind, we have designed Canyon, our best travel shoe yet.\nIn order to cover all our necessities man has designed a lot of different kind of shoes: sneakers, outdoor shoes, hiking shoes, aqua shoes, slippers\u2026 However all this footwear is so specific that if we don\u2019t want to have any problem while packing for the next big adventure, we are forced to sacrifice on comfort and convenience.\n\n\n Afters hours of investigation, research & development and customization, we have raised our game to craft a better travel shoe that delivers premium quality, high-tech performance and maximum comfort. \n What you can't see, it's what matters the most. It\u2019s all about the little things that make the difference. In design, we like to think that Less is More. \nThe Cruiser Backpack is your must-pack travel gear for your next vacation.  It fits in your pocket, it's great for wet and dry conditions and provides you maximum comfort. \n\n\n We consider ourselves a collaborative brand, that is why for us, our community support is vital and we will not tire of thanking it. Involving the Kickstarter community in new launches is essential to the quality growth of our business, as it allows us to design and develop the product that we want without investors. \n\n\n 1.

Similarly, in STEM fields, women account for only 15% of employees.\nMake Your Mark aims to change that.\nThis book will bring greater female representation to both design and tech by talking to women working in the industry about their lives, thoughts and careers.  \nInterview with Karishma Kusurkar, Multidisciplinary Designer.\nI believe that this book has something in it for everyone- it will be an important resource for individuals who feel like they are isolated from or can\u2019t find other female designers, women in tech or mentors where they live. It will also be an incredible resource for anyone else who just wants to read interviews with genuinely great designers!\nInterview with Libby Sellers, Design Historian, Author and Curator.\nQuote from interview with Vic Bell, Professional Illustrator, Designer and Iconographer.\nHere are some of the amazing female leaders and creators in our industry who have agreed to be part of the book:\n-  Vic Bell  | Professional illustrator, designer and iconographer.\n- Debbie Millman | Host of the Design Matters podcast. Writer, Designer, Educator, Artist and Brand Consultant.\n- Alicja Colon | Paper Illustrator and Photographer. Creator and Owner of Thrice Studio. \n- Sheree Atcheson | Award-winning Leader, ex-developer for Deloitte, Tech Respect and Inclusion Manager and Women Who Code Global Ambassador.\n- Libby Sellers | Design Historian, Consultant, Curator and Author of Women Design.\n- Deepa Mann-Kler | CEO of Neon and Visiting Professor in Immersive Futures at Ulster University. \n- Karishma Kusurkar | Multidisciplinary Designer and Owner of the brand Karishma\u2019s World. She is also the co-founder of Belfast Design Week, The Design Salon and co-founded the Small Town Big Dreams podcast.\n- Caroline Smith| Product Designer at Amiqus and co-founder of FabFit. \n- Dani McFerran | Founder and Creative Director of Done and Dusted Design. \nI have really enjoyed getting to talk to some of the women who have inspired me as I have started my career, as well as meeting new role models along the way. I couldn't create this book without their help (if you're one of the contributors and you are reading this, thank you!).\nMore names will be added to this list as the project goes on, so please check back for updates!\nI want this book to be a beautifully designed product that is worth holding on to. Make Your Mark will have a case bound 300gsm cover with a matte laminate on one side and foil detailing. It will be a 210mm square book with approximately 60 pages.\nI have also designed a range of backer rewards to compliment the Make Your Mark book. \nAll Physical Reward Tiers-\n- Double sided bookmark on 400gsm matte laminated board.\nFree bookmark with all physical reward tiers.\nPen Tool Tier-\n- 10cm x 10cm square vinyl logo stickers \n\"Make Your Mark\" Logo Stickers\n- Button badges in one of five designs.\nBadges in 5 different designs. Each reward badge will be randomly selected!\nPaintbrush Reward Tier-\n- 21cm x 21cm square art print on 300gsm smooth white board. Limited to 50 pieces. \n\"Creative Growth\" square print reward.\n \n - White foil-stamped,  2B hexagonal pencil. \n2B pencil reward, so you can make your own mark!\nFountain Pen Tier-\nThis tier includes a unique A3 giclee print, designed by me- what goes on the poster is up to you! Please check out my Dribbble profile for more examples of my illustration work. \n\nPrinting Costs- Most of the money raised will be put towards printing the book! I will be working with a Northern Irish printing firm to ensure the book is produced to the highest quality possible.\nVideo Costs- I worked with the brilliant Belfast-based video production team, Creating A Space, to create the promotional video for Make Your Mark. To cover the costs for their hard work, I have set aside some of the total funding amount. It has been exciting to use my project to support the work of other creatives, so paying them for their hard work is very important to me! \nKickstarter Fees- For hosting this amazing platform where ideas can be brought to life, Kickstarter takes some of the total amount of the funding.\nShipping Costs- For shipping, boxes, and other packaging materials. I will be trying to keep these costs as low as I can, because no one likes paying extra for shipping!\nBacker rewards- Printing art prints, posters, pencils, badges and the other lovely rewards on offer in this campaign. \nOther- This money has been set aside for unforeseen costs, just to make sure I have enough money to fulfill the rewards no matter what! \n Thank you so much for taking the time to look at my Kickstarter Campaign! With your help, \"Make Your Mark\" can become a reality and provide inspirational figures to young women working in design and tech.\nI want to say a massive thank-you to the team at IxDBelfast for all of their support in creating this project, to Paul McNally for his amazing advice on creating a Kickstarter, to Womenfolk's Christine James for the fantastic support she has given me when creating this project and to all the wonderful women of design and tech who agreed to be interviewed for my book. \nVideo Credits: Created by Creating A Space.

It's been just over a year since the release of 'Brother' last April and we've been busy as ever touring and promoting that record. I can't thank you all enough for your help and support in launching my debut album \u2013 the response has blown me away.\n\nWe've had a whirlwind year that included a full band tour, playing shows all over the world and, I even signed a publishing deal that should hopefully see my songs appearing in some your favourite TV shows and movies soon.\n\nWithout the continued support of fans like you, none of this would be possible.\nThe Music\nJames and I have been hard at work, writing a new collection of songs that we'd love to share with you, and, once again, we'd love your help to make them a reality. \n\nI'm so excited about the new music and I can't wait for you all to hear it. It's a slightly more mature sound than first time around and I really think it's my best work yet (that's a slightly biased opinion I know).\n\nThis album is called 'Good Love' because it's essentially a collection of Love Songs. Songs about true love, lost love, new love and even the love of the road \u2013 some traditional and some not so traditional love songs. And I think you're going to love it.\n\nMuch like last year this Kickstarter campaign is an opportunity to preorder the album, support an independent artist and pick up some exclusive rewards at the same time! \nThe Rewards\n'Atlas' T-Shirt. (Artwork subject to change)\nOnce again we've put together some really cool rewards as part of the Pre-order campaign. Here's  a what you can get your hands on:\nA signed copy of the new album\nA signed copy of 'Good Love' and of 'Brother'\nA 'Kiss Me In The Dark' typographic T-shirt, inspired by the track of the same name\nA ticket to our 'Album Preview' show this August (a chance to hear the songs live, in their entirety before anyone else)\nA live show in your living room or any room in your house for that matter\nThe Process\nWe've got a number of the tracks recorded already and we're hard at work in the studio at North South, recording the rest. I'll do my best to share some tracks and snippets with you as well as reveal more info about the songs and track listing as the campaign goes on.\nOnce again I've got a wonderful and talented team behind me and I'm really excited about the new record.\nIf we don't hit the \u00a32000 goal I won't receive any of the money so any donation, big or small, could help me get the next record off the ground.\nI'll be posting regular updates to let you know what's happening and how we're getting on with producing the album. \nOnce you've become a backer, you can keep an eye on things in the 'updates' section and get in touch via this page.\nWhy use Kickstarter?\nI know some of you might be wondering why we're running a second Kickstarter campaign, as opposed to just releasing the records and selling them straight to you. \n\nThe simple answer is that this model just works. Kickstarter allows me to gauge interest in the music, it allows you, the listener to preorder and support music you love, and get cool, exclusive rewards at the same time, and \u2013 all importantly \u2013 it gives me the capital upfront to make something amazing. I can budget accordingly and create the best possible product, safe in the knowledge that the CDs are already sold. In short, it's a dream business model for an independent musician and I'm just so grateful that so many of you have gotten behind the concept! \nWhat if you make more than your target?\nJust like last time, we'll be touring and self-promoting the album after it's release but this time around, we're planning to spend some of the extra money on PR. With the first record, I was hesitant about paying for press and publicity because I don't want to encourage a music industry trend of third parties taking money for review spots, radio plugs and write-ups.\n\nSadly, though, it seems PR is a necessary evil and a concerted effort to promote the record will likely lead to bigger and better things, as well as exposure to a new audience and that's never a bad thing.\nThe fine print\nIf you order a t-shirt, we'll get in touch with you once the Kickstarter campaign is over to find out sizing info etc!\nAll physical rewards should ship by late September.\nIf you back me for a house show, we'll get in touch and organise a time that suits you.\nIf you have any questions at all, about the rewards, the album or the process you can get in touch via Kickstarter or at hello@danielduke.co.uk.\nSpecial Thanks\nThanks again to everyone who has been a part of this journey so far. To Hannah, James, Freddie, Danny, Ross, Jon and to my family, you're my inspiration and my driving force and the best support anyone could have. \nTo anyone who's bought a ticket to a show, picked up an album, listened online or just told me how much they connected with a song or video, I'm so grateful. All this work is for you!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nObviously with any creative process there is a certain amount of risk involved. We're still recording the tracks for the record but we've got a deadline and we've allotted a sensible amount of time to get it done. \n\nLuckily, we've done this all before so we know what we're doing and what pitfalls to avoid!\n\nBecause I'll be using third parties for the CD duplication and t-shirt printing, it's hard to guarantee there will be no hold ups during production. I have, however, already received quotes for these and they should be completed within the timeframe.\n\nIf any challenges or delays do arise, I'll be sure to keep you updated on this page and via email, so you know exactly when your rewards will arrive.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a32 or more", "title": "EVERY LITTLE HELPS", "descp": "You'll get a free download of the first single and some serious kudos for helping us make the second album a reality.\nINCLUDES:\nSingle Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a38 or more", "title": "ALBUM DOWNLOAD", "descp": "A new tier for folks who don't have a CD player but still want to show their support and get a copy of the record!\nYou'll get a digital download of the album.\nINCLUDES:\nAlbum Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "SIGNED ALBUM", "descp": "You'll receive a physical copy of the album signed by yours truly.

It's taken us less than 24 hours but we've already managed to blitz through our first stretch goal. The value of this milestone is truly incomprehensible, and by now being able to access the full funds generated, we can put this immediately back into the documentary.\nSo now the question is...can we make another?\nWith this one final push, we can bring the documentary to the highest standard possible.\nThis second and final stretch goal is a small one, but the benefits for this are huge. With a new stretch goal that's only \u00a3831 away, we'll be able to bring an additional crew member on board to our shoot in Tokyo this January. \nAt this stage, we're working on a skeleton crew operation, meaning that often times designated cameramen are also required to handle sound, and vice versa. This stretch goal may seem small on the surface, but the potential for growth with regards to quality is staggering.\nWe're on the home straight now, team. Let's do this.\nUPDATE: \u00a315,000 TARGET REACHED\nIn what seemed like a pipe-dream only a few short months ago, we're now on the cusp of making this a reality. It's going to take a while for this one to settle in.\nYou've all dug deep and put whatever funds possible into a project that you believed in. So from every single person involved with this documentary: THANK YOU.\nWe won't let you down.\nWhilst we've just passed an unbelievably remarkable milestone, for which we'll be eternally grateful, the hard work is just beginning.\nWhat happens now is that Kickstarter now takes up to 10% of the funds generated for payment processing fees. Additionally, there's also every chance that when Kickstarter comes to take the funds from donators, these may not be available to withdraw. Finally, in the last 24 hours alone, we've had almost \u00a3250 of donations cancelled.\nTo accommodate this, we're pleased to announce our very first stretch goal for OSPREAY: \u6697\u6bba\u8005\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8 \u2013 and we're already well on our way to hitting this new target.\nThanks to you guys, we're incredibly almost a third there already. Truly humbled.\nThis stretch goal allows us to access the full funding without having to give 10% back to Kickstarter. In saving these funds, we can focus on putting it back into the documentary as we can think about utilising better equipment, larger production crews and a swifter post-production process. \nYou've brought us this far. Now there's just 24 hours for one last push. Thank you everyone. You've made this happen.\nWho are you and what is this?\nAren\u2019t you going to say hello?\nHello, who are you and what is this?\nHi there. I\u2019m Ryan Carse, producer of \u2018Ospreay\u2019, a feature-length documentary following the career of British professional wrestler, Will Ospreay. \nMyself, along with a close-knit group of filmmakers have turned our attention to tell Will\u2019s story from his humble beginnings in the backyard, rising through the ranks to where he is now: at the very precipice of global stardom. \nOver the past three years, we\u2019ve found ourselves incidentally and accidentally filming Will on his journey, before coming to the realisation that we were sitting on a film\u2019s worth of content. With Will\u2019s blessing and contributions, we officially began pre-production on \u2018Ospreay\u2019.\nOspreay seeks to explore the unique relationships Will shares with his peers. Photo: Oli Sandler\nTo give you a little bit of my backstory, I\u2019m also the editor of The Tag Rope, a quarterly publication dedicated to upholding the ethos of quality journalism whilst presenting professional wrestling in a completely new fashion, using long-form articles, original artwork and captivating photography. \nOver the past year The Tag Rope has grown immensely, we\u2019ve adapted to new forms of media and in doing so have worked alongside some of biggest names in the world of wrestling.\nWorking with one of professional wrestling's most influential minds, Paul Heyman earlier this year. You can watch our full interview with The Advocate by clicking this link. Photo: Robyn Goding\n  So why the Kickstarter then?\nThe reason behind this Kickstarter campaign is similar to most, in that we just don\u2019t have the finances to take this project to the heights that it could reach. \nWe are all first time feature filmmakers, and a good chunk of our team is of a similar age to Will himself, yet we do have experience in this field and more importantly, the drive and determination to produce a quality piece of filmmaking. \nThe great thing about this project is that we\u2019ve already gathered at least 50% of the footage over the past three years. However, as it stands, there are things that are currently out of our reach. We hope with your support, they soon won\u2019t be. \nLike what then?\nWill has now signed a contract with New Japan Pro Wrestling, and finds most of his time split directly between the UK and Japan. One thing we don\u2019t have at the moment is our own footage of Will competing in Japan.\nThis is essential to the film\u2019s story and our intentions are to travel to Japan with Will in January 2017 for Wrestle Kingdom 11, as Will competes in front of 50,000 people.  \nImagine this but way bigger. Photo: Oli Sandler\nOn the home front, we also need to document Will up until mid-2017 at the least, as his career grows even further we need to be on hand to capture every moment. This means travelling up and down the UK and Ireland, which carries its own expenses.\nThere are a few other non-glamourous issues that we have to factor into this documentary, specifically the post-production process which will prove to be time-consuming as well as costly. You can find a full breakdown of our budget further down the page.\nI don\u2019t know, I bet you guys don\u2019t even have a schedule.\nAu contraire, let\u2019s not jump to any conclusions here. As stated above, our express intentions for this Kickstarter are to gather enough funds to travel to Tokyo, Japan for Wrestle Kingdom 11 in January 2017. \nHowever, we do have a full shooting schedule which looks like this:\nWhatCulture Pro Wrestling \u2013 06/10/16, Newcastle, UK\nWhatCulture Pro Wrestling \u2013 07/10/16, Newcastle, UK\nWhatCulture Pro Wrestling \u2013 08/10/16, Manchester, UK\nWhatCulture Pro Wrestling \u2013 09/11/16, London, UK\nRevolution Pro Wrestling \u2013 10/11/16, London, UK\nRevolution Pro Wrestling \u2013 11/11/16, Reading, UK\nOver The Top Wrestling \u2013 17/12/16, Dublin, Ireland\nOver The Top Wrestling \u2013 18/12/16, Belfast, UK\nNew Japan Pro Wrestling \u2013 04/01/17, Tokyo, Japan\nNew Japan Pro Wrestling \u2013 05/01/17, Tokyo, Japan\nThis is a continuously growing list of on-location shoots with various wrestling promotions across the country, in addition to a number of shoots we have pencilled in at training schools, family residences and other important places in Will's life. \n  It's critical for the documentary that we're consistently available and on-hand to record moments like this. Photo: Robyn Goding\nWhat about a budget though?\nWay ahead of you. We\u2019d be na\u00efve in thinking that we could carry on with our limited resources and personnel, and self-financing a feature length documentary is not an option. \nWith your help, we can spend the next eighteen months dedicating ourselves to fulfilling the projects potential. \nHere\u2019s how the projected finances will be spent:\nJapan\nFlights and accommodation (7 days) for 4 \u2013 \u00a33,800\nEditing/Post-production\nEditor\u2019s two-month wage \u2013 \u00a32,500\nEditing hardware \u2013 \u00a32,000\nEditing software \u2013 \u00a3200\nAnimators/musicians/graphic designers \u2013 \u00a31,500\nEquipment\nLighting \u2013 \u00a31,000\nAudio \u2013 \u00a3500\nMisc.

We strongly believe in collaboration in order to grow and exceed expecta-\nOh yeah, incentives! Tell me about those.\nHere\u2019s the fun part. We want to bring each and every person who donates to the project as close as possible to the documentary through our incentives. \nTo do this, we\u2019ve teamed up with the finest graphic designers, photographers and purveyors of luxurious goods to craft completely unique rewards for this project.\nIf and when this project is successfully funded, we\u2019ll reach out to you directly to confirm your details regarding mailing addresses, size, choice of design etc. To be up front, unfortunately we don\u2019t stock any shirts in Extra Medium.\nHere\u2019s just some of the rewards you can pick up from this project:\n          Alright, I\u2019m coming round to this. Here\u2019s the go-home cue.\nWe\u2019ve all made great sacrifices to get to this stage and we will continue to do so.\nBut with your support, you can help us achieve our goal, make life a little easier and give us the creative freedom to tell Will\u2019s story. \nIf you support us, you will be directly responsible for getting this film made and be able to follow every step of the process. \nDemand more from the content you consume. Thank you.\nPhoto: Oli Sandler\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe figure that we have come up with for our total goal is designed to eradicate any potential risks that we may have otherwise encountered, however there are still a number of challenges that we will face with the project. A lot of this is down to travel and specifically speaking, our intentions to travel to Japan. All of us have not been before so adjusting to the culture in a short space of time and making sure we have a safe and productive trip is priority. Another challenge would be the editing process and finalising the film to take to distribution. A lot of time and manpower will be needed for this but again, our Kickstarter goal is designed to cushion this and ease the process as much as possible. \n\nWhat makes us qualified to over come these challenges is that we\u2019ve previously been in similar scenarios and situations for the past few years now. When it comes to filmmaking we have a lot of experience under our belt, specifically in the field and genre we are aiming for. When it comes to problem solving and thinking on our feet, we couldn\u2019t be more accustomed to this in our experience of working for The Tag Rope, and the success of the magazine itself and its online presence is a testament to this. \n\nWe never know what will happen in Japan, and we can only ask contacts that we already have over there to give us an insight into the potential obstacles that we may face. If its related at all to the previous obstacles we\u2019ve faced so far when filming this documentary then no doubt they will be related to technical and equipment problems in the moment of filming, which is always dealt with in due time. We will most definitely have language barrier issues as well, which may prove difficult when entering new locations and getting access to film. To get around this we already have planned an entourage to help us get around as well as an interpreter. \n\nOur project does not need approval or premarket review from any outside sources and we do not have any past projects that need completing. The project in question is 100 percent independent and owned by ourselves, and is the only project we have on our schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Thank You", "descp": "You are bloody brilliant.

If you like it, you might want to pay to make it a reality.\nJack Straws is the idea; not a caf\u00e9, a board game caf\u00e9! To find out what that means in detail, check out the video above!\nThis is how it works. First, if you want to, you make a pledge. If the campaign is successful then you will be able to claim a reward based on how much you pledged.\nThe campaign will be successful if we get enough pledges to meet the target. Then (and only then) the backers will have their pledges debited and receive their rewards.\n\nIf the campaign is not successful then no one is debited!\nWe have every faith that this project will work  and make many happy memories amongst friends and family.  \nTHE PLAN\nThe business model we are working on will involve substantial outlay. We want this caf\u00e9 to be a popular social hub and so are investing a lot in the cafes appearance to maximize the enjoyment for each individual. We want everyone to feel comfortable coming and having a night of fun, from whether you have never played a board game before to having played many.\n\nWe envision a rustic caf\u00e9, seating around 50 people, comfy booths to enhance your gaming experience, BYO, good quality coffee, and locally produced food platters, ice-cream and tray bakes.\n\nWe have covered most of the considerable fit out and building costs, however to fund the remaining fit out, supply the best selection of games, a top class coffee machine for your satisfaction and striking d\u00e9cor we need your pledges!  The money we hope to raise through kick-starter is an important portion of the substantial outlay required for this project. Every pledge makes a difference!\n\nOur plan involves having at least 6 enthusiastic employees, including our full time managing director on the floor at all times to ensure you have the ability to get help with the game you have selected when needed. Trained baristas will ensure you enjoy your coffee while you play!\n\nThe initial opening hours will be 2pm-11pm Monday- Saturday, however this can be adapted according to demand.\n  Floor plans and fit out plans will be available soon! Watch this space!\n WHY A BOARD GAME CAFE?\nWe are raising funds on kickstarter to help make our dream a reality. Board games provide so much fun and interaction that has recently been lost in a society increasingly dominated by multimedia. I grew up with family board game nights and have wonderful memories of the laughter and enjoyment they brought. Since I got married, we now host board game nights in our house once or twice a week. \nWe want to provide a comfortable, fun environment where groups of friends or family's can come together, drink coffee and select and learn a game from a collection of over 300 board games. We will continually update and increase our stock, so there will always be a reason to come back for more!\nBoard game cafes are becoming popular all over the world yet Belfast doesn't have one. We want to change that!\nHOW WILL THE CAFE WORK?\nThe vast variety of board games that have now been produced means there is something for everyone. We will have dedicated, friendly staff who will meet with you when you first arrive at the cafe. They will ask about your board game experience and judge from your answer which game would be appropriate for you. They will sit with you and teach you how to play and then will be available to serve you food and drinks and answer any questions you have throughout your time in Jack Straws.\nYou can book a table online or by phone or come on down to the cafe. It is \u00a34.50 for a 2 hour gaming session for an adult and \u00a33.50 for children, pensioners or groups over 10. The 2 hour rule applies if the cafe is very busy, otherwise you are free to play on as long as you like!\nYou can purchase a membership for the year at \u00a320 and this will get you your gaming session for \u00a33.50 every time.\nWe also plan to host workshop nights where we will advertise a game and anyone that wants to learn and meet new people to play the game with can come along to our dedicated evenings.\nWe will have a private function room that can be hired out for groups and parties with dedicated staff ready to teach you games and serve you food and drinks.\nWe will also run tournament days and evenings for different games throughout the year. \nHOW CAN WE MAKE THIS HAPPEN?\nWe have put a lot of work and planning into this project already. We started plans in July 2015 and now need to pull together some final funding to bring this dream to life. \nWith your help, we plan to open in East Belfast, hopefully by October.\nTIMELINE OF EVENTS\nJuly 2015  \nI had heard of board game cafes before, but my first experience came in July last year when I visited a very popular Board Game Caf\u00e9 in London. I fell in the love with the place and the plans began! I knew if Belfast had something similar I would be there all the time!  \nJuly 2015- January 2016  \nWe put together our business plan, did our research and made the big decision to take on this adventure!  \nJanuary 2016- May 2016  \nThe search for the ideal premises began  \nJune 2016  \nWe found the premises we want, and negotiations started  \n19th July 2016  \nKickstarter Launched  \nIf we're successful and everything goes to plan here's how the timeline of events will progress:  \nAugust 2016  \nWe will update you with floor plans and the interior plan of the premises\n28th August 2016  \nKickstarter Campaign Finishes  \n11th September  \nFinal Funds transferred to Jack Straws Ltd  \n12th September  \nFit out Begins  \n1st week of October  \nJack Straws Board Game Caf\u00e9 is Open!!!!\nREWARDS\nSTRETCH GOALS\nStretch goals If our funding goal is exceeded, the following stretch goals will be applied;    \n\u00a315,000- We can add another 150 games to our board game library.\n\u00a318,000- We can add a luxury Aspinal of London Monopoly and luxury apsinal of london scrabble board to our cafes collection.

We are aiming to create a super-relaxed zone for animal-lovers who crave hot beverages and cat hair. The lounge cats will nap or play or plot world domination and might wander onto your lap for a tum-scratch. Please obey!\nWhat's a cat lounge?\nCat caf\u00e9s originated in Taiwan in the late '90s, they are pretty commonplace these days but not in Ireland. We know it's hard to find an understanding landlord who will let you keep a cat nearby in your home or under your bed. It's a shame but that's where we can help.\nAt Kittywinkles you can lounge and laze and lol amongst a few friendly cats. Sip your tea, connect to the WiFi and admire the very small, hairy mammals.\n How does it work?\n1. Book your visit online at our website.\n2. Be super excited and tell everyone you're going.\n3. Arrive bright-eyed and fluffy-tailed.\n4. Kick off your shoes and cuddle a kitty.\nWho would visit Kittywinkles?\nWe expect to see lots of different people come through our doors when we open, humans who:\nlove cats (of course!)\nlove cats but are too busy to own one\nlove cats but aren't allowed to have them in their homes\nlive with other humans who have cat allergies. Achoo!\nHiya! I'm Caitlin (or Kitty). I've always been a cat-person and you're probably one too. Here I am, barefoot and surrounded by cats in the mid-90s, that's the dream, isn't it?\nNot too much has changed, I still love cats, but these days I wear shoes.\nLiving in Belfast I found it difficult to keep pet cats at my rented accommodation and I've found others have experienced this, too. I first came across cat caf\u00e9s 2 years ago and fell in love with the concept. It wasn't until they started popping up in the UK that I eventually got to experience a visit for myself, which is what led me to develop my idea for Kittywinkles.\nFor the past 8 months I have been working on bringing this project to life. With the help of some fantastically talented buddies I'm ready to take the next step and share my plans with Kickstarter.\nMeet the clowder of cats behind Kittywinkles\nThere's a few people involved in bringing this idea to life\u2026\nCaitlin McClelland - Founder/Top Cat\nJonny Campbell - Design/Marketing\nFilly Campbell - Photography\nAnd we have lots of help and support from Joe, Sara and Charlie Fox.\nWe have run our plans past Belfast City Council, we have floor plans for our ideal space, we have been talking to numerous shelters and rehoming services and taking their advice onboard, some of the lil' kittywinkles are waiting to move into their new home and check out our fancy buns!\nNow we need your help to make it real.\nTimeline\nIf we're successful and everything goes to plan here's how the timeline of events will look:\n24th June - Kickstarter campaign comes to an end.\n8th July -  Final funds will be transferred to Kittywinkles.\nLate July/August - We would hope to have the Kittywinkles space locked in, the signature on the dotted line and we can then begin the catification (i.e. fit out). \nLate August/Early September - We will be introducing the cat residents to the lounge and inviting kitty critics and backers to visit.\nSeptember - Backer visits and launch party.\nSeptember/October - Open to the public!\nFloor plans\nWe have been visiting locations over the past 4 months and we've found some great spaces but we're unable to make any more progress until we have funds though that hasn't stopped us from mocking up the floor plans for our ideal space.\n  Our Kickstarter goal of \u00a320,000 is the absolute minimum amount we need to get up and running. We have big ideas and we'll be using every penny to make Kittywinkles amazing.\nWhere will the funds go?\nStretch Goals\nThe more funds we can raise the better we'll be able to make Kittywinkles for everyone, cats and humans alike. If we raise more than we need we can get a bigger and better space and we can do lots of fun things too:\nAt \u00a325k we can create a cat utopia: kitty bridges in the sky, cat trees and lots of cool board games and books for visitors.\nAt \u00a330k we can add mini drinking fountains for the resident cats to drink out of AND a giant cat flap for humans to use (c'mon, isn't that alone worth it?).\nAt \u00a335k we can upgrade the whole shebang: bigger and better premises meaning more cats, fancy new drinks and treats from far-away lands and, if the space permits it, an outdoor sun garden for kitties.\nTiers (of joy!)\nWe have put together a list of rewards we hope you'll love. Check the reward section (\u261e) for bookings. Every backer will be part of our exclusive Kittywinkles Kickstarter Club and will have access to limited specials, exclusive tastings and first dibs on some very special merchandise.\nWe also made some fun things you can hold! \n  We have a add-on rewards for you to choose from too. These rewards are unlocked when you pledge at least \u00a310. You can select an add-on by doing the following after pledging:\n1. Click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on our page and add the amount for each add-on reward you want to your TOTAL PLEDGE.\n2. When the campaign is over, you'll tell us which add-ons you want.\n3. Save your pledge and don't change the tier that you originally pledged at.\nAdd-on rewards can be picked up from Kittywinkles Cat Lounge on your visit.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nKittywinkles Badges +\u00a32.50\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nThe Trump Dump +\u00a34\n\u201cMake litter boxes great again with The Trump Dump. #TrumpDump2016\u201d\nDoes your kitty hate using the litter tray?

The animal shelters in Northern Ireland do an amazing job at caring for and rehoming cats and I decided I wanted to adopt a small herd of them for myself (but I'll share with you). Adopting an animal is a cool thing to do but if your landlord/mum/narcissistic goldfish doesn't like the idea then you can visit the Kittywinkles' cats whenever you like! It's our aim to provide our cats with a happy, permanent and enriched environment.\nI can haz?\nNo, iz mine.\nDo you need any spare cats?\nWelllll... no-but-I'd-take-them-all-if-I-could. These cats are a tight-knit gang and newcomers would have to complete a gruelling gladiator-style initiation.\nBut\u2026 I can pet a cat for free if I leave a trail of cat treats to my front door.\n'Course you can! But these kitties will be waiting for you AND we have FANCY TEA! The admission charge keeps these cats in fine satin robes and pedicures (and food and vet checks).\nI need to pick up that cat. Discuss.\nTrust me, if you plonk yourself down with a coffee the cats will approach you. Just... Stop doing that creepy smile.\nI'm on a diet and I'm not allowed to eat cat hair for 6 weeks. What else can I have?\nGood news! The caf\u00e9 area will be a strictly kitty-free zone and, hopefully, so will the bathroom.\nAren't cats meant to be free to frolic on hillsides?\nAfter being domesticated for 9500 years, cats are happy to live in pampered luxury. There will be loads of safe spaces in the caf\u00e9 and the staff will be watching to make sure they're happy and calm.\nI need more time, please!\nYou will be able to book the cat lounge for parties and occasions, just contact us! And if you just need an escape from your catless, coffeeless home, you can book as much time as you like and lounge amongst cats and WiFi all day long.\nI also love cats, can I join the Kittywinkles clowder?\nYes! Well, maybe. If our project is successful we will be looking for cat-loving staff and volunteers with experience working in a catful/caf\u00e9 environment to join us. Please get in touch if that's you: kitty@kittywinkles.com\n\u2014\nIf you have a question for us send it through and we'll add it to the list.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nYou can find our press pack here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're confident about what lies ahead and the steps we need to take to open Kittywinkles and for it to be amazing.

Gadgets, clothing, cars, art, people, places \u2013 in our daily lives we are constantly surrounded by amazing things. These things provoke memories, create deep feelings of nostalgia and we become attached to them.\nWhat if you had to choose only Five Things as your favourite things. What would they be? And, why those particular things?\n\nOver the last year I have been posing those exact questions to people from all over the world. Each person would supply a list of their five favourite things, along with the reason they chose that particular thing. The replies have been mesmerising; often poignant, emotive and at times, quite funny. These answers provide an insight into the lives of people from varying cultures, places and backgrounds.\n\nThe project forms the main part of my MFA in Multidisciplinary Design at the University of Ulster, Belfast. \nJessica Hische, Lettering Artist, double page spread\nAdrian Shaughnessy. Designer / Writer / Publisher, double page spread\nOver the last year the project has been web based, with all submissions added to the Five Things website. However; as a graphic designer \u2013 passionate about typography \u2013 it occurred to me that the perfect platform for the Five Things project would be in a design-led coffee table book. With so much beautiful copy to hand, it seemed fitting to use typography and graphic design to create a book, and some products, to showcase the answers in all their glory.\n\nThe web is incredible, but nothing beats holding, and enjoying, a beautifully printed book. The project is about amazing 'things', so it seems right and fitting to create an amazing 'thing' to showcase the project.\nAs well as the submissions, the book features an introduction written by myself, and a foreword, written by Kristian Nairn \u2013 who many will know better as an international DJ and Hodor from Game Of Thrones. Kristian was actually the first person to submit his five things, so is the perfect person to write the foreword.\nBook Size: 200 Pages (approx.) | 270mm x 210mm (portrait)\n\nTimeline:\nDecember \u2013 January: Finalise book design.\nJanuary: Proof reading, editing and meeting with printers/suppliers.\nFebruary: Tweak and finalise design, then send to print.\nMid March: Ship the book, and products, all over the world to my project backers.\nMalcolm Garrett, Graphic Designer, double page spread\nGiova Brusa / Rich Carter, double page spread\nOver 100 people.

As well as cardboard postal tubes for the prints, sturdy envelopes for the postcards, tissue paper, stickers and bubble wrap.\nFont licensing \u2013 I will purchase a licence for the typefaces used within the book.\nVideographer \u2013 My amazing videographer is Tim West. He has bills to pay, but has kindly donated his services until the Kickstarter succeeds. \nPhotography \u2013 I am outsourcing some photography to local photographers, as well as taking some myself. I will also purchase some stock imagery to use within the book and associated artwork.\nFees \u2013 Kickstarter need to make something for their amazing service too, so they deduct a fee to the total amount raised if the project is successful.

Design roller coasters, install shops and thrill rides, and top it all off with incredible scenery and dynamic landscapes. Management is key: you'll have to look after employees, resources, and park infrastructure. Fail at that and face the consequences! Unhappy cashiers might annoy guests, unhappy custodians will leave your park a mess, and unhappy ride maintenance teams will leave your guests a mess.\nWe're approaching this inspired by other games of the genre and our love for simulation games and theme parks. We're setting out to create a modern experience with new features and ideas that previous games lacked. We're creating a fun, colourful environment reminiscent of amazing theme parks around the world. With that in mind, we're focusing our visual aesthetics on the cartoony and colorful, while maintaining (mostly!) realistic ride designs.\nResources\nShops require resources to be able to sell something. You'll have to ensure a timely and efficient delivery of resources to the shops in your park. At first this might mean hauling it by hand, though other means will become available.\nEmployee Management\nShopkeepers, cashiers and ride operators keep your park running. Just like guests, they have their own needs that have to be fulfilled. Unlike guests, they require special infrastructure buildings to keep them happy. Unhappy employees could cause negative repercussions throughout the park.\nMaintaining the Illusion\nGuests don't want to see the \"behind the scenes\" parts of your park. Build separate roads, paths and utility tunnels to keep resource transports and staff discretely hidden from your guests. Scenery doesn't just make the park prettier to look at, but ensures that your guests will never get a glance at the parts of the park they shouldn't see.\nThe game you've seen so far is a vertical slice, something we put together to figure out our workflow and get the basic systems working. We've been working super hard to get everything into this state over the past few months. What we have is a solid foundation to build on.\nVariable track size and banking angle controls. (Placeholder UI)\nTrack G-force visualization mode\nWe've got the basics for roller coasters and coaster tracks working, though it will still need a lot of tweaking and polish, not to mention an actual GUI, to get it to where we want it.\nWe've put together a small selection of thrill rides so far to figure out how to make them work, now we're ready to move forward and add a lot more!\nWe've got park guests, paths for them to walk on and shops fulfilling their basic needs. Shops require resources to be transported to them by your staff. You can tweak how much of a resource goes into a sold product (for example how many ice cubes to put into a drink). This influences the desirability of the product, how much guests are willing to pay for it, and other stats.\nRide Node Editor!\nWe have also created custom editors for rides, ride stats, and balance stats. Additionally, the current UI in the game is all debug and placeholder, and we're planning on completely overhauling it with the new Unity GUI system.\nAnd of course more rides, more advanced coaster building, further guest behaviours, additional staff, and more are all planned and waiting to be built into the game.\nAs for audio, we're working with the very awesome Gordon \"A Shell in the Pit\" McGladdery, who scored and mixed our trailer! He's worked on awesome projects such as the game Rogue Legacy and the YouTube series Smarter Every Day. We're very excited to be working with him and he can't wait to get cracking on the rest of the game. Check out some of his work at the link below:\nA Shell in the Pit on Bandcamp\nWe're a tiny team of developers. We've been working on this project for months now, bringing it from a programmer-art-laden prototype to the more colourful version you see here, but we're still far from being finished. To bring it to the level of quality that we feel is respectful of your investment will take time and resources. The funds from Kickstarter will help make it a truly excellent game. We may need to hire contractors to take care of smaller jobs like helping with promotional work, or additional scenery. However, the majority of funding will go to ensure the game has polish and balance, add music and sound, and cover the many other expenses involved in a project of this scope.\nNONE. We want to make one, excellent game. Stretch goals run the risk of over-scoping the game and causing financial problems. We've decided against them after researching successful projects.\nIf we overshoot our goal, it will go towards making the game bigger and better. Some possibilities are mod support, online features (not multiplayer), map/coaster sharing (possibility of an in-game browser), and an expert mode for the coaster builder. How is that not a stretch goal in itself? We will do our best to try to add these features with whatever money we might raise, but extra funding will help us make these features easier and faster.

There will be business and preparation hurdles but more importantly the game itself is quite an undertaking. There are dozens of rides for us to build with varying amounts of animation, sound, and code work, not to mention loads of scenery and decorative items. We've built this vertical slice to reduce risk--it contains the core components of the game we want to make and solves the biggest technical challenges we were expecting. We've invested 4 full-time months into ensuring we can confidently deliver on this.\n\nThe completion date for Parkitect is an estimate based upon what we can and want to get done before we release a playable version. Some features may take longer than anticipated to implement. If we decide we need to push the date back, it will be for the good of the game. We will keep you informed and in the loop about any changes during development. Additionally, our current estimated release is for Steam Early Access.\n\nGarret and Gordon live in Vancouver, which is arguably the world's most potent hub for independent game development. We have constant access to feedback from some of the independent game world's best developers. If there's an issue and we aren't sure how to fix it, there are plenty of extremely knowledgeable people for us to ask! \n\nThere's a difficult but fun road ahead of us.

It was always going to be a bit of a long-shot trying to fund something which needed such a big commitment of time as well as money from all our backers.\n\nHuge thanks to everyone who gave us their support and were willing to believe. Sorry that we let you down. Maybe we'll try again one day.\n\nIf you would still like a t-shirt for the league that never was (and to help us recoup costs) you can buy one here in your choice of colours:\n\nwww.lbfleague.co.uk\n\nT-shirts will be screen printed by hand by me onto Fruit of the Loom cotton t-shirts. If you would like the logo printed onto something different (bubble football pants?) send me a message.\n**************************************************************************************\nBubble football is the silliest sport which I've ever had the privilege to play. It's fast, it's frantic and it's violent without being dangerous (after all, you're in a giant inflatable ball).\nI want to see it played more and played properly. I'm ready to make that happen but I need you to help me. Most of all I need you to play!\nTogether we can build a real community around bubble football, playing to win on the field but making new freinds off the field. You should be able to charge tackle someone halfway across the pitch but still help them up and go for a drink afterwards. \nMy vision for bubble football is partially inspired by the London roller derby scene because of the kind of community and competitiveness which they've built around an unusual sport (I wouldn't dare to call derby silly where any roller girl might hear me)... but also because of their commitment to awesome team and player names! Can you come up with better names for your team than these?\n\nNow is your chance to be part of the inaugural season of bubble football. Simply find a group of five (or more) people and get ready for some serious \u2013 but silly \u2013 competition. Can\u2019t find four more like-minded people? Check out the pledges for how to get involved as an individual or half-team.\nIf you're still not convinced enough to commit to a whole season, why not sign up for a friendly match? Give the sport a go and maybe you'll even be convinced to sign up for next year!\n\nAnd finally, you can also just come and watch this amazing sport being played. Either as a spectator for one match or as a supporter, following a team for a whole season.\nHow is the league structure going to work?\nThe teams will be randomly assigned groups of four. Within those groups every team will play every other team, receiving 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw and nothing for a loss.\n\nThen we'll line the whole league up by their score and put them into new groups of four with nearby teams (so low scoring teams play low scoring teams and high scoring teams play high scoring teams). We'll do this twice more, until every team has played a total of 12 matches in 4 different groups.\nExcept in exceptional circumstances the winner is likely to be in the top group of four so we will be calling that group of matches The Final and hoping they don't mess it up by letting someone from the group below overtake them.\n\nWhat about the matches?\nBecause of the strenuous nature of bubble football we'll be keeping matches short and giving players plenty of breaks. Matches will have two five minute halves.\n\nNow, I'm sure you're saying \"Only ten minutes? Not much of a game.\" but that's because you haven't yet played football in a bubble. We want the game to be accessible to people of average fitness and trust me, ten minutes is enough. We're also going to be playing on a five aside pitch and from tests so far a ten minute match results in an average 3-5 goals, enough to make for a satisfying game.\n\nBut we're not stopping there. Because the halves are short and we want the rests to be long we'll be playing several matches in a session. In fact, each group of four (see league structure) will play out all of their matches in a single session.\nA group session will go something like this:\nA vs B (1st half)\nC vs D (1st half) (while A&B rest)\nA vs B (2nd half) (while C&D rest)\nC vs D (2nd half)\nWith switchover time that should take around half an hour. All the teams now take a 10 minute rest before the next set of matches.\nA vs C (1st half)\nB vs D (1st half)\nA vs C (2nd half)\nB vs D (2nd half)\nAnother ten minute break for everyone, then the last set of matches are played.\nA vs D (1st half)\nB vs C (1st half)\nA vs D (2nd half)\nB vs C (2nd half)\nThe whole session should last around two hours, with each team playing all three of their group matches.\nHow many to a team?\nWe will be playing with five players on the field, we recommended having at least one additional player with you to swap out should a player be injured or just exhausted. We won't allow substitutions during a half but you are welcome to swap as much as you like during the break.\n\nWe have calculated most of the rewards based on teams of six, and that will be the size of the teams we put together from the \"Irregular\" and \"Half a team\" levels. But you are welcome to have more, especially if you think some of your team will struggle to make all the matches or if some of your players are likely to tire quickly.\nWho can play on my team?\nEach team will be asked to pick a team captain (this will default to the person who makes the payment unless they tell us differently). Once the captain is chosen their call will be law. If they turn up with five different players every session because the same players are never available then that is their team and their call. This is a mixed gender league. We ask only that your players be human, capable of running in a ball and over 16.\n\nWhen will we play?\nThe plan (subject to pitch availability) is to play on a weekday evening. We'll ask what nights work for you when the kickstarter closes and pick the best fit.\n\nThere will be a match every week for 20 weeks but your team will only be playing approximately once every five weeks. We'll aim to give you at least two weeks notice of your next match.\n\nIf you've just gone for a friendly then we'll give you a choice of dates which you can sign up for.\nWhat will you spend the money on?\n\u00a36000: Two sets of good quality body zorbs (20 spheres in total)\n\u00a32000: Pitch hire for league matches for one season\n\u00a31000: One year of storage space for equipment\n\u00a31500: Pay for referees for one season\n\u00a31000: Pitch hire for R&D, referee training and friendlies\n\u00a3500: T-shirts and printing\n\u00a31000: Kickstarter fees\n\nWhat if I want to play sooner?\nWe hope you'll still back us as well, but do we recommend the lovely company who lent us their bubbles for the video BLT Events.\n************************************************************************************************\n\nStretch goals\nAs the number of teams signing up goes up we'll naturally need to pay more for pitch hire and referee pay, but there will still be some left over for some extras...\n\n \u00a315,000 - A proper website (made by a professional rather than me swearing at wordpress)\n\u00a316,000 - We'll live-tweet every match (the low-tech option)\n\u00a320,000 - An youtube live stream of every match (the high tech option)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n* Creating a ruleset which really works - We have a couple of lovely game designers on board with experience of creating live games, but live games are different to sports. People care a lot more about winning in sports and are much more likely to try to cheat to make that happen. We'll need to design a robust ruleset which creates a very clear and fair winner and well trained refs to keep order.\n\n* The balls can pop - They aren't easy to pop but in the end they are inflatables. We've budgeted for two complete sets and we are fairly confident this will be enough, but if we somehow damage more than ten body zorbs beyond repair in a season we'll need to find an extra \u00a33000 for another set.\n\n* Finding a suitable pitch - We have a few in mind which are inside zone 2, fit our budget and currently have availability but we can't be absolutely certain what their availability will be like in three months time. If we hit the live streaming stretch goal we'll also need to make sure we have wifi access on site.\n\n* Recruiting referees - We need a ref and an official (ticket taker, toilet pointer-out) for every match. You can help us with that! Drop us a message if you would like to volunteer. We do intend to pay refs and officials for their time, but it won't be a fortune.

There will also be panels and hands-on activities and host over 150 local young people, learning alongside delegates from across the tech and creative industries. \nThe event is being created in partnership with the CultureTech Festival, Northern Ireland\u2019s biggest tech/media event, and Generation Innovation, which is a peer-driven movement of Northern Ireland\u2019s most ambitious young people, hosted by NISP CONNECT at the Northern Ireland Science Park and the North West Regional Science Park.\nStretch Goals\nOne down!\nWe're delighted to have hit our initial funding goal so quickly and have to send HUGE thanks to everyone who has got behind it.

We will be looking for 15 speakers from a range of different sectors as above. Many speakers will be available to stay and participate in the networking lunch and the breakout sessions.\nAims\nThe Create:2014 Team\nOur goal is to get people excited about the creative economy and the possibilities within. We want to do this in 2 ways; one is through notable people telling their stories of how they got involved with the creative economy and another way is through workshops allowing people to gain hands on experience of just some of the jobs available in this sector. \nTo us, the success of Northern Ireland depends on people realising the potential of this sector and we see this event as a way raising the profile of the creative economy in a manner based on stories, conversation, and experience rather than through traditional means like careers fairs and information leaflets.\nAudience\nHitting the streets in Derry-Londonderry\nWhile many of our audience will be young people from schools in the area, our aim is for a wide audience and we will attempt to attract some of the thousands of people who will be in the city during the week of CultureTech. \nWe want to target both those people already working in the creative economy, and also those who are yet to be 'converted'. Our target is 250 people, which will fill our venue to capacity. School groups will go free, while the main ticket price will be \u00a320 with a 50% student discount.\nSpeakers\nKate Russell\nKate Russell (BBC Click) is an English technology reporter with the BBC and currently is a presenter on the long-running BBC Click series.\nMichael Sayman (developer) is an American developer and at the age of 17 has 13 apps in the iOS App Store.

Through Sarah's extensive involvement with Generation Innovation and YENI over the past year she has come to appreciate the many opportunities N.I's close-knit business network has to offer. She is optimistic that the creative industries will allow our generation to put NI on the map. \nMatthew Carson is a 17 year old from Belfast who has worked with the NI Science Park on a range of projects in the last year. He decided to get involved with Create:2014 because he believes passionately in building a better future for this place, and sees the creative economy as being a key part of this. \nJordan Earle is a 17 year old from Belfast who has worked on a variety of non-profit projects and start-ups in the past few years. He\u2019s a keen designer, and was charged with building the brand identity for Create:2014. He got involved with Create:2014 because believes it\u2019s vital we encourage more young minds to consider alternate career paths. \nJoshua Kempton is from Ballymena, Northern Ireland and is 16. He got involved with Generation Innovation in February 2014 and this then led to becoming Create:2014's Marketing Director. He is extremely excited about spreading the word about the present and growing opportunities in the creative and tech sectors. \nGareth Reid is a 16 year old pupil from Belfast. He has worked alongside NISP for some time and is currently a finalist in their Invent 2014 competition.

I\u2019m an educator based in Belfast with a passion for design. I hope to share that passion with you at a new conference called Break, which explores what design might be if we begin to question what I call \u2018the edges of design\u2019. The conference and associated fringe events run from 12-14 November, 2014 in the lovely city of Belfast.\nI\u2019m delighted to have lined up eight world class speakers from right across the spectrum of design, to inspire you:\nSarah Richards (Head of Content Design, GDS; GOV.UK)\nNik Roope (Hulger, Plumen)\nHamish Muir (MuirMcNeil, 8vo)\nDan Rubin (MOO, The Impossible Project)\nJane ni Dhulchaointigh (Sugru, Fail Better)\nAlex Klein (Kano, Kano at Kickstarter)\nAdrian Shaughnessy (Unit Editions, Design Observer)\nMatt Webb (Berg, Little Printer)\nBreak\u2019s Speakers\nBreak\u2019s speakers will leave you feeling challenged and invigorated. They\u2019ll inspire you to question your understanding of what design might be if we move beyond the silos of specialism and, instead, embrace the wider continuum of design.\nAbove, clockwise, from top left: Sarah Richards (GOV.UK), Nik Roope (Plumen), Dan Rubin (MOO) and Hamish Muir (MuirMcNeil).\nSarah Richards is Head of Content Design at the UK\u2019s Government Digital Service (GDS). GDS\u2019s design for GOV.UK won the Design Museum\u2019s 2013 Design of the Year Award and a highly coveted Black Pencil in the Writing for Design category at the D&AD Awards. A highly respected content designer, Richards\u2019 thoughts on content as design are challenging our understanding of the role content plays as a core part of design.\nNik Roope is Founder and Executive Creative Director of Poke, an award-winning digital agency. Roope\u2019s work has won multiple awards. Roope\u2019s Plumen light bulbs - beautifully designed low energy light bulbs \u2013 won a highly sought after D&AD Black Pencil in addition to winning the Design Museum\u2019s 2011 Design of the Year Award. Roope\u2019s work is held in the MOMA permanent collection, The Cooper-Hewitt collection and the V&A collection.\nHamish Muir is one of the world\u2019s most highly respected graphic designers. A founding partner of award-winning design consultancy 8vo, whose work for Manchester\u2019s Factory Records, and numerous other internationally respected brands, is celebrated worldwide. 8vo\u2019s typography journal Octavo (1986-1992), remains, without question, one of the world\u2019s most respected typography publications. In 2010, together with Paul McNeil, Muir co-founded MuirMcNeil, a project based collaborative whose activities are focused on exploring parametric design systems.\nDan Rubin is the former Creative Director of MOO.com, one of the world\u2019s most innovative digital companies. A highly respected photographer, with a considerable following on Instagram, Rubin has consulted with The Impossible Project, a grass roots initiative to develop instant film for Polaroid cameras (founded when Polaroid ceased producing instant film for Polaroid cameras in 2008).\nAbove, clockwise, from top left: Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh (Sugru), Alex Klein (Kano), Matt Webb (Berg) and Adrian Shaughnessy (Unit Editions).\nJane ni Dhulchaointigh developed Sugru - derived from the Irish word \u2018s\u00fagradh\u2019 for \u2018play\u2019 \u2013 whilst studying at the Royal College of Art. As ni Dhulchaointigh puts it, \u201cThe future needs fixing.\u201d This spirit of sustainability has seen ni Dhulchaointigh speak at numerous respected conferences including WIRED and 99U. Her single-minded spirit is inspirational and her thoughts on failure and fixing are hugely necessary.\nAlex Klein launched a Kickstarter in 2013, hoping to hit a $100,000 goal to realise his vision for Kano, a computer which you make yourself. By the time his crowdfunding appeal had finished, he\u2019d hit $1.5 Million ($1,522,160 to be precise). Kano is re-imagining computing for young and old alike, it\u2019s an incredible project that rethinks computers \u2013 and their users \u2013 for the 21st century.\nAdrian Shaughnessy is an internationally respected design critic. In addition to his writing for some of the world\u2019s leading design journals - Eye, Creative Review, Design Observer\u2026 \u2013 he is the co-founder of Unit Editions a publisher of high-quality, affordable books on graphic design and visual culture, which has, in its short existence, deservedly captured a sizable share of the design publishing market.\nMatt Webb is CEO at Berg, the design studio turned tech startup he co-founded in 2005. An internationally respected speaker on the role of design and technology in culture, Webb has been instrumental in exploring the growing importance of \u2018The Internet of Things\u2019. Webb\u2019s work, in particular Little Printer, places design at the heart of a growing connected digital culture.\nMy Vision\nI believe it\u2019s an exciting time to be a designer. Design is, once again, joining the dots and, with the right thinking, I believe we can embrace it to create incredible opportunities.\nBreak\u2019s branding is inspired by the edges of design, exploring their intersections. This echoes the conference\u2019s purpose, to explore design in the widest sense.\nMy goal with Break is to encourage attendees to widen their frame of reference, to see design in the widest sense, and becoming better designers in the process. In addition to the core conference day, I\u2019ve lined up some exciting fringe activities, which offer an unmissable reason to visit Belfast in November.\nFringe Activities\nFringe activities offer additional value for money and, just as importantly, a space to meet other, like-minded people, making new friends and perhaps future colleagues.\nJonny Campbell (Brewbot) and Sarah Parmenter (You Know Who) enjoy a post talk pint.\nAn Afternoon With Shopify\nWe\u2019re delighted to be partnering with our friends at Shopify to once again run An Afternoon With Shopify. We\u2019ve lined up some great speakers who will entertain you and challenge you the day before the conference:\nElliot Jay Stocks (Creative Director, Typekit)\nVerne Ho (Director of Design, Shopify)\nRyan Rumsey (Experience Design, Nestl\u00e9)\nSituated in The Black Box, nestled in the heart of Belfast\u2019s historic Cathedral Quarter, this fringe event is ideal for attendees who\u2019d like to spend a little more time in Belfast and offers a great opportunity to meet other like-minded designers.\nA Rather Large Tutorial\nAn evening talk at The Belfast School of Art, A Rather Large Tutorial sets the scene for the following day. It\u2019s optional, should you prefer to explore our local bars or spend time with friends.\nAfterparty\nA conference wouldn\u2019t be a conference without an afterparty. I\u2019m delighted to be partnering with MailChimp to offer you an afterparty where the drink will be flowing, be it Guinness or Ballygowan, and the craic (as we say in Ireland) will be mighty. Sl\u00e1inte!\nThe City and the Venue\nBelfast is rapidly establishing itself as a key player on a world stage: Andy McMillan\u2019s sterling work with Build needs no introduction; the team at Typecast are taking the wonderful world of web typography to new heights; and Cargo\u2019s recently unveiled Brewbot is rightly winning the praise it deserves.\nThe craic is mighty and the bars are warm and friendly. I\u2019d highly recommend our local, The Duke of York (above).\nBelfast is firmly on the map, right where it deserves to be. We think you\u2019ll love the city, the people are warm and friendly and by keeping the numbers at the conference low (around 350 attendees) we hope that Break will give you a chance to make new connections, through its intimate feel.\nJoin us at a venue with a difference. The Assembly Buildings in Belfast is a recently restored church with beautiful stained glass, gargoyles, and a wonderful church organ. We think it\u2019s a beautiful space that has real character.\nBelfast is easy to get to, with two international airports served by numerous low cost airlines. We\u2019ve lined up discounts with some of the city\u2019s best hotels, we\u2019ll list these on the conference web site once we, hopefully, hit our funding goal.\nThe Edges of Design Ebook\nIn addition to the obligatory schwag, all attendees at the conference will receive a copy of an ebook we're compiling called The Edges of Design. This book will bring together new thinking on design by a host of writers whose opinions we respect. Writers we\u2019ve confirmed, include:\nAdrian Shaughnessy (Unit Editions)\nRichard Weston (Ace Jet 170)\nJonny Campbell (Brewbot)\nIf you can\u2019t make the conference, we\u2019d appreciate your support by buying a copy of The Edges of Design, a beautifully designed publication that will challenge and inspire you. We\u2019ll be publishing further details of writers in our Kickstarter updates, we think you\u2019ll appreciate their thinking.\nRewards\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to keep tickets affordable. Thanks to our generous sponsors we\u2019ve been able to keep prices within the reach of all. As an educator, it\u2019s important to me that students have the opportunity to hear internationally respected speakers and we\u2019ve priced student tickets accordingly. (Student ID required.)\nBack Break at the Bauhaus tier and you\u2019ll get a beautiful, hand printed limited edition silkscreen print celebrating Dieter Rams\u2019 iconic RT 20 radio.\nWe\u2019ve kept our next tier of Constructivist tickets priced low to attract freelancers. We know how important it is to get out of the studio and meet others, we hope Break\u2019s pricing helps with that. For those who\u2019d like to spend a little more to support us, we\u2019re working on some lovely rewards, all inspired by the edges of design approach of the branding.\nAt the De Stijl tier, we\u2019ve created some lovely additional rewards, including an Edges of Design T Shirt, a set of Edges of Design Collectors Cards, and a unique generative laser-etched aero-ply totem as a memento of the conference (we think you\u2019ll like it). At the top Bauhaus tier, we\u2019re working on a lovely two colour silkscreen print featuring Dieter Rams\u2019 gorgeous RT 20 radio (above). In a signed and number edition of 30, we\u2019ll be hand printing these with the assistance of one of our MFA graduates, Pauline Clancy. We think you\u2019ll like them.\nYour Host, Mr Murphy\nWho am I?\nI\u2019m an educator, based in Belfast where I teach at The Belfast School of Art. Break is an extension of the teaching ethos I\u2019ve developed through my MFA Multidisciplinary Design programme.\nThe MFA embraces design in the widest sense and our graduates have gone on to achieve great things all over the world: Paddy Donnelly runs Lefft, when he's not building wonderful iOS games at Wee Taps; Lee Munroe leads product and user experience design at Mailgun; Katherine Penney works at Heatherwick Studio; Jonny Campbell co-founded Brewbot; Danny Turley founded Performa Sports; and Kyle Gawley and David Turner are currently building Get Invited, re-imagining what ticketing might be.\nWhat ties these graduates together is that they embraced design as a continuum, allowing them to see beyond the edges of design and build fantastic companies. This is what I hope Break will also achieve.\nSponsors\nWe\u2019re delighted to have secured some wonderful sponsors who are helping to support our vision and make Break a reality.\nWe have lots of ideas for really special things that would be great for both sponsors and attendees, and we\u2019d love to discuss these further. If you\u2019re interested in sponsoring Break, we\u2019d love to hear from you. We have sponsorship tiers at Gold and Silver levels, which include tickets and your branding on all associated Break material.\nWe\u2019d love to partner with sponsors to make Break a reality and ensure it delivers to its full potential. Drop us a line at @breakconf and we\u2019ll work with you to create something awesome.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough I have experience running events \u2013 having been involved in running fringe events at Build and other conferences, and organising the Ulster Festival of Art and Design \u2013 I know this will be a significant challenge. However, I believe the team I have in place is ideally equipped to make Break a reality.\n\nI'm delighted to be working with my friends at Little Thunder, who are heavily assisting me. Both Tim and Gab, in addition to running Little Thunder, work with me at The Belfast School of Art, teaching the next generation of interaction designers. I'm also being assisted by Paul McCormack, the final pillar of our teaching team. Lastly, I'm being assisted by my wife, Cara, who is both an internationally respected silversmith and a mean project manager.\n\nWith our combined \u00a320,000 Kickstarter goal and the generous contributions of our sponsors we have enough to create a fantastic conference, I hope you\u2019ll back me and my team in making Break a reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Not long now\u2026", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Shaping Up", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Perfect Partners", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Hotels and Accommodation", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Getting Here", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "We Made It!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Thank You, All!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "The Fringe", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "The Afternoon", "update_content": ""}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "227 backers pledged \u00a323,870"}]}], "comment_no": 7, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fehler/break-a-conference-that-questions-the-edges-of-des", "project_name": "Break: A Conference That Questions the Edges of Design"}}, {"backer": "Steven Hylands", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Goal:\nFFTL and ROSS ROBINSON in the studio 2006\nSo, what we hope to achieve by doing this Kickstarter is basically up to how much the funding makes possible!\nThe absolute #1 goal is to make a new record. What we are asking for will make it possible for us to pay for the recording, as well as any travel and related expenses.\nAfter that, if we continue to raise more than the goal, then things like a new music video, new episodes of FFTLTV, etc., will all become possible.\nThe Story:\nFirst photoshoot with Sonny and being with Epitaph records\nSO, if you've been a fan of FFTL at pretty much any point, you probably know this is a band with a lot of back story.\nIt all started in high school. I (Matt Good) had become heavily interested in music, and was in a band called First Too Last.\nFirst Too Last\nWe were basically a Blink 182 rip off haha. We played locally in Florida a lot though, and that is what led me to meeting Travis.\nTravis Richter early days\nAfter knowing Travis for some time and playing with his band called Eastdale, we decided to team up together and he joined my band which was modified to be called \"From First To Last.\"\nAt that point, we had gone through a few members, mostly just local friends, until we met Derek Bloom.\nDerek Bloom early days\nThe first time I ever met Derek, he actually found me on a VERY early social media site, far before Myspace or even Friendster. He saw that I played guitar and asked me to play in a black metal band that he drummed for. I of course said yes, and that is when my friendship with Derek began. Not too long after that, I asked him to join FFTL, and he said yes. Soon after, Derek's friend from LA, Jon Weisberg joined FFTL to play bass.\nThe last piece of the early puzzle was our frontman screamer, Phil Reardon. After Phil joined FFTL, we started heavily pursuing touring. We had very little interest in spending too much time trying to grow locally before we expanded nationally, so we started booking our own tours on a site called BYOFL.org. Most of the shows were cancelled - we usually didn't get paid, and had to think of VERY creative ways to obtain gas and food lol (we won't go into too much detail there). But at the end of the day, we were out there feeling like we were pushing forward in some way, even if it was inches at a time.\nOne day, we played a show in Long Island with a band who was on a label owned by a local guy named Bob. They sent Bob our stuff, and he loved it. He ended up signing us to his indie label, and from there the Aesthetic Ep was born.\nAesthetic EP cover\nRecorded in Valdosta, GA with our friend Lee Dyess, we spent about 2 weeks making this EP. Our excitement was uncontainable.\nAfter making that EP, things started happening for us. Not all at once, but we got a manager, and a couple of better tours that actually had people at them! Also, some labels started to show interested in what we were doing. After talking to many labels, we ended up going with Epitaph. Brett Gurewitz flew all the way to our super shitty apartment and hung out with us, showed us Bad Religion solos on guitar, and he was just the most down to earth awesome guy ever. We were sold.\nIn the next few months, we ended up having personal and creative differences with Phil, so we parted ways. Since we were planning on pursuing a little more clean singing instead of screaming at this point, I was only going to sing and we planned to find a new guitar player to fill my shoes.\nFlash forward a couple months: at this point, Myspace was a thing that was coming up quickly, and I had met a dude on there named Sonny Moore who lived in LA. \nSonny Moore early 2000's\nOne day, Sonny hit me up cause he heard we were seeking a new guitar player. He was super enthusiastic, showed me some songs over the phone that he could play, and we decided he should come out to Georgia to hang out and see if he fit the part. This to me at the time was so crazy - I believe he was just turning 16, and his parents were all about it. That was something I was definitely not accustomed to haha.\nWhen Sonny arrived at the studio, a very large chunk of the Dear Diary record was already recorded and I had finished vocals on a few songs. While Sonny was there he asked me if I wanted any help working out vocal ideas on a song, and I said sure. Shortly after this I realized, \"Wow! this kid has a great voice.\" I asked him if he would be interested in getting behind the mic and trying to sing over one of the tracks. I would say not even 2-3 hours later, after only knowing him for maybe 2 days, we asked him to join the band. Obviously the label was confused (haha), but we sent them some tracks and they got fully onboard... And that is how that era was born! Soon after, our first full length, \"Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has A Bodycount\" was released.\nDear Diary album cover\nFollowing this, we did every tour we possibly could for awhile. It was fun and we did well, but it almost felt like we had missed the mark on the record. The reaction was positive at first, but dismissive in a way. So we started brain storming what we could do to make a better 2nd record! \nBut then somehow in a way I still can't explain, everything changed. The record started selling WAY more copies, and the tours got better. By the time we got to the following years playing Warped Tour it was like we were a totally different band. We were seeing our stuff in shopping malls, and our online presence was growing to be huge. In that moment, it felt like everything was coming together.\nWith the fire under our asses of wanting to make a better second record, and Epitaph's full support, we reached out to Ross Robinson.\nRoss Robinson\nRoss Robinson has produced some of the most influential records of my entire life and, to me, is a genius. We honestly didn't even expect to hear back from him. But, we did! I honestly remember feeling like all our brains were gonna explode all over our van when we found out he was on board to do the record. That was one of the happiest moments of my life.\nThe record was an insane amount of work. We would do 10 hour pre-production days every single day. Derek's hand were covered in blood and blisters. It was crazy, but in the best way! \nWe had recently parted ways with our bass player, Jon Weisberg, and were in need of a new bass player. At first we were going to record the bass ourselves, but then Ross suggested his \"friend Wes\" play the bass. Wait, \"friend Wes?\" You mean Wes Borland??\nFrom FIrst To Last with Wes Borland\nWe were obviously all for this because Wes is undoubtedly one of the best musicians and artists I have ever met and worked with. \nBy the time we got up to Weed, CA to record this thing, I can honestly say there is no way we could have been more prepared. We spent 3-4 weeks in Weed before returning to LA to finish the rest at Ross's house in Venice. The record was named, \"Heroine.\"\nHeroine album cover\nI still, to this day, consider this our finest work. The amount of thought, feeling, musicianship, personality, and scrutiny put into this album is beyond even my memory of it, I am pretty sure.\nWhen returning to the road, the band was on fire, and Wes had decided to join the band on tour for quite some time. It was an amazing time for the band. We were featured on the cover of Alternative Press magazine,\nFFTL AP cover\nselling out headlining tours, and up to doing the FalloutBoy Black Clouds and Underdogs tour with All American Rejects and Hawthorne Heights. Our record was released on that tour and I actually remember seeing every band on the bill on the top 50 of Billboard at the same time, a completely surreal moment.\nIt wasn't too long after all of this that things started to change. Sonny was experiencing problems with his voice, and shows and tours started to become cancelled. People often ask me exactly what led to Sonny leaving the band and I can honestly say I don't know if there is really one, simple answer. I just think that sometimes if you are feeling unhappy in a situation you're in, sometimes the best thing you can do is to change the situation for yourself. Sonny officially left the band at the end of 2006, although we didn't officially announce it for quite a few months after that.\nAfter Sonny left, we were faced with a lot of challenges and questions. We determined the band had come too far to just let it die. It was decided that we should go back to me singing like before, and try to see what happens. At this point, FFTL signed with Interscope/Suretone and started working on our next release. We also picked up our new bass player, Matt Manning.\nMatt Manning\nAfter about a year of writing, demoing, and recording, our self-titled full length was released. \nFrom FIrst To Last Self Titled\nLooking back on that album, I can say there are some things I would have done differently, but I think it's a great album with great songs. People were kind of confused because the sound was a pretty massive departure from Heroine, but the way we saw it was that it was better to change and become something new instead of try to imitate what we were. In that situation, I don't know if there really was a right answer to make everyone happy, but I do know that the band meant so much to me that I was willing to try anything that I could to keep it alive. After this record was released, we did some of the best tours and festivals we have ever been a part of. I can honestly say that it was a very successful journey. We played every major European music fest, toured with KISS, played with The Cure, and ended with Soundwave in Australia.\nFFTL playing with HIM and The Cure MTV WInter Break in Spain\nAfter that touring cycle, the band took a break and started to work on its 4th record. We decided to move to Rise Records for this album, and we went back to Valdosta, GA to record with our original guy, Lee Dyess. Over the course of a few months, \"Throne to the Wolves\" was created.\nFrom First To Last- Throne to the Wolves\nThis is probably my second favorite album we ever did. I really feel like by the time we made this record, we had grown up a lot and following our experiences with the last record, we had a lot to say. This was our kind of \"leave it all out on the table\" kind of record. This album seemed to be accepted far more by our older fans and critics than the last record. We toured off of this for about a year, but whether it was timing, or whatever, it just felt like it was time to take a break. In 2010, FFTL was officially put on hiatus. \nNow is the time:\nOver the last 4 years since we announced our hiatus, there have always been people asking me when the band is going to come back and release new material. What I didn't realize until not long ago is that the amount of people asking has been growing significantly each year. All of us have been off doing other things, musical and non-musical, but this is the time. I have reached out to the members of the band, and have heard back from many. What is to come from here is something that no one knows, but I do know this: With your support, an AMAZING record is about to be made. The rest of the guys and I are excited to do something completely and utterly awesome, now more than ever. My goal is to walk away from this thing knowing that I just made the record of my life.\nThis record will contain 6 - 7 songs and will feature friends, old and new. I, for one, am ready to make some music that sounds like dragons spitting fire all over godzilla, if you know what I mean! I plan on this being the most epic From First To Last record ever made! \nSo, if you decide to contribute to this Kickstarter, I just want to say thank you.

If a car was parked in the neighbourhood where Chalky lives, before long he would be over to investigate it. The bonnets would often be warm from the engine heat and neighbours or strangers would often return to their car to find him sitting or fast asleep on it. \nOne thing that Chalky particularly enjoyed was looking up the tail pipe of cars and being a white cat he would often return home with a black ring of soot on his face and so the story was born.\nIllustration\nThe book is being illustrated by Jordan Henderson. We first came across Jordan\u2019s work in his debut book Upon a Star, a children\u2019s book about a boy on a surreal journey to wish upon a star. \nExcerpt from Jordan's book - Upon a Star\nWe instantly fell in love with Jordan\u2019s unique style and lovingly handcrafted visuals.

You want a filter module? Turn your Patchblock into one! You want a crazy sounding bassline synth with built-in arppegiator? Make it so! We provide you with an empty canvas, your imagination fills it. Visit us on:\npatchblocks.com\nHow does it work?\nAll you need is a Patchblock, a Mac or Windows PC and our free software. The software allows you to program your hardware module the way you want. This is done in a so called \u201cvisual programming language\u201d, in other words, you don't have to go into 100% geek mode and write code to make it happen. Visual programming is easy, you choose from a variety of low level sound processing elements and combine their functions by connecting them with virtual cables \u2013 a bit like a modular synthesiser, but in software. Your library of software modules includes signal generators and processors (e.g. oscillators, filters, delays etc.), signal routing options and even modules for algorithmic composition. Our editor lets you emulate how your patch will sound and once you\u2019re happy with it you can upload it to your Patchblock hardware simply by connecting it via USB. Once programmed you can unplug the Patchblock and jam away. \nWhat can I do with them?\nA lot, it's really up to you. Plug some of your other gear in and use them as a sound processor if you want. Make an awesome noise box that produces pure digital filth. Let them play a concerto of chaos based algorithmic sequences. But also don't forget to think outside the box! Because you can combine several Patchblocks, you can make them work together. One Patchblock could for example generate an LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) that you plug into another block to modulate processes that happen in there. Or you can create a chain of audio effects and processes. You can do this analogue style, by connecting them with audio cables, or via a digital connection, by clicking the Patchblocks together directly. Or even both!\nDemo sounds\nThese examples have been produced with a single Patchblock:\nThis is an old-school Yamaha kids keyboard plugged into a Patchblock:\nThis is a little jam with two Patchblocks clicked together, nothing else:\n( you can also listen to Patchblocks demos on SoundCloud )\nPatchblocks feature:\nstereo audio input\nstereo audio output\n2 channel digital input\n2 channel digital output\n2 assignable knobs\n2 assignable illuminated buttons\ntough 5mm machined acrylic enclosure panels\nUSB chargeable LiPo battery\n10bit / 20K sampling rate audio - it sounds fatter than you expect!\nPick your colour\nPatchblocks come in 4 different colours. You can choose between:\nWhite enclosure, white PCB, blue LEDs\nPink enclosure, white PCB, blue LEDs\nBlack enclosure, black PCB, red LEDs\nYellow enclosure, black PCB, red LEDs\nShare your patches online\nBe a creator, not a consumer! Become part in our community. You can upload your patches to our website www.patchblocks.com. Other users will be able to download, rate, and discuss your work. Patches can be opened and edited in the software, so that everyone can see how they were built, and develop them further.\nOur website also offers a forums section where you can connect with other users, get help, and get involved with ongoing development.\nDig into the nitty gritty\nIf you are a coder, great! All low level DSP blocks of the editor library are based on simple XML files that contain a section with C-code. If you want to, you can even code your own low level DSP effects. Excited? So are we! We need people like you to expand our library. Share your blocks on our website, and if we like them, they will be part of the next release.\nWhat do you get?\nYou get a nice little box with a Patchblock, a mini-USB cable and a stereo mini-jack audio cable. \nWhat do we need the money for?\nSo far the project was funded by an Arts Council programme here in Belfast. This funding allowed us to develop the hardware to its current state and produce a small prototype series. This means we already have a supply chain established and tested. Now we would like to go into production, but don't have the funds for it. In order to keep component costs down we would have to place a larger order in the region of 1000 units. Throughout the development our goal was to keep Patchblocks affordable. Therefore we have to build lots, so that you can get them cheap.\nWhat is the project plan?\nIf we are successful, we will order components for 1000 units right away. We will ask our PCBA supplier to assemble 200 boards first. Once we receive those, we test the quality and give the OK for assembling the remaining boards. That means if you pledge for \u00a335, you can get one in January. The remaining units will be shipped out from February on. This approach allows us to go through an additional phase of quality control, and if necessary, make design changes or inform our supplier of problems.\nFor those who pledge for \u00a340, great! You are going to be a driving force in the development, because you will be able to play with Patchblocks before anyone else. Request features in the forums, upload patches and maybe DSP blocks. You can support us with more than just money.\nWho is behind Patchblocks?\nThis project grew out of my (Sebastian Heinz) PhD research at the Sonic Arts Research Centre in Belfast. I was trying to find a way to combine the flexibility of software with the tangibility and collaborative aspects of hardware. I am originally from Stuttgart, Germany, where I worked mainly on software and database projects for print publishers. However, I wanted to focus more on creative technology. This challenge made me quit my job, get an MA in Design for Interactive Media and eventually brought me here to Belfast as a PhD student. I was lucky to get some Arts Council funding here in Northern Ireland to turn the Patchblocks idea into a commercial product.\nThe evolution of Patchblocks\nI started to work on the project about 4 years ago, with only little experience in electronics, PCB design, embedded micro-controller technology, and desktop application development in C++. But I had a good understanding and vision of the interaction experience I was aiming for - some cross-breed between MAX/MSP, Arduino, Moog, and Lego. I had to learn that hardware development is a slow and tedious process due to long iteration cycles and difficult debugging. Particularly the audio input implementation took various iterations, in order to reduce noise levels. Once I received some funding support, I was hoping to be able to afford a proper injection moulded enclosure design. Unfortunately, the tool-manufacturing cost was still outside my budget. This might have turned out to the better though, as the 5mm machined acrylic panels give Patchblocks a tough, yet elegant techno-look, and a nicer and heavier feel than a cheap plastic enclosure. The Patchblocks hardware was ready in March this year, but lead-time delays of some components of the prototype series (due to an earthquake in Taiwan), intellectual property negotiations with my University, and eventually the determination of patentability delayed the launch until now. Patchblocks is currently being beta-tested by local electronic musicians, including Boxcutter. Have a look at the various stages of the hardware evolution.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe split the production into two parts. The first small series is to determine the quality of our supplier. Should there be quality issues with the first series, this might delay the production of the second. So, if you pledge for \u00a330, there is the risk that there is a further delay. For the same reason we also offer only 160 units of the first series for January, despite ordering 200, so that we allow for 40 boards that would not meet our quality standards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Patchblocks presents the minijam studio", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nIt's been a while, but here at Patchblocks, we think it's about time you all got an update on what's going on.\nBehind the scenes we're working hard to come up with improvements for your favourite programmable mini synth modules, and to that end we've hired a few local developers to help update and improve our software.\nSo, we've devised a competition to get everyone prepared for the next release!\nWIN A RAINBOW SET:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Win a Rainbow Set", "update_content": "Hi Backers,\nI have been quiet for a while, sorry about that.

As brewers, we understood what we needed and as a result we have been able to build a product that not only works, but looks great too.\nMany other brewing setups take up large amounts of room. They are usually unappealing and often tucked away, out of sight. Our aim is to bring brewing out of the garage and into the home. \nRender of our pre-production design.\nAs most home-brewers typically do, we started our journey into brewing using plastic containers and pipes. As we iterated on our setup we were constantly optimizing and went from plastic containers to stainless steel. Because of the cost we used copper piping, but it is our aim to move to a stainless steel design.\nWe researched what was readily available in the catering industry and strived to use as many off-the-shelf components we could.\nUsing Arduino allowed us to rapidly prototype and iterate on different methods and configurations of software and hardware, giving us flexibility to focus on building Brewbot, and automating the brewing process. Arduino is a well-proven electronic prototyping platform and we were able to leverage the vast community and resources that it offers.\nPrototyping\nUsing our extensive knowledge in iOS we rapidly prototyped a manually controlled interface, iterating on the design and refining the steps. \nAn early iPad app for monitoring temperatures and times, and operating valves and pumps manually.\nOur current prototype uses copper piping but with your help we can use stainless steel with disconnects to help make Brewbot a cleaner system that lasts longer.\nWhere we're at now.\nBrewbot is beginning to come to life. We have built an amazing prototype and we're almost there. We know what we have to do and what we'd like to improve. On the software side, we are in the process of refining our user interface and adding features.\nWe are so passionate about this project that we have moved the whole team to Portland, Oregon as it is the micro-brewery capital of America. We are spending a month on the West Coast sourcing fabricators, materials and components to make Brewbot happen.\n  How does it work?\nThe whole process is pretty simple. Buy your ingredients from a local brew-shop or online, setup your recipe in the app and connect your iPhone to Brewbot.  \n\nCreate or choose a recipe to begin brewing. Tap \u2018Start Brew\u2019 to automatically add the exact amount of water to be heated. Once heated the valve in the container releases and the water runs into the mashtun, where the grain lies.\n\nAt the end of the process the wort filters through the plate cooler, cooling it from 100\u00b0C to under 22\u00b0C, now ready to ferment.\n\nWe have used stainless steel vessels as fermentation tanks. They are sealed and opaque as hops are light sensitive. Light (specifically UV rays) will skunk the beer and produce off-flavors.\n\nStackable fermentation tank, branded for XOXO conference\nBrewbot demo video:\nA video demonstrating water flow around the system, heating, and temperature sensing with feedback during the process.\nPrototype technical specification:\nDimensions: 121cm x 40cm x 119cm\nWeight: ~100 kg\nBoiler Output: 2000 Watts\nBrew Size: 20 Litres/5.2 Gallons\nBluetooth LE Connectivity\n125kW Plate Cooler\nArduino Based Control\nFlow Sensors\nLoad Sensors\nTemperature Sensors (\u00b10.5\u00b0C)\nStainless Steel Motorized Valves\nNative iPhone iOS 7 support\nPower Supply: 240 volts (currently UK compatible, US voltage will be supported)\nStainless Steel Containers.\nIntegrated recipe system\nWe have built a recipe platform right into the app, allowing brewers to add and tweak recipes.\nSmartphone connectivity\nBrewbot currently talks to your iPhone via Bluetooth, giving you all the required feedback you need, from adding the grain on brew day to how long you have to wait for the brew to ferment.\nAccurate measurements\nBased on your recipe Brewbot enters the exact amount of water required for the brew. This can be adjusted using the app.\nSensor technology\nWe have used temperature sensors, load sensors, and flow meters to ensure you understand what is happening from start to finish. These sensors assist with the automation.\nOptimal brewing techniques\nYou can brew up to 20 litres (or just over 5 gallons) of beer. Brewbot is flexible and allows you to brew using no-sparge and batch sparging techniques which means it recirculates the water over the grain bed and cuts the brew time.\nBetter beer for less\nCraft beer can be expensive but now everyone has the power to brew beer themselves for as little as 26p/42\u00a2 for a 330ml/12oz bottle.\nCustom facades\nWe are offering a number of facades and we have options that can be branded so it can be customized to fit in with your home, office, restaurant or bar. The possibilities are endless.\nBrewbot prototype and app\nCompatibility:\nOur skills as designers and developers align most suitably to iOS, that's why we made the decision to develop our prototype for iPhone.\nWorking on iPhone allowed us to more easily pull together all the pieces in order to automate the brewing process and achieve our goals for the app both technically and visually. Support of Bluetooth LE in the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 gave what we immediately needed in development of our prototypes and having support on Android and other platforms would be an aim of ours beyond our initial Kickstarter.\nBrewbot Core [update]\nWe have received a lot of feedback from brewers who already have a system in place but wish to monitor, control, and/or automate it, like Brewbot. We realise we can offer this as a product to offer the technology that makes Brewbot work to others. Community is important to us so we wanted to open this up. \nBrewbot Core is unit that offers an extendable collection of the sensors and valves, fully customisable brew processes (even double sparge and step mashing), custom mapping of sensors to various outputs, have the full power of our software including scheduling system, Wi-Fi connectivity, recipe management system, cleaning modes, integration with other systems via our API, and also access to future products, such as our TV dashboard and Android app.\nWe've added two new pledges; Brewbot Core and Brewbot Core + Starter Kit.\n\nFeatures of Brewbot Core:\nReal-time notifications\nBuilt-in calendar support. Get notified when the boil is ready, a strike temperature is hit, when it\u2019s time to dry hop, when it\u2019s time to bottle.\nWi-Fi connectivity\nA Wi-Fi base station that can be standalone or connect your brewery to an existing network. Connect to your Android or iOS device.\nRecipe management\nSend recipe data to your smart brewery format, or input via the app. Comes with the same recipe tweaking ability as Brewbot.\nCustom brew processes\nSetup Brewbot Core to your desired brew process, timings, sparge technique, mashing technique. Brewbot Core offers full flexibility to suit your needs.\nSensor mapping\nAdd your temperature and flow sensors and setup what they do and control. e.g. Set temperature sensor one to open a two-way valve.\nManual control\nBased on the inputs and outputs defined you will get a custom interface to manually control outputs and monitor input sensors.\nCleaning modes\nSeveral preset functions that can be used to rinse your system out.\nExtendable\nWant a custom sensor or add even more? Brewbot Core can be upgraded through connections and software.\nBrewbot Core technical specification:\nThe core specification for Brewbot Core is:\n\n8 x Inputs (e.g. Temperature Probes, Flow Meters)\n8 x Outputs (Valves) \n2 x Pump Outputs \n1 x SSR Switch\nPID Control\nWorldwide Electrical Support\nThe starter kit is only the starting point to add monitoring, automation, and recipe integration to your system. You can extend this beyond this setup to suit your needs.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe\u2019ve created a fully functional prototype and it has proven extremely effective. We have spent the last several months putting it through its paces and have brewed a lot of beer along the way.\nWe've explored lots of ways to bring Brewbot to life but the only way we can see it getting into the hands of others is to use Kickstarter. We want to make it more affordable and the only way we can do that is by manufacturing in large numbers.\nSo far we have been able to fund the development of the project but now we need your help to take the product further. We believe if Brewbot existed we could empower discerning amateurs, home-brewers, and breweries to become better.\nProduction plan:\nWhat we will do whilst in the US:\nSource fabricators to help manufacture Brewbot in the US\nMeet brewers to help refine the project\nFind suppliers to help provide raw materials\nMeet people to help with the shipping of the project.\nWe want to bring the same personality that we bring to each brew to every unit we ship:\nThe priority after a successful project is to work on the stainless steel structure that forms the basis of Brewbot\nOnce this has completed our team of woodworkers will put in place the prepared wood\nEach valve, pump and flow meter will be installed into the unit\nThe electronics assembly that monitors and controls every detail of the unit will be installed, calibrated and tested\nAfter each Brewbot is assembled we will run through a series of tests for quality control.\nGlobal availability:\nWe are currently focusing our efforts on the UK, Ireland, Australia, and US. If we meet our goal we guarantee seamless delivery in these countries, we will endeavor to achieve the necessary certifications for other countries but if we can't we will refund backers in the countries we can't deliver to.\nShipping and delivery:\nIf we get funded we want to use our funds to optimize the weight of Brewbot to keep shipping costs as low as possible. Brewbot is a sizable, ready-constructed unit and as such currently costs \u00a3100/$160 to ship within the UK and it would be a similar cost in the US. We want to reduce this cost when we go into production by sourcing fabricators in the UK and the US. We will be in touch when our project ends with individual shipping prices for your country i.e. UK and Ireland, EU, US, Canada, or Australia.\nHow will the project funds be used?\nWe have a real working prototype, but there's still a lot to do. With your support we can finish the first production-run of Brewbot and get it out into the world. Your backing will help fund:\nSourcing components and materials\nWe are currently using copper for piping but we want to use stainless steel. Stainless steel doesn't corrode or oxidize and can be used with more cleaning products than copper can.\nOptimizing the product \nWe are continuously trying to optimize Brewbot particularly in two areas:\nHeating - we are using off-the-shelf induction heaters but we want to explore form and power in order to design a solution that is efficient\nSensors - currently using temperature sensors that are within 0.5\u00b0C but with your help we can achieve an even more accurate reading.\n\nElectronics - we are currently using Arduino but we are hoping to use our own micro-controller to optimize the threading. We need to optimize the product for both the UK and US voltage systems.\nFinal engineering to meet necessary safety regulations\nAs we will be initially launching in the UK there are three EU directives that apply in order for us to get CE approval:\nLow Voltage - electrical safety (low voltage as opposed to high voltage)\nRadio and telecommunications terminal equipment \u2013 for radio and network apparatus\nElectromagnetic compatibility (EMC) \u2013 limiting emissions and requiring immunity to emissions from others (if we use induction for heating)\nHowever, we have tried to use off-the-shelf parts where possible, all of which already have CE marking which mitigates the risk in this area.\nSoftware development\nThe current Brewbot app needs refined and we will require your help to make this happen. Whilst the app is currently iPhone-based we want to offer a cohesive visual experience across multiple platforms and devices.\nIf you decide to help us you'll play an integral part in starting a revolution in home-brewing. Every person backing us makes the difference. We're looking forward to seeing what you can do. \nWho are we?\nWe are Cargo, a multidisciplinary team of designers and developers based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. We come from different backgrounds but we all share the same passion for brewing.\nWe have designed and developed over 70 mobile applications to date but we made the decision to focus on our own product, and this is why we've put all of our efforts and energies into Brewbot.\nFrom left to right: Niall, Chris, Kieran, Aaron, Jonny, and Ali.\nTeam roles\nFounder: Chris McClelland\nCreative Lead: Jonny Campbell\nDevelopment Lead: Niall Kelly\nEngineer: Kieran Graham\nInterface Design: Ali Sisk\nDesign: Aaron Gilmore\nPartners\nWe have partnered with Caroline and Nelson Santos who are the founders of Mette, a creative consultancy who specialise in contemporary products and environments for cooking and living, to assist with the product design. They have designed products for Jamie Oliver, Tesco, and 100% Design.\nWe will be teaming up with James Lamb who was one of the very first design engineers at Dyson Appliances. He has designed a long list of products for companies such as British Telecom, Johnson & Johnson, GE, Gillette, and P&G.\nAlong the way we've had the help and support of Dr George Cathcart who is the master brewer at Sheelin Brewery.\nWhat do our rewards look like?\nWe wanted to bring the same personality to our rewards that we bring to our app and appliance. \nPrototyping our beer paddle at FabLab Belfast.\nLaser-etching our beer paddle prototype.\nInspired by the visualisations in the app, we have created some beautiful generative objects. Each of the rewards are completely unique and have been generated based on our triangulation design.\nWe wanted to make something just for you because you are helping us bring our dream to life.\nBeer paddle and glasses, coasters, and tasting cards.\nExample of the Brewbot T-shirts.\nNiall sporting a Brewbot T-shirt.\nSpecial thanks to:\nWe would like to thank everyone who helped and supported us along the way, without you we wouldn't be here:\nCaroline and Nelson Santos at Mette, George Cathcart at Sheelin Brewery, Andy McMillan and Andy Baio for going above and beyond to help us in Portland and for creating XOXO which inspired us to pursue this idea, Paddy and Adam at FabLab Belfast, Marty Stalker and Paul Searle for video, Filly Campbell and Simon Mills for photography, Warp and Woof for our soundtrack, Conor Midgely, Robin Price, Paul Lay, Llinos Griffiths, Miguel Ortiz, Baileys Taproom, Black Box, Hudson Bar, Max Temkin for all of his support, and everyone who encouraged us along the way.\nTeam Brewbot", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have built functional prototypes already and are confident we will be able to produce an amazing product, however, with all hardware projects, there is always a risk when it comes to getting a prototype production-ready.\n\nWe have tried to use off-the-shelf parts where possible, all of which already have CE marking which mitigates the risk in safety.\n\nWe appreciate your support and we are excited to have you join us in our journey to share the power of brewing to the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "We're Shipping!", "update_content": "Ahoy there!\nWe did it, Brewbots are shipping!

What is this?\nI was about to sign a typical financing deal in order to get the money to make \"Wish I Was Here,\" my follow up to \u201cGarden State.\u201d It would have involved making a lot of sacrifices I think would have ultimately hurt the film. I\u2019ve been a backer for several projects on Kickstarter and thought the concept was fascinating and revolutionary for artists and innovators of all kinds. But I didn't imagine it could work on larger-scale projects. I was wrong.\nAfter I saw the incredible way \u201cVeronica Mars\u201d fans rallied around Kristen Bell and her show\u2019s creator Rob Thomas, I couldn\u2019t help but think (like I'm sure so many other independent filmmakers did) maybe there is a new way to finance smaller, personal films that didn\u2019t involve signing away all your artistic control.\nFinancing an independent film the traditional way often means having to give away your right to \u201cthe final cut,\u201d casting choices, location choices and cutting down your script to make it shoot-able on the cheapest budget possible. \nWhat if there is a different way?\n\"If you don't like how things are, change it! You're not a tree.\" - Jim Rohn\nOk, I'm intrigued. What's the story?\nPage 1...\n\"Wish I Was Here\" is the story of Aidan Bloom (played by me), a struggling actor, father and husband, who at 35 is still trying to find his identity; a purpose for his life. He and his wife are barely getting by financially and Aidan passes his time by fantasizing about being the great futuristic Space-Knight he'd always dreamed he'd be as a little kid.\nWhen his ailing father can no longer afford to pay for private school for his two kids (ages 5 and 12) and the only available public school is on its last legs, Aidan reluctantly agrees to attempt to home-school them.\nThe result is some funny chaos, until Aidan decides to scrap the traditional academic curriculum and come up with his own. Through teaching them about life his way, Aidan gradually discovers some of the parts of himself he couldn't find.\nIt was written by my brother, Adam, and me last summer.\nAdam and me.\nThe Soundtrack:\nThe Soundtrack to \"Garden State\" was more popular than I could have ever imagined. The album went platinum and won a Grammy. Music and score are very important to me, and I'll be using them in the same way in \"Wish I Was Here.\" One of the cool things about being a backer is that you can get access to weekly song picks by me, and be the first group to stream the soundtrack. \nI don't have the rights to put any cool music on here, but here's me doing a fairly decent beat-box:\nPre-visualization:\nI am lucky enough to be friends and collaborators with one of the greatest pre-visualization artists in the business, Colin Fix. Artists like Colin help filmmakers establish the look and tone of the locations and characters before going into production.\n\"Wish I Was Here\" has some very unique characters, and mine in particular has elaborate fantasies that I want to try to bring to life in a very specific way. When operating on a tight budget, it's super helpful to be able to gather around the art Colin and I have come up with in order to make sure the entire creative team is on the same page.\nA doodle of the Bloom Family I made for Colin:\n*Note: The film is NOT ANIMATED. These are character design sketches.\nCharacter Design Lineup by Colin Fix\nColin painted these two frames as research for the look of Aidan's opening fantasy sequence. Aidan's fantasy-self has a flying robotic-squire:\nEXT. FANTASY-FOREST SEQUENCE - NIGHT by Colin Fix\nEXT. FANTASY-FOREST SEQUENCE - NIGHT by Colin Fix\nSince he's the only crew member that's already working, I put all my direction into Colin:\nCinematography:\nLarry Sher has agreed to shoot the film. Larry shot \"Garden State\" and has since gone on to shoot all the \"Hangover\" movies, along with many other big comedies. Larry and I have very similar taste and together we established the look of GS.\nThe amazing cinematographer Larry Sher and me:\nWe were able to shoot Super 35 millimeter film on GS. In today's digital age, it's become harder and harder, and more expensive, to shoot film. If the budget permitted, I would shoot \"Wish I Was Here\" on film as well. There are several amazing digital systems we'd use if we couldn't afford film, but as a camera geek who went to film school, I'm sad film is going away. Only the biggest directors these days get a chance to shoot it.\nProduction Design:\nA Production Designer is in charge of the overall look of the movie. They collaborate closely with the Costume Designer to ensure the film has a cohesive tone. They oversee all sets, set decoration, locations, props etc. If all goes as planned, \"Wish I Was Here\" will be designed by Judy Becker. Judy is one of the most amazing designers in the business. Here are some of her most recent production design credits:\nSilver Linings Playbook\nGirls (Pilot) \nShame\nThe Fighter\nBrokeback Mountain\nGarden State ;)\n\nOk... Why Kickstarter?\n\u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\" - Albert Einstein\nI want you to be my financiers and my audience so I can make a movie for you with no compromises. I know it's risky, and I don't know if it's going to work, but here are a few reasons why I think it's worth it to fund via Kickstarter. \nFinal Cut: \n\"Final Cut\" is the industry term for who has the final say on how the movie will be edited. A lot of financing deals require that the final cut go to the money people, NOT the director. Most films these days are tested in front of \u201ctest audiences\u201d to see how an audience likes what you\u2019ve made. This is sometimes very helpful, as you can get a sense of when the pace is too slow or when certain jokes aren\u2019t as funny as you thought they were. However, it can also be destructive, as a financier with final cut may use a note from the test audience to force you to make changes to the film that go against your gut. You ultimately have no right to fight against these changes because you have signed away those rights in order to get your money. As a film-lover myself, I always want to see exactly what the filmmaker intended.\nCasting Choices:\nTraditionally, in order to procure your financing, a filmmaker will often have to choose from a list of pre-approved actors with whom the financier is willing to make the movie. Although there are often many wonderful actors on these lists, you may not see the actors you had in your mind to play those parts. The lists are compiled of actors who\u2019ve been in films that have had large successes overseas. Their names are put into an algorithm, and a computer calculates how much money the financier will be able to pre-sell the foreign distribution of the film for based on that actor\u2019s past successes. Bored yet? Basically, you have to cast who they want, not who you want.\nLocation Choices:\nThis film is set in Hollywood. Bizarrely, it is very expensive to shoot in Los Angeles. So unless I have the budget to afford to shoot here (where it takes place), I\u2019ll have to shoot the film in Vancouver or Georgia or Louisiana and fake it to look like LA. I was told we\u2019d just \u201croll a few palm trees around.\u201d This happens all the time, and we could make it work... and no offense to all those places, but wouldn\u2019t it be amazing to be able to shoot the film where it takes place?\nCuts for Budget:\nEvery film makes cuts to trim the budget; that\u2019s completely sensible. But there are always places where, with a little extra money, the film could be better. In \u201cWish I Was Here,\u201d my character's elaborate fantasy sequences are one place that extra money would strengthen what shows up on the screen, as I could shoot those in the amazing and surreal locations I picture in my mind.\nWrap it up, Braff, I have stuff to do...\nI look at it like this: Come join this little club. Join for whatever you can. And then, together, this lil club's gonna make a really cool movie, and you'll have made it happen. If you've liked the stuff I've made so far, I know you're going to love this. \nWhether you end up with a rad t-shirt (soft as a kitten's taint) or an invite to a special preview screening, you'll know that without you, this movie never would have gotten made. (*Yes, there will be a secret handshake and code word for the club.)

The producers and I are truly doing this all ourselves. Lack of distribution can also be a blessing. We want to make this film the same way we made \"Garden State,\" without a distributor or financier demanding we adapt it to fit their needs. \n\nOur goal is to debut the film at the Sundance Film Festival. If you fund the project, we intend to start pre-production right away, shoot this August, and finish the film in time to submit it to the festival. There's a very accomplished team behind the scenes: two of my producers from \"Garden State\", Stacey Sher and Michael Shamberg, and a supremely talented cast and crew including Larry Sher and Judy Becker. \n\nYour goodies like t-shirts and posters for helping us make this possible will be sent out by a professional fulfillment company. Many elements of the rewards will be fulfilled well before September of 2014, which is when we hope to release the film and have all of our premieres and screenings. For those of you who are attending an event or joining us on set, we will do our best to keep you in the loop on our schedule.\n\nTHE FINE PRINT (stuff my lawyer wants me to say)\n\u2022 For those of you visiting our set, we anticipate shooting in August in Los Angeles. However, this has the potential to change. We will keep you updated so you can plan ahead to visit us.\n\n\u2022 If you become an extra ($2500 reward) or receive a cast credit ($10,000 reward), you must be a US citizen or have a US work visa, and not be a member of SAG/AFTRA. \n\n\u2022 You must be over 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian (who will count as your plus one) to attend the premiere or visit the set. Extras must also be over 18. \n\n\u2022 The content of the voice and video messages are at your direction, but at my discretion. I reserve the right to refuse to say or do what you request if I find it inappropriate.\n\n\u2022 Some rewards may require additional paperwork. If you are appearing in the film, you will have to sign a release. \n\n\u2022 My final cut of the film may have to be further edited in certain cases to adhere to the laws in the country which it is being viewed, or for different types of media. \n\n\u2022 All shooting locations, including Comic-Con, are subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the amount of money we are able to raise and the particular locations giving us the right to shoot. \n\n\u2022 This fundraising campaign is all subject to applicable Kickstarter rules/regulations, movie guild rules and applicable law. if any of this conflicts, we will work with you in good faith to give you a substitute reward.\n\nTo sum it up, movie making is a crazy business, with a lot of unknown factors. We start with a script I'm really proud of. Then, we assemble the best team possible, get insurance, and make contingency plans. It's impossible to guarantee everything will come together exactly as planned, but in the end, we will have created a movie that hopefully all of us can be proud of.

I was one of those guys, and that show was called The Totally Rad Show - but it went away at the end of last year.\nNow, I'm hoping to carry the torch of rad entertainment forward with a brand new show!  You can help make it possible by donating to this Kickstarter.\nExclusive Virtual Action Figure, yours absolutely FREE - just by viewing this page!\nBut what is it?\nThink of this as \"Jeff and His Amazing Friends\".  Each week, I will cover the biggest genre news, review the latest movies, video games, TV shows, comics, and more, and invite some of my friends and notable personalities from around the web to hang out and talk about what they love most.  It will be your one-stop shop to find the very best stuff you should be watching and playing, all with the personality, positivity, and passion that made TRS such an internet hit.\nDonate and stay tuned to this page as I begin to reveal some of the people I have lined up for appearances.\nUPDATE!!  The first reveal!  I'm happy to announce that my friend and former co-host from Reviews on the Run has agreed to join me for one of the first episodes.  The fantastically talented, super hot, always opinionated Miri Jedeikin from Electric Playground!\nSo where will I watch this show?\nThis Kickstarter is all about getting the ball rolling.  I want to create a high quality show that can continue for a long time to come.  If this project is funded, I'll make a series of pilot episodes, which I'll use to find a more permanent home for the show on the web or on TV.  If you donate, you'll get these new episodes, as well exclusive access to update videos on the project before the first episode hits - and hopefully the show will find long-term distribution and continue on for years to come.\nToo excited about the constant stream of new Star Wars movie news not to have a show to talk about it!\nThat sounds awesome!\nBut wait, there's more!\nI have some very lofty goals for this show, and want to take it farther than an internet talk show has gone before.  If the Kickstarter exceeds its goals, I'll be able to do more to make the show even better.  I've already been in talks with the creator of a popular online animated show to create an animated \"show-within-the-show\", and would like to be much more ambitious about what kind of things we cover. \nThis is really just the start of something special.

All of the money you pledge this month goes right back into making this movie the one you've been waiting for, and the movie we've been waiting to make. So call your friends. Rally the troops. Lets break another record.\nLoVe always, \nkristen bell\nDay 1: Messages from Rob & Kristen\nAlmost since Veronica Mars went off the air, there's been talk of making a movie. In that span, I've taken different tactics in dealing with the question of whether it might happen. To be clear, I've always wanted to make a Veronica Mars movie. I love writing these characters and working with these actors. Kristen Bell has always wanted to make the movie.\nThere was a moment, a few years ago, when we thought we had a real shot at making it happen. I developed a pitch that revolved around graduation day at Hearst college -- Wallace and Mac were graduating at least, Veronica had been sidetracked by freeing Keith from prison. Plus, there was a murder in Neptune that was affecting the beach city's spring break business in much the same way a great white shark affected the beach community of Amity. I probably stoked fan fervor in my optimistic comments about the prospects. Warner Bros. wasn\u2019t convinced there was enough interest to warrant a major studio-sized movie about Veronica and the project never got off the ground.\nAfter that, I tried to tamp down expectations. I didn't want to be guilty \u2014 at least not twice \u2014 of building up hope when the odds seemed so long. Still, without fail, in every interview I do or every place I speak, I get the \"will there be a Veronica Mars movie?\" question. Even after a couple of years of downplaying the chances, I'd still run across blog postings headlined, \"will Rob Thomas shut up about the Veronica Mars movie, already!\" I was trying to. I promise. \nI first found out about Kickstarter a couple of years ago from an Austin musician friend of mine \u2014 Robert Harrison, lead singer of Cotton Mather, the band that gave us \"Lily Dreams On,\" our closing song of season 1. He financed a rerelease of the band's fantastic Kontiki album. Later, I was marveling about Kickstarter with another buddy of mine who said off-handedly, \"You should use Kickstarter to raise the money to make the Veronica Mars movie.\" I chuckled. That seemed like a silly idea in the moment. We'd need millions. But for the next few weeks, the notion was never far from my mind. I started doing the proverbial back-of-a-cocktail-napkin math. The average pledge on Kickstarter is $71. Hell, if we could get 30,000 people to give the average donation, we could finance the movie, particularly if the cast and I were willing to work cheap. The most common donation amount on Kickstarter is $25. Surely, 80,000 of our three million viewers would find that price-point viable! \nOf course, Warner Bros. still owns Veronica Mars and we would need their blessing and cooperation to pull this off. Kristen and I met with the Warner Bros. brass, and they agreed to allow us to take this shot. They were extremely cool about it, as a matter of fact. Their reaction was, if you can show there\u2019s enough fan interest to warrant a movie, we\u2019re on board. So this is it. This is our shot. I believe it's the only one we've got. It's nerve-wracking. I suppose we could fail in spectacular fashion, but there's also the chance that we completely revolutionize how projects like ours can get made. No Kickstarter project ever has set a goal this high. It's up to you, the fans, now. If the project is successful, our plan is to go into production this summer and the movie will be released in early 2014. \nLife has taken Veronica away from Neptune. In the years since spoiling Keith's chances to be reelected sheriff, Veronica hasn't taken a case. But something big is about to bring her back home and back to her calling. My goal is to include as many of your favorite characters as possible. It is, after all, time for Veronica\u2019s 10-year high school reunion. Keep in mind that the more money we raise, the cooler movie we can make. A two million dollar fundraising total probably means cross words are exchanged at the class reunion. Three million? We can afford a full-on brawl. Ten million? Who knows... For some reason the Neptune High class reunion takes place on a nuclear submarine! A Hobbit shows up! There\u2019s a Bollywood end-credit dance number! I\u2019ve always wanted to direct Bill Murray. We\u2019ll figure out something cool. Hey, if that total goes high enough, I\u2019ll bet the good folks at Warner Bros. will agree a sequel is a good idea.\nThanks to everyone who hasn't lost faith.\nRob\nDay 1: A Message from Kristen\ndearest marshmallows... \nI am currently the happiest blonde in a hamster ball the world has ever seen. We have been waiting so long to make this movie dream a movie reality, and it\u2019s because of YOUR commitment, YOUR persistence, that we finally have a chance. We just have one more step to go. \nYou have banded together like the sassy little honey badgers you are and made this possibility happen. i promise if we hit our goal, we will make the sleuthiest, snarkiest, it\u2019s-all-fun-and-games-\u2018til-one-of-you-gets-my-foot-up-your-ass movie we possibly can. \nI promise to give it my all. i promise to work my hardest to give everyone a little bit more Veronica, and i will be oh so honored to do so.  \nI only ask for one thing in return. \nIf I ever die, do me a favor. Go on Oprah and tell the world that I loved kittens. \nLoVe to you ALL, \nkristen bell \nMore Countries!

My name\u2019s Nial Giacomelli. I\u2019m an iPhone application developer and a type 1 diabetic. I'm asking for \u00a37.5k to help fund the development of an innovative new iPhone application that could help thousands of diabetics worldwide. With your help, I'd like to release it completely free on the App Store and possibly bring it to other devices in the future.\nIn 2011 diabetes was estimated to have affected 366 million people worldwide. In the US, over 8.3% of the population are affected, and here in the UK it\u2019s estimated that more than 1 in 20 people has diabetes. Even if you're not diabetic it's likely you know someone affected. \nBut here\u2019s the good news: good diabetic control has been shown to severely reduce the risk of complications later in life. The more information we have to work with, the healthier we can be.\nBut there's a problem...\nMost of the existing diabetic applications on the App Store make it tedious and difficult to keep your journal up to date. After all, my disease takes up so much of my life already that I didn't want to spend any more time than necessary recording data. So I built my own diabetic journal application, and I made it fast. More importantly, I made it intelligent.\nCan good design help to save lives?\nBy using an innovative new technology called Smart Input, the application I've developed looks at your medication usage and uses that information to determine which medicine you're mostly likely to be taking at any given point in time. By learning your habits, it's able to pre-populate fields that other applications make you type out by hand or select from menus - cutting the time needed to enter information from minutes to seconds.\nIt lets you monitor every aspect of your health, from tracking carbs and watching your diet to physical activities. It can even remind you to take your medication when you next leave the house.\nI've slaved over every aspect of the applications interface in order to make it as efficient as possible. The result is an application that I believe is more focused than any other diabetic management software out there. With your help, I want to prove that good design can really help to improve peoples lives.\nEarly application design concept\nFeatures include:\nThe ability to track and report on daily athletic activities, meals (and carb intake), as well as medication and blood glucose readings.\nA system which monitors your medication schedule and intelligently pre-populates fields to save you from monotonous typing!\nA blazingly fast autocomplete system.\nFully internationalised, with automatic BG unit conversion between mg/dL and mmoI/L. The journal works everywhere.\nMedication reminders (including a geofence that'll remind you to take your medication when you leave the house)\nView entries across a rolling six month period or break it down by entries entered within the past 7 or 14 days\nA fast and beautiful gesture-based interface\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for\nBy using my journal I've managed to get better control over my blood glucose levels. Not only that, but the act of logging my meals and activities has given my readings added context, which I've used to make better and healthier choices. In short, using this application has helped me to become a healthier diabetic. And I want it to help as many other people as it possibly can. Which is why, with your help, I\u2019d like to release it completely free of charge on the App Store.\nI've already spent hundreds of hours working on it in my free time. But there are some things I need to include in the application that I just can\u2019t do without funding.\nWith your help I'd like to:\nAdd rich, beautifully interactive charts to the application so that users can see a visual progression of their health. \nDevelop a medication reminder system to allow for conditional reminders (i.e: remind me to take another inject 8 hours after my first injection), as well as standard time-based reminders.\nDevelop a backup and restoration feature that integrates with popular cloud-based services like Dropbox and iCloud.\nThe money I raise on Kickstarter will also go towards helping to build a strong visual identity for the application. Something that people will recognize and hopefully come to trust!\nWhat you\u2019ll get\nAll backers who pledge \u00a310 or more will receive an awesome pin badge to show that they helped back the project. They'll also get a chance to see the application come together in the final stages of development.
