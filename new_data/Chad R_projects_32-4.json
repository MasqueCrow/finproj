When you\u2019re invited inside for an evening\u2019s entertainment, what could possibly go wrong? Will you Cuddle with Cats or Thwart a Thief? Will you Brawl Over Brandy or Fall Prey to the Plague? At Hemlock Hall, awful amusements become deadly diversions with the flip of a card.\nGloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is a darkly humorous stand-alone competitive storytelling card game for two to five players. To win, you make your characters suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death.  The player with the most negative score wins. And in Gloomier, the winner gets the final word: Who was the murderer? How did the heist end? You decide!\nGloomier features transparent plastic cards, allowing a character\u2019s score \u2014 and story \u2014 to evolve as cards are stacked on top of each other. You don\u2019t need prior experience to play Gloomier, but Gloom fans will find that A Night at Hemlock Hall expands the storytelling aspect of Gloom with new, specially-designed story prompts. And this full stand-alone game includes 6 new Stories and 14 new Guests that can be used with any edition of Gloom. So dare to enter Hemlock Hall, and see what delightful disaster awaits!\n\nLike all Gloom games, Gloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is a storytelling game. Stack transparent cards to boost your score and make your characters\u2019 tales the most tragic \u2014 while blighting opponents with good fortune. Then, tell the story of these miserable misanthropes.\nWhen you play an Untimely Death card on a character, they die and their negative score is locked in, but the story continues until all of one player\u2019s characters have perished. Then, all players tally their scores.The player whose characters had the most tragic lives (and the most negative score) is the winner.\nPoints are important, but the best part of Gloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is building increasingly sad, and increasingly silly stories with your fellow players. If you like Nightmare Before Christmas, The Addams Family, or A Series of Unfortunate Events, we think you\u2019ll enjoy the absurd dark humor of Gloomier.\n\nGloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall contains:\n 110 transparent plastic cards (including 14 new Guests, 6 Story cards, a new cast of Characters, and a variety of new Modifier, Event, and Untimely Death cards to bolster your tragic tales)\nA 12-page, color, totally redesigned rulebook \nAn attractive tuckbox \nIt\u2019s a standalone expansion, which means you can play it by itself or combine it with any other Gloom games.\n\nGloom fans have been asking for it for years, and it\u2019s finally here \u2026 a box big enough for all your Gloom games!\nThe luxurious Grief Case is large enough to hold every Gloom game produced thus far \u2014 that\u2019s roughly 1500 Gloom cards \u2014 plus all your rules and extras, and your darkest secrets. (It\u2019s even got room to accommodate another four full Gloom games or eight expansions, for when you add future Gloom games to your collection.)\nThis case is extremely sturdy! 4mm thick laminated chipboard will make this the strongest game box in your collection, sure to hold up to a lifetime of use. Or, of course, 'til Untimely Death.\n Soft Touch finish adds a luxurious velvety-soft texture for instant tactile appeal and resistance to fingerprint marks. It also makes sliding the lid off the box both quick and satisfying.\n Spot gloss and red metallic foil add texture and shine to highlight design elements.\nThis deluxe box comes with its own thick acrylic dividers, so you can sort and cross-reference your games and cards in whatever way makes the most sense to you.\nAnd more!

For this Kickstarter, we\u2019re focusing on just one big one: The Gloom Chronicles. Chronicles is an expansion for the Gloom series, turning Gloom into a serialized, campaign-style game. It is included with all pledge levels, and has been improved through stretch goals to be the best The Gloom Chronicles it can be!\nIn Gloom, you and your friends weave tales of woe. But where does the story begin? Each card in The Gloom Chronicles expansion starts a new chapter for an ongoing game of Gloom, ties those games together as a serialized campaign, and adds variant rules, bringing new challenges to the story. You can choose a card at random, or you can start from the beginning and explore the ongoing chronicle of your family through an extended campaign. Your story begins with the Unhappy Birthday \u2026 but will your next game of Gloom involve a Tragic Train Ride, or will you end up at the infamous World\u2019s Unfair?\nThe Gloom Chronicles is an expansion that can enhance any game of Gloom. You can use it with just one Gloom game, or let it navigate you through all the expansions. Narrative prompts give players a unified foundation for their stories, while variant rules challenge new and experienced players alike. The Unhappy Birthday awaits!

Final version subject to updates.\n\nNew to Everdell?\nCheck out this great How to Play video from Watch it Played!\nWithin the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding... Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details. \nIf your reward is shipping to one of the destinations shown on this More Shipping Destinations chart, we are not collecting taxes or customs fees, but it may ship from a local hub. The Destinations Summary below details which countries are in which regions. \nIf you're outside of the countries included in this Destination Summary, please reference the Expanded Worldwide Shipping details below. \nWe originally did not offer shipping to destinations outside of those listed in our Destination Summary due to cost and reliability concerns. We are now able to offer shipping to all destinations outside of those listed above only if the backer accepts that we are unable to provide free reshipments for any packages lost in transit (We typically offer one reshipment at no additional shipping cost for areas listed on our Destination Summary.) \nWe plan to ship these packages worldwide from our fulfillment center in Germany (for best cost), so please take that into account when considering your import costs. Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws.

Your skills will be tested across four scenarios, or Books, that each feature unique rules, allies, abilities, and epic boss battles! You'll have a limited amount of resources and turns to complete each of these four Books, and if Batman's Grit, Sanity, or Health ever drops to zero, it's game over\u2026\nBeyond staying alive in the short term, the world's greatest detective also has to plan for the long term: The \"Doomsday Clock\" persists across all four Books, as does the constantly evolving and always chaotic Gotham City. If the Doomsday Clock ever strikes midnight or Gotham becomes too overrun with Riots, it\u2019s all over (hang up your cape and cowl... or try again!).\nEach Book lasts four rounds and, in that time, you'll have to acquire enough Clues to track down the Boss's location, and then dispense justice by defeating them in order to progress to the next Book.\nGameplay each round is split into two halves. In the first half, you strategically pick your favorite Fight and Detective cards, which grant you unique abilities to prepare for future battles and for navigating Gotham. But think twice, because each of the cards you don't select has a unique Event that becomes part of the Event deck, which triggers each turn to keep you on your toes! In the second half of each round, Batman and his allies (such as Robin) will take to the streets of Gotham. Combine Ally Actions with Batman for some awesome combos!\nAfter each round, you'll be able to DRAW directly on the board to create a new pathway between locations in Gotham. Make your way towards locations with possible leads; you may hit dead ends, DESTROY locations, or find Clues. Find enough Clues, and you'll learn the location of the Boss. Take down the Boss in order to complete the Book!\nWith a variable setup and a nearly endless combination of Fight, Detective, and Event cards, each playthrough of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns - The Game will throw a unique combination of resources and challenges at you!\n           \n \nFor the uninitiated, The Dark Knight Returns is likely the most beloved Batman story ever told. Writer/artist Frank Miller\u2019s four-issue series from 1986 was a watershed moment in comics, as it brought a dark and cinematic feel to the medium. Every Batman story since then owes something to it.\nLet\u2019s set the scene: In Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Gotham City is controlled by a brutal street gang called the Mutants and, since it\u2019s the 1980s, the US and USSR appear to be on a collision course for mutual nuclear destruction. Also, being a superhero is illegal and Superman is now an agent for the government. It\u2019s pretty dystopian, to say the least.\nAs for Bruce Wayne, he is 55 years old, way past his prime. And he\u2019s been retired for years, ever since the Joker murdered Jason Todd, the last Robin. Spurred by the Mutants\u2019 crimes and a reminder about the murder of his parents, he returns to his crime-fighting ways, but with a new edge. This time, he\u2019s not holding anything back, using every bit of his smarts and battered body to take on the Mutant Leader, old archenemies the Joker and Two-Face, and even Superman, his one-time good friend. With Carrie Kelley, the new Robin, at his side, the Dark Knight takes another stand for justice and the soul of the city (and world) that he has defended for so long.\n  Please note: Due to COVID-19, most shippers have added surcharges to their rates. The amount we charge for shipping reflects the latest rates. In some regions, the cost of shipping may exceed the cost of the tier you\u2019re pledging for; unfortunately, this cannot be avoided.\nAnyone who preorders through the Kickstarter campaign will have an opportunity to add selected items and/or multiple copies of the game to their order through Backerkit after the end of the campaign.

Serenity. The Millennium Falcon. \nYou can\u2019t have a good space story without an iconic spaceship. Of course, more often than not, the heroes of the story aren\u2019t flying some shiny new cruiser. Those are for the wealthy, the elites\u2014not our lovable scoundrels. No, they fly the bucket of bolts\u2014the outworn, patched-up junker held together with hope, prayers and duct tape.\nThe eponymous 'bucket of bolts'\nThese ships weren\u2019t always hunks of junk though\u2014they have long and storied histories, and might even have been respectable vessels at some point. We only ever see a slice of that story though, a single captain and their motley crew. \nThis game flips the perspective.  \n\nThe Game.\nBucket of Bolts is a hack of Artefact, my game from last year's ZineQuest. Instead of creating a magical item, this time you'll be telling the story of a single spaceship. You\u2019ll create a brand new freighter, fresh off the manufacturing line, and explore its history through each of the people who captain it. Your ship will change as the decades pass - new names, new parts, fresh paint, fresh starts - until your story draws to a close.\nYou\u2019ll choose your Captains, bringing them to life with names and details, and create stories of their time with your ship using prompts and tables. When you\u2018re ready to move on, you\u2019ll choose a Fate for your ship. Maybe it\u2019s traded away fairly, but more likely it\u2019s stolen, captured or even wrecked. You might drift for a while as you wait for your next Captain, or the seat might still be warm when a new one takes over. Either way, the galaxy will change around you, and you\u2019ll see it all from the view in the cockpit.\nLike the original Artefact, it\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or two; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique ships for tabletop games like Edge of the Empire, Traveller or Scum & Villainy, with rich backstories, fun details and tonnes of personality.\n\nThe Zine.\nFormat \nA little paper prototype of the zine opening.\nI'll be using a new format for the physical rewards. Beak zines take an A3 sheet of paper and fold it into an 8-page A6 booklet. This process leaves one side of the paper blank, that people sometimes use to make a poster.\nOne of the things that's always bugged me about Artefact is how much flicking around the book you need to do as you play the game. I thought\u2014why not use the blank side of a beak zine for all of the game's content; the tables, questions and prompts you\u2019ll need during play. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nIn Bucket of Bolts, you\u2019ll be able to read through all the rules in the booklet and then unfold it into a complete reference for play. Pretty neat huh?\nAnd here it is closing!\nPaper\nExtract comes in a range of lovely colours.\nOf course, I'm still taking every opportunity to make this little zine a deluxe product. I'll be using one of my favourite paper stocks, G.F Smith Extract.\nAs well as having some seriously impressive environmental credentials (it's made from recycled coffee cups), it's also just a lovely paper that comes in some great colours. I\u2019m partial to Mustard, as you can see in the prototype, but we\u2019ll see when the print samples arrive.\n\nInk\nCopies of ARTEFACT, outside on a sunny day.\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using Risograph to print the book. That means rich, vivid shades with the aesthetic of screen printing, but viable for large-scale print runs. It\u2019s also one of the most sustainable ways to print, with soy-based inks & low energy machines. It\u2019s going to be beautiful!\n\nIllustration\nTorben is very excellent at drawing spaceships.\nSpeaking of beautiful, I'm also commissioning Torben B\u00f6kemeyer again to do some awesome illustrations for the game. Spaceships are his bread & butter, and I think his sharp, detailed style is a really good fit for this game. You\u2019ll have seen his key art at the top of the page, and he's already hard at work on the game's cover.\n\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nI'm looking forward to an excuse to get wild with paper & ink combos...\nI\u2019m also offering a Collector\u2019s Edition of the game, exclusive to the Kickstarter, packed with bonus printed matter like art prints, stickers and random tables.\nIt\u2019s all paper stuff, but I think it\u2019s gonna feel pretty special.\nAny \u2019game content\u2019 (such as random tables) will be available to all as a digital download.\n\nAccessibility\nLike Artefact and Orbital, the digital edition will also be fully-compatible with screen readers. A second version will also be provided to support a range of visual processing needs. Once again, Yubi will be handling the accessibility design of the digital files.\n\nCommunity Copies\nEvery backer of Bucket of Bolts, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks!\n\nStretch Goals\nThis is intentionally designed as a small project, but I've still got some cool things to announce if we break past our funding goal :)\n\nDelivery.\nTimelines\nI\u2019ve got a draft of the game written, and I\u2019m happy that the core concept works as well for spaceships as it did for magical items (after making a few changes to the design). I\u2019m hoping to get a playtest version out in a month or two, with the full digital version being delivered in late spring/early summer and the physical edition following soon after.\n\nBackerKit\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. This time, though, I\u2019m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn\u2019t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you\u2019ve selected add-ons.\n\nOrbital \nOrbital header art\nMy previous project, Orbital, is going to print imminently which means that the bulk of the work for that Kickstarter is done. I\u2019m not shipping out the rewards myself, and the stretch goal content is coming along nicely. I\u2019ll continue to actively manage the project, but barring any catastrophes it shouldn\u2019t take up much headspace.\n\nARTEFACT: Reviews & Remarks.\nI\u2019m so happy with the way Artefact has been received. Here\u2019s hoping I can recapture some of that magic for Bucket of Bolts.\nIf you\u2019re a returning backer: hi, nice to see you again! I hope you also enjoyed Artefact :)\nPrint copies of Artefact\n\"It combines a little bit of writing and a little bit of drawing with a lot of storytelling to make a game that is one of the most relaxing and mindful experiences I have had this year.\" - Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"This is a great system agnostic supplement that could fit on any gamer\u2019s shelf\". \u2014 Pulp Culture Museum\n\"It was a wonderful game that once I started, I had a hard time putting down.

Kickstarter-exclusive. I have no plans to sell Roll Camera! to distributors for wide retail release. Too complicated. I have a day job, you know! It's possible individual retailers will back this project, and we might sell off extra copies online or at conventions, but if you want to make *sure* you get a copy, you gotta back it here and now.\nBut more importantly, backing now is...\n2. More fun! Join the crew, throw your hat in the ring, be a part of making this thing happen now. It's what Kickstarter is all about, right?\nNot pictured: $10 \"Cinema Owner\" - Retailer Pledge Level\nOr rather, YOU did it! You unlocked the Clapper Box that really clappy claps! $100k - unbelievable!!\nHere's a video of me with the factory's sample clapper box (please note I accidentally left the sample rulebook inside as well, that's the papery thing sticking out): \nClick to cast your vote!\nTo unlock some of the more \"quality of life\" upgrades to the game, we're trying something a bit different: just like you do in Roll Camera: the Filmmaking Board Game, during this campaign we're going to \"shoot a film\" together!\nYou see, there are 20 Scene cards in the base game, each with a textless image. In the game, you arrange these images in the Editing Room, and at the end of the game, you use the story cues on the board to weave them into a coherent plot. The board game has 5 slots for these cards. We're going to take that idea to its logical conclusion and tell a full-length feature film story out of all 20 Scene cards! \nBut we need your help to shoot this film!\nSo: each \"shooting day\" (we shoot Tuesday-Saturday and take Sunday and Monday off), I'll reveal 3 Scene cards (below) and a poll (here on BoardGameGeek). Each of the cards is tied to a different game upgrade or bonus. Your job is to vote on 1 of the 3 Scenes to shoot that day. The winning Scene will unlock that upgrade or bonus for all copies of the game!\n(The two Scenes that are not chosen MAY come back around again later on! They're not necessarily gone forever...)  \nClick to vote on the final scene!\n Got it? Then:\nClick here to cast your vote for today's Scene!\nThe winning Scene is then placed in the next available slot in the Editing Room below, where you can track which bonuses have already been unlocked and what point in the story we're at:   \nClick to enlarge\n So make sure the Scene you vote for isn't just the upgrade you want, but also makes narrative sense! There's no re-editing allowed - we're cutting this baby on the fly.\nThis will allow you to participate more in how the game is upgraded, and give us a clear idea of which kinds of upgrades you actually WANT in the game. (Please note that these upgrades are not 100% guaranteed to feature in the final game - they PROBABLY will, but I reserve the right to change my mind if I think the upgrade will result in a worse product somehow.)\nSome Scene bonuses will unlock new Scenes, so there should always be 3 Scenes and 3 upgrades to choose from. Some Scenes might become available again later, others might disappear forever! So choose wisely.\nAfter the campaign, you'll have the chance to act out the scenes we've collectively \"shot\" and upload your videos. We'll all vote on the winner, who will receive a limited, playable Award Winner Idea card with their game!\nIf you want any or all of the above items as well, simply add the $ amount to your pledge now, and you'll be given a credit for that amount in the pledge manager after the campaign, which you can redeem for those items. Shipping is FREE if you add these to your standard game pledge.\nItchy Feet: the Travel Card Game was my first ever game and Kickstarter, launched in 2017. You'll recognize it from the bean people artwork of course! This is the retail version, which differs slightly from the one printed on the Kickstarter - it has an additional couple cards, and the passport cards have been redesigned. \nThe metal dice are the same size, color and have the custom faces for the game - they're playable game components. But metal!\nThe engraved acrylic dice are the same dice that come with the base game. They're useful if you got the print-and-play and want the official game dice, or if you just want to get some filmy dice for your filmy friends! \n(Note that if you pledge less than the $49 game and want the dice or Itchy Feet separately, you'll have to chip in a couple extra bucks later for shipping. Exact amount TBD.)\nWe are partnering with a pledge manager for this campaign. A pledge manager is a third-party service that allows you to do things after the Kickstarter campaign ends, like change your address, order additional copies of the game, confirm your pledge and reward level, and pay for shipping.\nYou'll receive an email invitation soon after this campaign is over, so please keep an eye out. You must fill out the pledge manager by the deadline (TBD soon) to guarantee your reward! We'll give you plenty of time and lots of reminders, both here on Kickstarter and on the Roll Camera! Facebook group, but if you miss the deadline you'll be giving up your game. So PLEASE check your email, and spam box, often after the campaign.\nWe are working with local fulfillment companies around the world to provide the cheapest possible shipping option for you. We are also subsidizing up to 40% of the shipping costs so that, again, you can pay as little as possible for shipping.\nHere's an estimate of what you can expect shipping to cost based on your region (these are only estimates and could change!): \nPlease note that we are ONLY shipping to the countries listed above, and on the reward dropdown menu. Please double-check that your country is on the list before backing!\nCOVID-19 note: if you're in a country that has COVID-19 travel restrictions placed on it by the USA or EU (excluding each other of course) in effect when the game ships in 2021, we won't be shipping your game immediately because it may get swallowed by customs / local postal services. Instead we will hang on to your game in our warehouse for a period of 3 months or until the travel restrictions are lifted. After 3 months if travel restrictions are still in place, we'll give you a choice: we can either refund your pledge or ship you the game anyway (although we can't guarantee what customs will do with it). Fingers crossed that this whole thing blows over before then!\nBrexit note: hopefully, the UK will still enjoy \"EU-friendly\" (aka, VAT-free) shipping by the time fulfillment starts in 2021. But that all depends on what Brexit terms will have been arranged by then, which of course are out of our control! Let's hope for the best, but it's possible that things will change for the UK. \nRetailer Info\nIf you are a store and you can prove it, I'd love to help you out. Please pledge at the Cinema Owner (Retailer) level, and then fill out this verification form, where you will also find more info. Proof of status will be required. This pledge level is NOT for group buys! \nEstimated shipping for retail orders will be $24 for 1 carton (6 games) to US addresses, \u20ac15 to EU addresses.

The Filmmaking Board Game. It ain't my first rodeo, though; in 2017 I Kickstarted my first game, Itchy Feet: the Travel Game, based on my long-running web comic of the same name. That game was meant to be a one-off thing, but game design is now quickly becoming my new obsession. I just love it! And that's why this year I started Keen Bean Studio. I think I might be doing a lot more of this kinda thing.\nFilmmaking was always my greatest passion, however. I've been making movies since I was 10! I've made short films, long short films, commercials, documentaries, screened at festivals worldwide, won awards, and now I run a filmmaking degree course and teach others how to make movies. I've been a writer, a director, a producer, a cinematographer, an editor, a boom operator, an extra...I've done it all, sometimes all at the same time!\nRoll Camera! was made so I could share with you that unique, raw mix of agony, euphoria, stress, joy, puzzle-solving, teamwork, pressure, and creativity that is so addictive about making movies. It's not easy, but man - it's fun. \nI think you'll enjoy it!\nLike any proper movie director, I am surrounded by people who make me seem more talented than I actually am. This production has only been made possible thanks to their patience, generosity, and support. I'd like you to read their names, because they're real humans and they are awesome!\nIris & Noah - my wife and son, not just patient but honest. Thanks for knowing when to pull me away from my work! Erik Rempen, thanks for always being willing to play yet ANOTHER prototype and having great ideas (and good luck with your game too!), and Kilian Rempen, thank you for packing and shipping those prototypes! Chris Palmer, thanks for your endless support and enthusiasm, and also for donating your formidable spreadsheeting skills. Oliver Valente, thank you for the encouragement and kindness wrapped in delightful snark. Maxime Rioux, thanks as always for being available to bang heads together, and for lending me your designer's eye for detail. Jayden Bailey and Agostina Cerdan, thank you for organizing the countless hours of testing and for just being up for anything. Max Sacker, thanks so much for all the awesome movie stuff for the video. Tony Go, thank you for giving me your blessing to use your ingenious crew dice mechanic from Deep Space D-6! Very special thanks to my parents for always encouraging both hard work and play. And thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone else who provided their time, thoughts, and support. It really meant a lot to me.\nCredits\nRoll Camera! is designed & illustrated by Malachi Ray Rempen. Rulebook by Sam Hillier. Graphic design consultation by We Are Knytt. Print-and-play by Martin Gonzalvez. Lead blind playtesters were Maxime Rioux, Jayden Bailey, Michael Herbers, Dan Callaghan, Grattan Aikins and Isabelle Schmitz.

Video cast/crew: Jayden Bailey, Agostina Cerdan, Kamilija Cizaite and Zac Yeates.\nRoll Camera: the Filmmaking Board Game is a proud production of:  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't my first game or Kickstarter campaign - but it is my first full-on board game, my first time manufacturing in China, and my first time doing all this (largely) by myself. So there are plenty of risks: any number of global catastrophes could of course delay production and shipping, but also I might make a misstep or miscalculation along the way. I'm only human after all! Keep in mind that everything you see in terms of artwork and design is subject to change before we deliver, and that most of the numbers and times posted here are estimates. Educated estimates, but estimates nonetheless. Also, I reserve the right to change my mind about any of the voted upgrades if I feel their inclusion will negatively impact the final product.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that these changes might occur and that the final project could differ from what is presented on this page.\n\nBut if there's one thing I take extremely seriously, it's getting you and all other backers your rewards while meeting or exceeding expectations. I mean that. From the beginning of this project, that's been the destination for me. That's why when I run into an area I'm less familiar with, I do everything in my power to learn as much as I can and consult with as many experts as possible to catch up. I also listen carefully to your suggestions and feedback for the same reason.\n\nThis is also why I've studied other Kickstarters and tried to limit the number of complicating factors I've seen impact delivery elsewhere. The game has been extensively playtested, including the upgrades, and I'm not adding loads of content that will require additional testing and cause delays. So design and development are pretty much there. The artwork is 95% done, and I'm doing it myself so I don't need to wait on someone else. I'm not adding fancy components or multiple versions that will stall things - I've already confirmed most of the components with the manufacturer. \n\nAnd as a filmmaker, I'm a big fan of planning ample buffer time and budget, because inevitably things will go wrong. What I do is assume they will go wrong and plan accordingly. And I pledge to be transparent with you, and communicate clearly and often all along the way. Just look at my last campaign (Itchy Feet: the Travel Game) to get an idea of how I like to operate.\n\nPLEDGE MANAGER: after the campaign we'll be using a third-party pledge manager. Here you'll be able to change your address after the campaign ends and order additional copies of the game if you wish. But you MUST fill out all the required information! If you don't complete the pledge manager by the deadline, you may lose your reward! Last time I had backers contacting me *literally years* after the project had shipped. You will have plenty of time to fill it out before the deadline and you will receive several reminders along the way. PLEASE check your email after the campaign and ensure our messages are not going to spam.\n\nAnd if you have any concerns, ideas, help, or questions, please get in touch!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nI hate waste. That's why I always look for the strongest, highest-quality materials - it may not make it the cheapest product, but it will hopefully ensure staying in your home and out of the landfill as long as possible.\n\nAlthough shrink wrap may seem like a perfect example of damaging single-use plastic, it actually protects the games and components (which are mostly paper, remember) from mold, moisture, and temperature changes during the shipping and fulfillment process. Without it, the waste created would be immense. So until there's a good alternative to plastic wrap, it's actually doing the environment a big favor here.\nReusability and recyclability\nOne great thing about board games is that they are almost infinitely reusable. Even if you get tired of Roll Camera!, the board game second hand market is a rich and vibrant place. These days, you can always find a good home for a board game. \n\nNEVER throw out a board game! Even if something gets damaged or a key piece gets lost, contact us and we will try to send you a replacement part. This again helps maintain the lifespan of the game for as long as possible.\nSustainable materials\nPlastic is a menace to our environment, which is why whenever possible, I want to avoid plastic in favor of cardboard - for example, with the box insert. The only fully plastic game components are the budget/schedule clips (I have not yet been able to find a durable non-plastic alternative) and the dice, which will be acrylic. \n\nFor a long time I went back and forth on wood or plastic dice. I decided that plastic dice are longer lasting and more resistant to damage than wood.

For more information see here. If you're an interested retailer, pledge at the Trader level (\u20ac110). This is for the minimum of 2 cases, which is a total of 4 games of the retail version. After the campaign, you will be redirected to a special pledge manager where you can also upgrade your pledge to the Deluxe version and/or order more copies.

We're still astonished by all their enduring, wonderfull support and for making our lives so much easier!\nTerms and conditions\nThe following terms and conditions apply when you pledge to one of our games.\nREFUND POLICY The Kickstarter terms allow you to get a full refund if the request is received within 14 days from the end of the campaign. Any request made after this period will be at the discretion of Black Box Adventures and will be a maximum of 90% of the pledge cost (due to Kickstarter and card fees already paid by Black Box Adventures).\nRETURNING PRODUCTS If you fail to accept your package when it is delivered we will not issue a refund for the cost of the pledge (and shipping).\nDAMAGED PRODUCTS  We guarantee that the packages you receive from us will be complete and include all the items in perfect condition. If not, we will replace any missing or damaged items. Replacements for minor cosmetic damage to external boxes will be decided on a case by case basis.\nSURVEY RESPONSE  We will use a pledge manager. You will be required to fill a survey on that platform. We will send out several mails and updates notifying you of the deadline to fill the survey. If you do not fill out the survey by this deadline after notifications have been sent, we may not be able to fulfill your pledge.\nREASONABLE CHANGES TO PRODUCT  Due to ongoing testing and developing and potential improvements suggested by the factory, the final product may be different from the prototype shown on this page. By pledging to this project you acknowledge that the final game may be different from that presented in this Kickstarter campaign. Having said this, Black Box Adventures will make every effort to keep the final game as close to the Kickstarter project as possible and only make changes to improve the game. If major changes have to be made, Black Box Adventures wil inform the backers about the changes and the reasons for such changes.\nOTHER LANGUAGE EDITIONS  The Spanish and French translation will be handled by 2 Tomatoes. The Dutch translation will be handled by Black Box Adventures. For specific questions or problems concerning the translation copies (also after the campaign) you can contact the responsible company. The other language editions will be available in all countries during the Kickstarter. \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough every project comes with risks, we've done our best to minimize them. This isn't our first project and we're partnering up with a few other experienced companies. However, we rely on our suppliers just as you rely on us, and hope for a relationship of mutual understanding.\n\nWe've worked with different manufacturers in the past and don't work any more with those not living up to our expectations. That's why we choose a new manufacturing partner that has done games for major publishers and creators and who has come recommended with impeccable credentials. \nSome events may be out of our reach. One such event is COVID-19. To take such events into account we've talked with the manufacturer and gave ourselves some more time to deliver the game. We would love to tell you your game will arrive earlier, instead of the other way around...\n\nShipping is always a risk, especially when shipping international orders. After production is complete, we'll be shipping the game worldwide through several fulfillment centers, ensuring that we have \"Friendly Shipping\" (no import taxes) to the US, EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We'll also be subsidizing a portion of the shipping cost for all pledges to keep your costs down. Like before, we're using a highly renowned fulfillment partner for an ultra smooth fulfillment process. For more information see terms & conditions above.\n\nThe EU has recently implemented stricter tax regulations on online sales in general and crowdfunding in particular. We thus are obliged to collect and pay VAT on the value of the total of the pledge and shipping amount. VAT varies between 17% and 25% with most countries at 20% and above. The total amount is calculated on the amount paid for the game and the shipping. We have taken these costs into account so you will not need to worry about them. It is important to note that VAT is a sales tax that is separate from import taxes or duties. We will cover import duties in the USA, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand so you do not have to worry about those. Other regions might incur import duties.\n\nAdventures in Neverland has been developed over 5 years, with numerous play-testers and groups in different countries. A new batch of test groups will be brought in after the end of the Kickstarter (and COVID-19) to test the final content and to blind test the rulebook.\n \nLastly, although we are working very hard to expand our range of games, we put originality before anything else. Every game we publish must be an original masterpiece, drooling with flavor by itself. We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal. Like our previous games, we will listen to the backers. Together Adventures in Neverland will be a unique game, dedicated to J.M. Barrie's legacy!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAll of our games are made with longevity in mind.

There are only so many classical medieval buildings one can print before being fed up.\nThat is why our main focus for the future is expanding our themes. As a proof of concept that the Townbuilder has potential, we chose very classical themes. These are represented by our \"Basic Sets\", which are included in every pledge level and also in the free version of the Townbuilder.\nThe Basic Themes include Stone, Fachwerk, some Miscellaneous Items, and corresponding Medieval Roofs.\nCheck out our showcases below but note that they do not display all models individually as this would simply take up to much time and work.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Premium Sets will be the two choices of the community and will be modeled as soon as the Kickstarter closes. If you are a backer, you can find the link to the poll in their respective update posts or on the top of the Kickstarter campaign.\nWe don't have any 3D models to show so far since they will be modeled after... well we know what they will be.\nPremium Set I has officially been decided: It will be Sewers and Caves, for which we have some concept art below.\nPremium Set II has also been decided: It will be Steampunk, check it out below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTownbuilder Basic\nThe Basic is free for everyone. As soon as you sign up for a free account after the Kickstarter you can try out the Townbuilder and even testprint some buildings. Obviously we want to encourage buying the Townbuilder, therefore the functionality of the Basic version is... well pretty basic.\nTownbuilder Unlimited\nThe Unlimited Version has everything you need to build hundreds of custom houses. Every functionality we think makes using the Townbuilder easier will be included here.\nTownbuilder Infinite\nThe Infinite Version adds nothing you need... but a lot of things you want. Want a 20 story high wizard tower? If your PC can handle it, knock yourself out. Want to create nice rendered pictures of your building while exploring them in first person perspective, seeing through the eyes of a miniature, here you go!  Want to create a custom sign for each guild of your world, with their custom logo and name... guess what? Townbuilder Infinite is for you.\n\n\n\n\nApprentice\nThe \"Apprentice Townbuilder\" includes the Townbuilder \"Unlimited\" Edition and all Basic sets. This tier allows you to create an endless number of buildings in the classical medieval fantasy style. Perfect for people that want to get started in the hobby or that just want to test out the tool for a low price.\nJourneyman\nThe \"Journeyman Townbuilder\" also includes the Townbuilder \"Unlimited\" Edition but a lot more models. Two additional sets are included here, which will be based on community decision so you can influence what you get. And then all Stretchgoals that will be unlocked are also included here. So if the Kickstarter takes off, you will get a lot of different models for your money, enabling you to build all kinds of different buildings.\nMaster\nThe \"Master Townbuilder\" includes the Townbuilder \"Infinite\". In this premium Townbuilder Version, you will find loads of cool features that let you enhance your gameplay. These range from a rendering studio that allows you to walk around in and outside your building and take screenshots of it, to a custom logo and text tool, which will allow you to upload your own custom logos and add them to banners and signs inside the Townbuilder. We have a lot of plans for these cool gadgety features and we already started working on some of them as the development of all basic features comes to a close.\nGuild Head\nThe \"Smith's guild head\" includes everything listed above for the Master Townbuilder and one additional feature: You get to decide two 100% custom models that we will sculpt for you and add to the Townbuilder. This can be anything you want, from a vegetable garden for your farm village to the symbol of your game's largest Kingdom as a banner to be affixed to your buildings. This allows for a whole new level of customization. Just an idea though, choose something that you want to use a lot, something that we don't feature yet and that will be a common feature for your buildings. \nSyndicate Leader\nThe \"Smith's syndicate leader\" includes everything listed above for the Master Townbuilder and one teeny tiny additional feature... You are playing a Steampunk game but the community didn't vote for the steampunk stretchgoal? Boy, do I have something for you.\nYOU GET TO COMMISSION A SET !!!!\nYes you can trust your eyes, this is an actual tier we offer. We will create a custom set for you and do our best to make it as close to your wishes as possible while still having it fit with our system.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we reach the 1000\u20ac that are necessary to keep the servers running for the coming years, the real fun begins. If you are unfamiliar with the way stretch goals work, here is a quick introduction: Whenever the campaign's funding reaches a certain threshold a stretch goal is unlocked. If we raise enough money to keep the office running for a full month, we can release an additional set at no cost, that's the basic idea.\nEach stretch goal unlocked means you get more bang for your buck and we get to do what we love as a job, win-win!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have partnered with the awesome folks of OTP Miniatures and Scenery to offer you guys the option to get your buildings printed!\nThough we don't offer printed Kickstarter tiers this time around, every backer of the Kickstarter will receive 10% off their first order for a building created in the Townbuilder at OTP's shop. This way you get your print at the same discount as if it was bought during the Kickstarter.\nAfter the Kickstarter we will also offer seller licenses. If you own a print shop or offer a printing service, feel free to reach out to us via info@townsmith.de .\n\n\n\n\nWe are a small company from Saarland, Germany. Our team consists of (currently four) tabletop enthusiasts, who love nerdy shit and who enhance tabletop games with 3D printing! Tom, Christopher, and Monika are computer scientists and Leevke is our intermedia designer.\nChristopher \"Korson\" Adam - PM, CEO, 3D Dev, 3D printing Enthusiast, DM\n\"Greetings! I'm the guy, who brought 3D printing to Townsmith. I've been playing tabletop games, namely Dungeons and Dragons, for just about 4 years now. I found out very early that being the game master was perfect for me and I've GMd ever since.\nI soon developed a need for something more than just a piece of paper when designing my encounters. Equipped with a cheap Anet A8, I began to delve deep into 3D printing for tabletop games. From then on, my arsenal of both models and printers started growing until I got frustrated with the limited customization options for the terrain that is out there.\nFor Townsmith, I take on the role of the project manager, 3D programmer, and CEO. If anything weird happens in the Townbuilder, yeah that's most likely my fault.\"\nTom \"Zatho\" Zahlbach, CTO, Webdeveloper - Fullstack, DM, Player, Documentation Enthusiast\n\"Hey, I'm Tom. I'm the guy that had to read around 300 pages of Amazon Web Services documentation to get this project hosted for all of you. So yeah, I am somewhat of a masochist ... but, I also got to code a bunch which, if anything in this world, I adore. Everything website-related and invisible to you, as well as all the things behind the website, are written mostly by me. Additionally, I also take care of our AWS infrastructure. In my free time, I play D&D 5e with my friends both as a player and as a DM\nFor Townsmith I take on the role of CTO. Which... well, says not much since I get to help with everything that needs to be worked on.\"\nMonika \"Her Smolness\" Unruh - Lead 3D Artist, Dice Enthusiast, Player\n\"Hey I'm Monika, I'm a Scorpio and 1,62 m tall, whatever you want to do with that information. I've known Tom and Christopher since school and started playing DnD with them in 2017, which made me become a dice-hoarder. When the two of them came up with the idea of Townsmith I was really hyped about it. Half-jokingly I asked them if they needed someone to help with the 3D modeling since I'm somewhat of an artistic person and was interested in trying digital art and 3D modeling.\nTo my surprise, they said yes and so I came on board and am now a 3D modeler for Townsmith, but I'm still learning, so if the models start floating randomly that's probably on me.\"\nOliver \"Ore\" Inglen - Master of the positive aura\n\"Hello, my name is Oliver. I am new to the world of tabletops, dungeons and dragons, but have been working in 3D and modeling for many years. Actually, I was working in the field of architectural modeling and visualizations until a mutual friend brought me to Christopher. Since then I have been working on my sculpturing techniques for modeling your feature blocks and will also do some concept art! I am really happy to be able to support the Townsmith team while doing fun work. If you have any suggestions for details, get in touch with me. Can\u00b4t wait to model all this!\"\nLeevke \"Insomnyu\" Reher - Concept Artist, Supporting 3D Artist, Meme Enthusiast\n\"Ahoy! I'm Leev! My full name is Leevke Fee Thordis Reher but that's kinda overkill, so call me Leev. I've been playing lots of Pen&Paper in my early childhood but couldn't seem to find a fitting group when I got older. But in 2018, I was introduced to Christopher and his great dedication to Dungeons and Dragons. Since I'm currently studying InterMedia Design, the opportunity to do my internship at Townsmith presented itself.\nI joined shortly before the Kickstarter launched, so until now I did some of the concept art. Later I'll dive into some of the 3D Modeling and digital design for the community voted themes. So if there's anything wrong, blame the others, I'm innocent.\"\nIf you have any questions about us or what we do, feel free to join our Discord Server and get in touch with us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can clearly see, we are a very young team.\nThis is our first project though not our first Kickstarter campaign. A few months ago we already launched a Kickstarter with a different business model. We have learned a lot since then and we also improved the Townbuilder.\n\nStill, we are inexperienced by industry standards (Printable Scenery, Heroforge, Fat Dragon Games, etc.). Though we do our best to be responsive and professional, but our lack of experience will be visible when it comes to some aspects.\nWill the site be up 100% of the time? I doubt it.\nWill we fix it as soon as it goes down? Yes, we will.\nWill the range of themes increase as fast as heroforge's does? Well, it depends. It took us about three months to get the current models going, but we have gotten a lot faster at it and we will have more time to invest into modeling since there will be less programming work to do.\n\nMost importantly: The Townbuilder is basically ready for release weeks before the launch of the Kickstarter and we only need to polish up a few things, including the UX. There is little risk that you will not be able to create and download buildings after the Kickstarter closes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe sell software which is about as resistant to wear and tear as it gets.\nReusability and recyclability\nPLA, which is the main material used in home 3D printing, is bio-degradable.

Musicians are very lucky in this sense, but not everybody has the opportunity to make music. \nWe wanted to give everybody the opportunity to create music the same way musicians do. With OddBall, making beats is easy, intuitive, fun and can be done where ever you are.\nOddball comes in two parts, the ball, and the app. The ball behaves as the percussion trigger. Every time you bounce it off a surface, sensors at the heart of the ball communicate with the app via Bluetooth to play a sound through your headphones, speakers, or just the internal speaker on your phone. Oddball is pressure sensitive \u2013 The harder you bounce it the more intense the sound, the lighter you bounce it the more delicate. \nYou can loop your beats to make complex, intricate tunes, play over your favourite songs and add effects. Since Oddball is inherently shareable, the app will have it\u2019s own social environment, where you can post your latest beats and share them with your community.\nOddball is the most versatile way to play music. Get bouncing, throwing, smashing, flicking, tapping \u2013 which ever way you choose to use it, have fun and see what you come up with.\nPut your headphones, get outside and explore different ways to play with your surroundings. \nOne of the great things about Oddball is that you can play with multiple balls at the same time. Simply plug in a speaker, choose different sounds and jam with your mates.\nTechno tennis anyone? \nHow about augmenting your basketball game with a bass drum?\n Or turn your office into a banging playground.\nUse the ball in original ways. Challenge yourself to create new tricks. Use your imagination, let yourself discover unexpected grooves.\nOddball is ideal for people of all ages. The level of craft within the design make it a pleasure to use \u2013 whether you are a teenager, adult, or preteen kid with big ambitions, Oddball is for you.\nWe see Oddball as a fashion statement, choose the style that suits you. Oddball will come in different colours, so whether you are a 'Deep Purple' kind of person, a 'dance the blues' guy, or a 'want to paint it black' kinda gal there is a colour for you.\nVote here!\nWe are running a poll to find out which are the most popular colours. The designs with the highest votes will become the first colours we will deliver to you. Do you like it load proud and proud, or cool dark and subdued? You choose.\nAlso be sure to check out the Pimp your Oddball reward where you can really get nuts with the finish of your ball.\nIf we reach \u00a380,000 \u2013 Street and Desk setting. Sensitivity adjustment lets you choose the intensity range you want to play with.\nIf we reach \u00a390,000 \u2013 Triple Direction setting. Unlock triple direction tapping or bounce.\nIf we reach \u00a3100,000 \u2013 Live Audio input. Record and bounce your own sounds on the fly.\nIf we reach \u00a3130,000 \u2013 Shaker Style setting. Keep rhythm with a different interaction.\nIf we reach \u00a3200 000 \u2013 ?\nWe are really excited about this final stretch goal, which we are keeping secret for the moment. Stay tuned to find out exactly what it will be.\nMovie credit: Hollin Jones, Ask Audio \nTo get all the experimental musicians excited, we made it possible to use Oddball as a velocity sensitive Bluetooth MIDI controller, so you can connect it to any DAW software on your laptop (such as: Ableton, Logic Pro, Pro Tools, etc.) and control your favourite plugins.\n The app allows you to have complete control over the sounds you play. With expansive audio libraries you can choose between traditional or electronic drums, melodic instruments, or any other \u2018Odd\u2019 sound under the sun.\nPLAY\n\nThe app has been designed to be super intuitive, so you can focus your time on making your beats. Here are some of the features:\nChoose and play sounds from a large sound library. \nLoop, record and overdub your beats. \nPlay over your favourite tunes.\nConnect multiple balls and assign different sounds. \nAdd your own sounds. \nAdd sound effects onto your loops. \nShare your tunes with your friends.\nOddball is easily rechargeable by USB. The charging cable is inspired by the iconic jack cables you usually see plugged into famous electric instruments, such as the Fender Stratocaster.\nOddball can also be charged on the go with a common USB portable battery pack.\nThe Oddball standard pack comes with one ball and one charging cable delivered in a beautifully crafted box. You also get the app with preloaded sounded libraries and effects for free.\n Why not turn the volume up to eleven and pledge for our two, three pack or even six pack. \nIf you are looking for something really special, let your imagination go wild, choose a special finish or custom colour, you name it and we will personally make it for you. Pledge for a bespoke Oddball and we will get in touch to pimp it up for you. \nOddball has a series of sensors at it's heart that are protected by a strong core, that helps withstand the craziest of bounces. \n It has been a long but fulfilling journey to get where we are today, here are just a few picks of the development of the project across the two years.\nPLAY\n\n Your support will help us:\nPrepare the injection molding tools for production\nFinalize the development of the firmware and App\nBuy all the necessary components and materials for production\nTesting and quality control \nOddball Founders Nathan Webb and Pasquale Totaro met at the Royal College of Art.

The last thing we'd want is for Planecrafters to be delayed because we tried to make it bigger than we could manage (and bigger than it needs to be).  However, we are committed to rewarding you, our backers, with regular KS-exclusive content via stretch goals.  So, while every copy of Planecrafters is going to get better, your copy of Planecrafters will truly be a limited edition.\nAs a Planecrafter, you follow a strict turn order\u2026Hire, Acquire, Flyer, and Buyer.\nIn the Hire step, you pay the bank and bring an Employee into your factory\u2026they work for you now. The Employees are organized into Tiers with different costs to hire.  Each employee has specific abilities that can be used on the turn you hire them and every following turn until the end of the game. You can only hire one employee per turn.\nEveryone starts the game with five crowns, the currency of Crumplehorn, and can afford one of the Tier 1 employees.  These less expensive employees focus on your own factory.  Tier 2 and Tier 3 employees have additional abilities that also involve more interaction between other players.  Who you hire (and who your opponents hire) is the thinky part of Planecrafters.  It's great to come to the table with a plan!  But be ready to adapt!\n\nIn the Acquire step, you draw part cards from the Parts Depot and place them in your hand\u2026these are what you\u2019ll use to build your planes.  Everyone starts this step by drawing two cards.  In the Depot, you'll also find Spare Part cards.  These are wild cards and can be used as any plane part you need, but they do not belong to any plane type (Big Boy, Goliath, etc.).\nIn the Flyer step, you place cards from your hand into your factory.  Every player is allowed to play two part cards per turn and you can only build one plane at a time.  Use your part cards to assemble planes in your factory.  It's not required that the parts match, but you do need a nose, a tail, a right wing, and a left wing for the plane to be complete.  Master Pennington is not very picky about the planes he buys from you.  So if you're going to build wonky planes, then own it!  Be creative!  Name those gravity defying (or gravity attracted) beauties!  And have fun!\nIn the Buyer step, you sell your exotic, but completed, plane for crowns.  The more parts that match, the more money you'll make. \nAt the end of your turn, discard to the hand size limit and the next player's up. \nRound and round it goes, until the face-down deck in the Parts Depot is gone and then the game is over!  Bonuses are awarded to players with the most valuable plane sold, the largest employee pool, and the most plane parts sold.  Add the value of awarded bonuses to your collection of coins and...the player with the most crowns wins!\nIt's pretty simple, but if you'd like to learn more, check out the prototype rule booklet at paisleyboardgames.com/planecrafters!\nAs mentioned before, we want to keep this project simple, so our stretch goals will focus on making the game better for everyone. But we are scheduling regular unlockable Kickstarter-exclusive content. So you, our KS backers, will be able to flaunt your special swag.  Below are the first three, but there are more to come!\nFollowing the theme of simplicity, we have decided to surround Paisley with some of the best manufacturing and fulfillment professionals in the industry.  This makes things simpler for us and easier for you. \nLots of further information below, but two things we want to make sure are clear...\nYou will be able to order multiple copies of the game after the campaign, via our survey management partner.\nShipping costs (based on region) will be applied after the campaign, also via our survey management partner.\nFor the production for Planecrafters, we are using the top notch services of Panda Game Manufacturing.  We've worked closely with our representative (Thanks Stephen!) to make sure all the details are in order and all the specs are correct.  Some of the most impressive games in the last decade have been produced by Panda and we're excited to bring that impressiveness to Planecrafters.\nFor fulfillment and shipping, we're working with a dedicated and very experienced fulfillment house to make sure each game is tracked, organized, prepared, and delivered with care. \nWe all know that shipping is an expensive part of any campaign and we want to do what we can to minimize that expense for our backers.  But we can't take it on completely.  After examining the numbers provided by our fulfillment house, we've decided to break down shipping costs by region and split that cost with you, our backers.\nFore example, the cost to ship Planecrafters within the US is $10.20.  We'll cover half.  We'll follow the same pattern with shipments to the EU and CA/AU/NZ, where shipping rates run around $15 and $19 respectively.  Outside of these regions, shipping rates vary wildly.  In some cases, we'll be covering more than half of the shipping, but this system keeps things simple...just the way we like it.  Also, we'll be making it easy to combine multiple copies into one order through our post-campaign survey.  If you're within the US, EU, CA, and AU, you will only need to pay $30 + $1 (shipping) for each additional copy you bundle.\nTo make things even easier, we will be coordinating our fulfillment and shipping plans with partners inside the European Union, Canada, and Australia to make sure that no additional customs/VAT costs are passed onto you.\nPlanecrafters is the masterpiece of Paisley Board Game's dynamic duo, Michael Patience and Andrew Bosley.\nMichael Patience - Michael has been programming since he was ten years old. He has always enjoyed creating things whether it's a computer program, clay models, paper airplanes, or board games. He has always loved playing board games, especially hobby games or those of a more fantasy theme. Remember Dragonlance, or Gamarauders? Now he enjoys creating games of his own and contributing back to a community that has brought him countless hours fun.\nAndrew Bosley - Andrew is a freelance concept artist, illustrator, writer, and game designer. He was the lead illustrator on the new Mission: Red Planet, Citadels, Everdell, and Lightning & Bolt. When he\u2019s not daydreaming or drawing, Andrew is playing games with his wife and five kids. He is pretty good at ping pong, possum wrangling, and he\u2019s the best ukulele player in his family.\nGame Design: Michael Patience and Andrew Bosley\nIllustration and Graphic Design: Andrew Bosley\nKickstarter Design: Andrew Bosley\nKickstarter Video - Video Production: Joe Schneider and Matt Schneider\nKickstarter Video - Animation: Matt Watts\nKickstarter Video - Narration: Dallas Jensen\nSpecial Thanks: Cynthia Patience, Maren Bosley, Jenny and Rory Bristol, David Somerville, Joe Schneider, Dallas Jensen, Travis Wilkins, Bill Allen, Jessica and Alex Krenik, Chad Elkins, the Lowry family, the Siddoway family, the Gamble family, the Fetty family, the DeSpain boys, David Chen, Andrew Gilstrap, Jon Schindehette, and many many more!

An underwater cooperative war thriller that allows 1 to 4 players to assume the roles of the Captain, the First Officer, the Navigator, and the Chief Engineer on board of a type VIIC U-boat. The game is enhanced by a companion app, allowing for an unprecedented level of realism, as well as a challenging enemy A.I. which will push your skills to the limit. The action unfolds both on the strategic and the tactical scale, always demanding teamwork, efficient crew management, and quick situation assessment.\nWhat the reviewers say:\nGame overview\nThe Crew\nEach of the four roles entails unique responsibilities, encouraging the players to develop an efficient communication scheme and use genuine navy terminology. The Captain oversees the completion of mission objectives, supervises action point costs, and is responsible for the crew's morale. The First Officer operates the companion app, manages the flow of information, and takes care of the crew's health. The Navigator steers the submarine by setting its course and depth, but also updates all the essential information on the strategic, and the tactical map. Last, but not least, is the Chief Engineer, who is responsible for the engines, repairs, as well as other mechanical implements on board of the U-boat (such as the ballast tanks, weapon systems, etc.). At the same time, each of the four officers commands his own group of crew members by issuing orders within a worker placement system.\nThe App\nThe idea behind the companion app is to deliver a real-time, realistic gameplay experience. To that end, the app features the most essential instruments of the u-boat (such as the periscope, the hydrophone, and the Enigma, among others). Rest assured, however, that the vast majority of gameplay traditionally takes place on the game board, with the instruments revealing otherwise hidden information, and the app requiring only certain data (such as the U-boat's course, speed, etc.) in order to generate an adequate A.I. response of the enemy force. It is also responsible for all the ambient sound effects, thus immersing the players even deeper into the claustrophobic interiors of the type VIIC. But fear not! With open & play being a design priority, you will be launching torpedoes in no time, thanks to streamlined rules, video tutorials, and variable difficulty levels for each player.\nThe Mission\nFrom quick skirmishes, through full combat missions, to an all-out campaign, UBOOT will let you conduct submarine operations in all major naval theatres of the 2nd World War. Success of these missions hinges on the completion of various tasks delegated to the crew by the BdU (U-boat HQ), which include patrol duty, ambushing convoys, laying mines in enemy waters, and many more! Each mission will require the players to adopt various strategies and playstyles in order to successfully complete it, and the companion app will generate a detailed report at the end of each game session (evaluating player efforts, and possibly awarding decorations, promotions, etc.). That is, if the U-boat makes it back home\u2026\nGameplay video\nHow to play\nThe stage is set and the crew is awaiting your orders. Do you have what it takes to command the Kriegsmarine's finest? Hunt or be hunted, as you brave the stormy seas of the greatest conflict in history!\nCore rules\n The Captain\n The Navigator\n The First Officer\n The Chief Engineer\nPledge level\nThe UBOOT Pledge includes one copy of the game, one copy of the Kickstarter Special Expansion - Giant Playing Mat (latex), and any additional Stretch goals we may reach during the campaign.\nThe UBOOT All-in Pledge includes one copy of the game, one copy of the Kickstarter Special Expansion - Giant Playing Mat upgraded to eco leather material, Interior upgrade resin pack, Supply tokens upgrade resin pack, Environmental conditions upgrade resin pack, 110 Paladin sleeves and any additional Stretch goals we may reach during the campaign.

The design is complete, with 2 years of development and playtesting behind it. There will be no rule-changing expansions and stretch goals. We will use them only to improve the components, including the game's app, and to enrich gameplay. This is the reason why we have chosen Kickstarter. We are offering a great product at a great price and a short fulfillment period. There is no hidden agenda. We are offering a great and simple deal.\nThe game will be published if we reach the funding goal: \u00a365.000. Then we will dive deeper for some Stretch goals. Stretch goals are added to every game for free:\nSocial stretch goal\nYou have unlocked five social stretch goals - thank you!\nNo Kickstarter exclusives\nWe are players at heart, so we are against Kickstarter exclusives. That is why we have prepared Kickstarter Special Expansion: free for our backers and available later in retail, but at an additional cost.\nAdd-Ons\nWe are offering a number of items that you can add to your pledge.  To include add-ons in your pledge, please click on the Manage your pledge button. Increase your total pledged amount of the add-on values, to include any items you would like to receive.

If you back us on Kickstarter, you will receive your copy several weeks before the game reaches any retail outlets! Our goal is to produce UBOOT within 180 days of reaching our funding goal. Kickstarter backers will have their copies delivered no later than December 2018.\nShipping\nYou will be asked to pay the shipping cost in the Pledge Manager after the campaign. At that time, you will be able to add extra copies of the game and items from our Add-on list. Additional items may increase shipping costs. PHALANX is responsible for shipping the English edition of the game. The games will be shipped out from USA, EU, Canada and Australia. The estimated shipping cost is: USA \u00a315 to most states, \u00a330 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Canada \u00a320. EU \u00a310 to most countries (Poland - free). Other European countries \u00a315 - \u00a330 (Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus: \u00a310).

This expansion will not be in the initial retail release of the game like The Good, the Bad, and The Handsome. \nBy participating in our social goals, backers add their voice to the game while helping to create visibility--which means more backers and more rewards. Taking a few moments to comment, like images, and follow us on our social platforms goes a long way in making this project truly Kolossal!\nWestern Legends kicks off the Kolossal Games catalog. As such, we are dedicated to taking the gaming world by storm with the design, development, and component quality of this launch title.\nThough Kolossal Games is new to the industry, our President - Travis R. Chance - is not. Travis was a founder of Action Phase Games. He is an expert at Kickstarter, funding every game he brought to the platform, including Heroes Wanted, Kodama, and Aeon's End. Our team has spent the last 8 months preparing for the launch of Western Legends in every way possible.\nThe game has highly detailed hand-sculpted miniatures from Pure Arts, some of the last and best in their trade. These miniatures are dynamic, accurate to the time, and gorgeous on the table.\nThe game is full of beautiful illustrations and layout from Roland MacDonald and Brian Lee.\nWe are committed to fulfilling all Kickstarter pledges of Western Legends before the game is made available in retail.\nAll components and materials for the game were completed upon launch. All files will be uploaded to our manufacturing partner within 1 week after the end of the campaign. This ensures timely delivery to our backers.\nBy backing Western Legends through this campaign, you will receive - at no extra cost - the Fistful of Extras expansion. This expansion will include tons of unlocked Stretch Goal content not in the wide release of Western Legends. We have exciting goals planned for those who are early adopters of Kolossal's first release!\nThousands of hours have gone into the design and development of this game to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience. Through extensive global internal and open testing, Western Legends provides a rich gaming experience like no other game out there.\nThe utmost thought and care were taken with regard to the theme and source material for the game. As with all of Kolossal's releases, we strive to show diversity and thoughtfully approach inclusion.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $70 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured.\nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps:\nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page.\nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page.\nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information.

Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD Homicide detectives that will do whatever it takes to solve the case, but one player will take on the role of The Chisel whose goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn. \nInspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a mystery and crime solving game unlike any other. \n    4 unique sculpts are included in the game. Prototype sculpts shown here.\n  Detective: City of Angels is a VRG Select title. This means that it will not be sold through normal retail channels. It will be available at the best price to backers of this Kickstarter campaign, for preorder/late pledge at a higher price through our pledge manager, and eventually through our website, at conventions, and/or through other direct partners. For more information see Update #9 here.\n          Each case is beautifully illustrated by renowned artist Vincent Dutrait, creating a rich and gritty noire atmosphere.\n  Detectives will explore every shadowy corner of the City of Angels, rendered in gorgeous and authentic detail on a massive 33x21 inch game board. The game board is based on an amazing public domain map created in 1932 by K. M. Leuschner, which Vincent has lovingly updated and adorned with his own touches.\n     Click here to download the rulebook for Detective: City of Angels. This is the rulebook that was sent to reviewers and uses prototype components and art. It is NOT the final version! \nWith 9 cases included and the option to play competitively, cooperatively (see below), or even solo (see below), Detective: City of Angels will provide hours of mystery-solving gaming.\nPlus, go all in for the Hardboiled Pledge level and get Bullets Over Hollywood, the first expansion which includes four additional cases, putting even more noir goodness on your table!\n      While we highly recommend the game be played competitively, the versatility of Detective: City of Angels is such that it can also be played cooperatively against \"The Chisel\" or Cooperatively/Solitaire with no Chisel player. \nPlaying cooperatively against the Chisel removes the \"corruption\" elements and the detectives become a team working together to solve the case. There is still competition with the Chisel though. \nAlternatively, this KS will come with a 64-page Solo/Cooperative case book and case grid cards that allows the game to be played without a Chisel player as the book will simulate the play of the Chisel. In particular, playing the game solo is a great way to prepare for your first game as The Chisel! \nDesign of solitaire case cards and solitaire paragraph book is not final.\nIn each of these modes of play the ARC system is in the spotlight and the competitive elements of the game, like scratch and bribe actions, are removed. The focus is primarily on solving the case and immersing yourself in the role of a detective.\nAn important question with scenario-based mystery solving games such as Detective: City of Angels is: how replayable is the game? \nWhile detective players will not be able to experience a given case again as a detective (since they'll already know the solution), anyone can play the same case multiple times as The Chisel. In fact, it even benefits The Chisel to have played a case more than once! The Chisel will understand how the mystery works and have a better grasp of how to mislead and delay the detectives during their investigation. \nIn fact, a case can unfold VERY differently depending on how the detectives pursue their investigations, always forcing The Chisel to stay on his or her toes even if it's a case he or she's already played.\nDetective player boards\n  Rahdo Runs Through\nThe below video has Richard \"Rahdo\" Ham's final thoughts on the game.

Because of the huge narrative aspect of the game, it's a real challenge to bring to life all the iconic characters and well-know places. I've never worked on a game with a \"film noir\" atmosphere before, and I did a lot a research to find precise documents and great references, all in support of helping the players immerse themselves deeply in the game and the city of Los Angeles in the 1940s. Another tricky challenge was to get the right tone and to capture the right mood! Working with Evan and the Van Ryder team has been incredibly rewarding as we worked so hard to share and convey our points of view with the players. We wanted to give them the chance to live out the stories and everyday life of Detectives & Mob characters.\"\n\"Technically, I really enjoy to working on 'fake' illustrations, imitating textures, objects, colors and lights of past periods, which is a unique opportunity. I also enjoy bringing the characters to life, giving them authenticity, truth and credibility! Furthermore, Detective is a fascinating project because of all the different component sizes and elements: I have to develop precise and accurate solutions for building the box, cards, boards and tokens in order to get the most cohesive ensemble!\"\nMiniatures\nWe would like to thank James Van Schaik for his incredible sculpting work on the miniature in Detective. Thanks to him, each player will have his or her own miniature to move around the City of Angels!\nJames has worked on many top grossing kickstarters including Gloomhaven, Defense Grid, Myth, Mercs, Relic Knights, Dreadball, and many more. As a sculptor, he has worked with Ral Partha, WizKids, Wyrd Miniatures, Games Workshop, Mantic, Megacon Games, Ninja Division, Soda Pop Miniatures, Pulp City, Battlefront, Gale Force 9, Dust Tactics, Reaper, Gloomhaven, and Lynnvander.\nSee the many projects he has developed here on Artstation.

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played.

This is a must-buy!\u201d\nJamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games\n\"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming. Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder. The ripple effect of this game will be felt for years to come in the Boardgame Industry and should most definitely be enjoyed by all.\"\nJeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\u201cThis is the ultimate survival/exploration board game.

Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\nAlmost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork.\nJoin the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it.\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card.\nThere are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not.\nAn expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics!\nThis expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions.\nIt includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials.

When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper.

A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1.

Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games.

Each god continually remaking reality was more than the universe could withstand\u2026 The great nothingness returned, leaving the gods to bicker in the void.\nEventually, a compromise was reached. The gods joined forces to create the universe anew, but this time there were rules that even they must obey. No longer could gods battle directly, tugging against one another on the fabric of reality. Now their wars are fought in the mortal world with mighty champions and devastating events.\nTales from the world of Epic:\nhttp://www.epiccardgame.com/covenant/\nhttp://www.epiccardgame.com/cry-havoc/\nhttp://www.epiccardgame.com/tales-of-danabrae/\nIn Epic, each player starts the game with a score of 30 health. Your goal is to eliminate your opponents by reducing their health to 0.\nYou start the game with a hand of five cards, and draw a new card at the start of your turn. Your cards represent powerful champions that will fight for you or game changing events you can use to thwart your opponent.\nBefore you first turn, you may muligan to improve your starting hand.\nEach turn every player in the game gets one \"gold.\" Some cards cost a gold to play, others are free. This means you can play any card in your hand from the very first turn. There is no slow building of resources in this game.

Yellow is good, red is evil, blue is sage, and green is wild. Each alignment has its own strengths and weaknesses.\nLike in Star Realms, you can play cards of any and all colors in your deck. If you can match colors, your cards will frequently get more powerful.\nThe righteous, the honorable, protectors, healers, angels, saints, brave knights and benevolent kings. These are the forces of good.\nYour good cards will raise large armies of humans, protect your champions and increase your health. You will banish enemy champions to the bottom of your opponent's deck and launch devastating airborne assaults lead by glorious angels.\nSavage beasts, burning fire, terrible storms, instinct, aggression and rage. The wild don't have an agenda. They aren't good or evil, they're hungry... and your opponent looks like food. \nPlaying wild gives you giant monsters that can smash and stomp though your opponent's defenses. You'll hurl fire and lightning at your foes. Great storms, volcanoes and earthquakes will smash all that stand in your way.\nThe cruel, the murderous, vampires, assassins, demons, devils and zombies. These nightmares taken form are champions of evil.\nWith evil cards, you'll master death, killing champions in droves then bringing the dead back to serve a new master. Your vampires will shrug off mortal wounds and feed upon the forces of your enemies. Hordes of zombies and powerful demons will be yours to command, if you are willing to pay the price to summon them.\nThe wise, the clever, the logical, tricksters, scholars, illusionists, engineers, alchemists and wizards. For the sage, knowledge is power. Reason and logic will illuminate the path to victory.\nThrough sage cards you will master time, returning enemy champions to your opponent's hand. You will construct mighty engines of war and call upon powerful magic to transform or blast your enemies. You will mislead enemy armies, leaving your opponents defenseless and assuring your victory.  \nIn November of 2016 White Wizard Games ran the first Epic Card Game World Championship where 64 players competed for their share of the $100,000.00 prize purse!\nOne of the very exciting things about Epic Digital is its potential to grow the Epic Card Game community.

Players choose from a number of historical pirates and explore dangerous locations full of royal navies, heavily defended forts, treasure fleets, and pirate hunters. \nTaking place during the sunrise of the Golden Age of Piracy, the game introduces a number of innovative mechanics that let you play a fully cooperative or fully competitive adventure. \nThrough daring feats and plunder on the high seas, gameplay remains faithful to this rich time period of revolt and revolution from which the legendary Golden Age pirates continue to live on in our movies, TV shows, and popular culture. \nAre you ready to add to the legend of adventure and swashbuckling glory?\nIt's time to embrace that inner pirate...in all of us.\n  The Pirate Republic is much more than a classic hack-and-slash game. Like the best medium complexity games, this one requires strategic thinking, clever planning, a little bit of luck, and exemplary teamwork to succeed.\nWe don\u2019t like complicated Kickstarters, so we\u2019ve made this one as simple as possible. There are just four pledge levels for you pirates: Basic Edition, Collector's Elite, Art Connoisseur, and Legend.\n  Each card remains true to the time period from Pirate\u2019s initial deck, to Elite Pirate, Crew, and Treasure cards. All card image art was created with pens, paints, and pencils to reflect an authenticity unique to today's digital age.\n       Who other than the most successful pirate of the Golden Age: Bartholomew \"Black Bart\" Roberts and his forty-gun frigate, The Royal Fortune. This painting includes a collection of combat scenes true to the period.\n  With works in galleries across the world, Chris Collingwood paints solely with traditional Dutch oil paints, manufactured now as they were in 1664. Click on the image to see more.\n         We realize some of you pirates out there like to show off your swagger\u2014we've got you covered.\nAs an add-on for $17, we also have a custom dice tray. Or, you can spend your doubloons for $25, and get 11 steel miniatures. The miniatures replace the Pirate Hunter and Treasure Fleet tokens in the game. Combine the two add-ons for an even sweeter deal of $31 (totaling $11 dollars off in combined savings).\nOr, you can throw us $30 coin for a neoprene game play mat. Combine the entire lot (dice tray + miniatures + play mat) for the sweetest deal of $51 (totaling $21 dollars off in combined savings!).\nTo add these little beauties to your pledge, add $17 (dice tray); $25 (steel miniatures); $31 (dice tray + miniatures); $30 (neoprene play mat); or, $51 (for all of 'em) per game order. \nTo keep shipping costs low, pirates can add 1 to each game order for up to 2 games. Manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nAll pledges must be made in full by March 29th. We don't use a pledge manager\u2014backers may NOT increase their pledge or add on more items at the KS prices after the campaign ends.\nWhat's better than pirates? More pirates. \nYour shipment will include every stretch goal unlocked during the campaign, regardless of your reward level! \nSo the more people who support the project, the more goals get unlocked. With your help, we can squeeze over 30% more value into that metaphorical cannon bore, and fire off a more fully stuffed game to you! \n  Click Here For Facebook \"Likes & Sharing.\"\n                                                            With the game's modular gameplay, you get to decide if tonight will be competitive or cooperative.  Don't worry, you saboteurs, there is room on the ship for you too.  \nNext, with no fixed scenario, it\u2019s as simple as drawing cards, choosing the direction to explore, rolling the sailing die, and flipping tokens on the game board to fight.\nEach time you decide where to go, you'll experience new danger as you carry out secret missions, squash mutinies, or maybe have a go at the treasure fleet, teasing you with her sweet riches. Each location becomes a real risk to your hard-won progress. \nSo do you return to your pirate haven to rest and spend part of a turn strengthening up? Or do you throw caution to the wind and press on, praying that the next enemy won't be beyond your capabilities? \nAfter all, you are a pirate and no one tells you what to do... \nCombat is both fast and deadly in The Pirate Republic.\nThe game rewards clever players and punishes sea-rovers trying to go somewhere fast without any sense of direction or pursue \"all sail, no wind\" strategies. Players must time their encounters in order to fight more effectively and strengthen their pirate.\n    More Game Reviews:  Undead Viking, Forensic Gameology, & Tantrum House.\nWe will pre-pack The Pirate Republic in a robust mailer box at the factory, and use quality fulfillment companies in each region to keep customs fees, VAT, and shipping costs as low as possible so you can back more games! All pledge levels include USD $15 for shipping, freight, and customs, though backers in some regions will need to pay additional fees, as follows:\nBackers are limited to two games per pledge (a mix of any two versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game).\nTo add more games beyond the first, or to buy add-ons, manually enter the money total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to your existing pledge.\nCheck out the rules for The Pirate Republic to see how it blends inspirations from Dungeons and Dragons\u2122 (critical hits and misses), Mage Knight\u00ae (card combat), Dead of Winter\u00ae (chaotic events), and Shadows Over Camelot\u00ae (sabotage). \nOnce this campaign funds, we will bring on professional game editor Joshua Yearsley\u2014whose work includes Vast: The Crystal Caverns and Lagoon: Land of the Druids\u2014to revamp the rulebook and cards, ensuring they read as well as the game plays.\n  We will support game stores around the world by offering Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We package 5 games into 1 carton, carton size: ~401x400x274mm, Gross weight per carton, ~14-18KG depending on reward tier.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Tom at greenfeetgames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information. After the campaign, you can reserve retail copies of The Pirate Republic by contacting our distribution broker.\n                                                                                                                                                                       Lastly...why you, why this game, why now?

We have finally been able to source huge high quality mats at a reasonable price!\n        When the Kickstarter ends, we'll email everyone a survey. When you fill-out that survey with your mailing address and such, you will also add the game you'd like for free if you pledged for Sherman Leader or higher.\nWe can do this! Tell your friends and gaming group about this amazing game and offer! Let's make this happen!\n        In Sherman Leader, you command an American group of tanks, armored cars, trucks, half tracks, and infantry squads. You get to choose your campaign. Anything from 1942 North Africa to 1945 Berlin, and everything in between. Of course we have the D-Day and Italian Campaigns!\nSherman Leader is a great game for both experienced strategy gamers and well as new players. Each campaign takes only 30 minutes to set-up, and each battle can be resolved in 15 to 30 minutes.  \nBeing a solitaire game, you can play whenever you have time, at your pace. This is very important. Sherman Leader is not a multiplayer game that has solo play rules tacked on. It was designed from the ground up to be a 1 player game.  \nSherman Leader is the latest game in our \"Leader\" series. Previous games: Hornet Leader, Phantom Leader, Thunderbolt-Apache Leader, and U-Boat Leader. As a side note, you can divide up your forces and play co-op with a friend. Let's talk a little about how the game plays.\nNot only do you get to select a Campaign, you also get to choose your Campaign's Objective. Do you want to conduct an Assault? a Holding Action, a General Offensive? Each Objective lists your resources and goals.\nMixing and matching Campaigns and Objectives gives the game endless variety and replayability.\nYou then get to select your units and commanders.  \nSherman includes dozens of American vehicles and infantry types from the early Lee's and Grant's all the way up to the late war Jumbo Shermans!\nHaving great equipment is important, but having skilled commanders is vital. Here are 3 of the 6 stages of experience for Commander Smith...\nCommanders have 6 skill levels: Recruit, Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace. They gain Experience Points when you commit them to battle, but they also suffer Stress. As they gain experience, they advance to higher skill levels and improve their stats. As they suffer Stress, their abilities decline. This means you must carefully decide when to assign your men to battle, and when to let them rest.  \nYou will be fighting against the German Army!\nHere is what your battlefield looks like...\nYou can play battles in the rural terrain of Europe, the sands of North Africa, and the freezing cold of winter!\nEach Campaign is divided into Weekly turns. During each Week, you get to assign your tanks and commanders to battles, and then resolve those battles. At the end of each Week, the German forces advance, hold, or retreat in relation to your front line. This gives you the big picture and battlefield action all in one game.\nLet's talk about what the battlefield combat is like...  \nEach battle usually lasts 5 turns. During each turn, you roll to see the German units' overall movement strategy, your Fast Commanders get to act, then the German units get to act, and then your Slow Commanders get to act.  \nEach unit moves and then attacks. Units have a speed of 0 (a Field Gun), 1 (Tanks), or 2 (Armored Cars). Units have an Attack range of 0 to 3 hexes.  \nYou move a unit, and if it is within range of an enemy unit, it gets to attack.  \nTo perform an attack, roll 2 10-sided dice.\nTo successfully attack, you need to roll the attacking unit's Attack number or higher on a die. If each successful die roll inflicts a potential Hit.\nSubtract 1 from your rolls if attacking at Range 2, and subtract 2 if attacking at Range 3.   \nFor example: Your Sherman M4 (76mm) needs to roll a 5 or higher on each 10-sided die to score a potential Hit against a Panzer III. The Tank Commander gives +1 on Attack rolls. You need to roll 4s or higher.\nFor each potential Hit you score, roll a Defense die for the target. If you roll their Defense value or lower, the Hit is negated.\nFor example: You roll a 6 and 8 to Attack. Both will Hit unless stopped by the Panzer's Defense. You roll a 1 and 4 for the Defenses. One Hit is stopped, but the other penetrates, and Destroys the Panzer. \nCombat works the same when they shoot at you.  \nInstead of destroying your Units, they inflict 1 Damage counter for each successful Attack roll that your Defense does not stop.  \nHere are a few of the Damage counters. There is a different set of counters when your Vehicle or Infantry Units suffer Damage.\nThese Damage counters have an immediate effect on your Unit. They also stay with the Unit until you pay to repair them.\n240 Full Color Cards  \n2 Full Color Counter Sheets  \n3 Full Color Sheets of MOUNTED Terrain Hexes  \n22\u201d x 17\u201d Full Color MOUNTED Tactical Sheet  \n11\" x 17\" Full Color Headquarters Sheet  \n1 10-sided die \nEach Sherman game comes with a FREE Tiger Leader Upgrade Kit. This Kit includes all the cards, counters, and rules needed to upgrade Tiger Leader to the new Sherman standard.\nAdd-Ons!\nYou can add to your pledge! Once you pledge for the game, you can then manually adjust your pledge amount to any value. When we send out the Surveys, we'll add a question asking the items you Added. We'll ship them all in the same package. Your Add-Ons will not increase your shipping cost. We will cover the extra shipping charges.\n      STRETCH GOALS!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDan Verssen Games (DVG) has the knowledge and skills to ensure that everything goes as smoothly as possible.

Everywhere you look, people and animal power are being replaced by steam-powered machines. Steam rises from every street corner, filling the city with noise and commotion. It is the industrial revolution at the height of Victorian England. A new technology called the link is on the rise and you want to profit from it. The link makes it possible to live in the sky. People are clamoring for the chance to visit or live high overhead. You decide to sink all you have into the venture. It is all or nothing. Empires of steam documents the rise of your empire as it grows on water, land and in the great expanse overhead.\n  MANEUVER phase: In this phase, the player may play one population/maneuver card. Maneuver cards are cards labeled as population/maneuver at the bottom of the card. In this phase, only consider the maneuver portion of the card. Since players do not start the game with any maneuver cards in their initial deck of (5) cards, a player will not have any maneuvers to play during the first turn, but may be able to shortly after. Normally, a player may play only one maneuver card, but this number may be modified by playing other maneuver cards from their hand. To play a MANEUVER card, the player takes the maneuver card from his hand and lays it face-up in his play area. He announces which card he is playing and follows the instructions written on that card. The player may still play a maneuver card even if he is not able to do everything the maneuver card tells him to do/ but the player must do as much as he can. Also, the player must fully resolve the maneuver card before playing another one (if he is able to play another maneuver card). For example, if a card played gives +1 maneuver, the player uses his given maneuver to play that card. Then, because of the +1 maneuver, the player gets an additional maneuver. If the card gives +2 maneuvers, then the player has an additional 2 maneuvers remaining on that turn, etc. After accumulating more maneuvers and purchases, you can use these to place cards into your empire, attack another player (counts as a maneuver) until you have used all of your maneuvers for that turn.\nPURCHASE phase: In the PURCHASE phase the player can gain a card from the supply by paying its cost. Any card in the SUPPLY may be PURCHASED (support, platforms, population/maneuver, people and coin cards). Players automatically get 1 PURCHASE per turn, but he may buy more if he played certain cards earlier in his MANEUVER phase that gave him additional PURCHASES. The cost of a card is in the lower right corner. The player may play some or all of the gold cards from his hand to his play area and add to their value the coins provided by MANEUVER cards played this turn. The player may then gain any card in the supply of equal or lesser value. He takes the purchased card from its SUPPLY pile and either places it face-down on his discard pile or placing it into his empire. He may not use the ability of the card when it is gained toward maneuvers or purchases on this turn. If you do not have enough coins to purchase a card, you can always get a (1) coin card valued at 0 coins.  \nPLACE phase: This phase is where your empire grows. Placing cards means the card expands your empire, but will not go back to your discard pile. Cards used for maneuver and purchases cannot be placed in your empire on this turn. Placing cards into your empire will shrink your playing deck, but gains you population points which is the goal of the game. Many cards require other cards in order for them to be placed and count toward your population total. When you have completed all maneuvers, purchases and placings, put all cards into your discard pile. Then draw 5 new cards from your DRAW pile to prepare for your next turn Remember you can place up to 3 cards at any point in your turn, but only from cards in your hand.  \nCOINS: Coins allow you to PURCHASE additional cards from the SUPPLY. The large number in the center of the card represents the cards purchasing power. The number in the lower right corner represents the number of coins needed to purchase the card.\nPOPULATION: The number in blue on the bottom of all population cards represents its population value. To win the game simply add up all population cards that are placed correctly in your empire. The player with the highest population wins. Remember that only the cards correctly placed in the empire count toward your score.  \nATTACK/DEFEND: Using Attack/Defense cards are optional to gameplay.  If you want to add a bit more chaos and bite to your game then use these cards.  Empires of Steam has 3 attack cards and 1 defend card. To play an attack card, it needs to be one of the 5 cards drawn from your deck. Place your card next to your opponent\u2019s card you wish to attack. This card will remain until the opponent shows a defend card, at which time you will retrieve the attack card and place it immediately into your discard pile. The DEFEND card can be shown at the same time as the initial attack or as soon as the player draws their DEFEND card from their DRAW pile. Whenever the DEFEND card is shown, then the ATTACK card goes directly to the DISCARD pile. The DEFEND card remains in the player\u2019s hand If the opponent has the attack card in place at the end of the game, any cards beyond the attacked cards will not count toward their final population score.  \nEACH TURN: During each turn you are allowed 1 MANEUVER, 1 PURCHASE and up to 3 PLACES. Additional MANEUVERS and PURCHASES can be obtained thru the MANEUVER phase.  \nNotes  \nPOPULATION/MANEUVER cards while in your hand use the \u201cabilities\u201d of the card to gain extra maneuvers, purchases or coins. These population values cannot be used toward a winning total.  \nWhen POPULATION/MANEUVER cards are placed into an empire, their abilities can no longer be used, but the population values count toward your final winning population total.  \nSource of Water: Many cards require a source of water. Unless otherwise noted, as long as an empire has a source of water, then it is sufficient for the entire empire. Cards do not need their own individual source of water.  \n\u201cExclusively\u201d: A few cards require exclusive use. For example, the Grand Hall card requires a sky platform exclusively. No other cards can use the same sky platform as the Grand Hall. To continue to build that empire, another sky platform will need to be added. Remember, you are not limited to just one land or one Ocean Empire. These empires can be numerous.\n Normal version  \nAs soon as (3) \u201cGrand Hall\u201d cards have been placed into any empire the game is over. At this time, each player totals their population points that are correctly placed into their empires. The player with the highest population total wins.  \nTimed Version\n2 players \u2013 highest population totals after 15 minutes  \n3 players \u2013 highest population totals after 20 minutes  \n4 players \u2013 highest population totals after 30 minutes\n Turn 1\n  Each player starts the game with 5 coin cards in their DRAW deck. At the beginning of each turn, a player draws the top 5 cards from their DRAW deck. Begin each turn with the MANEUVER phase. On your first turn, there are no maneuvers so move to the next phase of your turn, the PURCHASE phase. Total all coins in your HAND and from your MANEUVERED cards. On your first turn there are no MANEUVERED cards so you have 5 coins to make a PURCHASE. With 5 coins, PURCHASE any card from the SUPPLY and discard the new card and your coin cards to the DISCARD pile. Next draw the next 5 cards from the DRAW pile. Because there are no cards in your DRAW pile, shuffle the cards from your DISCARD pile and place them in the DRAW pile. This ends your first turn.\nTurn 2\nAt the end of your previous turn, you should have drawn a new hand of 5 cards from your DRAW pile. Let\u2019s assume that in your hand are now 4 coin cards and 1 card from the SUPPLY. With this new turn, you have a MANEUVER, PURCHASE and PLACE available. Let\u2019s also assume the card you purchased from TURN 1 gives you an additional coin. With your MANEUVER, play your card, gaining an additional coin. With the other 4 coins in your hand you can now PURCHASE another card worth up to 5 coins. PURCHASE a new card from the SUPPLY. With no more MANEUVERS or PURCHASES, discard all cards to the DISCARD pile. Next draw another 5 cards from the DRAW pile. Because there are not enough cards, shuffle all the cards in your DISCARD pile and place them under the cards in your DRAW pile. Now you have enough to draw a complete HAND. This ends your second turn.\nTurn 3\nAt the end of your previous turn, you should have drawn a new hand of 5 cards from your DRAW pile. Let\u2019s assume that in your hand are now 3 coin cards and 2 cards from the SUPPLY. With this new turn, you have a MANEUVER, PURCHASE and PLACE available. Let\u2019s also assume the 2 cards now give you an extra coin and an extra MANEUVER. First place the MANEUVER card. This gives you an additional MANEUVER, allowing you to play the card gaining you another coin. As you build your HAND, you may be able to play several cards as long as you gain enough additional MANEUVERS to play the extra cards. Once you play all your cards or run out of MANEUVERS, then total up your additional PURCHASES and coins. PURCHASE additional cards from the SUPPLY and place them in the DISCARD pile. PLACE cards into your empire at any point in the turn if you wish. Again, draw another 5 cards from the DRAW pile. This ends your turn.\nTurn X\nAt the end of your previous turn, you should have drawn a new hand of 5 cards from your DRAW pile. Continue to play cards from your HAND thru MANEUVERS. Gain additional MANEUVERS, PURCHASES and coins, thus growing your deck. Also consider strategic times to PLACE cards into your empire. Also consider times to use ATTACK cards to slow the growth of your opponents. Your opponents may also use ATTACK cards so keep defend cards on hand as well. Again, draw another 5 cards from the DRAW pile. This ends your turn.\nFGXgames.com\n  For all those people using searches to find your information, the following is for you.

The first player to complete the puzzle by positioning their heroes accordingly collect the quest card and its benefits. \n  Each round is broken down into two phases, the day phase and the night phase.\n  In the night phase, players will roll adventure dice in a communal press-your-luck fashion to try to accomplish the tasks at the locations they ended at during the day phase. This could be fighting a goblin, learning a spell, or delving into a temple. But be careful, if you take too much damage you may exhaust and lose all that round's progress and more! \nPlayers keep track of their heroes' collective health, power and progress on personal adventure logs.\nAnd when you acquire powerful items, you equip them right to your ITEMeeples\u2122! \nPlayers keep track of their spell progress, and the rounds magic level on a community magic mat.

Displaced veterans and ex-slaves are traveling west in search of a new life, and immigrants from across the Atlantic are spilling out of East Coast cities, searching for liberty on the frontier.\nMap by Stuart Baxter-Potter\nThe more territory that is mapped and claimed in these final years of expansion, the more native tribes are forced away from their lands and traditions. Soldiers, encouraged and supplied by the United States government, are in open war with Native Americans who refuse to give up their homes without a fight.\nArt by Cameron Cseko Cameroncseko93@gmail.com\nSilver Springs is a city in heart of Jefferson State, the most recent to be admitted into the Union. The last stop before the edge of the map, every two-bit bandit and hopeful frontiersman in the West has walked these dusty streets, as well as every legendary outlaw and every prospector who's struck it rich.\nMeanwhile, stranger things lurk in the remote fringes of the frontier, waiting to be discovered. Folk tales and legends speak of strange monsters, places that resist being found, and people with impossible powers.\nArt by Cameron Cseko Cameroncseko93@gmail.com\nNow, you and your party step into this world. How will you make your mark on the West?\nAmerican Sunset is inspired by both Western films and books, as well as the true-life history of the American West. No small amount of research went into the creation of the American Sunset setting, and the system is designed to reinforce the themes of the Western.\nPlaying the Game\nCombat is tense and fast paced, with conflict resolution built around do-or-die scenarios. Character creation is devised to so that players can create fully realized characters with their own reputation and destiny right out of the starting gate.\nArt by Calida Howell\nReputation itself is a powerful force in American Sunset, and player characters can take advantage of this by using their influence, whatever it may be, to re-shape the world around them. After performing incredible, improbable, or extraordinary feats, characters can call upon the stories of their accomplishments to bolster (or diminish!) their odds.\nIn addition, a versatile combat system allows verbal sparring to happen seamlessly alongside fistfights and shootouts. Rhetorical strategies and arguments provide a way for socially-oriented characters to stay relevant even in combat-heavy campaigns. \nMechanics Demo\nPLAY\n\n  With funding from Kickstarter we will continue development of the system. With more time, we can polish mechanics, add depth to the setting, and commission more art.\nEven more importantly, when funded, we will print and distribute hard copies of American Sunset to everyone who has supported us at the \"Book and PDF\" level or higher. Books that we ship will be soft cover with full color illustrations, filled with everything you need to play and run a campaign.\n  All of our backers who pledge more than $8 will receive a copy of the final book in a PDF format that will be made available for download. Donate more than $25, and you will receive a print copy of the game once it's fully completed. Our current plan is to print the book in softcover, with full-color illustrations. At the moment, our alpha build is approximately 100 pages, but we expect that the final version of the book will be at least 150.\nBandit Backer Tier - $8\nYou will receive a downloadable PDF copy of the full American Sunset RPG.

Basically, the first people to pledge get some kind of discount or exclusive item.\nInstead of taking that approach, if we can reach $10,000 in the first 24 hours, we will upgrade the game's huge 33\" x 17\" Mission Display from heavy paper to a Mounted Map Board! By doing things this way, everyone benefits, and it becomes a team effort.\nB-17 Flying Fortress Leader is a solitaire game.\nYou select and command Bomber Groups and Fighter Groups belonging to the US 8th Air Force as you carry out a strategic bombing campaign against German Occupied Europe.\nAs you plan and carry out your missions, the game's AI controls the German Air Defenses, Technology improvements, and allocation of resources to the European, Mediterranean, and Russian campaigns.\nB-17 is a Dean Brown design. He has worked closely with us to make sure B-17 is faithful to the Air Leader series, while at the same time having its own unique flavor!\nYou begin by selecting a Campaign sheet. Each Campaign details the year of your aerial campaign, point values of different types, objective, and special rules that make the campaign unique.\nYou then select your Bomber Group cards, Fighter Group cards, and any Renowned Commanders you would like to have command them.\nIt is then time to set-up the initial German resources and air defenses that you will be flying through.\nDuring each Mission, you select which Target card you wish to attack, plot a flight path to and from the target based on what you think the best path through the defenses is, and then resolve the Mission.\nDuring the Mission, you'll move your Bomber Formation and Fighter Escorts one leg of the flight at a time to the target, checking to see if you encounter German fighters, \"Bandits\", and resolving the air engagements along the way.\nDuring these battles, your Escorts will do their best to shield your Bombers from the swarming Bandits, but some might slip through. At which point it will be up to your gunners to destroy the incoming fighters, or at least driving them off.\nWhile at the same time, the Bandits will be doing their best to shoot down your Bombers.\nAs you approach the Target, you'll lead your Bombers through deadly fields of flak guns before being able to drop your bombs.\nOnce over target, you'll call out \"Bombs Away!\" as you rain destruction down on the factories below!\nIt is then time for the long flight home. Hopefully, the enemy fighters will not have had enough time to land, rearm, and take off again to intercept you on your home-bound journey.\nIt is up to you to inflict maximum damage on Germany's war-making capability, while at the same time bringing your brave crews home.\n At the Strategic Level, you will need to decide which Bomber and Fighter Groups to purchase. You will also need to decide how to spend your limited resources. Should you repair damaged aircraft? Purchase another Group? Purchase Technology upgrades to help you complete Missions? And more.\nYou will also see the German Air Defense strategy alter as they decide to either keep or replace their current Air Defense Commander. Each historical Commander has his own style, skills, and abilities. The AI will also move German resources around to add another layer of decision making to the game.\nEach Mission provides an attack by attack telling of the heroic action. Waves of enemy Bandits will clash with your Fighter Escorts in their desperate attempt to reach your Bombers. If any Bandits reach your Bombers, only the marksmanship of your Gunners will prevent the Bandits from shooting down your Bombers.\nEach Mission unfolds like a classic WWII movie. B-17 provides enough details to bring you into the action, without adding so much complication that it takes you out of the story.\nEach Mission takes only 15 to 20 minutes to resolve.\n Your copy of B-17 comes with...\n1 Huge 17\" x 33\" Mission Display\n280 Cards. Including...\n  Bomber Groups\n  Fighter Groups\n  Special Weapons\n  Targets\n  German Defense Commanders\n  Secondary Missions\n  Events\n2 Counter Sheets\n6 Campaign Sheets\nRulebook\nThis is a work in progress. We will update the Rulebook as we do format changes, add graphics. Here is the link to the prototype rulebook. All of the art shown is playtest art. We are building the final rulebook now.\nhttp://images.dvg.com/www.dvg.com/b17rulebook.pdf\nVery easy to learn!\nEach Mission plays in 15 to 20 minutes!\nSolitaire Game!\nCommand the greatest air offensive of all time!\n  B-17 Flying Fortress Leader will launch with an Expansion pack of plastic aircraft miniatures, plastic stands, and a huge 11\" x 17\" mounted map board! This is an enlarged version of the map shown on the Display Sheet and gives you plenty of space to move your miniatures each Mission!\nThe Bombers are roughly 40mm long and the Fighters are roughly 20mm long.\nThe Aircraft included at the start will get you up and running, and we'll add even more aircraft and more aircraft types as Stretch Goals. With your help, we can reach all the Stretch Goals and provide you with a large assortment of aircraft battling in the skies over Europe!\nAs we add minis to the Expansion, we'll increase its eventual MSRP to cover our production costs. With the initial mix of aircraft, the Expansion Pack will have a $40 MSRP.\nInitial Aircraft...\n2x B-17s\n2x B-24s\n1x B-26\n1x P-51\n1x Bf-109\n6x Stands\nAdd-On Games  \nIf you would like to Add-On any of our other DVG games, please add the following amounts to your Pledge amount.

Most crimes don't require a negotiator. But for the ones that do... you get the call. \nHostage Negotiator: Crime Wave is completely playable without any other content. So if you don't own the original Hostage Negotiator, you are still getting a fully playable game right out of the box. But having the original as well really brings out the most in this expansion! With new Conversation Cards, new Terror Cards, new Pivotal Events, new Abductors, and new Demands that can all be integrated with the original, your Hostage Negotiator experience will be taken to an all new level! Plus, with a larger box that can easily fit all released content -including the entire original game box- with room for more, you won't have to worry about any storage concerns whatsoever. But you'll still have the portability option of the original for taking on trips!\nThe box is designed to hold all of the Hostage Negotiator content released so far (with room for more!).\n  We are very proud to say that Hostage Negotiator has garnered much praise over the last year and has a very good reputation with the Solitaire community.\n2015 Solitaire Game of the Year - 1 Player Guild\nHas over 5,000 members!\n2015 Golden Geek Nominee and Runner Up for best Solitaire Game\nRunner Up\n  If you already know how the original plays, you can skip to the next section to find out what is new. But if you're new to the game, here is how it works.\nObject of the Game: Your goal as a Hostage Negotiator is to save the hostages and have the crisis end with the Abductor\u2019s capture or elimination. To win, at least half of the hostages must escape with their lives AND the Abductor must be captured or eliminated.  \nHere is what the game looks like set up on your table...  \nThe Game plays over multiple turns with each turn being comprised of 3 phases.   \n1. The Conversation Phase - this is where you play and resolve conversation cards from your hand by making a Threat Roll to influence the Abductor's Threat Level, earn Conversation Points, and save hostages. Thematically, this phase represents the back and forth dialogue between you and the abductor. Perhaps a calm conversation... or... a tense and heated exchange depending on the cards played and the results. It could also represent actions such as sending in a field team to extract some hostages while you occupy the abductor.  \nDuring the Conversation Phase you play the \u201cLittle Compromises\u201d card. The Threat level is currently on 4, so you roll two Threat dice. You get 1 success which allows you gain a Conversation Point, reduce the Threat by 1, and save 1 Hostage.\n2. The Spend Phase - this is your chance to spend any Conversation Points you may have earned in the Conversation Phase. Similar to a deck building game you will buy cards from the available area on the table, but in this game all the cards you buy go directly into your hand for use in the next or another future turn. Thematically this represents the conversational equity you've built up with the Abductor by influencing her (or him!) and/or keeping her on the phone longer so you and your command can plan a potential use of force!  \nDuring the Spend Phase you can purchase available Conversation Cards. \"All snipers engage targets!\" is a very powerful card that can end the game with one shot, but it doesn't come cheap. You'll need at least 7 Conversation Points in order to purchase it.\n3. The Terror Phase - this is where you will draw and resolve a Terror Card. In general, bad things will happen putting pressure on the Threat Level or worse... losing one or more hostages. Thematically this represents the Abductor's (or sometimes another individual such as a hostage's) actions between conversations. Maybe the Abductor decides he/she is angry or that you are not listening to his demands. Or maybe a hostage attempts to escape! The number of cards in the Terror Deck are limited to represent the ticking of the clock... after all, the Abductor has only given you a limited amount of time to meet his/her demands! The above is only a general summary of play, but we hope it gives you a good idea of the game. There are other details not discussed here such as Demands, the Pivotal Event Terror Card, the 2nd in Command, and more! \nDuring the Terror Phase you must reveal the top card on the Terror Deck. In this example, you drew \u201cFit of Rage,\u201d which will temporarily raise the Threat level by 2 as your Abductor throws a dangerous \u2013 and costly \u2013 temper tantrum.\nWe strongly suggest you take a look at the FULL RULES for the game by clicking the image below.\n(Hostage Negotiator: Crime Wave rules were not able to be posted during the campaign much to our regret, but we will share them as soon as possible. Core rules are basically the same as the original with some slight tweeks and modifications for Crime Wave.)\nOriginal Hostage Negotiator Rules\n  The Box - Normally not much is said about the box, but the box for the original can barely fit the current content. So the larger Crime Wave box complete with custom insert to keep all of your cards organized is really a big selling point. Additionally, the box will be sized to accommodate sleeved cards. \nCustom Labeled Dividers - The dividers won't simply be generic, but will be labeled by card type so that you can quickly and easily sort all of your Hostage Negotiator content.\nNew Oversized Player Board - The player board has been expanded significantly with a new design. The additional real estate will help you more easily track your hostage negotiating sessions.\nLarger Custom Dice - The custom dice have been enlarged from 16mm to 18mm, because bigger is better (especially when it comes to chucking dice!). \nNew Hostage Meeple Designs - The game now comes with two designs - one male and one female - and 10 of each will be included in the box.\nScreen Printed Alert Tokens - Tokens that remind you of triggered effects in the game. Many effects of cards in this new set trigger well after they are first revealed. \nNew Cards that use the familiar core rules of HN, but will force you to change how you approach the game. \nRules for combining Conversation Cards into one set\nRules for combining Terror Cards into one set\n*Kickstarter Exclusive for this project means not to be sold except by the publisher for promotional purposes which may include Conventions, direct from the publisher's website, or other promotional forums.\nWe are very excited to offer the next 3 Abductor Packs. Each of the new packs is from an acclaimed designer. These packs extend the game each adding new mechanisms and big challenges.  All packs are compatible with both HN and Crime Wave.\n A cult has turned to violence to push its agenda and to garner more attention. Many in the cult are as much victims as they are culprits. How will you handle the situation when the Abductors are also the Hostages? Find out in this thrilling pack.\nClyde Seaver's life is in shambles. His wife left him and in fear of losing his 2 children he's kidnapped them with the help of his loyal sister, Tina. She has the kids hidden in Becker Swamp and you have to negotiate with the suicidal Clyde and buy your team time to find the kids.\nValerie Stone was another negotiator who was constantly competing with you, but never garnered the accolades or had the level of success that you did. Ultimately it became too much for her and she's decided the only way to prove she is better than you is to force you to negotiate with her... and she knows just how to accomplish that.\n  *If you are interested in multiple copies of a pledge level, please contact the project creator via the KickStarter messaging system.\nDue to incredibly popular demand, we're now offering these add-ons to our backers. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount and we'll sort it all out after the campaign ends.\nMetallic Dice\nWe are not offering the Metallic Dice as part of this Kickstarter, but for those interested in the Metallic Dice you can get them from our partners at Javelin Dice.

Communication is of the utmost importance to us. Please ask any and all questions and we will answer as quickly as possible. \n2. We have planned out the goals for this project, but feel strongly about not overextending ourselves for the sake of more $. If we are so fortunate to run through our planned stretch reward offerings prior to the end of the project we will not add more on the fly. This will help us stay within our capabilities, our budget, and the timeline for delivery. You don't have to look far for other projects that overextend; which only ties up more backers' money and delays delivery. \n3. Your comments and feedback are REALLY important to us. If you have an idea, concern, or compliment, please share it with us! We can't promise to implement every idea that comes our way, but we will certainly consider each one! \n4.

Kickstarter takes a 5% cut of the raised funds. Amazon Payments takes another 3%. So although I have been raising $15,080 (the annual federal minimum wage), I\u2019ll actually receive $1,206 less than that. I am grateful for such an amazing platform to introduce my dream to the world and don\u2019t mind sacrificing for the privilege. Now though, I would like to raise $16,392 so that after the 8% is taken out, I will still be left with the actual minimum wage amount of $15,080.\nThe video says it best, but The Rolling Bard is a viewer-driven online storytelling road trip adventure web series to be published every Saturday morning for an entire year on YouTube! I'm trying to shoot for July 23, 2016 for the launch date. To learn more, watch my video or send me a message.\nA sprawling day at \"the office\" glorious whipping wind and weather! Just enough to make me feel alive without hurting my little Bonsai (Bob).\nSample Themes: Here are a couple examples of what an episode might focus on for a given week.\n1) I want to discuss and share experiences with my fellow military veterans. I\u2019m just one Marine with a combat deployment and I know others with five. My deployment felt like the experiential equivalent of 10 years. In the first weeks, we developed the heightened senses needed for combat. The colors were brighter, our emotions were stronger, and we lived with every ounce of our ability. With the suffering came incredible joy, love and friendship. Then we were returned home and were asked to exist in a world that was grey and lifeless by comparison. It\u2019s now been five years since my return from Afghanistan, and it may as well have been yesterday. I can still put on my combat gloves, press my face to my hands and inhale deeply, taking in the smell of memory, of war, and of the most intoxicating high I have ever felt. The floodgates of my mind\u2019s deepest vaults start to creak open, and with razor sharp clarity, I\u2019m back in the poppy fields of Sangin.\nA hero named PFC Ibarra watches over me while I speak Pashto with some local Afghans. He was welcomed through the gates of Valhalla a few days later.\n2) Employees of the Food Service industry are the most hardworking, intelligent, generous, and crazy group of people I\u2019ve had the privilege of working with. I\u2019d like to bring you into that world. We work terrible hours for no money with the good faith that our fellow man will, abide by the culture to tip us for our efforts. What isn\u2019t given enough attention is the back burner, not the one on the stove, but the place where servers, bartenders, bussers and dishwashers keep the dreams they are fighting for. We chose this work for a reason, and the fighting spirit I\u2019ve seen in those hustling for their life\u2019s greater ambition is beautiful. \nOne of my best friends Shani (a fellow server in DC), on the day we dreamed up this adventure and I began to think it was possible (June 2015)\nSupport with Significance: Support given to this campaign or throughout the year will be shared. Let\u2019s give this money meaning beyond food, gas and van modifications. I want to make room in the budget for random acts of kindness, to honor unsung heroes, and to reach out from wherever you are in the world and impact lives. You will have direct input as to when and how this happens. My vision is that you all have an active role in our community-driven project.\nCoffee with a Stranger: I will either be buying or making coffee (or tea for the Irish) for 365 strangers throughout the year. With their permission, I\u2019ll take also take their photo and create a mini-profile of the person and our conversation and upload it to social media/the website.\nBe the Bard: The Rolling Bard will host free potluck story sessions in different locations around the country, where storytellers and fans can share the magic of live storytelling. You can always come for the free food and stories, but if you want to do it right, be the bard and tell your own story.\nWhat a pretty picture!\nYour Music/Our Mix-tape: I want the entire soundtrack for this series to come from all of you. Once this project is funded, I will work to make it easy for you to upload your tracks for consideration. My great Irish friend\u2019s band supplied the main track for this first video! It\u2019s called \u201cWinter15\u201d. His band\u2019s Facebook & Sound Cloud links are here: https://www.facebook.com/castlestreetband/, https://soundcloud.com/castle-street/ I sampled from another friend\u2019s track for the introduction to the video and that song is called, \u201cLucid Fugitive\u201d and is an awesome full-song too! Check out \u2018Fifty Shades\u2019 Sound Cloud here: https://soundcloud.com/fifty-shades\nVideography Credits: Ryan Patch (Storyteller's Ink) Shot all footage from Washington, DC.\nA Short History of the Rolling Bard: The dream to become a bard was born in Ireland. I lived there for nine months while I studied Mandarin and International Development at an Irish University. I loved Ireland, but the death of a close friend brought me to the realization that waiting for any amount of time to live out my dream was a waste of my time. I flew to Washington, DC, absolutely broke, and found a rent-free room four blocks from the White House (with a nudist hoarder as a roommate) and worked in my fourth and fifth restaurants while I planned for this day. A year later I left DC, took out a loan and bought a used cargo van. Another restaurant and a few months of planning sessions later \u2026 bring us to today!\nThere are no 'bad tripods'.\nThanks to all who have been patiently helping me to review my plans and special thanks to Sandra for giving more than anyone else could. This project is dedicated to Frederic.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of right now, I have nothing else on my plate but this project. No health concerns, no relationships, and no fear. A solo-yearlong trip around America is fraught with obstacles and challenges too numerous to list. Just like the Marine Corps taught me, I will adapt and overcome and no matter what, I promise I've been through worse. Friends, this is a labor of love. I have never in my life lost so much sleep over sheer excitement! Though I expect to struggle, fail, and be frustrated. Dreams aren't dreams for being easy.\n\nSpecifically: After the project is funded I expect to take about three weeks to work out administrative issues and planning associated with the many moving parts, which a project like this will require. I have an awesome team so far and will be seeking help continuously!\n\nA few things I need to buy with some of the Kickstarter money are:\n\nVan Modifications: Just the basics (will network for local labor & help).\nInsulation, ventilation, a backup battery, a bed frame, shelving, a food cooler, a washbasin, and a curtain.\n*As I will be using salvaged wood and hitting up rummage sales for what I need, the costs are hard to define but will be low.\n\nEquipment: (Hopefully to be Rented/Loaned/Sponsored)\nTripod (\u2248$30), 2-3 lavaliere microphones (\u2248$120ea), and a motorized 360-degree tripod head (\u2248$100)\n*I also would love to get FinalCutPro ($300), and Woowave DreamSync ($200).\n\nI should be covered for anything else.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Bard", "descp": "You get to vote for one of the continental 48 states to be included on the journey.

We're pleased to present our project, the Brilliant Mug! The Brilliant mug is perfect for two audiences:\n1. For bars, clubs, and restaurants, the Brilliant Mug is a functional product that alerts staff when a customer needs another drink. It's also great for setting ambiance and creating a stunning environment!\n2. For everyday consumers, the Brilliant Mug is a fun product that's great for events, parties, gifts, holidays, camping, weddings and more! It's also perfect when relaxing in the pool or hot tub because it's completely waterproof!! We've even used them as lamps when the power went out!\nOur mugs are beautiful high-quality products; the glass mugs are ideal for less accident-prone environments, while our polycarbonate mugs are nearly indestructible and perfect for high risk environments (great for kids!!).\nPersonalize your Brilliant Mugs! We did!\nHow It Works\nThe Brilliant mug continually monitors the user's drink and will trigger when the drink is nearing empty. We've designed the Brilliant Mug with different functionalities in mind. Users can configure jumpers on the bottom of the mug to achieve desired modes. To have the mug illuminated while drinking and change to a different color when nearing empty, just use the \"Standard\" mode. This is the default mode our mugs are configured to when shipped. If you prefer not to have lights on while drinking, but want the mug to illuminate when nearing empty, use the \"Fill 'Er Up\" mode by removing only the P2 jumper on the bottom of the mug. We've also included an additional mode for fun. This mode is called \"Party's Over\". In this mode, the lights will stay illuminated until the drink is nearing empty, at which point the lights turn off. Remove only the P1 jumper to set the mug to this mode. To replace the battery, just remove the silicone plug on the bottom of the mug. We recommend using a small flat-head screwdriver to remove the battery and jumpers. \nEngineering\nWe, the developers of the Brilliant Mug, are engineers with more than 25 years of experience in the aerospace industry. We're meticulous when it comes to developing products, and have spent the past 2 years perfecting the design, functionality, and fabrication process of the Brilliant Mug. In addition to being aesthetically stunning, we've designed the Brilliant Mug to be highly efficient. Each battery lasts roughly 300 hours depending on color and configuration. We've made several revisions to the Brilliant Mug and wanted to be sure we had a solid product prior to launching our Kickstarter campaign. We use only food-grade epoxy and silicone for the Brilliant Mug so you can rest assured there are no hazardous chemicals to worry about. \nProduct Care\nDo not freeze (polycarbonate version is ok to freeze)\nDo not microwave\nDo not use with hot liquids (may degrade mug over time)  \nHand wash only (dish-washing may degrade mug over time)\nHelp us Launch the Brilliant Mug\nWe need your help! We need your backing and social media support so we can begin to mass produce the Brilliant Mug. Any help provided is greatly appreciated! Like us on Facebook and follow us on Instagram and share with your friends!\nWe've worked tirelessly with suppliers to ensure we'll receive the best pricing on supplies without having to order massive quantities. This is how we're able to launch our campaign with a backer amount of only $10,000!

If successfully funded, we can begin to explore these options as well! \nHighball / Pint Glass \nTumbler \nMargarita / Martini\nFeatured at:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe want to be completely transparent with our backers.

If you are unhappy with Campaign Trail for any reason, just return it to us within 1 month of receiving it and we will issue you a full refund.\nWe've hit our funding goal and are now working on unlocking these stretch goals!

Play a card from your hand and decide which action to take\n    2. If you have the most voters in a state, you control that state and count it's electoral votes toward your total.  \n3. After three rounds, the player with the most electoral votes is the new President!\nYou're vying for electoral votes and not all states are the same.

Thus we want to get the game into as many schools as we can.\nFor every 25 backers we get on this project, we will donate 1 copy of Campaign Trail to a school nominated by you and voted on by you. \nHere's how this works:\n1. Any backer can nominate a school of your choice using our nomination form (click the link). As part of the nomination, record a 1 to 2 minute video explaining why this school is deserving (this can be about the teachers, students, etc) and send to jeff@cosmicwombatgames.com\n2. We will post the nomination videos in a public forum so that all our backers can have access to the information.\n3. When the campaign ends we will ask each of our backers to vote for their top 5 schools from all the nominations listed. \n4. We will select the top vote getters (1 school for every 25 backers) and send them a retail copy of Campaign Trail when it is released.\nNote: This will only go into affect should the campaign fund successfully. \nWe have chosen to use the Stonemaier Games shipping and distribution method so our shipping is EU, Australia, and Canada friendly. We have tried to make the shipping as affordable as possible. The US shipping is included in the base pledge amount. That same amount is credited to all countries to help offset their shipping charges. Any additional amount will be added to your pledge at checkout.\nSee chart below for shipping amounts:\nNote: Hong Kong and Taiwan should be in the $8 additional shipping tier. We apologize for not including them originally. If you are from one of these countries go ahead and pledge, Kickstarter will charge you $20, we will then issue you a refund of $12 at the end of the campaign.\nDesign: David Cornelius - Campaign Trail was designed by our dad before either of us were born. His love of politics and strategy board games led him to come up with a card play system that placed influence in states where players worked to win the electoral college. \nIt existed on a posterboard game board with index cards and paper score sheets. But it was fun.\nDevelopment: Nathan and Jeff Cornelius - We are the founders and creative team behind Cosmic Wombat Games. We have always wanted to take our dad's game and turn it into a modern boardgame. We have been working on developing the game for the last five years.\nIllustration/Graphic Design: Chris Strain - Chris has been an illustrator and graphic designer for 14 years. He is also an accomplished game designer of his own. His credits include Evil Intent and Asking for Trobils. We knew on this relaunch that we would need some professional help with the graphic design and layout of Campaign Trail. Chris has brought that and more, giving the game a new modern look and feel with a minimalist design philosophy.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we do have one successfull Kickstarter under our belt, we do realize we are very new to this.

Time it is something you will never ever get back again. So please allow us to show and share with you how we can prolong some of your memorable moments. With Kvits you will add more valuable time to your life journey. Yet, your dining experience will never be the same and we guarantee it!\nWhat is Kvits?\nKvits is a payment platform where patrons can pay their bills at restaurants, bars, cafes and more, all without waiting for a server with a push of a button on your smart device. With Kvits you can split your bill among other guests, add a tip and even rate the service you received. Well, restaurants are a great way to spend time with friends and family, but if you dine out often, then you know how long it can take to pay for a meal. Even if your server is a pro, they still need to ask if you finished and would like a check, bring it to you, and then process the card and/or give back change. Fortunately, we have created a way to avoid these 3 steps with Kvits, now you can pay your bill whenever you and your party are ready to leave \u2013 it\u2019s dining on your own terms!\nHow Does it Work?\nSimple! As for the end user, all you have to do is download an app and with a push of a button you can be out to your next destination avoiding the frustration of 3 Waits. On the other end there is a secured software which consists of various numbers, letters, characters and all kinds of algorithms that is in the process of being developed for integration to Point of Sale (POS) systems. But we don't want you to worry about it, so we will not bore you with this information. Basically, the Kvits platform syncs with a restaurant\u2019s POS system and processes transactions in real time. All you have to do is just input or scan your table\u2019s unique identification number and pay your check via Kvits app simply by using one of your major credit cards or alternative payment services such as Paypal, Apple Pay, and traditional gift cards. And guess what? You just saved and added more valuable time for your precious moments and avoided the unnecessary frustration. How? Because now you are in charge!\nThe Impact\nAs a customer with Kvits:\nNow you are in charge of your own time avoiding the 3 Waits! \nNo waiting to call for a server to ask for a check! \nNo waiting for a server to bring a check! \nNo waiting for a server to bring a change or a credit card back! \nSplit the check between other guests or pay all by yourself. Choice is all yours.\nYou can add a tip with a tap of the screen.\nYou will be out to your next destination faster avoiding unnecessary frustration.\nSignificantly reduces the waiting time to get seated.\nYou will never be publicly embarrassed by a declined card again.\nYou can rate the services and leave instantaneous feedback for the owner's or management's personal review.\nRestaurants benefit with: \nTables turn faster, which increases sales up to 55%\nStreamlined service \u2013 servers no longer have to double back from table to table with checks, freeing up time to perform other tasks.\nLower wait times \u2013 tables will pay faster and leave more quickly, reducing the wait times for others.\nHigher customer satisfaction \u2013 diners will be impressed with your state-of-the-art system, and will remember your establishment over traditional restaurants with longer wait times.\nInternal data compiling \u2013 Kvits generates automatic reports and statistics to track promotions and other crucial information, helping you stay connected with your restaurant\u2019s needs in real time.\nOther Ways to Help\nIt's great when people can help pledge, but if you can't pledge at this time, it doesn't mean that you can't help.

The clean up process was far to annoying and time consuming. The Clean Cover Hair Mat was made to save you time and consistently maintain a clean,organized bathroom! The name Clean Cover was chosen because it fits the dilemma that was once a problem. I needed something to keep the bathroom CLEAN and something to COVER the sink.\nCLEAN COVER HAIR MAT\nThe mat covers the entire sink area with a hood made to go over the knobs to prevent any loose hair or makeup from falling in between. The hood was designed to fit any style or size sink. For wet shave the hood can be detached with a velcro connection allowing running water to go down the drain. It also has two pockets on each side for storage of brushes, combs, razors or makeup.\nTHE CLEAN COVER HAIR MAT IS UNIVERSAL BOTH MEN AND WOMEN CAN USE IT!!\nDETACHABLE HOOD FOR WET SHAVE!!\nRIGHT POCKET\nLEFT POCKET\nThere is two ways to dispose the hair clippings after dry shaving or hair cut. The first is simply brushing the hair off the mat into the garbage can, the second is simply picking up the mat and shaking it over the garbage. The Clean cover can be washed in the same sink after using, you can literally ring the Clean Cover out like a wash rag and let dry it dries in less than five minutes . Makeup can be wiped clean with a damp cloth.\nThe Clean Cover is made of Ripstop Polyester which is perfect for loose hair or makeup particles to slide off with ease plus its tuff material that will last for years.\nCLEAN COVER HAIR MAT FOR HER!!\n              FINALLY A SOLUTION!!\nMAKE GROOMING FUN AGAIN!!\nWET SHAVE!!!\nGREAT FOR TRAVEL!!!\nGREAT FOR GIFTS!!\nApproximately 30 million women experience hair lose every year, with nothing to help with the messy appearance that's left behind. The Clean Cover is the perfect solution to prevent strings of hair from clogging the drain.\nA one hundred person survey was completed in January of 2014 with 3 basic questions: 1) When you cut, trim, shave or apply makeup over the bathroom sink, how do you prevent particles from going everywhere? A) Use the towel method  B) Use newspaper  C) Nothing, run it down the drain. 2) On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest how important is it to have a clean appearance in your bathroom and avoid arguments between husbands/wives, roommates/friends, brothers/sisters etc.? 3) Would you purchase a hair mat specifically designed to prevent this problem? The results were amazing and exactly what I was looking for! 60 out of 100 uses the towel method, 37 runs hair down the drain and 3 uses newspaper! 95 people out of 100 rated 10 on the importance of a clean bathroom and avoiding arguments!  98 people out of 100 said they would purchase a hair mat now! 95 people out of 100 rated 10 on the importance of a clean bathroom and avoiding arguments.\n (FACTS) Using a towel is one of the worst methods to use, because hair particles are sharp and can get caught in cloth causing a trail of hair everytime you use it or when washing. Have you ever washed a towel that was used for hair clippings? Its a nightmare, loose hair gets into everything involved, other clothes, all over the washer, as well as the clean water. Another horrible method is running hair down the drain, which can cause unnecessary plumbing cost due to clogging in the pipes.\nMAKE LOOSE HAIR AND MAKEUP A THING OF THE PAST!\n        STOP LIVING LIKE THIS!! CONSISTENTLY MAINTAIN A CLEAN AND ORGANIZED BATHROOM!!\nNot only can you use the Clean Cover for head, face and makeup, but its great for shaving arms, underarms, nose, and chest as well.  \nHome hair-cutting kits are expanded in the U.S. year over year! (Clipper sales rise as hairlines recede) \"Wall Street Journal\". More and More people are cutting their own hair to save money. Companies like Conair, Americas largest private company has made 2.23 billion dollars in revenue. Wahl clippers are sold in 165 countries world wide with also 154.6 million in revenue and Andis, a fairly new company just started in 2010 had already made 4.11 million. I give you those statistics to say if people are spending millions and millions of dollars on home hair-cutting kits, there is a high demand for a product to make it more convenient, fast, easy, and efficient to clean up after yourself. Hair clippers and a Clean Cover go hand and hand, meaning alot of money can be made.\nThe Clean Cover could even be pitched to one of the above companies as a package that includes a set of clippers and a Clean Cover Hair Mat.\n\nWhat makes the clean cover so unique is that it can fit any style, shape or size sink as well as being universal both MEN and WOMEN can use it. The Clean Cover can also be personalized with team logo, picture, name or uplifting quote.\n\nThe market for this product is wide open. There is absolutely nothing like it. College kids would buy, moms for the men in the house, dads for the lady's in the house, roommates, friends, brothers, sisters. I see this product selling out during the holidays.\n\nOver time the Clean Cover has improved and added features along the way!

Head over to www.battlemindgame.com! Stay tuned for a new Battlemind game (different theme) coming soon! \nNOTE:  The game's name has been changed from \"Cyvase\" to \"Battlemind\". This is not associated with George R. R. Martin or HBO in any way whatsoever.  Per Kickstarter, the reward tiers can't be changed and still say \"Cyvase\" as the game name. \nOnyx army | 300 gsm card stock | 2.25\" x 3.15\"\nJade army | 300 gsm card stock | 2.25\" x 3.15\"\nTerrain cards | 300 gsm card stock | 2.5\" x 3.5\"\nGame contents: 115 cards (22 character, 92 terrain, and 1 title)\nBattlemind is a medieval-themed battle strategy game in which two players, each with 10 character cards, try to capture/kill the other player's King. Inspired by the game from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels (HBO's Game of Thrones is based on this series), Battlemind combines the strategic elements of Chess, Stratego, and Blitzkrieg to create a an easy to learn but hard to master game with infinite replayability. This game is for anyone who loves strategy games - not just fans of the books!\nWhat makes Battlemind special? Instead of being played like a typical card game (dealing/drawing), it is played more like a board game, with players setting up a \"board\" made of terrain cards and moving character cards across them. \nLike chess, each character card has a certain number of spaces in which it can move. But that's where the similarities end. Each character has a strength value (1-8) which dictates whether it can capture/kill another character as well as certain advantages and disadvantages over other characters. From the lowly Rabble (rabble is like an angry mob) to the powerful Dragon, every unit has a purpose.  How you use them is up to you! \nFinally, each terrain type can benefit or hinder your character. Use terrain to slow your enemy down, protect your fortress, and even hide from Dragons!\nUltimately, how you set up your terrain, arrange your army, and advance your units will determine whether you will be the victor or the vanquished. You'll laugh at your opponent when he places a crucial unit on his front line that you are able to capture easily, but will be crushed when that same placement allows him to capture your dragon on his first move in the next game!\nWill you create a defensive stronghold and make your advesary come to you?  Or will you storm the front lines in hopes of catching your opponent off guard? \nIt's your decision.  The fate of the Kingdom rests on your shoulders. Fight for honor.  Fight for glory.  But remember: in the game of Battlemind, every move can mean victory or crushing defeat. \nIf you're a fan of HBO's Game of Thrones or A Song of Ice and Fire, the series of novels upon which the show is based, you may already know about the chess-like game many of the characters play called cyvasse.  \nAfter reading the books, I became fascinated with this game. I immediately went looking around on the internet for all of the information I could find. I wanted to play cyvasse, but couldn't find a cheap and portable physical version. I'm a maker and really enjoy creating things, so I decided to create a version myself.  \nIn the novels, George R. R. Martin loosely describes the game pieces and how the game is played, but doesn't go into any detail about the rules. So, I took what I could from the books (The 10 specific characters/ placing terrain) and some rule ideas I had found online and just used my imagination from there. According to Martin, cyvasse was inspired by \"a bit of chess, a bit of blitzkrieg, a bit of stratego. Mix well and add imagination.\" \nThe game is completely designed, manufacturers are waiting to produce the cards, and the prototype has been tested. I need a minimum of $2500 to order a first print run of the game and get it to backers. I hope you enjoy and commit to helping me bring it to life!\nTo create the board upon which the characters are played, each player places 32 terrain cards (20 Grassland, 4 Forest, 4 Mountain, 3 Wetland, 1 Fortress) in a 8 card x 4 card grid, for a total board size of 64 cards.  \nEach setup is done in secret, so players must take turns to set up their side and then cover it while the other player does so.\nSince every game the \"board\" is set up differently, no two games are ever the same!  \nTerrain setup.\nPLAY\n\nNext, each player arranges his 10 character units on his home side as he sees fit, with the King starting on the Fortress.\nHome setup.\nPLAY\n\nPlayers then flip for first to act and play commences with players moving their character units across the board in order to capture their opponent's units and eventually capture his King. We have included a \"gold\" coin (1\"x1\" solid brass) with a Dragon on one side and a Crown on the other you can use to flip. \nAdd $10 to your pledge ($17 for the double game tiers) and we will include a pair of Dragons, 3D printed with black ABS plastice and measuring at 2\" wide x 2.5\" tall, that you can use to hold a screen between Home sides. We are using a piece of poster board 21\" wide x 9\" tall. This prevents one player from having to leave the room as the other player sets up, and also creates an additional way to \"play\" for who strikes first: the FIRST player who successfully sets up their side is the FIRST to act.  Who can strategically set up the fastest?  \nDragons designed by Dutchmogul. Click for source.\nThe three really awesome things about Battlemind that make it a challenging strategy game and really fun at the same time are:\nCharacter movement/attack patterns\nCharacter advantages/disadvantages\nTerrain differences\nTo give you a leg up on your opponents, you will have access to a digital strategy guide that will help you through strategic setup and play for your terrain and unit cards. \nEach character has certain attributes that govern where it can move and which units it can attack. The Trebuchet, for instance, is a long range weapon and can attack 3 spaces in any direction.  However, it must shoot full range, meaning it can't attack 1 or 2 spaces away. \nIn the following setup, the Trebuchet would be able to successfully capture the Heavy Horse, but not the Spearmen.  Additionally, if there was a Dragon roosting on the Mountain, the Trebuchet could capture it, as range weapons can capture Dragons while they roost on Mountains. \nMost characters have special characteristics which create advantages/or disadvantages for them based on other characters or terrain.  Here are some examples:\nThe Spearmen may not be captured by calvary units (Light Horse/Heavy Horse).  This makes it a great unit to use defensively. \nThe Dragon may only be captured by range units (Trebuchet/Catapult/Crossbowmen). \nThe Elephant (6) may capture the Trebuchet (8) (Units usually can only capture other units one strength level above them).\nEach type of terrain can benefit or hinder the game units. Here are some examples:\nForests slow down calvary units and can hide units from Dragons. Catapults and Trebuchets can't attack from Forests.  \nThe Fortress protects any unit inside from being captured but is ruined once it's attacked.  \nIf a units ends its turn on Wetland, it may not move the next turn. \nPlace your terrain carefully! It is often the difference between victory and defeat!  In the following setup, the Dragon may not capture, the Catapult, because it is hiding in a Forest.  However, the Catapult also may not attack the Dragon, because it may not attack from Forests!\nOne of the great things about this deck is you can make the game your own! To assist with that, we included the following EXTRA cards for alternate play:\n(2) Red Priestess cards (extra character)\n(4) Hill cards (extra terrain)\n(24) Grassland cards (extra terrain)\nThe Red Priestess is meant to switch places with the Spearmen.  Her advantage is magic (adds +1 to a character's strength for 4 rounds but on the 5th round it is sacrificed!). This adds another strategic element to the game. \n The Hill terrain piece can be used in addition to your other terrain cards.  When a range unit is placed on a Hill, its range is increased by 1 space. \nSTRETCH GOAL REACHED!  New alternate \"Township\" terrain card will be included in the deck! (one for each player). The Township will most likely allow only melee units to enter and either they may not be attacked there by other melee units (only siege engines) or they will receive a defensive bonus there!  (This will not be included in strategy guide). \nWant less complexity? Switch out some or all of your Mountain, Forest, and Wetland Tiles for Grassland.  This will take the terrain element out of the game (which is a large part of the game) and allow you to battle it out on an open field.  (It also makes the game move more quickly). \nYou can also play the game with predetermined terrain setups. This adds another interesting element to game play and takes away the advantage of players being able to set up their terrain to their advantage.  Here's one idea, but the possibilities are endless:\nLonely Mountain setup.\nDon't like something else about the game?  Change it!  Create your own rules! The possibilities are endless!\nWe're offering a ton of cool art during this campaign, so don't miss out on the opportunity to get something one-of-a-kind.

Kangol is the world\u2019s most famous headwear brand and it\u2019s been worn by some of the world\u2019s most famous celebrities like Brad Pitt, Bill Murray, Eminem, Samuel L. Jackson, Gwen Stefani, Kid Rock, Madonna, Miley Cyrus, and others.  \nKangol is a brand that was born in Britain and grew up on the streets of New York and now we\u2019d like your help to bring another icon to the states and move as much as possible of the Kangol 504\u2019s manufacturing stateside with the Bollman Hat Company. \nWe\u2019re looking for your help us bring the historic machinery that has been used to make the Kangol 504 and other styles since the start of Kangol to the states and create new American jobs. \nBollman Hat Company is America's oldest hat maker.\nThe Bollman Hat Company is the oldest hat maker in America dating back to 1868. We are employee-owned and pay our employee-owners a living wage. In 2001, Bollman Hat Company acquired the global license to design, produce, and distribute Kangol headwear. By the time Bollman Hat Company had acquired the license, the decision had already been made by the previous ownership to move all the manufacturing to a factory in China which was created in the mid-1990s to stay competitive. The factory in China was purchased in 2006 by a Chinese hat maker who has now decided to exit due to rising labor costs in Southern China. Since acquiring the Kangol license, Bollman Hat Company made several Kangol straw, wool felt, and fur felt styles in their factory in Pennsylvania, but until now, did not make knitted and blocked hats which are the most iconic Kangol styles. \nThe 1932 staff of Bollman Hat Company.\nAbout The Kangol\u00ae 504\nThe Wool 504 is the iconic, original Kangol\u00ae Cap. First introduced in 1954, the 504 cap gets its name from the block number that it is made on. The 100% seamless wool cap is the ultimate cap for comfort and style and now for the first time ever Made In The USA.\nWhy Do We Need These Machines?\nOver the years there has been attempts to duplicate the machines unsuccessfully.  As our Design Director, Nic Harris, likes to point out this is very similar to the denim selvage machines that jean manufacturers replaced in the 80's.  The result was less of a quality product than what was produced with the older, slower machines.  We're not interested in faster machines that make an inferior product.  We want to keep the quality that has built Kangol and that our customers love.  \nThe manufacturing of the 504 requires special machinery which was built specifically for Kangol in the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s to create the knit of the 504. These are the same machines we are looking for your help to move today. These special machines were each customized to knit, link, tease, shear, and block the Kangol 504 style. Other styles will follow with sufficient funding. \nOne of the ten machines already brought to the US.\nWe have already moved 10 of the machines over to the U.S. and made the necessary electrical conversions for the equipment to work in the U.S., but there are another 70 machines yet to move. Altogether, the cost to move it will be over $650,000. Bollman Hat Company has invested more than $350,000 and in addition we\u2019ve already secured $60,000 from the Department of Community & Economic Development\u2019s Pennsylvania First Program grant, $82,000 in Job Creation Tax Credits, and $18,450 in Workforce and Economic Development Network of Pennsylvania helping to fund the skills training needed for our employee owners. The cost of making the Kangol product in the U.S. is estimated to be more than twice the cost of making it in China, but we eliminate the transportation costs to North America, achieve faster customer turnaround, and control our innovation. \nWhy Do We Want To Bring These Machines To America?\nAmerica became a world leader because of its manufacturing strength and the middle class built by this strength. Over the past 50 years America has lost its title of the world manufacturing leader with many of the jobs going overseas to China, India, and Bangladesh. That doesn\u2019t mean that great products can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be made here and Bollman Hat Company is a testament to that. Aside from being America\u2019s oldest hat maker and nearly 150 years old, Bollman Hat Company is also the founding member of American Made Matters, a community of US Makers with a focus on bringing attention to the importance of making and buying American products. Bollman Hat Company and American Made Matters believe that if it can be made here, it should be made here! The beloved Kangol 504 is the next piece in that puzzle.\nPLAY\n\nBringing the 504 and other Kangol styles' production to America will create dozens of new jobs for American workers while maintaining the current workforce and that can make a big impact.\nA Rewarding Campaign.\nWe've worked hard to come up with some great rewards for backers so not only do you get to feel good about where your money is going but you'll be able to show off your support too.  We've also created bundles so you can get almost any combination of rewards you'd like.\nSome of our rewards include:\nWe\u2019d like your help in strengthening America again and bringing jobs back to the U.S. Your help will be greatly appreciated and reinforce the tide of change to bring back Made In The U.S.A.\nSpecial thanks go to our friends Samuel L.

We have tried to create most of the design, cover art and printing material ourselves, but apparently we are not professionals.\nSo swallowing our pride we are now facing the cost of printing on actual paper and not toilet rolls. We have design cost, cover art, page layout, binding, proof cost, ISBN cost, there's shipping supplies, envelopes, padding, labels, administrative and distribution cost...which are among many other fancy words we thought we could just plagiarize from other projects. Turns out we also have to pay for all of this. I know, such bullshit right!?\nAwesome Perks/Rewards - We believe that even if you pledge a small amount you should still get something awesome. We got a wide range of different rewards. Maybe you want us to whisper your name in the ear of a baby sloth the next time we kidnap one from the zoo,  maybe you just want the book with a personalized drunk note, or maybe you want Ace to fly out and party with you at a foam rave. We got all that and much more. Check out all the classic rewards in the column to the right.\nLifestyle Choice - Everyone has their own unique sense of humor and ours is pretty weird but we believe it's a big part of who we are so we embrace it...maybe too much. But if you believe that you can resonate with such a humor we think it's a reason to support us.\nCoffee Table Book - This book obviously falls under the category of comedy but it's also a prime example of a coffee table book, and you can never have enough of those.\nCoaster - Read the sentence above but replace \"coffee table book\" with Coaster.\nIt's a Weapon - Read the sentence about Coffee Table Book but replace \"coffee table book\" with weapon. Because you never know when you'll need to throw a pointy corner into someone's eye. Support our project and support your right to self defense.\nFirewood - At the very least this book can keep you a little warm during the winter time.\nKicking it Forward - We will kick life into a bunch of awesome projects with your help: http://kickingitforward.org\nOther Great Reasons:\nBecause this book is like getting an A on a test that you didn't even study for.\nThis book is like playing a sport for the first time and realizing you're awesome at it.\nThis book is like drinking yourself into oblivion and waking up without an hangover.\nBecause last week you spent $15 on Starbucks coffee and lifestyle magazines alone.\nBecause $15 wouldn't even cover the four drinks you got peer pressured into buying at that place you didn't even want to go to but your friends dragged you along. They all wanted different fu**ing drinks making the order super complicated and leaving the bartender angry at you. Next thing you know all your friends have magically disappeared like innocence at a strip club. Nobody bought you back drinks. The music sucks and is giving you permanent ear damage.

But over time and as you get older, you realize that things aren\u2019t as easy as they sound\u2014and letting go of these kind of dreams becomes very easy.

Not the lifestyle that would last me for long, and that\u2019s when I started the foundation of my brand. I started designing leopard-print hats with the \u201cLEOPARD\u00cbT\u201d name embroidered on the front. The leopard was a unique animal just like my background, and LEOPARD\u00cbT was my better, more fashionable and sophisticated version of a leopard. \nStarting a fashion brand with limited resources and learning the ways of a fashion designer has been challenging and fascinating at the same. I have been rejected by stores, agencies, factories (etc.) and have been told many times \"to stay away from the competitive industry\"..\"you are never going to make it\"  but it will take more than that to stop this train.

But the biggest one has to be quantities. They make or break the fashion business, especially for small brand. Factories will turn their back on you the moment they hear that you can't meet their minimums. Which are usually the high hundreds or thousands if you want to get decent profit margins. After deciding to move the production to Los Angeles, in just two months I was able to find family owned companies here in Los Angeles that can manufacture smaller quantities (starting at 100 pieces). Despite U.S. labor and cost to make a piece of clothing being more expensive over here, it's worth it because I have stronger relationships with the factories and am able to monitor projects.

We truly worked hard to come up with the most essential elements of the games that have become huge hits all over the world, but we are bringing in very unique and useful elements. For example, the players will be able to level up there troops by using them, not by paying huge amounts of resources and waiting for days to complete.\nThink of a supercharged Age of Empires style game that has been upgraded for mobiles. To most people the name Clash of Clans will be more familiar and the addictive elements of this game has all been brought to Age of Stickmen.\nWe have worked very hard to get this entire game concept moving forward with character development, strategy tweaks and revamps that will turn it into an instant hit. We just need your support in order to be able to get the entire process done with as many resources as possible.\nOur commitment to this project has been huge and we have invested a lot of time and money into bringing this concept to the level that allows for the development process to be the next logical step.\nThis game will have enhanced gameplay, replay value, fair level up systems and it will not make you feel like you have wasted your efforts if leveling them up. You will be given a chance to revive units that have reached a certain level and this will make it fair for anyone who invests plenty of time in upgrading.\nYou will also be able to control your units with the swipe of a finger, which is a very refreshing addition to this game. In pre-battle mode you can organize your troops into smaller groups to be able to control them easier throughout the battle.\n\nFeatures of the Game:\nEra: Roman Empire \nStory line: You have been sent by Caesar to establish a new Roman Settlement for the purpose of helping secure the newly conquered land. This is a wild and dangerous land. You need to make sure you prepare your Settlement to defend off attacks from unfriendly Settlements. You are given the authority to attack anyone you see fit for the glory of the Empire.\nBuildings: Everything will be based off the Roman style. Market, Marble Quarries, Iron works, Castra (which can house 150 troops), Academy etc.\nBuilders: We want the user to start off with two builders. This allows the user to build more than one building at a time, from the start. By having two builders at the beginning it will also let us show the user the new feature.\nBuilders can be stacked!! Example: If I upgrade my Marble Quarry to level 5, it will take 24 hours to complete with just one builder. I can take a second builder and add him to the project thus diminishing the project by a quarter of the time (from 24 hours to 18 hours). I could then add a 3rd or 4th builder as well.\nResources: The two main resources for now will be Marble and Iron.\nTroops: We have a special plan for troops. Troops sent into battle, whether you win, lose, or retreat, will not be lost if they haven\u2019t died. Players will not have to save up and spend resources to upgrade troops. Troops will be upgraded by the experience they gain from battles. They will gain more experience from winning than from losing. Troops can also be upgraded from another vital aspect \u2013 the Academy. By placing troops in the Academy, the user is giving them up for \u201cX\u201d amount of time. If a troop is in the Academy they will gain experience 5X faster than a troop who fights in battle. The different units will also change in appearance as they level up.\nThe troops will of course be Roman style: Legionary \u2013 Infantry, Praetorians- Heavy Infantry, Archers, Auxiliary Archers (Archers on horses), Catapults, Rams, Trebuchets, Pikeman etc. Each one will be worth a certain number of troops. Defences/Traps: Archer towers, Trebuchets on walls, Boiling pots of Oil on walls, Massive wooden-spiked bear traps hidden underground, Ballista, Attack Dogs, Walls (Up-gradable from wood poles to Stone Walls) etc.\nPlayer vs. Player: In other mobile strategy games, you can only attack a person when they are offline. In this game, not only will players be able to attack/revenge a person while they are online but the player being attacked can use up to \u00bc of his army to defend himself. A player can also place \u00bc of his army to defend him while he is offline too.\nCard integration: When you attack a village and win you get a random card that can be either defensive or offensive. When attacking, a player can use an offensive card to give him a slight advantage.  A Defender can also use a card when attacked and store a card to be used while offline.\nGems: We are calling them Denarii based off of what the Romans called their coins. We do not want to make the mistake of other developers and build the game around the \u201cgem concept\u201d. This is where a lot of game apps have failed/frustrated their users. Instead, game-play will be the main focus. Rewarding users for playing the game, rather than forcing them to use \"Gems\" because they feel like they're not getting anywhere.\nMorale Meter: In Rome, when the army returned from war, the city was excited and the troop and citizen\u2019s morale was boosted. We want to integrate this into the game. We would like to have a \u201cMorale Meter\u201d located somewhere on the screen. When the Meter is at 0% the Iron and Marble mines are at normal mining rate. When it is at 100% the rate of mining is doubled. Also, when the meter is kept at between 95-100% for a certain period of time, Caesar will send a special gift to the player \u2013Denarii. The way to make the Meter go up is by winning attacks. When you win, it goes up and when you lose to many times in a row, it comes down a little. Also, doing nothing causes the Meter to go down.\n\nConclusion\nWe are truly looking forward to bringing this game to the community and we are looking for support from everyone who is a fan of games that foster strategic planning and help exercise the mind.\nThis is the kind of game that you should support if you love strategy gaming.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenge we have, is needing to get the development started.

LED flares (or e-flares) are becoming the best practice for roadway safety around the globe.\nThe Care-Flare, a patented, innovative e-flare solution, introduces a new standard to the world of LED flares. The Care-Flare is intuitive to use, highly visible, reliable in even the most extreme conditions and environmentally friendly.\nIntroducing the Care-Flare\nMy name is Adam Cotsman and I am the creator of the Care-Flare.\nI am a paramedic with over eleven years experience in one of Canada's most progressive Paramedic Services. I have used combustible (or incendiary) flares many times when responding to emergency calls. Whenever I used them, I was always struck by their many shortfalls and how unsafe I felt. As I did more research, I found others who shared my deep unease. \nNumerous studies highlight the combustible flare's many drawbacks. They burn at high temperatures and can ignite fires and injure those who use them (Evaluation of Chemical and Electric Flares). They are challenging to handle, burnout quickly, pollute our air and leave hazardous waste on roads which contaminates our water (Evaluation of Alternative Causes of Widespread, Low Concentration Perchlorate Impacts to Groundwater). \nConcerned, I created a product that introduces a higher level of safety, is environmentally friendly and is simple to use.\nCare-Flare is for everyone!\nThe Care-Flare is essential for EVERYONE who drives. Crashes involving pulled over vehicles are an all too common devastating occurrence. Annually, nearly 350,000 parked or disabled vehicle crashes occur in the U.S. alone, in which an average of 507 people are killed and over 30,000 people are injured (The Impact of Highway Safety Flares on Driver Behavior). Having professional-grade Care-Flares handy could be a life saving decision during emergencies or vehicle failures.\nThe unique design\nThe Care-Flare was designed in close consultation with emergency service personnel, industrial designers, electrical engineers, certified Health and Safety Committee members and logistics experts.\nAs a first responder, my life and the lives of those at an emergency scene depend on the effectiveness of the flares that I am using. I trust Care-Flare with my life.\nCare-Flare's unique design reflects its simplicity, durability, reliability and ease of use:\n\u2022 Two simple settings that are easy to activate: a flashing sequence (seen above) as well as a fixed red light\n\u2022 Robust structure ensures that it functions even in the most volatile conditions\n\u2022 Its length (39 cm / 15.35 in) ensures maximum visibility \n\u2022 Light output can be seen from 2000+ meters / 6560+ feet \n\u2022 On flashing sequence, runs for 70+ hours on four 'C' cell alkaline batteries \n\u2022 Functions in extreme cold (-40\u00b0C / -40\u00b0F) and heat (+40\u00b0C / 104\u00b0F) \n\u2022 Drop resistant and waterproof\n\u2022 The LED light source of the Care-Flare provides an environmentally conscious alternative to combustible flares. The Care-Flare is CE and RoHS certified\nWhat's next?\nFor over 2 years, we have secured intellectual property, completed multiple prototypes, built the tooling, completed the first small production order, done vigorous testing and certifications and it is currently being trialed in the field during real life emergencies.\nWe are launching globally in 2016 but require a large production order to obtain a discounted rate with our manufacturer. The larger the order, the larger the discount. \n\nTo thank those who support the Care-Flare campaign, we are offering the following rewards:\nThank you for creating safer roadways for everyone!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have estimated a delivery date of April 2016.

Now, to raise awareness on the state and fragility of nature, he takes on a one-man expedition in the Gulf of Mexico, which he calls Exileration.\n\u201cI am going on a one-man expedition to create art and draw awareness to the fragility our natural surroundings. I am traveling to the U.S. National seashore in the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d says the artist. He will be going to Horn Island, one of the barrier islands off the coast of Mississippi and Alabama. \n \u201cOne of my goals is increasing the urgency and understanding of the fragile place we put ourselves in by neglecting our impact on the world,\u201d states artist, who will live on the park in the island, in primitive camping conditions and with only the bare necessities.\nLewellyn\u2019s projects and advocacy was inspired by Walter Anderson, an artist and naturalist who also lived in Horn Island for a time to document the life around him through radiant watercolor art. Lewellyn hopes to follow Anderson\u2019s footsteps and continue to document the natural ecosystem in the island.\nThrough the crowdfunding campaign, Lewellyn aims to raise the funds to cover the costs for the needed camera and equipment to document his trip. Part of the funds will also go to boat prototyping materials and supplies such as food and a tent he himself designed.\nAccording to him, his Exileration project is a three-part piece, which includes planning the trip, exile on Horn Island, and the creation of the film and other work for exhibit. He has chosen Horn Island because the location has been under much stress due to human hazards, such as the BP oil spill and the US Army Mustard Gas contamination.\nFrom 1943 to 1945, Horn Island was closed to public access and activity for use as a biological weapons testing site by the US Army. Later on, asbestos materials were identified around old concrete foundations on the north side of Horn Island, known as The Chimney. Asbestos has shown to be a cancer-causing agent. In addition, mustard gas residue has been detected in the sands nearby the US Army testing sites. Mustard gas is a blistering agent that attacks the eyes and respiratory systems. While the military is in the process of destroying any residue, Lewellyn aims to go deeper and investigates on the effects of these military operations to the ecosystem in the area.\nIn return, backers of the campaign will receive copies of his artwork through wallpapers, postcards, and signed prints. Backers will also receive printed and electronic invitations to every gallery and museum show exhibiting Exileration. Higher tier backers will receive a digital copy of the documentary film, be included in the film credits, and many more.\nAbout Sabe Lewellyn\nSabe has been an artist and designer for over 12 years. Exileration is the second of two projects that he has undergone to help educate people and involve them in environmental issues. His experience includes participation in the Particles on the Wall exhibit at University of Washington. Soon a book will be released that includes his contribution to that project. This was an interdisciplinary exhibit exploring the elements of the nuclear age, Hanford history, and its impacts on humans and the environment.\nSupply List:\nTent\nFirst Aid kit\nBack pack\nBedding\nSunscreen, chapstick, nose sunblock, aloe vera\nInsect repellent spray\nPancho\nSea suds\nFlash light\nPersonal canteen\u2013\u2013\u2013Camp Water Jug 21 gallons\nShovel\nEating utensils\nGarbage bags (medium kitchen)\nlight rope,\nDuck Tape\nThe bulk of this Funds will actually be for:\nSeveral Camera (probably Gopro) Sound Equipement Solar Charger Gimbal (steady cam) Drone\nDeepwater Horizon: Or the BP Oil Spill\nApril 20 marks 5 years since the Deepwater Horizon suddenly exploded. It is considered the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, an estimated 8% to 31% larger in volume than the previously largest. Following the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, a sea-floor oil gusher flowed for 87 days, until it was capped on 15 July 2010. The US Government estimated the total discharge at 4.9 million barrels.\n\nMore on the spill and the aftermath five years later by Jean-Michel Cousteau.\nGreen: Army NOT Ecological\nFrom 1943 to 1945, Horn Island was closed to all public access and activity for use as a biological weapons testing site by the U.S. Army.\nAsbestos materials have been identified around old concrete foundations on the north side of Horn Island known as The Chimney, which was operated from late 1943 to 1944 by the Department of War to test biological toxins.\nnorth side of Horn Island known as The Chimney north side of Horn Island known as The Chimney\nIn addition, mustard gas residue has been detected in the sand nearby, Brown said.\nIn all, National Park Service officials are permanently closing 30 acres to the public and park rangers. This area also includes the Big Lagoon.\nCivilian Mask for Personell\n\"There is literature that suggests mustard containers were brought into the water. That was a prudent way to store mustard gas at the time because it doesn't mix with water,\" said Cmdr. Brian L. Cook, environmental and sustainability manager with the Public Health Service, National Park Service, out of the Atlanta, Ga., office.\nWhile asbestos has shown to be a cancer causing agent, mustard gas is a blistering agent that attacks the eyes and respiratory systems, Cook said.\nMaintenance manual\nThe military is in the process of destroying any reserves of the chemical, he said.\nThe National Park Service plans to contact the federal agency that handles site cleanups used at defense sites under a federally funded program, Cook said.\n\"I'm not sure what agency. I've never worked with them before,\" he said.\nThere will be phases to go through, studies to complete and several agencies coordinating with each other before the actual cleanup can occur, he said.\n\"The magnitude would be at my estimate some number of years to complete,\" Cook said. \"This is not uncommon with hazardous waste sites.\"\nArt Influences\nOne artist who has a direct influence on the nature and structure of this project is Walter Anderson.\nAfter the Horn Island was opened to public use by the US Army in 1946, it was no longer used for biological weapons testing and more about that later, Walter would boat out and live on the island on and off until his death in 1965. Drawing and painting the native ecosystem.

Stability test failed.\nPLAY\n\nStability issue is solved. Now with an outrigger the boat should be able to take a sail.\nPLAY\n\nOn this day Sabe was wearing a 4:3 wetsuit, which would of been just enough if he used it, but was too much for staying dry. The deeper the water the better it handles, but the test of 8-1 foot water passed and the draft even with ballast and the rest of the gear will be in inches. Once good paddles are purchased and finalize the design it will get around in these outer bank areas.\nCenter For Wooden Boats\nThe CWB, as it is called, is a hands-on maritime museum where every visitor has opportunities to engage in heritage experiences.\nThey have been very helpful to the project not only as a great place for inspiration, but Sabe has been using the boats in their livery and learned dead reckoning from one of the many classes the center offers.\n\nIf you are in Seattle take time to check it out.\nSome of the row boats in the CWB livery\nStretch Goals Unlocked\nThe Island of fully funded has been reached.\nBut this isn't the final destination in the archipelago.\nNow that this project is fully funded Sabe would like to make this the best movie he can. To get the ball rolling with only $500 another camera can be purchased. And after looking at the budget $7,000 is the number needed for a quality full-length cinematic film.\nRight now the focus should just be on the next $500. When that is reached two things will happen: everyone who backed $5 and above will get temporary tattoos of \"Dead Men Vote Twice at Elections\" and the next goal will unlock the reward of naming the boat that will take Sabe into the Gulf.\nLoose Lips Float Ships\nSo, tell your friends.

It isn't overstating that Sabe is putting his life on the line. There are risks here. Luckily due to the nature of the project, it can be written off as production value.

A chosen few were selected to help restore the stars! In Astrum Resurrectione you have the task of rebuilding that galaxy. Are you up to the challenge? \nComponents:\n1 Game Box\n68 Galaxy Cards (Main Deck)\n12 Mission Cards (Victory Conditions)\n1 Set of the Rules of Play\n*** All Cards will be Beautifully Rendered - Poker Sized ***\nBuild your own solar system in this fast paced, space game for 2-7 players. During the game players race to connect planet and star cards together to form a unique, expansive, solar system scene. Final victory is secured in the end by the player with the most galaxy points.\n By connecting planet and star cards, a player can harness the power of celestial bodies providing them unique advantages over other players: faster draws, extra plays, trade access, card destruction, and much more!\nGameplay Video Review: Eric Howell\n Gameplay Part 1: (Feat: Ellie Belle)\nPLAY\n\n Gameplay Part 2: (Feat: The Completed Star)\nPLAY\n\nQuick Rules:\nSet Up: Shuffle both decks. All players start the game with 5 galaxy cards from the large main deck and 3 mission cards from the mission deck.\nMissions: Mission cards are kept hidden from other players until the end of the game and serve as objectives for players to try to complete during the game- example \"build 2 dwarf planets.\" Be careful though, if a mission isn't completed by the end of the game then it subtracts instead of adds from your total victory (galaxy) points.\nTurns and Galaxy Deck: The galaxy card deck is shared by all players and set in the center of them. Each turn a player draws 1 galaxy card and can play 1 galaxy card to build their solar system scene. The 1st card played by each player starts that players scene but all additional cards must be played only in allowed ways shown on the top left of the cards by the placement key.\nBonus Actions: All galaxy deck cards have a bonus action that comes into play once the card is placed into a player's scene. Some actions include (draw 1, play +1, trade 2, etc.). Most actions are shown on the top left of each galaxy card directly under the placement key and those only happen only 1 time when the card is played. If the action appears in the top right of the card, then it is a celestial event and the action can be used every turn.\nEnd of Game and Galaxy (Victory) Points: Once the galaxy deck runs out, all players get one last turn to play cards to their scene and complete remaining missions. Afterwards the game ends and players total up their galaxy points which can be found at the top right of all played galaxy cards. Players then reveal and score or subtract from any failed or completed missions. In the end, everyone has created an awesome space scene and the player with the most galaxy points wins!\nProtoplanet: $3\nThank you for your contribution to the galaxy.

What can you do with them? Excellent question! The answer is\u2026anything!\nLet me explain further. Every physical card looks exactly the same as the other. The secret is the unique number which is recognized by our app on every single card, so virtually \u2013 they are totally different. How different? It\u2019s up to you!\nSumatokado enables you to create your own card games or even to use our build-in games (even as part as your own games). So, how does it actually work? Another great question!\nFirst of all, you need to install our Sumatokado app, and get some of our smart cards.\nEvery card is scannable via NFC or QR code, depending on the support of your device. You (the player) have 2 choices \u2013 play an existing game or create a new custom game.\nIn order to play an existing game \u2013 choose the game, read its instructions and you are ready to go! For example, we created a mini game called \u201cLeader War\u201d. You shuffle the cards and every player picks a card. Then, using a smartphone or any compatible device, everyone scans their card to revel whether they won or not.\nIf you want to create a new card game \u2013 scan the cards you want to be part of your game (as many cards you as want!), insert a picture and a sentence and choose the purpose of the card.\nTheoretically, you will be able to create an endless number of card games, share them and purchase pre-made games. With your support, we will be able to push this project even further!\nHi, it\u2019s Ben \u2013 one of the game designers. When I was a child, I loved to collect playing cards (who didn\u2019t?). I loved it so much, that I\u2019ve spent thousands of dollars on almost every playing card packs I have seen on stores.\nNow, when I\u2019m 27 years old, I started to miss that feeling of physical gaming cards and their fun and diversity. That is why I decided to create a hybrid card game concept, which combines the need for the devices we use every day, and quality physical gaming cards.\nAt that moment, I and my friends understood the amazing potential of this card game concept \u2013 using a 1 pack of cards for any game we want to play!\nWe started working on this game, and while the game is not yet finished \u2013 you can see here our progress and huge potential of it.\nIn order to it to succeed, we need the support of each and every one of you! So, please back this project if you think it is the next big thing and in return we will send you the game, so you will be the first to experience the change!\nThank you for your support,\nThe Sumatokado team!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe initial game is ready.

This unique cartoon project brings an opportunity for development and global distribution of the first Arab/Expat family values-oriented cartoon. \nAstonishingly, only few creative groups have stepped up to fill this huge gap in creative media business potential so we are asking the help of our awesome supporters and pledging community to donate as much as they can to make Ready Rashid go live on the big screen. \nThe Ready Rashid Cast\nReady Rashid:\nFrom concept design in 2012, through first-phase content development in 2013, OutFront Films has positioned the Ready Rashid project to be a unifying, creative force and something everlasting which will serve new generations for years to come.\nWe crossed oceans of creativity, explored many collaborations with various insiders to bring only the best out of \u201cReady\u201d and his unique ways.\nSince our team is in love with comic art in general; the idea of bringing new age humor that challenges the limits of today\u2019s society with unique concepts and character relations is something that is meaningful in life to us.\nUpraised irony, insight into modern family life, Islamic/Western values, new worldly perspectives and so much more are the cornerstones of a cartoon designed to achieve international distribution and deserved acclaim.\nReady and Bobby \"The Weatherman\"\nWhat is Ready Rashid?\nReady Rashid is a cartoon comic based on an orphaned Arab boy who is adapting to life within the cosmopolitan environment of a modern Middle East city.\nReady's story begins on location in the streets of his battle stricken nation with an international news reporter who was curious about Ready's life story and the tragic loss of his family.\nCoincidentally, one of the viewers was a commercial pilot and father of a very stable Arab family.\nThis father was so overwhelmed by the touching story of the young man\u2019s loss of his original family; that, he and his wife who is also a much respected pediatrician in the community searched for a way to legally embraced Ready into their family.\nSupported by new friendships and a stable family, Ready is making his way into a big world with determination and natural guidance.\nA world of opportunity unfolds in front of him \u2013 new challenges are on the horizon but this time, he has all what matters the most by his side!\nWinter in Dubai\nAbout Characters:\nThe Ready Rashid family characters portray a mix of traditional Arab/Expat values and roles interwoven circumstances that could easily be experienced by families across the world.\nThis character set provides a unique story-line hook: they portray the close-knit nature of the Arab family through four generations (child, young adult, parent, and grandparent).\nWhile the focus of Ready's family dynamics are both built on a strong foundation of Arab culture and values, the story-lines will always be presented in a lighthearted, welcoming perspective, designed to endear to all cultures and religions.\nImpact and Our Mission:  \nThe Ready Rashid cartoon media offers the potential for placement of the Arabic and English languages side-by-side.\nThere is yet another hook engaged: the characters are traditional in their Arab Muslim orientation, yet they are placed in circumstances familiar to families around the world. Several languages; several cultures\u2014one cartoon media: Ready Rashid, family and friends!\nWe believe the Ready Rashid project has a unique opportunity to address cultural and racial barriers\u2014 how? Just by not addressing them.\nExtended Characters provide the opportunity for story lines that integrate four cultures (Arab, American, British, and Asian) into the setting of young people experiencing life as lifelong friends.\nOutFront Films has also developed the Ready Rashid cartoon for immediate adaptation into social media. Along with a Website and Facebook page, a keen area of opportunity is the development of mobile device \u2018apps\u2019 featuring Ready and his young friends.\nThe Website, Facebook page, and Mobile Apps provide a safe and productive online internet space for all children to enjoy!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/readyrashid\nhttps://www.twitter.com/readyrashid1\nhttps://www.instagram.com/readyrashid\nEshika, Bobby, Ready and Max\nWhat We Need & What You Get:  \nThe OutFront strategy is to align with a major animation production firm as a first step toward development and distribution. This alignment serves two purposes:\n- To enable the physical production of animation.\n- Access the media firm\u2019s natural connections to visual media outlets.  \nTo accomplish this first goal, we are seeking funding from the crowd fund community, our long term supporters, friends, family, and fans in the amount of $250,000. This amount will help us take the \u201cReady Rashid\u201d cartoon media and convert it into a spectacular movie that appeals to both children and their parents. Most important of all, this movie is bypassing or to better express; it goes beyond religion, politics, culture, classes and breaks all barriers emphasizing only one notion: we are all the same!\nOutFront Films, LLC\nTHE TEAM\nOutFront Films is the NYC-based LLC that dreamed up and developed the Ready Rashid creative concept and cartoon media.

With your help this mission can be a success, so I hope you are looking forward to this comic like I am!\nDestiny Mitsu Jean a.k.a Spirit\n                \" Story Information\"\nOn the surface, Destiny Mitsu Jean is a typical troublesome 16-year-old teenager who attends Bottom Creek Senior High. She is a lonesome, eccentric, ill-tempered, competitive, compassionate, and sarcastic individual. She is often judged as a disobedient hoodlum by many of the adults and the teachers in her community. She can come across as very anti-social when it comes to the general public.  All of these traits stem from a history of abuse at the hands of a former caregiver.\nWhen Davine, Destiny's mother who was also a Navy Seal Officer, discovered that Destiny had been abused by her caregivers, she attacked the couple, very nearly killing them.  Afterward, Davine decided that Destiny needed to learn to protect herself and began to train her at a very young age.  Since Davine was often deployed or away on assignment, Destiny's grandparents stepped in to care for her.  Her grandfather was a skilled Taekwondo, Aikido, and a Wing Chun Sensei. He took Destiny as his pupil. Destiny's grandmother was secretly a sorceress paid for hire for everything from resurrection to simple love potions.  When she found out about Destiny being abused, she sent a spell to the perpetrators, who finally did meet their demise. She eventually erased Destiny's memories and cast a spell to purify the child's mind, body, and soul.\nDestiny is currently a skilled martial artist who has mastered ten different forms.  This accomplishment is not only due to her early and continuous training, but also  because of a serum that was injected into her blood stream as a child.  The serum, which she is unaware of having, enhances both her agility and endurance.  Destiny has a strained relationship with her mother who she sees as forcing her to constantly train for no reason (since she has no memory of the abuse). \nDestiny only socializes with two other teenagers who she grew up with: Rachel Terracina and Erik Wright.  Rachel used to bully Destiny during her elementary school years, but now she is her best friend.  She is a cheerleader at Bottom Creek High and is known to be the jokester and a fun loving daredevil. Erik is the British playboy who has a crush on Destiny, of which she is oblivious.  \nIn Destiny's world, martial law has been imposed in order to see how it will affect society.\nDestiny Mitsu Jean a.k.a Spirit\nRachel Terracina\nBrian Walker\nBrian Walker\nBrian Walker is a former Major Navy Seal Operative who was dishonorably discharged for his unethical behavior. Walker and Davine Kenta Jean met during basic training and developed a romantic relationship that culminated in their marriage. They eventually divorced not long after becoming parents to Destiny. Walker has not seen his daughter since she was barely 1-year-old, but he has kept track of her from afar. He is currently the most wanted terrorist, yet he remains uncatchable. He is a psychotic and manipulative individual. He is a master at martial arts, hand to hand combat, swordsmanship, and marksmanship. The question is what does he want with Spirit?\nDavine Kenta Jean\nDanielle Clark Jean\n What and who is Danielle Clark Jean? She is the grandmother of Destiny Jean, who happens to also be a voodoo witch doctor who uses her abilities to earn a living. She is able to create zombies and control her creations either vocally or telepathically. Her primary powers involve mind control, resurrection, and the use of potions. She is a very powerful witch doctor. More detailed artwork will be available soon.\nErik Wright\nErik Wright moved to the United States from England when he was 7-years-old. He met Destiny at the age of 8 when his mother introduced the two. Erik automatically developed a crush on the eccentric little girl. His father is a computer engineer who works for a software company. His mother is a mechanical engineer who works alongside Davine Jean. He is the star shooting guard for their high school basketball team. He is currently a mechanical engineering intern at Lucid Miami Laboratory. This cutie is a common flirt/playboy known for having all the ladies. He often flirts with Destiny, but she is too oblivious to realize it.\n                        \" Collaborators\"\nTerry Alec\nTerry Alec Comic\nTerry Alec Illustration Work\nTerry Alec is the original artist responsible for my main character Destiny Mitsu Jean (\"Spirit\").

My pen name is Zen Thai. There's nothing I like more than chilling out and hanging out with my friends and family. My friends enjoy my happy-go-lucky lifestyle and attitude. They wonder how I'm able to keep that child-like energy even as I grow older. For years I've kept it a secret - but no more! \nIt's simple - I vent daily. I don't let feelings of anger, hatred, sadness, jealousy, disgust, and whatever else fester inside. I let them go by singing loudly, dancing obnoxiously, and just generally not giving a bleep. I do this so that I could get back to chilling. \nIt seems to me that people just aren't letting go of these hurtful and painful feelings often enough- are you one of these people? Maybe you don't know how or maybe you've been taught to deal with these feelings in calmer ways, but sometimes all it takes is to scream at the top of your lungs! \nThis is all I hope to do with this book. I want YOU to use it to let go of whatever it is that's bothering you. Don't let crap loiter around! Flush it down the toilet! \nThis book contains pages upon pages of satisfying destruction. There is much fun to be had! I can't show you the really fun stuff because well... profanity (don't worry, there's a clean version if you'd like that instead). But here's an example:\nIt also contains common situations that just piss the sheet out of me. I'm sure you can relate - like this: \nNote: This book contains profanity because you know... real anger involves throwing around such words! I'm sure you can relate. When you pledge, please let me know if you'd like the clean version. :)\nBut this book isn't just about destruction (most of it is), it's also about celebrating accomplishments and remembering all the wonderful things in life - like this: \nMy friend, you deserve to live a stress-free and happy life. Let this book help you!\nRewards\nThe ultimate reward is feeling awesome after destroying the pages within this book, but there's more!\nFor the ENRAGED level, your name will be embellished to be awesome as shown below. I will come up with sweet title for you or you can provide me one yourself. This page will be found at the end of the book so you may live on forever! \nFor the LIVID FURIOUSITY level (yeah that's not a real word, but that's how angry I can get to create words like that), you get your name embellished with awesomeness AND the insignia of an IMMORTAL like this:\nOn top of that, I will get with you and give you YOUR OWN PAGE in the book where you can tell your story or pet peeves or whatever it is that make you RAGE! You will be IMMORTALIZED forever! See example below: \nFor the EPIC RAGE level, you get everything plus a t-shirt AND a video of me acting a fool! Woot woot, right?\nWhat's the progress of this book?\nI'm glad I asked. It's basically done pending how many pledges come in for the LIVID FURIOUSLY pledge, but I will communicate with those pledging at this level quickly to get the book out to you as soon as possible!\nLET'S HAVE SOME FUN!\nWhile you're waiting for this campaign to end, let's have some fun! Whatever level you're pledging, I will send you a page you can print out and tear apart. It would be totally awesome if you created a video of it and upload it to whatever service you like (youtube, etc) and I will link it here so we can all enjoy the destruction together. Use your creativity. Let's see what you can come up with to destroy a piece of paper.

Depending on what you are applying for, a poor comment or remark from a reference can greatly reflect on the individual, and on their ability to hold a job, or to make payments on a loan.\nReference Me Please\nReference me please the mobile app, allows you to request and store references on your smartphone. Whatever you need a reference for; Reference Me Please will have it.\nSimply request a reference from a previous employer, credit agency or landlord and store it on your Smartphone ready for the next request.\nReferences are valuable! They give potential employers an idea of what they\u2019re getting into by hiring you with a glimpse into your work ethic and habits.\nReference Me Please \u2013 For Candidates\nMake sure you get hired!\nAs a candidate, whether it is a job you are applying for or a mortgage for a home, references are an indicator as to how you acted in previous situations.\nIf you put down a former landlord as a reference on an application for a new home or a rental application, you have to make sure they are going to say good things.\nFrom paying the rent on time, to being a quiet individual that did not cause any troubles, these positive remarks are going to greatly impact the potential of you getting the apartment or loan, or possibly losing out on it.\nReference Me Please \u2013 for recruiters\nThe importance of reference checks for employers/lenders\nIt is important to check references as an employer.\nFor example, if it is a government position, you have to know the individual applying is not a convicted felon, or doesn\u2019t have a prior record.\nIf an individual is applying for a mortgage, as a lender, you want to know they make payments on time, have a good credit score, and are a reliable borrower. \nThe importance of reference checks is that the references you contact, about different scenarios, can give you a great indication about the person you are interviewing or considering for a loan, and the references can help you determine if they are the best candidate or not.\nReference Me Please Wallet\nThe Reference Me please app has an added feature \u2013 the Reference me Please Wallet. \nA digital safe, allowing you to store all of your important documents including wills, contracts, tenancy agreements, tax forms, birth certificates and social security information.\nAll of the important documents you need for life, available at the press of a button, so you always have whatever document you need for any situation.\nHow it works\nReference me Please is a mobile application that stores all of your reference details.\nReference Me Please has six different reference categories:\nPersonal/Character Reference: Court cases, volunteering\nBusiness Reference: Business loans, Business networking, and professional services.\nEmployment Reference: Job employment, and Job advancement.\nAcademic Reference: Private school, College admissions, and graduate school.\nCredit Reference: Buying a house, car, loan, employment, business\nRenter Reference: To rent a condo, apartment, townhouse, and office space.\nNow with the Reference Me Please app you can send any creditor a credit reference invitation through the Reference Me Please app, and store it in a file on the app.\nThe app has a notification system that will notify the sender once the recipient receives the reference invitation.\nThe Renters Reference allows for quick references supplied to a prospective landlord. Simply request a reference from your previous landlord, store it on your app, and send it on quickly to the new landlord.\nThe Reference Me Please! app makes it quick, easy, and convenient to ask, send, receive, and save your references in one place.\nWhy Reference Me Please\nReference Me Please is extremely beneficial providing accurate information in a timely manner and storing it in a digital format, allowing for a paperless operation, easy to access and really simple to use.\nThis app makes sure that you are always prepared, with whatever you\u2019re doing whether buying a house, applying to graduate school, or going after your dream job.\nWith Reference Me Please, keep your network at your fingertips.\nHow Reference Me Please Improves your references\nWith Reference Me Please, you can select whom to get your reference from, and vet it in advance of sending it on. It\u2019s always good to know what kind of reference you\u2019re going to get.\nReference Me also provides an opportunity for you to contact referees that wouldn\u2019t usually provide a written reference, such as a creditor you cleared your debt with.\nSo stay in control of your history with Reference Me Please!\nIt\u2019s really that simple.\nHow Reference Me Please! Helps your business\nIf you\u2019re running a small business or are an independent landlord, Reference Me Please provides a cost effective, and efficient alternative to reference agencies.\nAs a small business owner you often have to hire temporary staff, or as a landlord rent to lots of tenants over a short period of time. The costs of using an agency can be prohibitive to conducting proper checks. However by using Reference Me Please, you stay in control of your business, keep costs down and get the information you need to proceed.\nThe Team\nReference Me Please is the brainchild of Maxine Robinson, a small business owner who was confronted with the challenge of hiring casual staff on a regular basis and wanted an efficient cost effective way to stay on top of her reference checking system.\nMaxine Robinson, Founder and creator of the Reference Me Please! app\nAfter months of brainstorming and conversations with fellow business owners Maxine came up with Reference Me Please, and the rest as they say is history.\nRushil Sablania is the software developer and has extensive experience in the field of mobile app development.\nPhotos by:Lalu Patel.\nThe Concept\nThe concept is simply to innovate how references are checked, given and stored.\nWe all live in a digital world and where possible we should use technology to support our most tedious of tasks.\nBy using the Reference Me Please app, we can reduce the time it takes to send and receive a reference, cut down on administration costs, and completely cut out the middleman. Not to mention the storage facility and always having the right information at your fingertips no matter the situation.\nWhere are we so far?\nThe app has been designed and the team are all in place to develop the app and bring it to life.\nThe reason for this campaign is to raise the funds needed to develop the app, create the website and market Reference Me Please.\nMaxine has a team in place poised to spring into action as soon as the funds are secured.\nOur Goal\nThe goal is to raise $25,000 to make Reference Me Please! happen.\nReference Me Please! is a unique product in that it applies to all people living in today\u2019s modern society.\nWhether you run a business, are trying to purchase a car, go to college or rent an apartment, Reference Me Please is essential for everyone\u2019s life.\nWe know that by developing this app and making it available on the Android and iOS platform we will save people a lot of time, trouble and heartache.\nOur stretch goals are:\n$30,000 \u2013 develop the Reference Me Wallet added feature to the app\n$40,000 \u2013 develop the app for the iOS platform\n$50,000 \u2013 Launch party to promote, celebrate and launch the Reference Me Please app in style \u2013 check out the perks to get invited!\nSo please support this campaign and make Reference Me Please a reality.\nHow Can You Support Us?\nReference Me Please! is ready to go live.

However, the practicality of the process of making them is what keeps then from mainstream use.  Most molds are either expensive, time consuming, or both. \nOur Patent Pending design may be the first to solve all of these problems. By shifting the dimension in one direction and connecting the cavities together, many more ice balls can be made a lot faster. \nBilliard Baller. Makes Eight Billiard Ball sized Ice Balls. 10\" x 6\"\n Stacking the mold cavities vertically allows you to fill them all at once instead of one at a time, and the two sides of the mold, oriented vertically, are designed to simply seal and snap apart in one motion which allows them to be opened and closed easily. Through this process we've been able to make more ice balls at a time, and do something else that no other spherical mold can do. We can make them in LARGE quantities!\nWith the vertical stack design, any size ice ball can be made more efficiently, in less time. They also make, in general, a rounder, more quality sphere shaped ball than most competitors we've tested. \nComparison:\nUnnamed Competitior, left, vs Hailstonez Billiard Spheres\nSpheres on left were made one at a time with two separate molds. It took four days to make eight Balls.  The Hailstones were made in one day, with one mold. The competitors can make some very round balls as well, but not as consistently.\nThe Product\n  The Hailstonez Billiard Baller. \nThe most popular Spherical ice is the \"Whiskey Ball\", for connoisseurs that like their liquor cold and undiluted. Usually only one Ice ball is necessary, and they last a long time. This one makes eight at a time. The most any other competitor can make can make that we've seen is four. Most molds make one at a time, and because they are predominantly made from silicone, the Ice Balls tend to be irregularly shaped.\nWhiskey With single Hailstone\n They are offered at very few establishments because they are still costly and time consuming to make. That is one of the things that we are hoping to change.\nThe Design\n We have gone through many iterations of the design in order to work out the flaws.  \nThe first few were not of uniform thickness which via the injection molding process would create bends and divots in the shape due to uneven cooling of the plastic. The tooling of the Aluminum mold would have required two cavities in order to make both sides of the Ice mold.\nMale snapping parts on one side. Female on the other\nKeep in mind that the above design is for a much smaller Ice Ball. The concept is the same however. Through the design process we eventually figured out how to make a universal part that has both male and female connectors. In other words, both sides of the mold are now COMPLETELY IDENTICAL. This universal part can now snap into another identical part. \nUniversal part. Male on one side, Female on other\nWhen your injection mold has to be tooled out of SOLID ALUMINUM, this is a huge advance and has reduced the tooling cost by almost a half. This is what they look like when fit together:\nMale snap faces forward on left, and backward on right\nLikewise, We have evened out the thickness of the design as uniform as necessary so that it cools evenly in the injection molding process and produces a perfect part every time.\nMold with Heartsink Lid\nThe mold is sealed with a sealing grove around the edge that prevents water from escaping while it is standing up. In the groove is a Flexible FDA compliant silicone O ring cord that is designed to account for any expansion due to the ice freezing. \nNote. This is not the seal the final product will have. The final seal will be universal as well.\nThe seal is the most important part of the mold and the part I am most proud of.  The newest versions of the mold are built around the seal and not the other way around.\nThis Mold will be constructed as well from a BPA Free Polypropylene. It has been Chosen for its FDA compliance, water resistance, stiffness and flexibility, and it's resistance to the cold. \nDiscoveries Since Prototyping\nSince the testing of the prototypes , I have found three ways to improve the molds:\nFirst, the mold was hard to open because it had too many snapping parts. I have figured out a way to make it with two snaps instead of four. This not only makes for a simpler design, but makes it much easier to open. There are less parts to break as well.\nSecond, the prototype itself had a tendency to bow in the middle, making it leak over time.  I realized that it needed to be able to seal on the bottom as well, so I have added a tongue and groove mechanism on the bottom that will give a nice even pressure seal along the long axis of the mold. As you can see it is also designed to be universal. \nTongue on one side, Groove on the other (Photorealistic render)\n When they fit together, it makes mold much more stable, as shown from the bottom in this photorealistic render:\nThe red tongue is on the left, facing down and the yellow tongue is on the right facing up.\nWe've found that this works very well as I have tested it in the design of the Billiard Baller prototype.\n I have also learned that they must be made a little larger, as they are a little flimsy in the prototype. \nThird,  The trough needed to be deeper to capture more water. Most people will want to fill the mold from a refrigerator water dispenser, which means that it will likely be held directly over the floor. So I have deepened the trough to make sure that it catches all of the water.\nThis is the New Look of the Billiard Baller:\nPhotorealistic Render\nIt now has ribs to prevent water from seeping between the cavities. It also has a much stronger tongue and groove on the bottom:\n And lastly, the trough is deeper and steeper on the edges to capture more water:\nWhat is the Money For?\nThe money that I am asking for is for five things.  The prototyping of the of the new model, the construction of the injection mold for mass production, the Initial orders, shipping packaging and any unforeseen expenses. \nPrototyping 5%\n3D printing is very fast these days, usually you can have a prototype printed and shipped within two days. The prototype above must be tested. Given the functionality of the device has been proven, the testing is to find if any more improvements can be made. Preparing for all eventualities, I have allocated enough to have two prototypes 3D printed if necessary. If a second must be 3D printed, It would take one more week. Then I will order the Injection Molds built.\nAluminum Thermoplastic Injection Molds 65%\nIf they pass the testing as expected, then the Injection mold will be ordered which takes about two weeks. The construction of the injection mold is the most costly part of the process. One will have to be built for the Universal part and one to produce the gasket seal. 65% of the funds will go to the construction of the molds. The first samples are sent after the mold is complete and tested. Any modifications (if any) will be made at that point. Modifications won't cost money, just take time. IF the mold needs to be modified, then it might add about three weeks to the date of the initial orders.\nInitial Orders 15%\nThe first batch can be ordered the minute the samples are approved. Delivery usually takes about two weeks and then assembly can begin\nPackaging 10%\nThe packaging chosen for the product will be a see through plastic with graphics printed on them. Plastic was chosen because it will arrive with the graphics already on them. You will be able to see the product clearly and inspect it for defects right through the box. It is also more cost effective than a lot of cardboard packaging that I've found.\nNow Designing Graphics for cover\nTimeframe:\n You can see some overlap in the stages of development, this is to illustrate the variability in time that it might take for each stage.\nAdditional Projects\nThose of you who have seen my other project know that I have two other models that I would like to produce.  Should this project fund more than I'm asking for, then the additional funds will go to the production of two other molds: \n1. The Marble Baller (as seen above)\n This one I'm most proud of because it demonstrates the efficiency and quantity that these Ice Balls can be made. It's also the most versatile, because these little marbles can fit in any glass and can be used for any drink. It makes Ninety-six at a time.\n And \n2. The Pong Baller.\nMakes Ping-Pong ball sized Ice Balls\nThis one is more practical for mixed drinks and zombie glasses because the balls are medium sized and you only need a few.  Most molds that make ice balls this size make about four at a time. We've found a way to make twenty-four. They are also nice because there is No Way that one will end up in your mouth!\n  All have their respective best uses for mixology and style. For Restaurants that have Exclusive specialty drinks, It can now be more practical to offer them with Ice balls than before. Top shelf drinks can be enhanced as well, by offering them with Spherical Ice.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are very confident that we have worked out the major issues with the production of the product. However there are a few contingencies that it is prudent to prepare for.\n\n1. There is a possibility that the actual injection molds will have to be retooled. While the retooling process will be relatively cheap , the time lost will be significant. We have prepared for that inevitability by setting our delivery date by July. If the mold needs to be modified, then it should be repaired and ready to be delivered within this time frame. Of course the possibility exists that it will take longer. We will of course make sure to keep everyone involved up to date with the progress so that there are no surprises.\n\n2. The prototype works as expected, but the actual product will be made with a stiffer more consumption friendly plastic. It may behave in a different manner. This is not likely as the material itself was chosen for its density, stiffness and cold resistance, but as with all things untested, it may have some surprises. Most issues can be solved by retooling, or in a drastic case, modifying the injection molds for another material which would take time. The only way it would be expensive is if a completely new mold has to be tooled, which we have prepared for as in step 1.\n\n3. As confident as we are about the material, we have to prepare for the possibility as well that the material might affect the flavor of the ice as some other ice cube trays have. Again not likely, but it would require a retooling of the injection mold for a different material, the same solution as the two aforementioned. \n\nAside from the Three risks mentioned above there are always logistical issues that may arise involving shipping, packaging etc. These are mostly time issues so the worst problem is not delivering on time. Again we are preparing for this contingency by setting our date to account for that.\n\nWe will pledge to be as honest and transparent as possible and to keep every one of our backers as informed as possible.

The fact that the ice expands as it moves inward makes for a pressure buildup inside the ball as well.  What you end up with is an Ice ball that has an irregular buildup of pressure inside it that makes it imperfect and cloudy. The result is mostly cosmetic, but the irregular pressure inside the ball also makes it prone to cracking."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Please Check out some projects that we're backing:", "update_content": "The Pakroller:\nA mail Delivery mothod the will save time and $$$ shipping the delicate items that you need delivered"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "50% Goal Party!", "update_content": "To all of my Pledges:\nWhen this project reaches 50%, I am cordially inviting all of my backers to celebrate at the place where we filmed our video.

My passion has always been to help outside-the-box learners get Wings to Soar. Over the past 16 years working with struggling learners, I've researched and developed many ideas to help dyslexics. This Kickstarter includes publishing my Help and Hope for Dyslexics book and video course. It also includes publishing Wings to Soar Foundations: Integrated, Multisensory Language Arts with Words You Really Use which includes readers, handwriting, commonly confused words practice, card games, bingos, game boards, word cards, sentence templates, and practice online. I also want to expand the programs Wings to Soar Online Academy can include in our customized Dyslexia Intervention Packages. \nFor those who would prefer a video overview of the elements included in this Kickstarter, I have provided this 2 1/2 minute video. Or peruse the images and text below.\nPLAY\n\nI have compiled my 16 years' experience working with dyslexics, including my own extensive research, into a set of informational resources. These include a 2 1/2 hour online self-paced course in Udemy and paperback and e-book versions of the same overview of dyslexic strengths and challenges, as well as options for accommodation and remediation. These resources are targeted to parents, teachers, and tutors who are trying to help dyslexics gain the confidence and skills needed to thrive in school and in life. \nThis 5 minute video provides an overview of the material contained in the Help and Hope for Dyslexics book and 2 1/2 hour video course.\nPLAY\n\nWings to Soar Online Academy currently serves 98 students with over 70% having learning challenges. This Kickstarter will allow us to expand our Dyslexia Intervention Packages. We will have even more quality programs that provided targeted remediation for weak dyslexic skills. These Dyslexia Intervention Packages come with coaching support and any of the resources from our Wings to Soar Foundations program (described below) that are appropriate, in addition to 3-5 online intervention programs with personalized learning paths in each to help dyslexic students gain the confidence and skills needed to succeed in school and in life.\nSince shortly after taking my basic Orton-Gillingham class, back in 2000, I have been creating resources to help dyslexics and early readers. To engage my students, I came up with 75 multisensory ways to do the core reading and spelling practice needed. In addition, Dad and I created many board, card, and bingo games, word sorts, scavenger hunts, and readers. This helped to make the basic and fairly boring Orton-Gillingham practice more fun. \nI also wanted to make sure the words and spelling patterns I was having my students practice were actually useful words. So, my husband wrote me a computer program to analyze the dictionary, so I could figure out how many words actually use each phonetic pattern. I also have spent countless hours analyzing word frequency lists to make sure the words I'm including in my materials are \"words you really use.\" Out of this, I have developed Wings to Soar Integrated, Multisensory Language Arts with Words You Really Use. \nFor this Kickstarter, I want to get all of the resources Dad and I already have in various stages of development for the Foundations level into a marketable product suite. We have handwriting practice pages, readers, word cards, game boards, bingos, and commonly confused words practice worksheets created. Preliminary lists for the next two levels are in use by some of our students in Vocabulary and Spelling City. I also want to expand the already fairly extensive set of resources we have created for the Kindergarten level. \nYou can well imagine that there are many costs associated with a project of this scope. Here's my budget breakdown:\nOur blog and social media pages help to disseminate current information available about helping dyslexics. You can help this Kickstarter and stay informed with what I am finding about dyslexia by liking Wings to Soar Online Academy on Facebook, joining my LinkedIn network, and following Beth Ellen Nash on Twitter and Pinterest. If you like what you see, please like, comment, and share it as it will help spread the word.\nPlease support our Kickstarter to help provide Help and Hope for Dyslexics and their families.

We use the finest merino wools, silks, cashmere, denim & organic cottons; and our timeless styles have been designed to last for many years with frequent use.\nTo keep our brand unique, only a limited release of our Outfits for pre-sale/pre-order will be made available per month, once this quota is subscribed to, production will commence & upon completion and extensive quality control, your purchase will then be delivered to you beautifully packed in one of our boxes.\nEach & every month we aspire to provide the perfect outfit, the one that you confidently select, something representative of what is shown in magazine spreads, yet logistically & economically obtainable.\nWe compliment this Outfit with the addition of some extra on trend items (EXTRAS) and wardrobe staples (BASICS), including jeans that fit perfectly & luxe knitwear, styles that will extend the wearability & diversify the outfit.\nA modest pricing structure is of high consequence to us at The Design Republik, yet this is in no way the result of any sacrifice to our quality. Our men\u2019s & women\u2019s collections are crafted with love and intention; using only the best materials, our garments are impeccable & inherently luxurious.\nIn most circumstances the price of our entire Outfit actually equates to far less than the retail price of just a coat alone found in any known middle market high street or department store.\nYou may ask how we can facilitate this, well such is a result of us learning solid methods over the many years that we have been working in the fashion industry, we have spent the last 12 months perfecting superior execution and building the efficient logistical structure that allows us to make this a reality & in turn offer our collection at a true cost, one that is not inflated with multiple margin requirements.\nWe undertake our manufacture in factories that are also utilised by top fashion houses. We have a sound ethical & environmental code of conduct & ensure that from sourcing our raw materials to dispatching our end products that social responsibility is paramount.\nWe are aware of our roll to our staff, our manufactures & their staff, society & environmental protection & we see to offset any carbon foot print we make by donating to environment charities. We also have a foundation called Inch by Inch Against Poverty (TM) through which we donate a percentage of the proceeds from our bags. Currently we support small business in developing nations involved in the apparel industry through Kiva & we are working with our denim factory to help provide community teachers who devote themselves to the rural elementary education for village children living in remote areas.\nOur clothes are designed with love & made with conscience. If you support our sentiment, please support us.\nxo xo\nwww.thedesignrepublik.com\nOUR AIM:\nWith a $25,000 pledge from the Kickstarter Community we will produce the production run of The Design Republik Outfit & provide to you our kind supporters impeccably made garments made with love & intention...\nThis amount will facilitate additionally an increase in our marketing & social media promotional activities to assist further with our growth. \nWe hope to also offer some stretch goals along the way which we hope will include a sneak peak at our Outfit #2 & #3.\nOUR TIMELINE:\n  OUR PROCESS:\nOUR CAMPAIGN:\n\nFILM:\n\nPLAY\n\n\nCAMPAIGN:\n\nOUR SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFollow Us:\n\nInstagram: @thedesignrepublik\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedesignrepublik\nTwitter: @_designrepublik\n\nOUR SIZING:\nThe chart below links to our sizing charts on our website:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are seasoned professionals at this game & there is very little that will beat us, albeit stages of the process we are indeed reliant upon others for, however with scrupulous management we foresee no issues with both undertaking & completing this project.\n\nPRODUCTION & DELIVERY:\n\nProduction space has been reserved to commence by the 30th April.

When a regular teacher finds a group of bears, who could talk and walk, she tries to uncover their magical secret!\nOur children's imagination is key to many areas of fundamental and sound growth during the formative periods of development. That is why I have created and designed a show that will not only capture all of the child's attention and hold it, but hold it with creative, exciting, and colorful adventure, while educating at the same time. TV has proven that it indeed can be a good tool for the aiding of teaching positive and lasting characteristic straits needed for the adult life. \nAdditionally, we have seen in many cultures, a confirmed evidence that what continually surrounds a child during those crucial and important growing years has a profound impact on 'what' that adult carries into many areas of his/her's life.\nThus, was, and continues to be my desire to be a part of shaping the heart, mind, and character of tomorrow's child. If you see what I am seeing in today's youth, there is a crying in your spirit for the decline of innocence, simple manners, poor language, education, and respect for family and self. Join with me in being a part of a solution. Please support Korry' Bears Storz Lane.\nEvery week, (repetition) the show will release a new episode that will teach children about integrity, self-worth, responsibility, accountability, honor and respect. Plus, it'll all feel like fun to them.\nMY STORY\nWhy did I choose to do a show for children for my very first TV pilot? Most importantly; children are our future, and I don't know about many of you, but when I look around, and what's before me in youth, I grow increasing worry of what the future may present if there isn't a change, and I mean a drastic change in parenting. Have you ever wondered why the percentage of home-schooling have gone up? These parents do not want their child/children in \"public\" schools. If some are like me, they are witness to: \nour young boys with pants hanging down their butts exposing their underwear\nthe most foul language that turn a sailor face two-shades red\ndisrespect on all levels\ndisregard of authority\nlow to no self-respect\ngirls half-naked and exposing breast and butt checks\ntwerking\nunder-age sex\ndrug use in elementary school\n.....and the list goes on.\nI've decided to be among many who desire a change,and not  simply 'sit' and hope for a change, but MAKE a change to the best of my God-given ability. \nWHERE DO WE PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS, and GUARDIANS begin?  At home at an early, early age. And many culturals, and in many homes, the TV is the babysitter. Moms are busy cleaning hourse, and all the other things today's mom are challenged with while caring for the babies. So, where do they put the child? In front of the TV. Yes, there are many, many, many children programming today that entertain the child for hours on end. But are these show entirely focused on family structure and principles build upon the WORD of God? Not that I'm aware of. Do you know of any?\nWhat I've done (oh, by-the-way, I taught Sunday School for over twenty years to primary and elementary school children - loved it!) is take scriptures that approach challenges that today's child is facing. For episode one, David and Goliath, is the story. Why? Because around the nation, 'bullying' is destroying our future children. \nHow and What is Korry's Bears Storz Lane about and What Exactly is the Solution to the Above in the Show?\nKorry Miller is a elementary teacher who is growing frustrated and close to the point of desperation, in her difficulty capturing and holding the attention of her disruptive second and third grade students. My goodness, the little tots are pretty much running the class. \nWary and eager to get on with vacation plans, she has no idea that this vacation will be like none other she's ever experinced. HELP IS ON THE WAY IN A VERY STRANGE WAY. In Virginia's  Shenandoah Valley, Korry stumbles upon a group of five bears. But there's something strange about these bears. They are walking and talking just like her!\nStrangely, instead of being afraid, Korry feels attracted..somehow connected to the bears, after they greet her in perfect English. It isn't long before she invites them inside her cabin, and feeds and clothes them. Then, not long there after that she gives them names to match their individual characteristics. BUT, nothing could prepare her for what comes next. Korry soon finds out a the magical secret to their arrival on her property! \nMeet the Bears!\nKayleb is the oldest female bear, and has a goal to be a teacher. \nOmar is a happy toddler bear, but is a tad mischievous.  \nRebekah is the teen bear who likes to have fun without restrictions. \nRaven is one of the smartest of the  cubs.       \nYancey is the oldest and wisest bear. He is the TIME TRAVELER\n FOR THE CHILDREN'S DELIGHT, THERE'S IS THE MYSTICAL DOOR AND TWINKLING LIGHTS OF THE TIME TRAVELING TUNNEL SLIDE.\nYancey, the oldest bear holds the key to not only helping his new friend, Korry Miller, regain control of her classroom, but to a MAGIC DOOR leading to an entrance toa mystical TUNNEL SLIDE, which the children from the \"live\" audiance will, at the end of each story, enter through the Magic Door, slide down the twinkling TUNNEL SLIDE , and experience the ancient Bible story  at the end of the slide. How awesome and educational is that!   Yancey and his friends are going to teach the teacher how to teach. The secret is to keep it interesting enough to hold them captivated. Yipeeee.\nEpisode Descriptions\nEvery episode will open with the electrifying theme song Korry\u2019s Bear. \nEach of the bears (cute costumed actors) will danced their own (professionally chorographed) dance groove at their announced name. Then, as a backdrop, there will be the animated bears to make it even the more entertaining for the children.\nEpisode One - Korry meets the bears: After the intro, Korry will pick from the studio audience two children to sit with her: .Korry will read that day\u2019s Bible story.  Yancy will soon discover his mystical magical powers, and  he also discovers that he\u2019s returned with the power to build a Magical Door to take others with him to experience the awesome and inspirational, educational, and character-building stories of the scripture.\nAfter each story, and at every episode closing, the bears and children are lead by Yancey back in time to live in and through the period of that narrative. Along with the costumed actors protraying desinated roles, there will be the animated \u2018extra\u2019 cast in the foreground.\nCore curriculum Goal: Facing  the Bully\nDavid and Goliath\nShow Objective(s): The children will re-tell the story of David and Goliath- discuss that we must trust in God to help us.\nThe story appeals to nearly everyone \u2026especially children because no matter how big they grow, they may find themselves in situations where they are in a vulnerable position and someone else is in the power position\u2014whether facing a bully on the playground, or a parent,\u2014we all know what it\u2019s like to feel intimidated. When the children listen to the story, they can put themselves in David\u2019s shoes\u2014or sandals\u2014and vicariously experience victory of the weak over the strong.Before going through the Magic Door, there\u2019s Q & A time:\n\u2022Who was bigger, David or Goliath?\n\u2022How many stones did David use to kill Goliath?\n\u2022Why did David get angry with the giant?\nShow 2\nNoah\u2019s Ark - Noah Obeys God\n Show Objective(s): Noah, Animals, obedience Children will understand that it is important for us to obey God.\nBIBLE VERSE: Noah walked with God\nOmar, the toddler bear is excited about the story of Noah and the Ark because Noah took bears of the big boat! Korry is having a bit of trouble reading the story because keeping him in his seat and quiet is a task because he wants to tell the story. It\u2019s his favorite. Finally, she is able to explain to the children that Noah loved and obeyed God even when no one else would. Then, at last Omar gets his chance to shine. With Yancey\u2019s help, he heads the Q & A.\nDiscussion Questions & Answers:\nIn our story today who was following God? (Noah.)\nWhat did God tell Noah to build? (An Ark.)\nWhat is an Ark? (A boat that was very big.)\nWhy did God tell Noah to build the Ark? (God was going to cause a flood of water to cover the earth.)\nCore curriculum Goal: Building Character\nDaniel and the Lion\u2019s Den\nShow Objective(s): Children will learn: Godly character allows others to see Jesus more clearly. Character has consequences. Godly character requires discipline.\nKorry reads Daniel 6 to the bears and studio guest, and teaches that all are to live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day He visits them.In a fun way, and so that young children can understand, she teaches that God is always faithful to answer prayer for specific needs of bear and child.Yancy will aid with reciting the memory verse together. Then he will explain pagans (unbelievers, people not following Christ). At Q & A, Rebekah will ask: What is character? Allow the bears and children to respond. (A person, esp. with reference to behavior or personality)\nWhat are some character traits that people can have? (Honest, liar, lazy, hard worker, encourager, discourager, loyal, disloyal, etc.)\nCharacter traits can be positive and they can be negative.\nCharacter also has consequences. If you are honest, people will trust you. If you are lazy, you won\u2019t get good grades that come from studying. Godly character requires discipline. We must follow God every day and obey His commands to have Godly character.\nThen Yancey explains as bears and audience guest are lining up to go through the magic door.\nTHE KEY PRODUCTION TEAM\nTim Wilson, Filmmaker\nTed Geiger, Executive Director\nJanet Thomas, Director\nRev.

The total cost of this show will run in exccess of $250,000. I have a Kickstarter goal of $75,000 because it will cover one episode.\nWhile we will still need to cover expenses for film stock, the extremely high coast of animation development, and of course our filmmaker's expense,  there's still the expense of insurance,artist, costumes, and the unique designing and cost of constructing the magic door and tunnel slide.\nCUSTOM SET DESIGN IS AT THE TOP OF THE EXPENSE LIST FOR TWINKLING LIGHTS AND TUNNEL SLIDE:\n\u00b7Artist\n. 6mm film stock + processing\n\u00b7 Up keep/maintenance of camera equipment\n\u00b7 Building custom props\n. Design and build the magic door!\n.  Annimator \n. Artist \n\u00b7Costumes, makeup, and prosthetics\n\u00b72D traditionally animated FX\nWHY YOUR SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT\nOur goal of $75,000 is the minimum amount of money needed to shoot the first five TV shows. \nIf we are blessed enough to go over (we're fervently praying) the goal (with Kickstarter it's all or nothing: so we must either meet/exceed our goal, or receive nothing at all), we will put every penny into the production of more show. The Bible is full of stories, and to tell them all, this would mean more film stock, more audio tape, additional props to use in production, and the major cost that come with post-production work.\nLastly, we want to thank you in advance for taking the time out of your day to check out our project, read our words, watch our video, and perhaps pitch in some money.  We realize that everyone works hard for their money, so we will use all of it to make the best children's TV show we can.\nGOD bless you exceedingly and abundantly with all goodness in all things!\nTake a look at few samples of the great Rewards for your pledges!\n STRETCH GOALS\nWhat will I do if we go over the funding goal?  Anything over will go directly towards the remaining cost of producing the show, and the administrative expenses.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a spanking-brand new TV-Pilot is hard. And add the two-fold task of making a children's TV Pilot with a biblical theme...therein becomes the ultimate crusade.\n\nA thorough knowledge of the television industry is crucial to anyone working effectively in the area. The TV industry's vertical addition can make entry as a new-comer difficult. Recent mergers and exclusive agreements between program producers and networks have made it extremely difficult for independent producers such as myself to find distribution.\n\nSudden and unpredictable personnel changes in the television industry can make it difficult to broker relationships facilitating program production and sponsorship, especially for independent producers.\n\nAgain, projects such as Korry's Bears relying for their success on financial participation by outside organizations are at considerable risk, if this participation isn't locked in before proceeding.

The last 30 days have been incredible, and we couldn't have done it without you!\nDr. Reed is the foremost pioneer in connecting the human mind to digital systems. It was his intention to see if people could work together while dreaming, but what he discovered was an untapped source of creativity that brings dreams to life. It doesn\u2019t matter what age, gender, or race a person is--they have the potential for unimaginable ingenuity. Now you too can live your dreams by participating in Project Dreamscape.\nYour turn starts by choosing whether or not to take a facedown card, called a Z card--these Z cards are currency in the game, but also count against you when it comes time to tally up the scores. Z cards are used to purchase cards from the Dreamscape, which are then placed in your REM stack. You must choose one of the two abilities on a card to activate when you collect it, but the real fun of the game comes from chaining these abilities together.\nAny one of the eight dream abilities in Project Dreamscape, by itself, produces only a minor effect--take a card, flip a card, rearrange some cards, and so on. But with some clever card play, one dream ability can lead to another until you've collected several cards or even cleared the entire Dreamscape. This continues until there are not enough cards to fully refill the Dreamscape after a player\u2019s turn. At that point, the game is over and it's time to score.\nScoring is simple. Just lay out your faceup cards in the order they were stacked, and then find matching abilities that appear on adjacent cards (the orientation of the cards does not affect scoring, but you may wish to rotate the cards to find these chains). Wherever two or more copies of an ability are next to one another, you score points as shown on the score chart. After scoring all of your chains, subtract points equal to the amount of Z cards you have, and that\u2019s your final score.\nFor some examples of Project Dreamscape's chaining mechanics, check out Richard Ham's wonderful run-through:\nCheck out the full rules for more information, and the free print-and-play files on BoardGameGeek:\nProject Dreamscape: Rules\nProject Dreamscape: Print-and-Play files\nProject Dreamscape also has a single player variant, although it's currently only available digitally; however, we hope to include the rules in the box over the span of the campaign! You can find the rules for Virtual Dreaming on BoardGameGeek:\nProject Dreamscape: Virtual Dreaming\nInside Project Dreamscape, you'll find a sleep deck of 52 cards, two reference cards, five Z shield tokens, a full-color rulebook, a special active player marker, and an expansion deck consisting of 54 cards (three alternate dream types!). The game will come packaged in a sturdy two-piece box that measures approximately 3.5x5.5\"--about twice the width of a deck of cards, and still very pocket-sized!\n\"Small, portable, and challenging, Project Dreamscape engaged each of our players and kept them hooked. Each game provided new insight on new ways to manipulate and organize the Dream cards, mess with opponents, and create killer combos. Project Dreamscape is a game you can learn how to play in 5 minutes and take all afternoon to work out the many different ways to win. Now that\u2019s a good game.\"\nCyrus Kirby, Father Geek (full preview)\n  \"It took a couple turns to understand some of the combos and nuances, and then we were off and running! Terrific, clever game!\"\nChris Leder, Game Designer, Roll for It!\n  \"The peaceful artistic style of Project Dreamscape guides you through a quick, combo-making dream you'll want to have over and over again.\"\nBrian Henk, Overworld Games, Designer of Good Cop Bad Cop\n  \"It's a fun game that I think will only get better with more plays.\"\nJason Glover, Greygnome Games\n  \"Deceptively cute, PD is a light, yet deeply strategic card game that keeps you on your toes until the very end.\"\nChris Chu, play-tester\n  \"A nice challenge in a small package. I like that I can plan a couple of turns ahead and that my plans are never totally wiped out, but I have to continually respond to changes in the available cards.\"\nKell Brigan, play-tester\n \n\"Project Dreamscape might put on a cute, simple facade, but there is deep strategy to be found in this dream world. The ability to rearrange the dreamscape and play powers off of other players' cards is a fresh and ever-changing way to formulate your strategy. Just don't plan too far in advance, because other players' sinister arrangements can plunge your perfect plan into deep sleep!\"\nJohn Shulters, play-tester\n  Richard Ham, Rahdo Runs Through:\n Nick Meenachan, Board Game Brawl:\n  Dave Taylor, To The Table: Full disclosure: David Taylor is a guy that I believe in and I enjoy his reviews, so I really wanted him to try out Project Dreamscape; however, I do support him on Patreon, so please keep that in mind.\nJeff King, All Us Geeks: Full disclosure: Jeff King is also a good friend of ours, but as he explains in this video, that didn't even need to be considered:\nAll pledge levels from $16 and up will also include the premium Print-and-Play files, which feature the final files (including the cards, backs, box, and rules) sent to the manufacturer!\nThis very limited pledge level will get you a copy of the special edition (See the Dreamer pledge), as well as one of the original water color art pieces from Project Dreamscape\u2019s eight dream types--not a print, but the original painting. These beautiful pieces of art measure 4x6\" and will be handled by Julie herself in a stylish frame of her choice.\n\nEach of these paintings are first-backed, first served. If you back at this level, please send me a private message letting me know which painting you\u2019d like to have.\nWant to see some larger versions of the artwork? Check out our gallery on BoardGameGeek!\n If you would like to add one or more of the items below to your pledge, simply increase the dollar amount of your pledge by the price listed under each add-on. After the campaign is over, but long before shipping begins, I will send out a survey to ask you what add-ons you included in your pledge.\n$15 - Roll-Up Game Mat\nPainted by Julie Okahara, this completely optional (but totally awesome) roll-up mat depicts a field of dreamers with the cards placed over them representing their dreams. Directly below them are the Z shields from the back of the deck which depict the Z card cost for the card in that space. Above, their collective dream features the sun (the draw pile), and the moon (the discard pile). This mat measures 10x15\" and has an 1/8\" rubber backing.\n $15 - Extra Copy\nGrab additional copies of Project Dreamscape for only $15 each. A great way to save on shipping!\nAll backer rewards will ship from the US.\nProject Dreamscape will cost about $5 to ship domestically, and this is built into the cost of the game. For international shipments, there is a small extra charge to help with shipping costs:\nBase game: +$4 for international shipping\nBase game and the game mat: +$4 for international shipping\nBase game and Tower: +$8 for international shipping\nCollector's Edition: +$10 for international shipping\nCollector's Edition and artwork: +$20 for international shipping\nThese premiums are only applied once. For example, if you order two copies of Project Dreamscape, you will still only pay the $4 one time; however, while Project Dreamscape is naturally import-friendly thanks to its small size and low price point, anything more than the base game may be subject to extra fees.  \nWe will be holding a local pick up event when the games arrive, at a location in the Sacramento, CA area. The option to attend will be available when surveys go out.\nA word from Ben Haskett...\nSarah and Will organize a game designers meeting each month, where local designers can get together and play test each other's games. I was first invited to attend the meet-up about two years ago (where we became good friends), and it was at one of these meetings that I first played Project Dreamscape.\nI remember the first couple of turns very well, as I struggled a little bit to find my footing. I understood the basics; you use facedown cards to buy faceup cards, you play one of the two options on each card, you chain them together... but on my third or fourth turn, the game just clicked for me. I realized that these eight dream types, while perhaps a bit mild when played alone, could be combined for a very satisfying \"never-ending turn\" effect found in games like Dominion. By the end of the first game, I knew we had to take Project Dreamscape to the next level.\nWill and Sarah Reed\nThe two of them already had an artist in mind, Julie Okahara, who created some beautiful watercolor art for the game.  Playful and dreamy, with just a hint of uneasiness, her paintings were a perfect fit for the game's tone.  Her work typically utilizes mixed media, which is in full effect here--if you look closely at the card art, you can see that sections are cut out to reveal all sorts of glittered and textured papers.\nThe design goal with Project Dreamscape was to create a big experience in a small package--not a micro game, mind you, but simply a small game that packed a lot of compelling decisions into a 30-minutes experience.  The mechanics came first, and the theme was later integrated as Will lay awake at night tying to pair something with the game; when you're asking yourself, \"What do people want the most?\" late at night, I suppose it's easy to understand why Will settled on sleep as an appropriate theme.\nFor more insight into Sarah and Will's design process, check out their designer blog posts on Project Dreamscape:\nHow I Designed Project Dreamscape\nMechanics First\nSetting Design Goals\nIncorporating Play Styles\nUnexpected Group Think\nTiming & Number of Players\nExpanding Meaningful Choices\nModifying for Production\nIncorporating Play-Tester Feedback\nItems for the Future\nUnconventional Player Interaction\nThe Finished Look\nAll of Project Dreamscape's artwork was hand-painted by the talented Julie Okahara. For more information about her wonderful art, check out her website at www.julieokahara.com.\nTo get a closer look at the artwork that Julie painted, check out our gallery on BoardGameGeek.\nHuge thanks to all of our play-testers!\nTrey Alsup, Dave Berlin, Jessica Berlin, Kell Brigan, Chris Chu, Dominique DeMille, Olivia DeMille, Jareth Elkins, Charlie Fish, Jon Fromm, Jason Glover, Patrick Girvin, Sarah Graybill, Brian Henk, Jacob Knoester, Alexia Lara, Luis Lara, George Lavana, Chris Leder, Walter J Little V, Cody Parcell, Ben Ritter, Brian Ritter, Jon Robinson, Robert Salls, Nick Shaw, John Shulters, Roland Strebe, David Studley, Jason Taylor, Trent Twaddell, John Vang.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the second Kickstarter campaign I\u2019ve run. While my first campaign was very successful, there was still a lot to learn from the experience that I will be able to apply directly to Project Dreamscape. There may be unforeseen circumstances (my first campaign is a testament to them!), but I pride myself on being open and honest about every step of the process; even if it\u2019s bad news, I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re aware.\n\nI have two personal goals with this campaign, and the first is to deliver on time. Having been through the process now, I feel like I have a better understanding of where delays might occur, and I've taken measures to solve those issues beforehand. Further, Project Dreamscape has the benefit of being a small card game. This will greatly reduce the amount of time required by the manufacturer to produce a proof copy, and mitigate the chance for issues--in other words, Project Dreamscape will be able to begin production very soon after the close of the campaign.\n\nMy second goal is to make shipping easier for international backers--there was some behind-the-scenes confusion in my first campaign concerning how EU shipments were to be handled. Project Dreamscape will ship out to backers from the US, but to touch on the game's size once more, it's small enough that one copy of the game will easily ship from the US in a small package and almost certainly not get held for additional customs/broker fees.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture is Now Live!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Undine in 2017 \u2013 Audio Books and Board Games", "update_content": "Hello, dreamers!

How well does SLIK handle wet sand directly poured onto it? http://bit.ly/1AvYYub\nWE DID IT! OUR INITIAL GOAL HAS BEEN REACHED!\nNOW FOR SOME STRETCH GOALS!\nHarnessing the power of nature and science, I was able to create what I think are three amazing products that are 100% non-toxic and all natural. So for all those who prefer to live a greener life style, this fits well into that category. Not only are they extremely effective but they beat out well known brands that they were tested against.\nSLIK Travel Kit\n     I personally find this to be pretty hilarious, but the idea first came to me in my sleep. I woke up at around 2am one morning and thought to myself \u201cI can make my own lube!\u201d. I don\u2019t remember what I was dreaming to prompt this idea and I probably don\u2019t want to know but none the less, the idea was stuck in my mind. The lubricant I had in mind was originally for machine parts, door hinges, chains etc. Starting a conversation with my friends about this idea elicited all kind of jokes and laughter to say the least.\nI started my quest to create the ultimate lubricant using the little bit of knowledge I had about the different properties of various ingredients as well as their viscosity.After months of research and testing, I was able to create a lubricant that was not only waterproof, but surpassed the effectiveness of well-known brand names.\nSLIK had to outperform what was already on the market otherwise, what\u2019s the point right?\nSLIK has been tested in dry, hot, and cold environments; even in the humid and salty air of the island of Guam.\nHad to be water-resistant (Tests have shown that SLIK is waterproof for many weeks if not longer)  \nAble to withstand the temperature changes of different environments and still be effective (passed with flying colors)    \nHad to be rust resistant (Prevents rust from forming effectively)\nAny and all moving metal part\nBicycle Chains\nMachinery\nWaterproofing and preserving metal and wood\nWaterproof and lubricating machinery on boats\nGun parts/slides\nKnife conditioner/rust preventative\nIn the kitchen (Cleaning up grease and oil build up)\nBrake dust cleaner\nPermanent marker remover\nSo much more!\nThe initial testing consisted of applying the lubricant to high carbon steel which is highly prone to rusting and then submerging it in water. A week goes by, no rust. I take the piece of metal out to ensure that there is still lubrication on it and to my surprise, not only was the metal coated and protected, but it was still very oily. I then put the high carbon steel back into the water.Another week goes by, still no rust.\nI then decide to test the lubricant in salt water and it was able to withstand it for a couple of days before starting to rust so I went back to the drawing board. After a bit of tweaking, I created a new formula and ran the salt water test once again. After a two week trial, there were no signs of rust.\nUsing the same test criteria with other known brands, rust started to form within 20 minutes to a couple of hours while SLIK remained un-phased.\nBEFORE:\n AFTER:\n     As you can see, the lubricant worked very well. In fact, it was so effective that I could not take it off using simple soap and water. I then created a natural solvent to remove the lubricant\nThe solvent is natural and in the form of a gel. The advantage of this \u201cgel form\u201d is that it sticks to what it\u2019s applied to and does not run off.\nUsing the same dirty cotton swab, I decided to apply it on the foggy headlights of a car and wipe clean with a paper towel. It was as if I was using an eraser to clean them. No effort, it just worked.\nBEFORE: (Lighting was not very good as the sun was going down but you can see a clear difference in the after picture)\nAFTER:\nThe CLP is a combination of the lubricant and solvent put together. It works very well as an overall cleaner, lubricant, and preservative. It easily removes dirt, grime, carbon, and rust.\nTo start off, you the contributor will be able to enjoy SLIK and the many uses it can be applied to.\nSmall businesses: I have sourced all of the material here in the USA so every contribution is supporting not only this project but the many small businesses out there.\n March 2015:\nKickstarter campaign completion.

It all started when I joined the U.S. Marines to serve my country. Now there is something that seems to be common across all branches....Tattoos. They are somewhat of a must in the military and now are very main stream in today's society. This part is no big secret. The one thing that eluded me when I wanted to get my first Marine Corps tattoo was where to get it, how much is a good price, how do I know this is a reputable artist? This business has seemed to be a mystery for some time. I found that even the artists themselves find it very difficult to connect with a client base efficiently. So after some years of research and planning, Ink Badger was born. Ink Badger is patent pending software that allows clients who are looking for tattoos to upload a design and have multiple artists bid in your local area. Each artist has their own profile page and is rated by prior clients. Once an artist wins the bid, the client goes for the consult with their set price and the confidence they are getting a great price from the right tattoo artist. This also solves the problem of up and coming artist looking to break in the business to find that customer that would never be able to find them. Ink Badger will also have an app that customers can upload a tattoo they currently have for a cover up bid. All the technology is in place to get my dream off the ground. Now we just need you to help us launch!!\nWe need your help for the launch phase and the funding will be specifically used for exhibition setup for conventions throughout the US starting in Florida. The equipment needed for the setup (monitors, sound, tables, giveaways, signs, etc) will cost what we are trying to raise.Travel of course will cost extra but getting the equipment is most important.

Here's an example of a real possible scenario in a wrestling match of Ring Veteran:\nIt's your opponents turn, and he plays a Punch. What will you do? \nYour options will depend on what cards you have in your Hand that can counter his move, if any. Will you Duck? Will you grab his arm and put him in an Armbar? Or will you take the hit to conserve your counters and be better prepared for a powerful Finisher your opponent may later play that can also be countered by a Duck or an Armbar?\nThis of course, is among the simplest of possible scenarios. With hundreds of different Moves and Specials you can collect to use in your deck, there are thousands of different possible strategies and ways you can use them. You will find Ring Veteran to be satisfyingly abundant with room for creativity and personalized strategy.\nWill Ring Veteran be available on Mobile devices?\nYes! Upon release, Ring Veteran will be available on Windows, Mac, Linux and all Android and iOS devices. Check out our updates for a quick Mobile demo.\nSynamicD was founded by Pedro \"Stone\" Costa. Stone is the founder of SD Solutions, a web development company that has been in business since 2004. After years of developing websites and business management solutions, Stone set out to follow his true passion and dove into the world of game development.\nThis project was inspired by With Authority!, a game that was shut down over a decade ago but will forever be cherished by its players. The SynamicD team created a simple game with a captivating concept that developed a small but very loyal player base. With the encouragement and support of this amazing community we engaged in transforming the once simple game into an elaborate mainstream masterpiece.\nFor the past 2 years, the SynamicD team has worked tirelessly on transforming this great vision into a reality. Although being short-staffed and having scarce funding, we have successfully developed all of the core functions and many awesome features, and are set to launch the first Alpha on February 14th.\nWe have already completed about 80% of the game's development. All of our core servers, security, and backup systems are already 100% complete. Stone put everything on the line and made this project his full time job. Sharing his passion and vision, our team members have sacrificed their leisure time, neglected their day jobs and invested countless sleepless nights into getting the project this far.

Upon release, Ring Veteran will be available on Windows, Mac, Linux and on all Android and iOS devices.\nRing Veteran is a wrestling game like no other. By combining the turn based format of a Trading Card Game (TCG) with features of a Massive Online Multiplayer (MMO) and every key element of a wrestling match, Ring Veteran produces the most competitive wrestling game in the world.\nYou can create decks that consist of 1 Superstar and a combination of Momentum, Moves, and Specials. These decks can then be used inside the ring in competitive wrestling matches against opponents.\nRing Veteran is free to play. Upon registration, every user is given 4 Rookie Superstars, a starting collection, and 4 prebuilt decks. The Rookie collection is meant to help new players get comfortable with the game, and can be used to compete in Ring Veteran for game currency and prizes, but cannot be traded.\nWhen you log in to Ring Veteran, you are placed in a fully interactive 3D world where everyone is represented by a player card. You can walk around and get to know the Onyx Arena. With your help, we want to allow you to see and interact with other players around the arena and participate in mini events for in-game prizes.\nThe list of things you can do while exploring the arena consists of but isn't limited to:\nInteract with other players\nChallenge other players into a match\nTake on a Ring Veteran AI\nSpectate other ongoing matches\nWatch replays from big event matches (such as title matches)\nCreate or edit a deck\nParticipate in automated events such as Tournaments and Trivia\nLevel up your cards\nAssign abilities to your superstars\nCombine your cards to create a FOIL (shiny gold plated version)\nGamble your scrap cards for a chance to get better cards\nCollect points and rewards by completing Achievements\nOpen your boosters packs.\nBuy or Sell cards using our in-game currency in the Live Market\nPurchase Superstars, boosters and more in our game store\nFully customize your player card\nOur goal is to make Ring Veteran the type of game where you'll never run out activities. With an organized release schedule, we'll ensure that you're constantly seeing new card sets, features, and events.\n  You can expect to see our stretch goals very shortly. Down in the Features List we will separate the features that are part of a stretch goal so that you are aware of what to expect prior to backing this project.\nWe want your player card to be a personalized representation of you. You will have the ability to fully customize your avatar, backgrounds, and borders. There will be new player customization items with every set that we release.\nThough some of you may choose to be lone wolves in the Ring Veteran world, others prefer the company of others and will stick together to represent their Stables.\nStables are groups of friends who play Ring Veteran together for the added thrill of competing in Stable events, and completing achievements as a group. Stable specific events will happen periodically.\nNow that we've covered so much of what happens outside of matches, let's get into the basics of a match in Ring Veteran.\nIn a match, your Superstar can perform a vast majority of wrestling maneuvers that are represented by Moves. Different Moves require different types and amounts of Momentum to play. Each Superstar has its own limits and strengths. This breakdown provides you with a realistic, dynamic, and competitive simulation of a wrestling match.\nRing Veteran Superstars are inspired by some of the world's top wrestling talent. Each Superstar has a special ability that can affect the game in their own unique way. Their abilities can be leveled up using our innovative Card Crafting system. In addition to their own abilities, you can also assign up to 4 (depending on the superstar) activate abilities from Ability Cards which can be found in Booster Packs.\nThere are five basic Momentum cards in our First Edition\nIf you're familiar with other Trading Card Games, you can compare Momentum cards to \"Power Up\" cards. These cards are used to raise your Superstar's Momentum (not exceeding their limits), which allows them to play Moves and Specials in a Ring Veteran match.\nA Momentum card can be played as long the Superstar's ability momentum of that kind is not already at that Superstar's limit. When played, that ability's count is raised by 1, and the Superstar's total momentum and ability charge is also raised by 1.\nMoves represent real wrestling maneuvers. A Move's cost is how much Momentum in total is needed to play the move, and the ability icons are the amount of specific ability Momentum needed to play the move. Once a player's Superstar has enough Momentum to execute a Move in a match, they can play the Move card on their turn.\nWhen you play a Move, it doesn't connect until the opposing player passes the turn, but here's where it gets interesting. Certain Moves can counter other specific moves, or even whole entire move types. So the opposing player can choose to pass and let the move connect, or if he could use a playable Move in hand to counter your Move, which reverses the turn back to you.\nA Move's damage is the base damage a move does when it connects. Each Move can have extra effects that affect the match and are described on the back of the card.\nSpecials are similar to Moves in what is necessary to play them. Unlike Moves, specials of certain modifiers can stay up over the course of the whole entire match.  Each Special have their own effects that affect the match and are described on the back of the card.\nEvery Trading Card Game includes cards that are so common that you end up having an abundant amount of scrap copies. Ring Veteran's innovative Card Crafting system puts all those scrap cards to good use.\nOne of the most exciting Ring Veteran features is the Craft Machine. By putting inserting cards in certain combinations into the Craft Machine, you can get all kinds of results! Below are some of the possibilities:\n20 of the same cards - creates a foil version of that card.\nany card below level 3  - levels up that card (based on a %).\nrandom combinations - unpredictable results!\nCertain combinations require Artifact type cards to be included. These Artifacts are included in boosters.\nA basic Ring Veteran booster pack is worth .99 cents and contains 12 cards The cards are distributed in the following format:\n6 Commons\n2 Uncommons\n1 (Rare, Legend, or Loaded Veteran Superstar)\n3 Artifacts\nLoaded Veteran Superstars can only be found in boosters, and come with 3 copies of each of their Trademark cards. The percentages for the Rare+ draws are as follows:\nRare - 88%\nLegend - 11.95%\nLoaded Veteran Superstar - .05%\nArtifact cards can be used for Superstar Abilities, Crafting, and Player Customization.\nAdditionally for every booster there is a .40% chance that one of the cards will be a Foil Version (randomly chosen).\nAnother awesome aspect of Ring Veteran are Championship Belts. You can participate in weekly Championship tournaments and compete to become a Ring Veteran Champion!\nCrowned champions will be awarded a Special title belt card. These title cards are exclusive to the champion, cannot be traded, and are usable in regular matches. Title belt vary in effects, and each effect is unique to their respective Championship. Do you have what it takes to become the very first Ring Veteran World Champion?\nLive Market - You can buy and sell cards on the Live Market. Transactions here are made directly from player to player.\nCrafting System - You can use the \"machine\" to smash your cards together to get impressive looking cards, like foil/shiny style cards. You can also use this machine to upgrade your cards to higher levels or better rarity cards.\nDeck Builder - Here is where you will make and edit decks using your collection of cards that you've gathered through booster packs, prizes, achievements and the Live Market. You will select a superstar for each deck and add Momentum , Specials, and Moves.\nAchievement System - The Achievement system is a way to show off your accomplishments in the game. Completing an achievement will yield points depending on the difficulty. Once you reach a points milestone you will be eligible to claim a reward. Do you have what it takes to get them all?\nAutomated Weekly Events - Who doesn't like events? We know everyone loves them, which is why we want to make sure you guys have them in abundance. Every week there will be several scheduled events going on. So get out there and win some tournaments!\nGauntlet Tournaments - If you aren't familiar with Trading Card Games, a Gauntlet Tournament can be compared to a \"Booster Draft\". Instead of opening Boosters, you are given a random set of cards, a few Superstars to pick from, and a set time to quickly create the deck that you are going to use for the tournament. You must use this deck for the remainder of the tournament, which may vary formats.\nMobile Support - Ring Veteran will be coming to all Android and IOS devices!\nThe following features will be part of our stretch goal bonuses. We will post our stretch goals soon.\nBackstage Match - One match type that we have been eager to add is the Backstage Match. In this match type, you will be able to use the environment as well as different weapons to get an advantage to crush your opponent! What will be your favorite weapon of choice? Decide wisely!\nBackstage Area - To go along side the Backstage Match, we will be building a whole new area so you can explore it first hand without being in the match, get a feel for the area so you know what to expect when you play the Match. \nPositioning Server (For out of match player interaction) - Who doesn't want to walk around and catch up with their friends? Maybe you would come across someone you don't like, why not throw him into the ring and show him who the better man is!\nMini External Events - External events are outside of the game-play, in the open world aka arena. These events will be very fun, and include scavenger hunts, trivia, races, etc. Be on your toes, there is no telling which event will be happening or when!\nTag Team Matches - Do you have a friend you like to play with? Do you think you two are the best? Well then this is your type of match, get your friend ready to face two other people and go head to head! Along with this match, there will also be a new belt available to win! Do you have what it takes?\n3-Way Matches - Maybe you're good enough to defeat one player, but what happens when you have to face two at the same time in an all for all, triple threat environment? Yourself and two other players going toe to toe, will you be able to handle this really difficult match?\n4 Man Battle Royal Match - Similar to the Triple Threat match, 4-way matches will be against four different people, in a free for all style match. There can only be one victor, will it be you?\n30 Man Over the Top Battle Royal Match - This match will consist of 30 players, it will be a regular match AND a special event type match. Do you think you have what it takes to go through 29 other people and come out on top? There will be special rewards to those players who are able to make it to the top!\nCreate Your Own Wrestler- In this mode, you create your own Wrestler card, and engage in matches against other created Wrestlers. The match format is a completely different game mode. While still using Ring Veteran move cards, this mode opens up a different perspective where your decisions are situational, and cards available to you are based on your wrestler's stats. By playing matches, you are awarded experience points that would be used to level up your wrestler. Each level up will award stat points which can be used to boost your wrestler's stats, and unlock more options that become available in your matches.\nOur VIP Program is a monthly subscription that costs $5.00 per month.

Major sets will range for 300-350 cards including 10 Superstars, and smaller sets will range from 80-150 cards including 3-5 Superstars.\nThe very first Ring Veteran set is called First Edition", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development can be a very tricky thing. The simplest typo can create a bug that turns into a nightmare. But with some patience, and good debugging skills, these little critters can be tracked down and exterminated.

With fatherhood came the weight; my jacket no longer fit.  \nRather than replacing my coat, I wondered: \"What if I could make it big enough to zip?\"\nWith the encouragement of family and friends the ZipFitter was born. ZipFitter is customized to add size to poorly fitting jackets.\nAbout ZipFitter\nThe ZipFitter is hand-made in my small home shop. They are made to fit each jacket individually. The material is meant to match the jacket as an extension.\nThe two panel design allows you to zip the two-piece ZipFitter into either side of the jacket. This extends the jacket\u2019s size by 4\" inches in circumference.\nFunctional and stylish, enabling the user to unzip like a normal jacket.\nOnce your jacket fits again, the ZipFitter zips out with ease.\nGoals\nFunding for marketing/advertising, materials, and manufacturers.\nExpansion into customizable ZipFitters i.e. vast color palettes, graphic designs, etc. \nCredits\n<div xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" about=\"http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Broke_For_Free/Slam_Funk/Broke_For_Free_-_Slam_Funk_-_03_The_Great\"><span property=\"dct:title\">The Great</span> (<a rel=\"cc:attributionURL\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" href=\"http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Broke_For_Free/\">Broke For Free</a>) / <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">CC BY 3.0</a></div>", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge is acquiring a manufacturer to reach our production needs.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Erik Herndon\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nAn ambitious entrepreneur aspiring to provide innovative solutions to everyday problems; working alongside an equally passionate colleague...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "How a ZipFitter works, Concept Drawing", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Prototype In Jacket", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Great Looking Faux Leather Prototype!!", "update_content": ""}, {"status": [{"Project ends": "FEBRUARY 13, 2015"}, {"Project launches": "JANUARY 14, 2015"}]}], "comment_no": 0, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zipfitter/zipfitter-the-zip-in-jacket-extender", "project_name": "ZipFitter: The Zip-In Jacket Extension"}}, {"backer": "Chad R", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Renowned relationship expert Dr. Antonio Borrello teams up with his ex-wife to write book uncovering the ultimate relationship and dating hacks for the new digital world.\nPsychologist and relationship therapist Dr. Antonio Borrello and his ex-wife, psychologist Dr. Theresa Pavone, have officially codified their exhilarating and sometimes-frustrating experiences in the new digital world of dating in a new book, Relationships 2.0.\nAfter three years of navigating the tumultuous \u201cnew world\u201d of online dating, Antonio and Theresa did what any divorced couple would do \u2013 they joined forces to share the ultimate dating hacks they had learned. This unlikely duo has written a revolutionary new book, Relationships 2.0.\nMarried in the Vatican and divorced in Detroit, the couple spent three long years re-learning the dating game, a game that has radically changed. Exhilarating and often frustrating, dating is not what it once was just 10 years ago. Tinder, mobile dating apps, online dating \u2013 all of these have changed the dating scene irrevocably.\n\u201cWe grappled with some primitive, powerful feelings as we shared stories and compared notes. Somewhere in there, we realized we\u2019d uncovered unique dating perspectives that could save others from so much frustration and hurt,\u201d explains Dr. Borrello. \u201cCombining our psychological background, our unique perspective as a divorced coupe and the new rules of online and mobile engagement, we were able to discover dating hacks that can help anyone searching for love today.\u201d\nBringing a unique relationships perspective never shared before, Relationships 2.0 will enable anyone to understand difficult dating or relationship situations and the changes necessary to improve their relationships.\nIt helps you understand why those failed relationships failed, teaches you how you can avoid repeating mistakes of the past, and guides you through handling common dating challenges. It\u2019s a tool that will help you prepare for the happy, healthy relationship of your dreams.\nThis book is for those of us who have at some point declared that dating sucks. It\u2019s for those of us who just can\u2019t seem to find The One. And, most especially, this book is for those who have struggled but still believe in second chances\u2014the 2.0.\n\nFirst Update and Answer to the question,\n\"Wasn't it weird to write a dating and relationship book with your ex-wife?\"\nClick on the Play button to Listen.\nAs a psychologist and relationship therapist, Dr. Antonio Borrello had spent more than ten years working with thousands of people to improve and heal their most important relationships. His scientific background and passion for helping people led Antonio to become a recognized dating and relationship expert. It even inspired him to begin writing his first book ... Until he got divorced. Suddenly, Antonio was forced to reevaluate every aspect of his personal life and professional practice. After all, who ever heard of a divorced marriage therapist?\nLike most divorcing couples with children, Antonio and his ex-wife Dr. Theresa Pavone struggled through a difficult adjustment period. Married or not, they were both determined to redefine their relationship and successfully uncouple. Through patience, understanding, hard work, and a little bit of luck, Antonio and Theresa were able to develop a new co-parenting friendship that is mutually rewarding and beneficial to their children.\nEventually, they also began to meet new people and rediscover the whole dating process, this time with the help of modern technology\u2014 texting, getting asked out on Facebook, setting up online dating accounts\u2014all the excitement and craziness the digital age can possibly offer. It has certainly been a wild ride so far, and now, three years later, Antonio and Theresa have come together to co-author the new book Relationships 2.0, revealing everything they have discovered since they ventured back into the exhilarating and occasionally frustrating world of single-hood, and of course, imparting some of their wisdom from their many years in the field of psychology.\nIf you thought it was hard trying to write an authoritative book on relationships after going through a divorce, try and imagine the \"Mission: Impossible\" nature of writing this book with a co-author who also happens to be the ex-wife in question! I'd be lying if I said didn't find myself grappling with some primitive, powerful feelings as she told me about her recent dating experiences as we compared notes on our dating experiences to write this book. A lot of authors will tell you they wrote their book from the heart and where Relationships 2.0 is concerned, truer words were never spoken.\nRelationships 2.0 is a book I wish I would have had a long time ago. It\u2019s filled with very easy to understand explanations of the most relevant relationship theories and research collected over the past decades.\nWith Relationships 2.0, anyone will be able to understand difficult dating or relationship situations and the changes that are necessary to improve their relationships.\nContents\nAs Featured on\nKickstarter is a funding platform dedicated to making creative projects possible with direct support.
