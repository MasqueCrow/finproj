[{"backer": "Michael Moriarty", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Do you remember the game from your childhood \"Rock Paper Scissors\"?   \n Well it's is Back! Stronger, Faster, Bolder : \nThe Origin\nRock Paper SlingShot is a table game based on the popular hand game Rock \nPaper Scissors. When we look back to our childhood, that hand game was one of the first game we learn, it was quick, simple and every one know it. Furthermore, you need nothing else then your hand to play it... and there was that catching song! \nWell, it's with the same spirit that we build Rock Paper SlingShot... rest assured there is no catching song...Not Yet!  In Rock Paper Scissors you had 3 signs, each sign beat one and is beaten by the other one. In our table game we add two new signs; Flames & Slingshot. So now, each sign beat 2 and are beaten by 2. Now, to makes thing interesting, we make evolution come along, not once, but twice (Darwin would be so pride!) for each 5 signs. Meaning that the Rock become Boulder and Mud Slide, the SlingShot become Catapult and Noah's Arch (hey! it's all woods), and so long for the other signs. They forms 5 families that share the same family Fonts as well. \nNow we were getting somewhere, but we needed something to keep them in line... \nSo we add 4 Jokers to the mix. We have Tornado, Deluge, Nuclear Bomb and Trump Wall (why not!)\nSo now when someone ask you : what Noah's Arch, the Trump Wall and a flamethrower has in common? You can said Rock Paper SlingShot! \n\nThe Game\nThe aim of the game is to get rid of all your cards before every one else. It's a turn based game. All cards are equally distributed among players. The first player start by putting one or many instance of a card. The next player need to beat it with the same number of card(s), or use a joker, or pass his turn. It's easy, because on each card there is a drawings that indicate which cards you can beat. A six-year-old child can play without the help of an adult, and have good chance of winning too. \n The Spirit\nOur goal was to create a game that is easy to learn and can be played quickly (the game lasts 8 to 15 minutes). The best part, you never know who's going to win, because there are no absolute cards that beat all the others. When you play a joker (the highest ranking card in the game), you can always be beaten by the next player with a lower ranked cards with special power\". Speaking of special cards, there is a very special one in the game: it is a joker with the famous Trump Wall. You can use it to beat your friends, but be careful, several cards of lower rank can destroy it... \n\n For Everyone  \nFor every age group that can enjoy a game that is quick to play and easy to learn. Super simple rules : become a skilled player after just one game!\nSo what is the target audience? Everyone. Really everyone. If you have family, colleagues, friends, you can play with them. If you don't, it's sad... But there is also a solitary mode!\n3 Ways To Play\nFor the people who want more strategies or want to keep score, we add 5 different types of tokens to the game. One for each family of cards ; Rock, Paper Foil, Scissors, Flames, and SlingShot.  \n Play for fun ; No need for tokens, each game has his winner, no need to keep score. \nPlay for points : The first to finish playing all his cards get a token. The one with the most tokens at the end of the night, is the real winner. \nPlay with Strategies : In this mode, each player want to be the first to collect all 5 family token. For that, the player need not only to finish first, but he also need to play his last move with a card(s) of the same family as the token he need to get. So, if you finish with a joker... No token for you!  If you finish with a token you already have, no token for you.\n\nThe Stretch Goals\nThere is 7 stretch goals (cards) to be add to the game :\n1) Trump Wall Joker : You can use it to beat your friends, but be careful, several cards of lower rank can destroy it... It is the less powerful joker in the deck. Goal : 25 000$\n2) Justin Trudeau Selfie : This card add an extra instance to the card(s) your are about to play. Goal : 50 000$\n3) Putin Election : Put this card after someone play multiple cards, and it become the value of only 1 card instance for you to beat. Goal : 75 000$ \n4) Mao's Red Book : With this card you can convince any of you card to become another one (except joker). Goal : 150 000$\n5) Obama Care : When a player play this card everyone must dump one of their cards. Goal : 300 000$\n6) Your name Hacker : With this card you can dump one of your cards just before your turn to play. Goal : if someone take the Pledge \u00abHacker card\u00bb\n7)Your name Challenge : With this card you can challenge someone that just play something hard to beat (except Joker) to beat his own hand. If the challenged player pass, the next player to play is you with a new set of card(s). Goal : if someone take the Pledge \u00abChallenge card\u00bb\n\n The Deck   \nThe set of 64 cards, plus stretch cards.\n\nThe Rewards   \n The Main Creator \nMy name is Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ch\u00e9ron (ok! just call me Jeff). I've study in marketing and used to work in customer service. Trust me when I says; every body wants to have more time on their hands to do the things they loved. Bad news! This game wont help you save time. Ok, it's playable quickly, but you will want to play it again and again.  \n\nRock-Paper-SlingShot is my first game, but I did my homework. I worked on it for the last four years. I took the time to test the gameplay with a lot of peoples from different backgrounds and used their suggestions to improve the game. I am still open to suggestions and I want this game to keep evolving. So by the time you get your copy of Rock-Paper-SlingShot, there will be a section on the game website for you to suggest rules variations to renew the game for the joy of every one. You may event suggest an adaptation of another game to be played with the Rock Paper SlingShot deck. I want you to be a part of this game & love it, as I do. \n\nMy Belief\nI believe that success is measured by the number of lives you have positively touched, even if it is only for the duration of a game. The important thing is to share good times with your loved ones. Have fun & stay safe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce we reach our funding goal, we need to print and package the games fast so they can be in your hands way before Christmas.

After each player has had their turn, the player whose total is nearest 21 wins the game.\nEach turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to \"hold\": If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and the game will switch to the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to \"hold\", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

At the end - that means after six rounds - the player with the highest overall score of the six rounds wins!\nEach player in turn throws the dice two times and scores points whenever a double is thrown. Double-6 scores 25 points. A double-3 cancels out a player's score and puts them back to zero. Any double other than a 3 or 6 scores 5 points.

This group primarily consisted of artists known as The Ferus Gang: Moses, Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Craig Kaufman, Edward Kienholz, Ken Price, Ed Ruscha, Larry Bell, John Altoon and Wallace Berman. They were the first generation of post-WWII artists who rose to prominence between the years 1957 - 1966 at the Ferus Gallery under owners Walter Hopps and later Irving Blum. Moses\u2019 path to this group began about 10 years earlier with an unlikely encounter.\nMoses had been with the Medical Corps when he was in the Navy. Afterward, he thought he might want to become a doctor, which led to taking pre-med classes at Long Beach City College. But it wasn\u2019t taking. He was having difficulty doing the math and memorizing. Someone suggested he take an art course. They talked about this kind of crazy bohemian guy, Pedro Miller, who ran the art department.\nMoses went to his first art class, where Miller began to discuss copies of C\u00e9zannes, Van Goghs and Picassos that leaned on a shelf around the room. Moses was intrigued. Then Miller set up a still life and said, \u201cNow we\u2019re all going to make a painting.\u201d Moses really wasn\u2019t sure what to do. As Miller came around to each of the students, he knew he had to do something. Sort of out of exasperation, he dipped his fingers in the paint and did this whole thing with his fingers. Miller took that painting up to the head of the class. He put it on an easel, and said, \"I want you all to see something. That\u2019s a real artist.\" Afterward, Moses got a reputation as the talented artist in the group, who they nicknamed Picasso.\nMoses always spoke of this as a defining, pivotal moment in his life, one that opened the possibility of being an artist.\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine today, but there was almost no art scene in the 1950s, except for the burgeoning film industry. There were surfers, Bohemians and beatniks. The Los Angeles Board of Supervisor\u2019s even banned Art Fairs as a form of communism. The powerful New York art scene thought we were just a desert wasteland. Little did they know we were soon to become the Wild West of the art world. That\u2019s when Ferus Gallery and the Cool School came along. Ferus is the latin word for wild. This gallery was located behind Streeter Blair\u2019s antique shop at 736 La Cienega in Los Angeles, an area better known today as West Hollywood. It was on what soon became known as Gallery Row.\nAfter a somewhat circuitous period, Moses enrolled in the graduate art program at UCLA, where he met and became friends with Craig Kaufman. Kaufman introduced Moses to Walter Hopps, who had just opened the Ferus Gallery. Walter put Moses into the first group show at Ferus in 1957, and then offered Moses a solo show at Ferus, comprised of the work that was also to be in Moses\u2019 graduate show at UCLA. This created some small controversy with the faculty, who felt like Moses had crossed some sort of line by showing his work off campus at a commercial gallery. This early recognition led Moses to this group of artists who would become life-long friends and form the core of the emergent contemporary art scene in Los Angles known as The Ferus Gang.\nIn its nine year lifetime, Ferus held important exhibitions for major east coast art stars as well, namely Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Donald Judd and Frank Stella. Andy Warhol had his first solo show at Ferus in 1962, exhibiting the famous Campbell\u2019s soup cans for the first time. Then there were others on the scene like John Baldessari, Dennis Hopper, Frank Gehry, Joe Goode, Tony Berlant, and feminists artists like Vija Celmins.\nKienholz ran the store during the day and used it as a studio. According to Peter Goulds, Founding Director of LA Louver in his work Kienhholz Before LACMA, Hopps was an autodidact intellectual, very much into art history and had connections with Cubist and Dadaist Marcel Duchamp, contemporary collecting interests and the Arensberg Family Collection, and with the emerging young Los Angeles collectors of that era.\nAfter Hopps and Kienholz parted ways, Ferus Gallery was in the red and changed hands to Irving Blum, who was a smooth personality and groomed Ferus and the LA art scene until the gallery got out of the red. Blum took the gallery from a loose knit group of beatniks and molded them into a competitive and brilliant group of artists that brought about the commercialization of the LA art scene. History says there was much lost and much gained in that process. Blum ran the gallery until its closure in 1966.\nWhat Ed did, his unique path, was very different. He was very iconoclastic, as they all were, but early on he explored mark making to an intense and unusual degree,\u201d said Turner. \u201cIf you look at his early graphite drawings in the sixties, made at a time when pop art imagery, primary color, large bold eye-catching works were taking hold, you see that Moses was headed in a very different direction.\nHe was doing these works on paper with graphite, not using huge amounts of color. But they were remarkable. You can feel the intense pressure of the graphite onto, and into the paper, almost like he was trying to push through to the other side! There is one very well-known series of huge graphite drawings of dense rose patterns, inspired by a tablecloth that he and his wife, Avilda, found when they were in Tijuana. That pattern interested him. You get this sense of curiosity from these pieces, a sense that he was asking, how far could you push that idea and find something that was magical by doing something to an unusual degree, very intensely and with a laser focus.\nA lot of that early work of his seems counterintuitive to that macho bluster that the Ferus Gang had. You had these very intense, very intricate, delicate, monochromatic works on paper that were in some instances somewhat intimate in scale. You can see when you look at the arc of Moses' career, he was really exploring, and pushing through from the familiar to get to another dimension with the material. That became a hallmark of his work throughout the rest of his career \u2013 pushing the possibilities of his materials.\nThe Ferus Gang\n  Ed Moses Foghorn #10 2017\nFerus Gallery 1962", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy big hope with the film is to uncover the true story of Ed Moses and his art and that of the Ferus Gallery. There is also a love story behind Moses, his art and life. The process of unearthing the footage and further interviewing will bring to screen those moments.\n\nOne of the big challenges of this project is a significant portion of the footage is already shot (e.g. prior artists interviews). It is a matter of cataloging and finding out what the footage was shot on. Then we will need to convert the footage to 4K for broadcast. That is a significant portion of the budget.\n\nThen the next challenge will be to further interview other people who knew Ed Moses to continue the story line. \n\nWe have contacts within the art community to help create the secondary necessary footage to make this project happen. \n\nWe also have access to the original footage of Ed Moses in talks with gallery owners and other artists. \n\nWe also have access to Ed Moses' art.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ruptured Media Films\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nKriss Perras is a screenwriter and director.

Well, you may now say hello to the world\u2019s first ever 3-arc electric lighter, and it is rechargeable too.  \n      Brush That Comes With Lighter\n      All available colors Blue, Silver, Gold, Black, Anodized\n      Brush and charger\n    Matchboxes and sticks have been replaced by lighters a while ago because someone was looking out for our pockets and safety while making flames. Now, it is time to perfect the lighter story, and in a bid to do this we came up with our own unique idea to get anyone who still has a \u201clighter budget\u201d to discard it already. The finished prototype of the electric 3-arc lighter is a functional and beautiful piece of hardware.  \n JUST HOW AWESOME IS THE 3-ARC LIGHTER?  \nLifetime investment:  \nA lighter as a lifetime investment is probably unheard of, but the bold 3-arc lighter can only be defined in those terms. The rechargeable feature of the lighter means users can now actually use one lighter for years. Of course, if you want to, but if you do some arithmetic you\u2019ll see just how much you\u2019d be saving if you didn\u2019t buy any of those unreliable lighters monthly.\nSAFETY:  \nMost people do not know this, but unless you are looking to burn something up, you only need flames not fire. The 3-arc lighter is electricity driven and works in a process that involves electricity jumping between set 3 electrodes and producing a dazzling electric arc because the air between both sets of electrodes has now become ionized.  \n This arc is simply beautiful flames forged from electricity, different from the wild fire other basic lighters produce. The 3 arcs of gentle flames are as safer than the uncontrolled flames we have become accustomed to. You can hardly go wrong from pushing a button to start a lighter than scratching on matchboxes.  \nDURABILITY:  \nAll materials featured in the design of the lighter are authentic and newly refined including the prominent zinc alloy.  \nFUNCTIONALITY:  \nAll the most awesome gadgets these days are one touch. The electronic 3-arc lighter matches up in this one touch functionality; it takes just a gentle push of the only button on the device to trigger the lighter and reveal it\u2019s 3 gentle arcs of flame.  \nThe charging system is as simple as can be too, just place the lighter in its charging stand and plug to electricity and watch your investment charge back.  \nDESIGN:  \nThis is where all the ideas come together. The 3-arc lighter does not heat up, lighters that produce fire get hot in little time because the flames pour everywhere and the induction heats up the whole lighter.  \nThis is not only dangerous considering those lighters are highly flammable, it is also not fun to hold a heated lighter. However, the 3-arc lighter stays cool even throughout intense use because it is mere technology producing gentle flames. The cutely designed 3-arc lighter will put some spice to how you light your birthday cake candles or romantic dinner night candles.  \nRECHARGABLE:  \n Making a product that will serve people for pretty much decades was our goal, and in these modern times where electric power is everywhere, a rechargeable lighter cannot go wrong. In 1.5 to 2 hours, you can charge the 450mAh battery of the 3-arc electric lighter.  \nFEATURES:  \nELECTRIC POWERED \n 3-ARCS\n VARIETY OF COLORS\n 450MAH BATTERY\nCOVER IS ZINC ALLOY \nVERY AFFORDABLE PRICE \nUsability:\nThe 3-arc lighters are not just pretty, they can be used in a diversity of applications, for candles, paper, gas cooker, incense and more. Tilting the lighter to awkward degrees doesn\u2019t affect its functionality, so, if you are in a tight spot and you need to light it up, go ahead, it\u2019ll work. \n Waste: \n The only time any waste comes from the 3-arc lighter is if for some reason you must trash it. Otherwise, you do not have to worry about fumes or smoke from burning fuel. \n WHY WE NEED YOUR BACKING? \n The lighter industry is not where a lot of investors turn their attention towards. So, when we finalized the prototype 3-arc lighter, we were confident no one else has this product out there. So together, with your backing we can produce more of the prototype on a commercial scale and get the 3 arc-lighters to people who need them. \n With a little thinking, we figured it\u2019s best to let the people who might appreciate this product do the backing and join in the story.\n WHOLESALE INQUIRIES\n  If you are interested in carrying our product in your online shop, please send us an email to zenlighter1@gmail.com before the end of the campaign.  \nAPPRECIATION\nI would just like to take the time and say thank you to all the backers, and customers.

That\u2019s why I decided to develop Strategic Collaboration\u2026 An Educational Business Game.\nThe initial feedback has been amazing and I am confident that with your support (financial and promotional) we will provide more people, of all backgrounds and ages, with an important tool to compete cost-effectively in the new collaborative economy and help spur the socio-economic development of their community.\u201d\nVictor M Rivera\nReviews on the Strategic Collaboration Workbook for Entrepreneurs:\n 5.0 out of 5 stars\n\"This is a go-to book for any entrepreneur that is looking to create, build and grow a business\"\nBy Vanessa Kings on October 30, 2015 Format: Kindle Edition \n \u201cMany entrepreneurship books that I have read focus on several aspects of being an entrepreneur and how to launch a successful business, such as lean business plans, scale of funding, process, market analysis, strengths and weaknesses, and so on.\nHowever, in \"Strategic Collaboration Workbook for Entrepreneurs: A How-To Guide for finding the Right Collaborators to help grow your Business\", author Victor M. Rivera places the focus on relationships. After all, running a business involves many interactions and what will make or break it are the people. Both customers and partners. So, finding the right collaborators is key to building any business.\nAnother strong point is that the book is not written as a narrative or full of theory, but rather a very practical workbook with easy to follow steps and useful guides that range from assessing business capabilities to determining which strategic collaborators are right for you to tips for creating a Strategic Collaborator Management Manual.\nThis is a go-to book for any entrepreneur that is looking to create, build and grow a business by focusing on collaborative relationships.\u201d\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\"Great resource for entrepreneurs\"\n By A. Martin on August 27, 2015 Format: Kindle Edition|\n\u201cEntrepreneurs advance by collaborating, but there are few guides on what strategies to follow. Rivera bases this guide on his years of experience to help entrepreneurs form lucrative relationships that benefit all involved. The practical steps are clear to guarantee viable outcomes. A must-have in the entrepreneur\u2019s library.\u201d\nDefinition of Collaborative Relationships\n \u201cCollaboration is when two or more persons/businesses with complementary resources, get together to share them to create greater efficiencies and help each other grow their business. Collaborations are generally for specific time periods and resources.\u201d\nWho is the Strategic Collaboration Educational Business Game designed for?\nThe target buyers/users of the game are:\n\u2022 Entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs seeking to learn about forming collaborative business relationships and how to maximize their benefits and minimize risks. \n\u2022 Business Development Organizations can use the game for training their staff and clients on the process of forming collaborative business relationships.\n\u2022 Employers promoting \"intrapreneurship\" at their company. \n\u2022 Parents who detect an entrepreneurial potential in their 16+ aged children.\nHow do you Play and Win?\n1. Start by reviewing contents of the Business Game Manual. \n  2. Fill out Business Game Profile on the Scoreboard. \n3. Select the type of business you will represent from industry cards on the Board. In each game you assume a different collaborator's role in a different industry.\n4. Roll die around the Gameboard until the six elements of your Company Profile on the Scoreboard are identified. These include:\n    a. Type of business seeking collaborator(s).\n    b. Capabilities to be shared.\n    c. Type of collaborative relationship desired.\n    d. Type of potential collaborator.\n    e. Where you will look for them.\n    f.  How you will minimize collaboration risks.\n5. When all players complete their Company Profile, including needs and circumstances, they will simulate a 3-5-minute presentation to a potential collaborator using Guidelines provided in the Game Manual. Sample written presentations will also be provided. Persons can also follow instructions and play by themselves, at their own pace.\n6. It is highly recommended that a video copy of each player's presentation be recorded (using a smart phone or similar device) for review and future comparison purposes. \n7. Players will listen, critique, score, and learn from each other's presentation. \n8. Player with the highest score wins the game. Actually, everyone wins because of the learning experience gained each time they play, assuming different roles in different types of businesses, and collaborative relationships. \nBusiness and Communication Skills you can learn from playing the Game.\nThrough role-playing exercises, players will learn about:\n1. Different needs and capabilities shared in collaborative business relationships.\n\n2. Types of collaborative relationships.  \n3. Types of potential collaborators.\n4. Where to find business collaborators.\n5. Ways to minimize collaboration risk factors.\n6. Ways to monitor a collaborative business relationship  to ensure success.  \n7. Making practice video presentations / elevator pitches to various types of potential collaborator(s) and sharing them via social media for feedback. \nHow long will it take us to complete the project?\n We estimate that 30 days after receiving the pledges via the Kickstarter crowdfunding process, we will begin to distribute the Strategic Collaboration\u2026An Educational Business Game to our project supporters.\nHow much backing do I need to complete the project?\n Financial: We are seeking 205 project supporters who submit pre- order pledges of $49 for each \u201cFirst Edition\u201d copy of the new business game within the next 30 days. The total of $10,000 will cover all pending project completion and U.S. delivery costs.\nPromotional Support: We are especially interested in finding project supporters who also see the many benefits of using collaborative relationships as a strategic business building tool that will contribute to the socio-economic development of their community.                        \nTheir willingness to encourage like-minded friends and families, to join our community of promoters of business collaborative relationships as a means of helping local entrepreneurs start or grow their business faster, will also be greatly appreciated.\n\nProject supporters can easily share this Kickstarter page by pressing the Share button at the top of this presentation.\n How will I use the pre-order funds?\nTogether with existing project funds:\n1. Test and fine-tune the final game product, including instructions, artwork, game pieces, packaging, game delivery costs, etc..\n2. Establish a cost-effective game production and distribution system.\n3. Funds will be used to fulfill all game pre-orders on time.\nHow will I keep in touch with my backers during the campaign and after the game is released?  \nBackers can view weekly informative postings on project status. They can also share ideas on how they can best utilize and help promote collaborative relationships within their business and educational/training communities.\nMy background relevant to the Project.\n I was introduced to the business world when I was 12 years old and worked after school and during summers at my father\u2019s grocery store in Brooklyn, NY, until I graduated from New York University with my degree in Economics.\nMy business development-related experience since then, at the local, state, national, and international level, includes holding senior management positions at the U.S. Small Business Administration (New York District Director, SBA Regional Director for six-states based in Denver,CO; and Senior Advocate, Office of the Chief Counsel for Advocacy; National Director at the Minority Business Development Agency/U.S. Department of Commerce; and headed the Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean at the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). This position required U.S. Senate Confirmation.\nHave served as a consultant to investment banking firms, federal and local government agencies, telecommunications firms, and the World Bank.\nMost recently, I\u2019ve focused my services on helping small and medium size firms expand their operations by building collaborative business relationships. Last year, I published an e-Book, \u201cStrategic Collaboration Workbook for Entrepreneurs \u2026a How-To Guide for finding the Right Collaborators to help grow your business\u201d\nI realized recently, that another way of helping persons acquire the know-how on the power of collaborative business relationships was to utilize the principle of \u201cgame-learning\u201d. That\u2019s why I decided to develop Strategic Collaboration\u2026An Educational Business Game.\nThe initial feedback on the concept has been amazing. I am confident that with your timely support we will serve a good purpose by providing aspiring entrepreneurs with an important, and easy to use tool, that will help them quickly learn the basics of forming collaborative business-relationships. This in turn, will enable them to compete cost-effectively in the new collaborative economy.\nYour support in helping to bring this worthwhile educational business game project to life will be greatly appreciated, Just press the Back the Project button at the top of page now.

It has greatly expanded the horizons of individuals who want to develop creative projects and start entrepreneurial ventures. Still, existing crowdfunding platforms, while being great avenues of empowerment, often work under rules that are too strict and which ultimately lead many crowdfunding project authors to fail in their campaigns, or to shy away from getting started in the first place.\nCrowdfunding\nWe believe it is time to create a \"before crowdfunding platform\" \u2013 that people can use while taking their first crowdfunding steps. \nWe noticed 3 interesting things\nA lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family\nFriend and family fund half of all \u201cself-financed entrepreneurs\u201d\nGetting funded by friends and family is expected to be used before using crowdfunding. Indeed, many investors invest in people before they invest in ideas or products. Since they don\u2019t know you, their first integrity check on you as a person is whether your friends and family believe in you strongly enough to give you seed money for your new idea. If they won\u2019t do it, they ask, why would strangers invest in you?\nThat\u2019s why we decided to create Friend Funding, where the chances of feeling shy or failing to crowdfund a project are very low. Through Friend Funding, we will help you in a funny, smart and witty way to fund your projects, starting with your circle of friends and family.\nFriend Funding think of crowdfunding Campaign as a \"\u00a9 digital piggy bank\", that your friends and family can contribute in a funnier and smoother experience.\nThe premise is simple. You reach out to your friends and family, and instead of just asking for a contribution, you ask for a contribution in a fun way, a way that makes the whole seem like a game.\nWe will also offer your friends and your project\u2019s fans badges whenever they contribute, while also offering you points as they support your project.\nBadge Friend-funding.com\nEvery month the top 3 most popular projects which have the most points will receive the Crowdfunding Package (Website creation, logo, advertising for a month, contibution to your Crowdfunding Campaign up to 1500\u20ac and much more...).\nTop 3 project\nFeaturing both a free and an affordable premium subscription for getting funding, crowdfunding project authors will find on our Friend Funding website a crowdfunding avenue that they can easily pursue and that they can successfully use, by understanding its simple rules and letting its structure work for them.\nPlus, Friend Funding\u2019s premium subscription offers a wealth of features that greatly enhance your chances of getting the funding that you need. It includes support from mentors, premium advice, social advertising, design support, brand name support, pitch validation and much more.\nSo this is it! With Friend Funding, you\u2019ll no longer need to feel pressured by all-or-nothing campaigns, or by a crowd of potential backers who knows nothing about you, and whose attention is being fought for by endless crowdfunding initiatives.\nAt Friend Funding, we are creating an even more fun and entertaining method for raising startup capital, a method that will help you reach out to the people most likely to support your campaign.\nYou\u2019ll have a flexible, rewarding, friends and family-based crowdfunding source that can actually work \u2013 just as you want it to.\nSince Friend Funding needs to operate from a technologically smart, safe, user-friendly and dynamic platform, we are seeking to raise 5.000,00 \u20ac to fund its full operational creation, by covering the following expenses:\nThese amounts are for a 3 month development schedule. Everything else is already paid for by the project creator using personal friend-funding.\n Accountancy work : 720,00 \u20ac\n Hosting :                 432,00 \u20ac\n Platform Design :    360,00 \u20ac\n Platform Coding and Development : 2.500,00 \u20ac\n(Project Team has already coded 30% of the work.

Imagine, then, that technician remotely logging in to your computer and fixing the issue for you at the push of a button.\nAt 'The Ready' we make that possible. We connect users with computer technicians over a secure cellphone connection. Using verbal instruction or a remote connection to the computer, technicians troubleshoot the issue together to solve the problem. It's like having a technician on call all the time. \nCreating an App for Technicians and Users\nThe Ready provides easy, at-home assistance with common issues like virus removal, backup assistance, computer optimization, and software configuration. It makes it easier for anyone who needs assistance to have it and anyone who is able to give assistance to give it. \nUnlike other apps, The Ready puts the technician at the center of the solution. By allowing qualified technicians the opportunity to provide tech support from anywhere, we're able to source and qualify many more technicians, with varying levels of expertise. \nFor users, the cost is significantly less than taking their device to a computer shop or having a technician physically visit their house to fix their issue. This lack of overhead allows more money to go directly to the technician. It gives them the opportunity to make money using the skills they already use everyday. \nEmbracing the Future  \nThis platform leverages the experience of seasoned IT technicians to help users anywhere, anytime. It puts them at the push of a button for users who need them. \nService when you want it, where you want it. In today's day, you can access just about anything you need with the push of a button. Car service. Groceries. Lawn care. Childcare. We're bringing this type of service to tech support by creating a quick, easy, secure way for users to connect to technicians.\nAs the number of consumer devices increases over time, so does the cost to maintain those devices. So does the need for a different solution. Get connected to the future of home-based technical support. \nHow it Works\nBoth the user and the tech have the app installed on their mobile device. The user initiates a \"ticket\" in the app, which notifies the right type of tech that there's a user who needs help. The ticket comes with a brief description of the issue. Techs can then accept the incoming call using the app if they are available and feel they can help the user. There is a reasonable per minute fee associated with the call.\nThe User Experience\nMillions of people need tech support everyday, but they don't know where to look, don't want to take their device somewhere and drop it off, or don't want to be routed through a call center. They probably wish they had a tech friend, right? Someone they could pick up and call who would be glad to help them through their issue. The Ready gives qualified technicians the ability to be that tech friend at the touch of a button.\nUsers will carry around the power of infinite technical knowledge in their pockets -- always an instant away from getting an answer or solution to almost any technical issue, simply and efficiently.\nAnd users can rate the techs, creating a user-based rating system visible to other users. \nThe Technician Experience\nAfter development is complete and The Ready officially launches, technicians can join and and earn extra money solving technical issues for everyday users. \nOff work early and want to make a few extra dollars? Turn on the app and be ready. Slow night or weekend? Turn on the app and be ready.\nTechs can work from anywhere there is an internet and phone connection for any length of time they choose.  \nThey'll use their knowledge and experience to build an online reputation through user reviews. \nThe Dream\nThe Ready team has worked diligently to get this app this far, but we need help. We thought there was no better way to raise money for a user-, in-home-based app than to crowdfund to those people who will use the app. Whether you're a technician or a potential user, it's clear to see the benefits of having on-hand tech support. Help us take it to the next step by helping us do the nitty-gritty, technical development. \nWe're at a good spot. We've worked through the model itself, the design and flow of the app, the preliminary legalities, and all that jazz. But we need to build out the app and give it legs to enter the market place. \nPending a positive kickstarter campaign, The Ready app will be available in the Google playstore for all android devices in the spring of 2017, with a projected iOS app launch date in late 2017. \nThank you for your support, please help and tell others.\nLet's get ready!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe preliminary stages of app creation are completed.

Once I obtained my dream job, I realized how close first responders are to the community. A first responder is an employee of an emergency service who is likely to be among the first people to arrive at and assist at the scene of an emergency, such as an accident, natural disaster, or terrorist attack. First responders include police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians.\nI have been to many law enforcement funerals and emergency scenes involving fire department personnel, emergency medical responders and law enforcement. I have been approached by many citizens asking, how they can support their local first responders. I have been trying to find a way to bring together local community support and first responders.\nEarlier this year, I was talking with a good friend, who is a retired police officer and previous fire fighter. During our chat, that\u2019s when this business idea and the community support model began. I was excited to get this idea moving, as I knew this was a great way to bring together the community and first responders. My business plan is to establish a private gourmet coffee brand, Thin Blue Grind, in which coffee consumers could purchase fresh local coffee and 10% of the proceeds would go directly back to the first responder community through non-profit organizations. I want to be the Northern California\u2019s premier coffee supplier. All orders will be donated to the customer\u2019s local community where they reside. As I expand, I want to support the nation through a daily cup of coffee offering \u201cCoffee with a Cause.\u201d\nSince I\u2019ve also always enjoyed my daily cup of coffee before a hard day\u2019s work, I knew I had to build the perfect coffee blend. I roast green coffee beans at home and love the taste of the fresh roast. After doing extensive research and considering all financial aspects, I realized, I need to have my coffee bean roasted at a local commercial coffee roaster. Having my beans roasted close to home, will provide the same quality and freshness I want to offer. This will allow me to provide great quality coffee beans with unlimited distribution potential. This partnership will also allow me to expand and offer other coffee roast as the business grows. I am a firm believer in partnering with other local businesses where I can build close relationships.\nWe are close to launching an online store with local delivery and pickup. We will be selling our House Blend (The Lineup), French Roast (Night Shift) and Light Roast (The Recruit) to launch the business. We also will offer other coffee merchandise with our logo to support first responder awareness in the community. Kickstarter funds will be used to offset and reduce our start up business costs, which includes equipment, packaging, branding, and marketing. This will enable Thin Blue Grind to open our business and donate to local first responder organizations.\nI want the community to know purchasing coffee from the \"Thin Blue Grind\" will make a substantial impact to our community by doing the thing they do every day \"DRINKING COFFEE.\" Thank you and please support the Thin Blue Grind, Coffee with a Cause.   \n\nOur Roasts\n  -SECOND TIER FUNDING-\nWe are thinking BIG here!\nIf we reach our projected goal, we will shoot for the stars. Any money raised over the original goal will go towards bringing \"Thin Blue Grind\" on the road. We have a small family vintage camping trailer that would make a great mobile coffee business. We would build out something like the picture below. It needs some work to make it into a useable mobile business, but would easily be retrofitted. This would allow us to bring my love of coffee, family history, community support along with awareness of our first responders!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur risk is very minimal based on our ability to have freshly roasted product available next day after roasting for pick up or delivery.

Effective preventative measures to help individuals withstand the threats of illness include having suitable footwear together with advice on foot hygiene.\n\n\u2022 Saving the Cost of Medical Bills In developing countries where medical resources are limited, costly, and oftentimes ineffective in curing diseases, for those on little means - medical treatment can financially cripple already-struggling individuals and families. Therefore, preventing illnesses that stem from wounds to the feet can hugely help in preventing needless expenses in the long run.\n\n\u2022 Allowing Access to Work/Education Shoes are often a prerequisite for being allowed into schools or places of work in many developing countries, thus having access to shoes will positively impact one\u2019s prospects in receiving education or securing work.\nBODO Footwear - Infographic\nDonation Sandal Infographic\nBODO Sandal - Light Blue, Ariel Image\n\nEVERY pair of BODO sandals sold will fund a second pair of sandals for someone in recognized need in (initially) South America and the Caribbean.\nThe Barefoot Foundation\nCrafted from recycled tyres\nHow it all began\nBODO Sandal - Construction Image\nBODO Sandal, 1st draft design, Pink\n  BODO Sandal - Concept\n\n\nWhile Peter Lochan, founder of BODO, was on a trip to see family in Trinidad and Tobago, the two-island nation where his parents were born and raised, he was told a story about his late uncle who used scrap tyres to make durable footwear, which helped prevent injuries in the Trinidadian oil fields during the 1960s. Peter, impressed by his uncle's brilliance and ingenuity, began thinking about this concept as a means of recycling the millions of discarded tyres the world over.\nFollowing his trip, two discussions led to the current BODO business model.\nDISCUSSION ONE The first talks focused on the short lifespan of footwear versus the warranty on vehicle tyre tread. Once warranties expire, the majority of the world\u2019s tyres lie in waste dumps. Yet the material from these tyres could be re-used and recycled to make other durable products. A question came to the fore: could footwear made of tyres offer more durability and provide a way of recycling this waste?\nDISCUSSION TWO The next set of talks addressed the inadequacy of footwear amongst people living in poverty and the impact this has on their lives, plus what solutions could be provided from recycled tyres to make comfortable and long-lasting footwear.    \nThe concept behind BODO sandals is not original. The world\u2019s poor and innovative have been making sandals from used tyres since vehicles and roads came into existence. Yet for Peter Lochan, founder of BODO, it seemed an amazing discovery.\nWhat we need\nBODO is inviting YOU, and the rest of the Kickstarter community to be a part of our campaign. The Kickstarter funding will enable BODO to kick-off its public launch by allowing us to do the following:\n1. Complete the manufacture our first run of BODO sandals - including creating and developing our product range (Our products are completed and waiting to be shipped over) \nBODO Sandals - Packed and ready to be shipped.\n2. Create sales and marketing campaigns for customer acquisition\n3. Targeted digital marketing in order to continue to raise awareness of our product within retail and fashion industries\n4. Grow our team by recruiting top quality staff to work alongside the current team.\nWhat have we been doing ?\nBODO, though a young company, is spirited in its endeavours to create a solid foundation for the company so it can thrust its success well into the future.\nIt has already triumphantly achieved vital milestones in forging distinct relationships with key suppliers and partners within its industry, and continues to tirelessly foster these close networks.\nNotable examples of its accomplishments include passing entry requirements and a board to become members of SATRA, an independent research and testing organisation.\nIt has technical facilities in the UK and China serving customers throughout the world. As well as testing products and components to European and international standards across a wide range of industry sectors, SATRA develops, manufactures and sells test equipment. SATRA is a Notified Body for various European directives including personal protection equipment (PPE), which is one of SATRA\u2019s largest sector operations.\nSATRA has its own chemicals analysis laboratory for testing restricted substances in accordance with European REACH, and US chemicals regulations for which it is CPSC-accredited. This was a very crucial step for BODO as its product testing is key to succeeding in its market. BODO will continue this work with SATRA and consider them invaluable to the development of BODO products.\nSatra - Infographic\nThe BODO Sandal - Infographic.2\n\nBODO Sandal - Red\nBODO Sandal - Red\nOur work with the Barefoot Foundation\nBODO has also been successful in negotiating a key contract with The Barefoot Foundation, based in Columbia, to distribute its donation sandals.\nThe Barefoot Foundation, aside from enabling BODO Footwear to distribute its donation sandals to those who need it most, will also open many doors for BODO Footwear in partner networks, and gives BODO an exclusive and accredited edge. It helps BODO move away from normal charity status, and allows their customers to embark on the BODO journey with them\nThe Barefoot Foundation\nWe have been busy...\nOne of the most crucial deals BODO has negotiated and secured is with the UK\u2019s leading footwear distributor, William Lamb Footwear, who have worked with some of the biggest, established footwear brands across the world and currently has a waiting list of customers. They will be involved in manufacturing the donation sandal.\n\nThe firm involvement of William Lamb Footwear speaks volumes about BODO\u2019s potential as a main contender in the market and is testament to BODO\u2019s professionalism, ethos and ability to create and maintain its relationships.\n\nThe sandal soles in BODO\u2019s collection are all made from recycled vehicle tyres, and are heavy on style and comfort.\nbodofootwear.com\nBODO's Key Achievements to Date\n1.

BODO Footwear will work with retailers to maximise sales, and thus donations, rather than working to maximise margins. BODO\u2019s assumption is that as sales grow, low margins will become more profitable as unit production costs fall.\n\u2022 Vigorously promoting BODO Footwear and the work of its partner social projects, through marketing and social media.\nBODO Sandals - Female", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1 - Unable to obtain enough sales distribution or partners lose interest\n\nBODO is working daily to develop these relationships, and already has several interested partners. However, we recognise that distribution must grow in order to increase sales and show donation results. We will not stop at the first few interested parties, but will continue to seek out and approach new partners as we develop. Should the sale of BODO sandals become less interesting to certain partners, we will have a reserve of other partners ready to commit.\n\n2 - Donation organisations\n\nBODO has full commitment from our first donation organisation, Whisper Orphans, and continues to vet others who operate in countries where adequate footwear is in need. Should issues arise with the donation distribution or with any organisation, BODO would be able to act quickly to identify a new distributor.\n\n3 - Loss of manufacturer (due to quality, breach of contract, etc.)\n\nBODO has identified several possibilities for making both the commercial and the donation sandals. Our preferred manufacturer, based in China, has proven the best choice for quality and price. However, since we aspire to find facilities that reduce shipping costs and help local economies, we continue dialoguing with other manufacturers. With these alternative contingencies at hand, if the existing contract were compromised in any way, we would swiftly revert to our backup manufacturer and lose no time.\n\n4 - Quality of either sales or donation sandals not up to standard\n\nThe importance of quality has been addressed with our chosen manufacturer. We will conduct periodic quality control on both sandals in order to determine any issues that need adjustment. We would then quickly be able to address them either with the existing manufacturer, or with a new partner.\n\n5 - Intellectual property infringement\n\nThanks to our expertise in online intellectual property protection, we have implemented a robust online protection plan against potential hackers. As for the sandals themselves, we will continue to conduct periodic assessments of existing and upcoming competitors.\n\n6. Bad press (seen as copying, quality-related, any problems with associated partners)\n\nWe are very active on the Internet, as well as in target markets, and are constantly monitoring media related to our product and our partners. We have a team ready to react to any bad press and are developing a crisis communication plan as we move forward, which will be ready for launch and adapted periodically thereafter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Peter Lochan\n2 created \u00b7 19 backed\nBODO (BuyOneDonateOne) is run by Peter Lochan.

I am a published author but over the past few years have felt that I want to publish a book with meaning and purpose. And so this project was born.\n In 1994 I started dating a great guy with a wonderful family. I met his Aunt Renee shortly after and she was very quiet and shy. Being developmentally disabled it was hard for me to relate to her at first Over the following years I would see Renee from time to time however she was sheltered and protected by her mother. In 2008 we sadly lost her mom and Renee\u2019s protected and secure world was thrown into turmoil. Being unemployed at the time I took the opportunity to try and help Renee through this time and also to get to know her better. The years have flown by and she is such a joy to be around. Society would consider her not normal but I always chuckle and think society has it backwards. She is more sure of herself and what she wants than I am. This project was actually her idea during one our many overnight outings she said \u201cI wish I could write one.\u201d (a book) And so this project begins.\nIn doing this project I battled with how to go about it. I wanted stories from many people dealing with a variety of disabilities but I wasn't sure how it would be received. I have been overwhelmed by the support and contributions.\nProject Funds Overview (Where will the money go?)\n   Marketing $280.00 - The Marketing funds will be used for promoting the book online and create a website to bring additional awareness.\n   Contributors Gift Book $350.00 -  For contributing and supporting this project we would like to gift each contributor to the book a copy.\n   Publishing Costs for 250 Black and White Books $870.00\nIt would not be possible for this project to happen without the support and guidance of a great many individuals including but not limited to: All the amazing writers, poets and artists who contributed, the Abilities Solution for all of their support and giving my Aunt a home all of these years, the SBTS team who volunteered countless hours going through submissions and every single person with a disability visible to the human eye or not who struggles to be understood and accepted.\nTHANK YOU EVERYONE!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are fortunate to have many submissions coming in.

It's a \"Clash-of-Clans\" type strategy game.\nWe studied more than 25 games of the same type and took the best parts of them and removing what wasn't so cool. So this game should have all the best parts without the frustration encountered sometimes in these kind of games. \n Here are a few of the features of the game: \nPlay without waiting! You won't have to purchase gems to be able to fight as many times as you want !\nCoop Mode : attack hard-to-beat bases with the help of other players and share the loots! Auto-detection of nearby devices to play with your friends !\nSix game modes: Solo and Multiplayer, but also Coop, Arena, Defend and Missions. You will never get bored with this game diversity ! \nTransformable robots : up to 8 heroes assemblies have to be found during Missions. Once you get all the right parts, you can add new transformable heroes to your army ! \nTrade or buy parts on the black market ! \nSteal other players' expansions ! You can win up to 5 subsidiary bases and get many more resources from these expansions! \nBrotherhood : send gifts and exchange resources or even help other members of your corporation ! \nCatch giant monsters when they attack your base and re-use them during your attacks. You can also collect DNA samples and create your own rare monster ! \nStrategy-based attacks : you can beat hard bases if you have a good attack strategy \nRPG elements : you can assign points at each new level! For example increase life points, agility, armour, or even attack range ! Each unit has its built-in characteristics (ground or air unit, melee or shooting, etc) but you can customize each unit as you like ! \nDestroying the headquarter : destroys all the other buildings as they are all linked to the main building. \nAuto Graphic Detection : The first time the game is launched, it automatically lowers graphic complexity according to processing power available so that each gaming experience is fluid no matter what device it's played on.\nBuildings\nGold and Uranium are the two main resources. You can gather and stock them in the appropriate buildings: \nEach building is upgradable : you start at level 1 and when you have enough gold, you can upgrade it . There will be a total of 16 buildings levels for each building\nHeroes\nEach hero will be transformable and upgradable..\nSnowPiercer\nBasilisk\nUnits\nHere are some samples of units. Each unit will be customizable\nthe units will be upgradable infinitely! but it will become harder and harder to upgrade to the next level.\nGiant monsters\nIn the game, you will have the opportunity to catch or to create giant monsters, and use them in battle ! Be careful, because training them is quite a challenge, so they sometimes go berserk and start attacking your own troops. But this is a skill and you can improve it at a point where it will never occur. You can equip them with armors, like a regular human to protect them from damages.\nGodzilla\nHelldog\nKing Kong\nDefense Turrets\nRocket-launcher (terre/air) Ground/air.\nMissiles (air only) Vertical.\nCanons balls can be destroyed by shooting them ! (zone damages).\nLaser (ground).\nLightning strike type that progresses from unit to unit until there is no more power.\nFreeze tower (zone : slow down the units).\nTower that changes the behaviour of one unit by making him attack his own side (only 1 available).\nTower that launch a subterranean wave that makes a group of units jump into the air then crash on the ground (does also damages to buildings nearby).\nTower that sends a ring of fire that damages everything on its path \nRadiating tower that affects only biologic creatures.\nBlack Market   \nA market will be available for the players and will give them useful objects to develop units. The more the building will be developped, the more it will have good items in store (DNAs, armors, speedup bonuses, etc.).\nItem examples :\nExperience points\nHero Experience points\n1 free update (rarely)\nBuilding time speedup\nNew hero part\nMonsters armories\nSalt, mercury and alchemix sulfur\nUranium/gold production speedups\nArmy creation cost rebate\nMonsters genetic code Shields (1 per day with monthly pack)\nRessources\nSelling & buying units   \n Each player will have the opportunity to sell units when they are not online, in exchange for ressources or even gems. This wil allow other players to attack bases otherwise unbeatable by buying stronger units.\nAlchemy laboratory\nAn alchemy laboratory will be available at the fifth level. The player will have the opportunity to gather sulfur, mercury of salt during his missions or buy some on the black market. When the quantity of each ingredient is sufficient, he will have the opportunity to complete a new alchemic work. The final work (iosis) will allow players to produce Alkaest. Alkaest will give opportunity to tranform gold into uranium and vice-versa.\nThere will be a total of 6 game modes\nEach mode brings its uniqueness to the game. Of course there will be the very requested Coop mode to play with your friends (the devices close to you will be automatically detected so you can play with friends easily) !\nAnd of course there will also be Clan Wars and many Events !\nhttp://GlobGlobGames.com\nhttp://Mechapunk.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat will we do with the money?\n The money will be used in 6 main areas:\n 1) programming : I'm a Digital Signal Processing engineer and I am also a programmer so my task will be to gather all the code parts and assemble them in the main program.

GPS, point of sale, maps, weather. Space-enabled data makes our modern life possible. Yet few people know the companies operating the satellites. Fewer still have access to the satellites themselves.\nWeebill wants to change that. \nWhy? Because we now stand on the cusp of a new era of space adventure. Advances in technology and changes in communication are rewriting the rules of the business. \nThe fundamental vision of Weebill is a simple one; we see a future where space becomes easily accessible, affordable and open to all.    \nWe want to spark this movement.\nWeebill\u2019s HyperQube satellite offers the most powerful CubeSat available on the market in an incredibly small 10cm\u00b3 chassis while being readily available to the public for the extraordinary price of $50 000AUD.\nAvailable to all, capable of limitless missions, the HyperQube will be the best orbiting platform for the surging space-enabled data market.* With a new space economy springing up, this unit will be able to conduct a greater variety of tasks than similarly sized, less powerful satellites. \nEarly motherboard prototypes of the HyperQube\nThe HyperQube encrypts incoming and outgoing data with the best in industry standards \u2013 AES-256bit, Serpent 256bit & TwoFish 256bit on all incoming and outgoing data with absolutely no interruption to operations.\nMost satellites have little to no encryption system in place, a worrying trend given the expected growth in orbitals and their applications. With HyperQube, your data will be scanned and encrypted through your browser, which is then sent to our master servers. From there, the data is compressed and encrypted further, making sure it's safe to send. It is then transferred to the ground-stations for transmission. The whole process is fast, easy and safe.\nFunding will allow further testing of shielding and on-board redundancies to ensure smooth operation in space.\nIn the heart of the HyperQube lies 6 Weebill Atom X1 motherboards working together as one, otherwise known as the X6. The Atom X1 is based of the 64bit ARM architecture and has been tested and proven for reliability and low-energy requirements. The X6 features 24-cores at 1.6GHz and 12GB of high-performance DDR3 RAM. That's up to 700GFLOPS of processing power available from a 10cm\u00b3 satellite. Something unheard of until now.\nThe heart of the HyperQube, the Weebill Atom X1 Mark II & III\nThe HyperQube will be powered by atomOS, our non-embedded Linux-based distribution built from the ground up. It provides a hardened operating system built for security, stability and speed. The OS will be released once the HyperQube has flown at least once. Regular security patches will be updated over the air, ensuring the HyperQube will always be the the most secure satellite out there.\nBackers will also receive a copy of the Weebill Ground Control application. Allowing you to check on the satellite's location and status, see the latest images, check on development updates and much more. \nWeebill ATOM X6 ARM CPU - 24 Cores @ 1.6GHz \n12GB DDR3 RAM\nAES - Serpent - TwoFish 256bit encryption on all communications \nNext-Generation S-Band communication systems \n1.2TB SSD \n2x 35mm 13MP 4K Cameras \n1U High Efficiency Solar Panels (28% Efficiency)\nLifetime in space (Without propulsion): 6-12 months. \nEarly prototype of the HyperQube running completely on its internal power.\nThe HyperQube is versatile machine, with an open-ended design that can support a variety of functions both in communication with the ground and autonomously. The CubeSat can be deployed for single purpose or mixed missions. For those who purchase the CubeSat, or obtain time on it as a perk, a HyperQube will allow you to:\nPerform complex calculations and see the results\nAccess the camera for photos and videos\nObtain data from sensors\nConduct scientific research\nSupport games in orbit\nDid we miss something? Send your idea to us and if we can do it, we will!\nAfter successful funding, the Weebill HyperQube will be available to the public from July 2017 on our website for $50 000AUD. \nCompanies are recognizing the wide application of space-enabled data, and consequently, the new commercial uses of space itself. Financial technology start-ups are nibbling into the transaction flows of legacy banks. They are matching lenders with borrowers, distributing pay via mobile phones, and flocking to niches existing banks are prevented from servicing. Weebill represents an early-to-market solution for a domain where regulated banks don't currently dominate. It has the ability to conduct transactions on a highly encrypted platform. As the nature of banking changes and splinters, Weebill will be positioned to service the flow of transactions including Bitcoin and digital currency Hyper Ledger.\nBut the business uses for the HyperQube aren't just limited to banking.  A few others are:\nShort and and medium term off-the-grid and secure data storage\nEncrypted communications\nEvent monitoring (Space weather and Earth weather)\nEarth Remote Sensing (Real-time magnetometer observations, real-time Geiger counter observations and more)\nThe Weebill Atom X1 Mark II\nCurrently, our demonstrator mission can be ready for the launch to Low Earth Orbit with spectrum access available by January 2017. The launch window is between February - July 2017. If Weebill raises the $AUD230,000 needed for the first launch, a powerful new tool will become a reality for the space-faring public. The HyperQube\u2019s applications are limited only by your imagination.\nMy name is Gavrilo \"Gav\" Koncar. I'm the founder of Weebill. I believe that the advances in computing that have revolutionised communication will soon redefine define space, opening up the frontier to individuals in a way unthinkable only a few years before. I believe space activity will soon be in everyone\u2019s hands. Weebill will make that possible. \nWeebill was founded in 2014 with the simple goal of placing an imaging telescope in space. After a few months had passed, we decided that the marketplace for imaging devices was already well-served. But in our design-phase we came upon something: inside the core of the telescope was one of the most powerful motherboards designed for space. Since then we have focused on perfecting the board and making it available on a mass scale, with one core belief; space needs to be open, secure and available to many. \nOur team includes Dr Jason Held as our principle adviser. Jason is a former US Army expert in military space missions. Jason's experience with the Hubble and International Space Station provides Weebill Space Systems with connections to other manufacturers and partners within the industry as well as direct contact to various government organisations.\nOur primary satellite engineer is Dusan Djordjevic, who holds a dual bachelors in Science and Engineering.\nSo, what's in the name? The smallest bird in Australia is the Weebill. It's an extremely nimble creature, fast and more than able to thrive alongside Australia's larger, louder species. Weebill Space Systems is also a native of Australia. We develop our technologies in the same spirit: small, nimble and incredibly effective. All our products are designed and created in Melbourne, Australia.\nMission Control is supplied by Saber Astronautics. The founders represent a wide array of backgrounds and capabilities, combining traditional space engineering, and military space operations. Their engineers helped develop the Hubble Space Telescope and International Space Station. Saber is based in Sydney and Denver.\nOur primary rocket launch contractors are AU Aerospace, who specialize in CubeSat launches. They're based in Adelaide.\nThe build of the satellite itself will be in-house here in Melbourne, Australia while extensive testing will occur at UNSW Space Research Facility in Canberra. This will be done multiple times to ensure a maximum chance of success. \nOf the funding sought, $AUD55,000 will be used for the production of the first HyperQube. The launch window (February 2016 - July 2017) is expected to cost $AUD50,000. There is an additional cost of $AUD75,000 for insurance of the launch and $AUD20,000 for mission control by Saber Astronautics. Regulatory changes in Australia may soon favor small satellite launches, which may possibly reduce costs, as well.\nThe same technological progress that has seen computers shrink from room-sized boxes, to desktop units and finally, to smart phones, is now changing space. The space age will finally be in everyone\u2019s reach. Help make Weebill\u2019s HypeQube a reality. Be a part of the future. \n*Subject to any applicable export control restrictions", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is the risk radiation interferes with the HyperQube's computing functions. We will test the CubeSats circuitry in space-like conditions at UNSW Canberra before launch. The funding we are seeking will cover the laboratory testing cost needed for maximum assurance of space-readiness.\n\nIt's possible there will be communication problems with the HyperCube, which can lead to a loss of the high-speed communications systems. Our backup UHF system will be in place for this specific situation and can be used to diagnose and restart the communications in full speed.\n\nThe HyperQube could fail to function upon launch. If that happened, it would likely be possible to collect data which could help advance a follow-on mission. In the event that the rocket carrying the HyperQube fails, insurance could reimburse company for the cost - providing funding for a second attempt.\n\nPlease understand that space is extremely difficult and unpredictable in regards to satellites operating.

The story follows Daniel Grey and the events behind the disappearance of his brother and friends. Remote addresses several key themes and important issues in our society, including missing persons, the dangers of social media, addiction, obsession, and the profound impact of deep personal loss. We have assembled a diverse, experienced, passionate team that is both eager and committed to this project.\nThis film is the first chapter in a much larger universe, The Red String Theory. This complex storyline was first conceived of in 2011 by Dakota R. Kuhlman. Dakota founded Exit Reality Entertainment in the summer of 2015, with the goal of bringing Remote and The Red String Theory to a wide audience. Exit Reality Entertainment is a young, dedicated, media production company with the goal of bringing entertaining, original media to film, the web, and print.\nWe are currently in the final stages of pre-production. We have the team, the cast, the screenplay, and the budget. Our team is ready and excited to make the jump to production.\nTHE MOVIE - SYNOPSIS\nRemote is a psychological thriller and independent film with underlying elements of comradery and humor. The story introduces the character Daniel Grey, who is compelled to perform his own investigation after the disappearance of his brother and friends. During this investigation, he discovers a series of disturbing, unsolved cases too similar to be coincidence. Daniel Grey receives a call from Charles Dawson, a realtor, who informs him there may be a link between one of his listings and the missing students. The film reveals the shocking and sometimes hilarious events that take place leading up to the disappearance of Daniel's brother and friends.\nABOUT OUR CAMPAIGN\nOur production budget for Remote is $25,000. By achieving this goal, we can move forward and begin production in early June.\nWe decided the best way to fund Remote is in two iterations: production and post production. We have chosen this approach so we can begin principal filming as soon as possible and to ensure an accurate, post-production budget.\nThis Kickstarter campaign only covers the production stage of this film. If the community likes our project, we hope to cover post-production costs later this year through a second, smaller campaign.\nWe have designed a solid production budget that cuts all possible costs without sacrificing production quality. The Exit Reality Entertainment team has opted-out of any payment for the film - we are not paying ourselves from this campaign. We have diligently polished and reduced our budget to it\u2019s lowest possible level. Our total production costs are approximately $17,000, excluding the cost of running this crowdfunding campaign. Ultimately, there are some costs we simply cannot cut.\nThis is our most ambitious project. However, we believe this story is worth telling and that we can deliver a great film - which is why we\u2019re asking for your help in the development of this film.\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN\nOur costs are broken down into nine major categories: equipment, essential personnel, location and legal, craft services, props and set design, hair and makeup, contingency, incentive costs, and crowdfunding fees.\nSome of our costs have been mitigated and delayed. Specifically, we are hiring three essential outside personnel who are willing to delay the bulk of their payment. While we still need to rent or purchase some equipment, we are borrowing what we can from within our network. We are even opting to build our own jib, rails, dolly, frame, slider and other rigs.\nWe have reduced other costs, such as hair, makeup, props, and set design to their bare minimum.\nWe believe we have a realistic, accurate, and frugal budget for this production, and are taking every opportunity to minimize costs, while also ensuring the quality of the film.\nMEET THE TEAM \nWe\u2019ve hand-picked a fantastic, talented team for this project. Our team is both committed and capable of producing a compelling film. We are all very grateful and excited to work on this project.

Over the next several years, we will release a series of films within the larger universe of The Red String Theory.\nThe Red String theory follows the interconnected storylines of several individuals and revolves around the concept of predetermined circumstances. As the characters develop, they all eventually discover they are not there by chance. In fact, they should not be there at all.\nThe Red String Theory follows three families through stories of hidden political agendas, power struggles, military conspiracy, global affairs, and the manipulation and control of human experience.\nEverything you\u2019ve done, everything you believe, is a result of the choices you\u2019ve made in the past. This is the undeniable truth. But is everything you believe a result of actions within your control? Is it possible that the choices you have made - the choices that have brought you down this path to where you are today - were designed and intentionally placed in front of you by an unseen person, one with a hidden agenda? What if every choice you\u2019ve made has been designed and orchestrated. Not predestined, but predetermined, calculated, implemented.\nAfter three generations of these families, three young individuals discover that their very existence is due to events that took place framed within this illusion of choice. As this discovery is made, a dark plot unfolds to transform the entire world that they know into something different.\nThe question remains: if every choice you ever made was predetermined, how can you stop the inevitable?\nOUR REWARDS\nWe thought about our incentives carefully.\nOur incentives are designed to be engaging, to provide additional insight into our characters and story, to give credit where credit is due, and to be unique, handcrafted, and personal. Our incentives also needed to provide value and involve you, our supporters, while also limiting the need to inflate our production budget - and consequently our total Kickstarter goal. We believe we have accomplished all of this.\nIn addition to our unique incentives, we are also including some traditional incentives, such as the digital and physical movie and soundtrack, along with movie memorabilia.\nOur favorites incentives include:\n$5: Special Thanks Credit in the Film! \n$10: Behind-the-Scenes Production Journal and Q&A\u2019s Access \n$25: Digital Download of Full Original Soundtrack by Phantom Noise *recommended* \n$50: Live Stream of Production, Pre-Release Digital Premiere, Custom Missing Person\u2019s Flyer \n$75: Memorabilia Package \n$125: Bizarre Skype Call from Mr. Vice, Personalized Thank You Video \n$175: Vinyl Figure Character Collectable \n$250: Your Missing Persons Poster in the Movie! \n$300: Incorporate an Easter Egg in the Film\nA full list of our incentives is also listed on the right sidebar of this page.\nWe hope you enjoy the incentive options. We put a lot of time and thought into them and would love to hear from you.\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nTHANK YOU for reading about Remote and getting to know us and the scope of this project. This project, like anything worth doing, is difficult, but we are very excited to be a part of it. Remote and The Red String Theory are stories we want to share with the world.\nTo make this movie happen, we just need your support.

Thank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS & CHALLENGES\n\nAs with any film production or entrepreneurial endeavor, there is an element of risk - both to the producers and the financiers. There will be challenges we must overcome, some which are expected (and that can be planned for), and others that may arise without notice.\n\nRisk to this project include: underestimating our budget, scheduling conflicts, breach of contract, film delays, conflicts within the team, copyright protection, successful distribution and audience reach, and of course, not achieving our Kickstarter goal.\n\nWe believe our budget is tuned to near perfection, and should sufficiently cover production, with post-production funding to come later. We\u2019ve done our best to factor in the cost of this Kickstarter campaign and all production costs while keeping a modest 10% contingency fund of our budget before factoring in crowdfunding costs.\n\nOther challenges will have to be solved if they arise, and will be mitigated by clear contracts, prudence, good team communication, and advanced planning.\n\nIn examining the risk to you, our supporters, there is the risk of non-delivery, delays in production, and delays in shipping. We believe we\u2019ve taken all possible steps to mitigate these risks.\n\nThis project will be completed.\n\nWe have a team extremely committed to this project, as can be seen in our Kickstarter video. To show our progress, we will post weekly video updates, announcements on our production journal, and social media updates.\n\nWe will monitor and allocate our funds closely to ensure they are spent only where needed and pre-allocated, and that spending is done so frugally. To ensure this, we are requiring approval from two of the following positions: Executive Producer, Operations Manager, and Finance Director.\n\nLastly, there is the risk that our incentives may be delayed. Unfortunately, this is a common issue on crowdfunding platforms. We are taking steps to ensure we meet our projected timeline by planning deadlines for incentive production, setting internal shipping deadlines, developing content-delivery systems, significantly overestimating our delivery dates, and delegating responsibilities.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Exit Reality Entertainment\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nExit Reality Entertainment is a small, media production company, focusing on the creation of film and digital media.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "ANNOUNCEMENT: Our New Campaign", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nWe'd like to thank you for backing our project here on Kickstarter.

The problem is...SOCIAL MEDIA! Dating is already difficult and staying in a relationship is even harder. \nThe #1 dating disaster is being ignored while on a date because someone is twifing (twifing is the act of using social media, e.g., twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, or facebook just to name a few), it makes you feel like a second fiddle to a smartphone. Social media is also a major factor in the increase of divorces. Google \"social media prenups\" you will be surprised. \nTwifless is the first and only matchmaking dating app based on interests and social media usage. If you prefer someone who's online no more than 5 hours a day you can select that, but if you prefer someone who spends less than an hour online, you can request that too! We use a \"twifometer\" algorithm that will compare the chemistry between individuals with emphasis on the time spent on social media. Understand, we are not eliminating social media users from the app, everyone is welcomed because we all use social media one way or another, including our team. It can be for communicating with someone in another country while traveling, apps for Security/Protection (Home alarms), Savings (Digital Coupons), or simply signing up to see those adorable baby photos everybody wants you to see...you know what we're talking about. Being the best dating app in this digital world is our only goal, by arranging successful long term relationships and instant proximity dating opportunities. The beauty of this niche...social media is not limited to just the U.S., the frustration of twifing while on a date or in a relationship is being felt around the world.\nOur matching leads you to see eye to eye.\nTHE BENEFITS OF TWIFLESS.  \n1.
