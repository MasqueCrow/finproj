So, it\u2019s time to move the goalposts: Let\u2019s raise $350,000 and we'll build a screening room !!!\nMovie Madness is a Portland institution. Known for its vast collection, knowledgeable staff, and display cases full of legendary film props, the iconic Belmont storefront has a deserved reputation as one of the best video stores in the country.\nBut now Movie Madness is in danger of closing forever. The Hollywood Theatre has the chance to purchase Movie Madness and fold it into our nonprofit, ensuring that this invaluable collection remains available to Oregonians for years to come. We must raise $250,000 by November 10 or Movie Madness will close and the collection will be sold.\nWith your help, we can save this important piece of Portland\u2019s culture and ensure its collection of 80,000+ titles remains accessible to movie lovers everywhere.\nMovie Madness was founded in 1991 by Mike Clark. Mike is now ready to retire - and he\u2019s offered the Hollywood Theatre the chance to acquire his beloved business for $250,000. (The collection alone was recently appraised at $585,000.)\nIf we succeed in raising our goal, the Hollywood Theatre will buy Movie Madness - the business and the 80,000+ title collection - and transition it into our nonprofit. We will continue to rent the Belmont storefront for the foreseeable future, and Mike will continue to display his remarkable collection of film props in the store\u2019s film museum. We will also retain the store\u2019s current employees.\nThe Hollywood is the right organization to buy Movie Madness and ensure its long-term survival. We\u2019ve lovingly restored our 1926 movie palace, and opened our new microcinema at Portland International Airport. We brought 70mm film presentation back to Portland. And we\u2019re a thriving nonprofit with 3,200+ members who believe in our mission of preserving and promoting the art of film.\nBy acquiring Movie Madness, we\u2019re not trying to save a dying business model - we\u2019re going to help it evolve by rethinking the role it plays in the community.\nWe\u2019ll expand our popular membership program to include benefits at Movie Madness. \nWe\u2019ll explore community engagement opportunities through construction of a new screening room and the development of new partnerships. \nWe\u2019ll partner with Free Geek to provide affordable access to VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray players. \nWe\u2019ll continue to preserve and grow the collection, adding new releases and found treasures to ensure that Movie Madness remains a \u201cliving collection\u201d that reflects the diverse interests and perspectives of the community it serves.\nWe\u2019ve already secured a $90,000 grant from the James F. and Marion L. Miller Foundation to provide two years of operating support for the project, contingent on this campaign succeeding. We are prepared to invest time, energy, and money into this project to ensure the long-term viability of Movie Madness.\nThe single most important reason for acquiring Movie Madness is to keep its extensive collection accessible to the public. A collection of this size is an irreplaceable cultural resource.\nThere are 80,000+ titles in the Movie Madness collection. In 2016, according to Variety, Amazon had 18,405 movies and 1,981 TV shows; Netflix had 4,563 movies and 2,445 TV shows; and Hulu had 6,656 films and 3,588 television shows. (Read more about Netflix\u2019s \u201cabominable selection of classic cinema\u201d in this recent Newsweek article.) Movie Madness has twice as many titles available as all three platforms combined.\nStreaming services offer only the illusion of choice. In reality, their constantly shifting lineup is dictated by studio licenses and distributor contracts, with titles subject to vanishing without notice.\nAdditionally, plenty of movies never make it to these services in the first place. Whenever there is an industry transition to a new format, movies are left behind - obscure and cult titles rarely make the cut.\nThese movies are not just entertainment - they represent diverse perspectives in a time when diverse voices are sorely needed in public discourse, and provide snapshots into our cultural history that can enlighten our present. By acquiring the Movie Madness collection, we\u2019ll keep these titles available to the public, and we\u2019ll make sure that the rare and one-of-a-kind titles in the collection are preserved.\nPledge today, and help us keep this irreplaceable community resource alive.\nWe're excited to offer some unique rewards in return for your support!\nFor $25, you can get your hands on a wool felt pennant in either the Movie Madness or Hollywood Theatre design. For $35, we've got some beautiful enamel pins, designed exclusively for this Kickstarter project. For $40, you can wear your support with pride with our Movie Madness \u201cVHS\u201d tee, and for $50, our glow-in-the-dark \"Frankie\" tee.\nNew! For $75, we\u2019re offering a limited-edition 18\u201dx24\u201d screenprinted poster, featuring prominent films from the Movie Madness collection and plenty of easter eggs for Movie Madness fans. Illustrated by Jolby & Friends and printed by Seizure Palace.\nFor $80, you\u2019ll get two tickets to A Night With Todd Haynes, an exclusive double feature of BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS and a newly restored, doll-themed rarity (the title of which we\u2019re not at liberty to mention). Both films will be presented in 35mm and the evening will be hosted by director Todd Haynes! We\u2019ll even throw in popcorn and two beverages per person.\nWe're also excited to offer new ways for our community to get involved with Movie Madness. For $100, you can select a film from their 80,000+ collection to be sponsored indefinitely under a name of your choosing (availability permitting). For $150, choose five movies to be featured in Movie Madness\u2019 Community Picks section - with recommendations provided by you. Your picks will be featured for one month.\nNew! For $400, we'll screen your favorite film from the Movie Madness collection in our *new* screening room! Once we finish construction, you\u2019ll be among the first to enjoy Southeast Portland\u2019s newest community space. Invite 15-20 of your closest friends for a private pizza party with complimentary pizza provided by Sizzle Pie.\nFor 25 lucky backers who pledge $500, we're handing over our marquee for you to display a personalized message. Why not use our marquee to surprise a friend and grab a photo! We'll choose a date together, and display your message from 11pm through 2pm the following day.\nFor $1,000 we're offering two tickets to a backers-only movie-themed dinner with award-winning local chef Naomi Pomeroy at her restaurant, Beast.\nFor $2,500, we'll walk you and 16 friends through airport security and screen a movie of your choosing at our PDX microcinema (schedule permitting). For $5,000, we'll screen your favorite movie for you and your friends at the Hollywood Theatre (schedule permitting).\nAnd if that's not enough, for $10,000, we'll screen 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, or WEST SIDE STORY in 70mm for you and 383 of your friends at the Hollywood Theatre (schedule permitting).\nWe'd like to thank Mike Clark for bringing this unique opportunity to us, for his all his generosity and hard work, and for his trust in the team at the Hollywood Theatre. We'd also like to thank the staff at Movie Madness (our future co-workers, we hope!) for their collaboration and enthusiasm for this project.\nThanks also to Todd Haynes for agreeing to host our very special double feature, Naomi Pomeroy and the staff at Beast for offering to host our backer dinner, Blue Chalk for our incredible project video (featuring Joaquin Lopez and Anahelena Goodman-Flood\u2014thank you!), Scarecrow Video for their advice and insights, Nate Ashley for his tireless work designing our campaign reward materials, and Andy McMillan for assisting with this Kickstarter project and managing our reward fulfillment.\nThank you also to Alison Hallett and Kristy Conrad for their extra effort on this Kickstarter campaign, and the rest of our office and theatre staff for their hard work day in and day out, our board for their steadfast guidance, and all 3,200+ Hollywood Theatre members for their support.\n\u201cMovie Madness is a place where a love of movies is completely and totally evident. An entire consummate encyclopedic collection of rare and obscure titles goes away if Movie Madness goes away. It would be not just the loss of an extraordinary collection, but a loss of a place that is a real, breathing tribute to the love of movies. It keeps you excited about the world to discover places like this.\u201d\n\u2014 Todd Haynes, Film Director & Hollywood Theatre Board Member \n\u201cThe Movie Madness library that the Hollywood Theatre would like to absorb is one of the most amazing collections of cinema archaeology that I have ever seen and it is very important that it be saved. This is a very worthy endeavor - give money to this project!\u201d\n\u2014 Gus Van Sant, Film Director\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine better bastions of film and TV history combining forces to create a whole new entertainment future for Portland than the Hollywood Theatre and Movie Madness. It\u2019s going to be tough to decide which one to spend more time in!\u201d \n\u2014 Tim Williams, Executive Director, Oregon Film\n\u201cUnparalleled in its breadth, depth, and genuine quirkiness, Movie Madness is the keeper of an important legacy. So much of the classic cinema behind its doors just isn\u2019t available anywhere else. Like a library, Movie Madness looks to enhance the future by preserving the past. I offer my full support to Hollywood Theatre and its effort to serve Portlanders, now and into the future, by preserving Movie Madness as a treasure for everyone to enjoy.\u201d \n\u2014 Vailey Oehlke, Director of Libraries, Multnomah County Library\n\u201cTruly great independent video stores with a collection of this size are an incredible asset for cinephile research and study. We can\u2019t tell you how many films have slipped into a copyright and/or distribution morass - there are many instances where a collection of early commercial releases like this is your only chance to see something exceptionally rare and unique. To lose such an incredible community resource would be heartbreaking.\u201d \n\u2014 Todd Wiener, Motion Picture Archivist, UCLA Film & Television Archive", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a community-supported nonprofit, we have a wealth of experience delivering on large-scale fundraising and crowdfunding efforts, having previously raised significant funds to bring 70mm film presentation back to Portland and managed multiple projects to restore our 1926 movie palace, including a prior Kickstarter to revive our marquee.\n\nWe've worked closely with Mike Clark to develop a transition plan for Movie Madness. He\u2019s ready to hand over the reins and we're ready to take them. At first, there will be no significant change to day-to-day operations at Movie Madness. Gradually, we'll begin to expand membership, begin work on the new screening room, etc.\n\nIf we don't raise the money, we don't buy the business.

Siuda", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "  Scroll to the bottom to see what people are saying about AURORA!\n  Help us finish our unique film!  \nPoster by graphic novel legend Dave McKean (Arkham Asylum, The Sandman)\n    Aurora is a unique 30-minute film inspired by the mantra: \"What if Alejandro Jodorowsky created a Twilight Zone episode?\"\nA \"creature feature\" art-film homage to Universal Monsters and 1950s westerns, all the puzzle pieces are now on the table, we just desperately need help to pull everything together.  With your support, this movie can be completely finished before the end of the year!\nSilent cinema, Hammer Horror, psychic science, and UFOs.\nMy friends John Terendy (cinematographer), Aaron Shaps (my co-writer and co-director), and I grew up on Fortean Times, Man Myth & Magic, and Chariots of the Gods? and love weird UFO history, so we decided to take a little-known historical record, pull it as far into the realms of conspiracy theories as possible, and then bring it back until it matched what we know today.  It was exciting to write an absolutely outlandish story where, if you check it against the news reports from the past century, everything lines up.  Read on to see what bizarre liberties we took with the story of...\nThe first documented UFO crash in American history. \nIt is widely believed that Roswell, New Mexico is the site of the first UFO crash in American history- but that distinction actually goes to a small town in Texas. According to an historical account reported in the local newspaper, early in the morning on April 17, 1897, the residents of Aurora (located just outside of Fort Worth) were awakened by a loud explosion as an inexplicable airship crashed to Earth\u2013six years before the first flight of the Wright Bros, and 40 years before the town even had electricity. A body was found at the site and buried in an unmarked grave in the town cemetery, the wreckage was thrown into a deep well, and a legend was born.\nSignal Service officer T. J. Weems, the military presence at the site, was coincidentally (or not) an expert in Astronomy and reported that the creature was a Martian. The well water where the wreckage was reportedly dumped appeared to be tainted in some way from that point forward, causing strange afflictions. Almost 80 years later in the 1970s, a grave widely believed to be that of the unknown pilot was robbed before the body could be exhumed by university scientists, and a fragment of metal unearthed in Aurora defied scientific explanation.  \nAll this leads to the question:\nWhat crashed in Aurora, Texas, in 1897?\n  A popular conspiracy theory is that German scientists developed an antigravity engine in the 1940s that powered a saucer-shaped craft called Die Glocke, or \"the bell,\" and that these test flights were responsible for the increase in UFO sightings in that era.  I won't go into detail here, but a google search will open up a Pandora's box of theories- including that the experimental craft was capable of inter-dimensional and time travel.  What if they were right?  What if the 1940s and the 1897 UFO sightings were connected?\nThe Fledermaus Pilot.\nOur first step was designing the suit for the test pilot for Die Glocke; he would need to be alien and elegant, and we needed a visionary to conjure our retro-futuristic fashion. Brom is high among the most celebrated artists in the world of Fantasy (in 2013 his thirty-year career was honored with the prestigious Spectrum Grand Master award), and he's also one of the genuinely nicest men I know.  To design the costume for Die Glocke's test pilot\u2013from an elite division of pilots known as Fledermaus, or \"bat\"\u2013I gave Brom one direction: imagine if 1930s sportscar maven Ettore Bugatti were designing a deep-sea diving suit.  And to construct the suit with an eye towards hypersensual fetishism, we needed someone rooted in fashion over costuming\u2013the atelier Ritual crafted the perfect embodiment of our vision and Brom\u2019s design.\nNothing says \"1897\" like a Nazi in a black leather space suit.\nThe creature.\nThe inter-dimensional travels of Die Glocke attracted the attention of a rare and peculiar cryptid-style creature we affectionately named Pango; to create this extra-dimensional cryptid SyFy Face Off winners Rayce Bird and J. Anthony Kosar envisioned a bear-pangolin hybrid and Rayce's team brought him to life using masterful skills in creating time-tested practical effects.\nFinal concept sketch before production\n  Production painting by Symbolist painter Gail Potocki\n  Before construction, Rayce used a computer to 3-D model the suit\n  Pango during the sculpting process\n    Jack Campbell starred in the two most-watched programs in Australian television history: the internationally acclaimed series Underbelly: Razor as the notorious legend of Sydney's 1920s underworld \"Big Jim\" Devine, and the award-winning All Saints as the romantic Dr. Steve Taylor. I met with Jack the day he moved here from Australia, and he's the finest leading man I could imagine to portray the gravitas of a soldier thrust into the cauldron of one of the greatest mysteries of the late 19th century.\nThe Aurora screenplay was specifically written with English film, television, and theatre actor Robert Boulter in mind. He's best known for a recurring role as Kieron Fletcher on the BBC series Casualty, turns in the theatre productions Mercury Fur and Citizenship, and the film Donkey Punch. Boulter's meticulous stagecraft delivers the subtle, magnetic intensity needed to humanize a complicated character, delivering a performance reminiscent of legendary silent film star Conrad Veidt. \nBehind-the-scenes photos of the filming of Aurora... To learn more click here: https://www.aurorafilm.info/blog\n  No one on the planet is better equipped to conjure the tones needed to create an alien language than visionary artist Genesis P-Orridge. From honors including being named the legendary \"Godperson of Industrial Music,\" founding the psychedelic, world-shaking band Psychic TV and their most recent incarnation PTV3, and changing the minds of magicians and artists everywhere as a visionary cultural engineer, Genesis is comfortable moving through dimensions other than this earthly plane. Utilizing cut-up techniques inspired by William S. Burroughs, Genesis provides the voice of the creature.\nThe eerie and jarring moments on the soundtrack are the work of two of my favorite musicians on the planet: the unearthly sounds of elegant avant-garde thereminist Armen Ra, and experimental rock drummer Brian Viglione (Nine Inch Nails, Dresden Dolls, Violent Femmes).\nThe gorgeous orchestrations that completely bring Aurora to life were created by composer Troy Sterling Nies; his work for the H. P. Lovecraft Society is equal parts terrifying and heartbreakingly beautiful. Tying all the music together is production master Joe Cassidy of the Belfast-founded band Butterfly Child and Shepard Fairey's L.A. art project N\u00d8ISE.\n \nIn our case, we envisioned a certain kind of movie: Black and white. Western. Science Fiction. Cryptid-style monster. UFOs. Twilight Zone-style anthology. These are all subjects that are a lot of fun and have a lot of artistic integrity, but not much commercial appeal to a larger studio. If you love the things on this list as much as I do, supporting us on Kickstarter is how we can finish the film and make this unique story come to life, exactly as imagined and with NO artistic compromise.\n  All the money raised goes directly into the production and manufacturing of rewards.  There are also a number of post-production steps including taking our edit into a studio for what is called grading- where it's fixed to look right on every possible viewing platform- and the same step on the audio side, called mastering. Those are expensive steps, but necessary.  Many of the people on this page believed both in me and in this movie so much that they have generously deferred payment until we could run a Kickstarter- so we will hopefully have enough left over to get everyone caught up as well.  It would be impossible for this movie to be profitable, but without this Kickstarter campaign it will take another two years to get everything for this movie finished.\nAbove all else you get not only my deepest gratitude, but I can share that you'll have the appreciation of everyone involved with this project\u2013 there are an infinite number of pursuits more financially rewarding than being an artist, and our culture continues to move on a path where everything is available and everything is free- making the support of the people who want to experience the artwork more directly necessary than ever.  By helping us make this you also get the invisible badge of being someone who took part in an act of creation.  \nWhile that is both romantic and noble, my friends and I have all banded together to make it rewarding on the physical plane as well by making some very special objects.  Not all of the designs are finalized, but we promise that they will be gorgeous, tactile experiences that will exceed your expectations!\nTwo-disc sets (The movie and the soundtrack)\nSpecially-printed movie posters (Letterpress, varnish-layered offset)\nTintype photo facsimiles (Insanely cool 1897-style metal print photos)\nVinyl records (We will be going really far with this packaging.)\nT-shirts (High-quality screenprinted vintage-style tees)\nEnamel pin of the creature!\n\n    Please note: if you select the Complete Poster tier ($250) you will receive ALL the posters published- all 6 posters with text, and also any variant posters that we produce (up to 11 posters for $250!)\nWet-plate photographer Anton Orlov brought his 19th century camera to the set, and took photos of the cast and crew in the wild west setting. We'll reprint some of these onto metal plates with modern ink techniques so that you can hang on your wall perfect 8\" x 10\" facsimiles of the tintype photos- these look and feel just like the original metal plate photos!\nThe vinyl record and the wax cylinder will contain the sounds of Troy Sterling Nies, Genesis P-Orridge, Armen Ra, Brian Viglione, Andrew Dalziell, Joe Cassidy, and myself (Thomas Negovan).  I also did a TEDx talk on archaic technologies, so we will be releasing a song on wax cylinder that won't be available anywhere else*.\n*really.\n      I've always devoted my life to trying to encourage connection through art and stories. For over twenty years I've written books on history and art, and curated exhibitions of late 19th and early 20th century artworks of art and artists who have inspired much of today\u2019s popular culture. Researching fascinating history and finding ways to share those stories with the world in an exciting way\u2013 plus decades of hands-on contact with the finest relics from earlier eras\u2013 has helped me develop an intense sensitivity to aesthetics and visual art.\nFor my first art project exploring the 19th century, I gave a TEDx talk on archaic technologies back in 2011. \nAurora is the next step in that evolution.\nAs a kid, my two favorite shows were The Twilight Zone and The Rifleman. Now as a dad, I find myself wanting to create something that might inspire my son when he's a little bit older. With this project, I wanted to create something that had the excitement of the 1950s and 1960s television shows I watched in syndication on Sunday afternoons, but with an undercurrent that was absolutely modern.\nI can't articulate how grateful I am for everyone involved in this project, for their incredible support and creative energy. If I typed how much the people named here mean to me, the page would be overflowing with love.\nI hope that you are as excited about this film as I am, and just as excited for the posters and tintypes and records!

Siuda", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "\"Have courage to think for yourself! That is the motto of the Enlightenment.\"\n--Immanuel Kant, \"What is Enlightenment?\" 1784\nThree years ago, more than seven hundred backers successfully kickstarted a project to create a free college-level textbook in logic and critical thinking. And here it is, still free.\nSince then, I've received helpful critical comments from many students and teachers, for how to improve the text, or how to use it in high schools and other situations. And the place for rationality in the public sphere has changed. So it's time to create a second edition.\nWe now have a greater social need for a book like this.\nWe live in a social and cultural environment where \"alternative facts\", \"post truth\", and \u201cfake news\u201d, has replaced truth, snarkiness has replaced debate, and the word reality itself serves only to get attention for various artificial contrivances (\u201creality TV\u201d, \u201cvirtual reality\u201d, \u201creal fruit flavour!\u201d).\nUpdating this book, and getting it into as many hands as possible for the lowest possible price-- as low as completely free, for the students-- looks to me like one way I can do something about this.\nThis little book might not change the world. But it will change the education of a few hundred students every year. You can help make that happen, by backing this project, and sharing it with everyone you know.\nWe also still have the original problem.\nCommercially available textbooks are too expensive. Our first edition was free in its PDF edition, $0.99 on Kindle, and less than $8 for its print edition. The usual price of a college or university level intro-philosophy textbook runs to between $50 and $80. I still think that's too much-- especially given the other financial burdens that students today must bear.\nI would like to hire designers, editors, and contributors, and together produce an elegantly designed and professionally written textbook, without passing the production costs on to the students. So I'm turning to Kickstarter, and to you, for help.\nThe Book\nThe first edition covered the following topics, all of which need to be updated:\nQuestions, Problems, and World Views\nGood and Bad Thinking Habits\nBasics of Argumentation\nFallacies\nReasonable Doubt\nMoral Reasoning\nFor the second edition, I'm planning new chapters including:\nMedia literacy, propaganda, and disinformation.\nRhetoric and persuasion.\nScience and scientific method.\nOther topics as time and funding may allow, such as strategic reasoning, game theory, art and creativity, or health and wellness.\nAnd as a stretch goal, we will create an inclusive outline history of world philosophy. And it, too, will be published electronically for free, and in paperback for the lowest possible price.\nThe People Behind The Book\nAll the writers and contributors who worked on the first edition are back on board for the second. We all have Ph.Ds in philosophy, and we all have 10-15 years of teaching experience each, at colleges and universities in Canada, the United States, and Europe.\nAnd, as with the first edition, I will engage the services of Winter-Hebert Design Studio, for the cover and the interior layout.\nThe Backer Rewards\nObviously, you'll get the book itself, and an accompanying set of PowerPoint slides. Backers at higher levels will receive copies of my other books, and a chance to chat with me, in focus groups or via Skype, about the book and what you think should go in it.\nMy novels-- also fully funded by Kickstarter!\n  And if we raise more than our target?\nAt $6,000, I will bring more writers and contributors into the project, so we can plan more chapters. And I will audio-record myself reading Socrates' Apology, as a dramatic performance, and publish it on YouTube and as an audio-book. (Besides philosophy, I also have a drama degree, and I've always wanted to do this. In fact I'm already rehearsing.)\nAt $10,000, I will continue to hire more contributors, and we will create a free outline history of world philosophy, and publish it as a separate book. Backers at all levels will receive the electronic edition; and backers who get a print copy of the logic book will have the option of receiving the history book instead. Backers who pledge $75 or more will have the option to get both books.\nAbove and beyond: I will pay for more contributors, and if funds allow then I will commission a French language translation.\nThe Budget\nRemuneration to writers and contributors: $ 2,500\nCover design & interior layout: $ 800\nEditor: $ 500\nPrinting and shipping books and backer rewards: $1,200*\nSubtotal: $ 5,000\nKickstarter's cut, and bank fees: $ 400 (8% of subtotal)\nFinal total: $ 5,400.**\n*Estimate for 100 books, mostly sent to Canada & the USA.\n**Yes, my Kickstarter target is slightly less than the budget. I will cover the extra costs personally.\nThe Production Schedule\nKickstarter campaign: Jan 24 - Feb 22.\nFirst draft complete and sent to focus groups: June 2017.\nReception of comments from focus groups: July 2017.\nFinal version of text complete: August 2017\nDesign work complete: October 2017.\nBacker rewards start shipping: November 2017.\nIf we reach our stretch goal of $ 10,000, then we will aim to have the history book ready for the backers by December of 2017.\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVery few.

At the center of culture is food: This is a sacred element which connects family with neighbors, friends, and distant relatives across generations. In our country, we get to enjoy neighborhood Italian or Chinese restaurants, where patrons re-connect with what was the glue for grandparents and their parents before them. Yet, where are our First Peoples foods and accompanying restaurants? What is the Indigenous cuisine that weaves together and builds our original nations of the Lakota, Ojibwa, Iroquois, or Yurok? How strong can culture be, without our Indigenous foods sustaining us, connecting us to our ancestors? \nToday, we have an opportunity to celebrate the historic foods of each North American region, starting with the foods of the Dakota and Ojibwa. Under the guidance of Chef Sean Sherman, Oglala Lakota from the Pine Ridge Reservation, the first all Indigenous Native American restaurant can become this sacred gathering place.\nOur First Nations mastered wild edibles, wild game and fish, and refined heirloom seeds that have been domesticated for centuries. With over 500 tribes across the country, these cultures and their accompanying flavors and food systems were diverse and rich. It is time for The Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen to become a gathering place for exceptional pre-colonial food, a culinary training center for Native peoples, and a new celebration of our American culture. \nBe a part of a new relationship with Indian Country. Sit at our table. Pass a bowl of bison with a chokecherry demi-glaze over wild greens. Drink a cup of cedar tea. We have a new history to write over a beautiful, perfect meal.\nMN State Fair Food Demo\n WHAT WE WANT\nThe Sioux Chef team wants your help to open the first all Indigenous restaurant featuring the foods of our region, namely the Minnesota and Dakota territories. These are the foods of many great cultures including the Ojibwe, Dakota, Lakota, Hidatsa, Arikara, Mandan, Cheyenne, Crow, Arapaho, Winnebago, Ho-Chunk and more!\nChef Sean Sherman is Oglala Lakota and was born on Pine Ridge Reservation in SD, and one day he asked, \"Why is it that you can find cuisine from all over the world in our many great cities, but not the food that comes from right under our feet, the food that is Native to our regions and the Indigenous Peoples?\" We want to change that and we want you to help us redefine Native American Foods for the modern world!\nChef Sean after teaching Indigenous Food Systems to youth from 51 Tribal Nations...\nOUR VISION\nAfter over a decade studying Indigenous food systems and working with tribes from across the country, Chef Sean along with his partner Dana Thompson, and their team are ready to open The Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen, the first Native American restaurant of its kind. Bringing back the ancient methods of food preparation over wood fire and open Comal grills, The Sioux Chef will be a healthy and authentic family style dining experience. \nBy raising $100K in equity, we would be able to leverage mission aligned, alternative financing. However, if we can excel beyond this target amount, our success will multiply allowing us to more quickly move towards sustainability including creating a wood fired cooking line, and removing a short term dependence of petroleum. If we are able to raise $150K-$250k, our capacity to leverage matching funds and secure low interest long term loans will allow us to purchase a building to house a sustainable, community space and lessen the inherent risk of the restaurant industry. We are actively searching buildings and locations under the careful guidance of real estate agents in the Minneapolis and St Paul metropolitan area. The more we raise, the less we will need in loans, and the greater our success and impact. This project will be our flagship restaurant with an opportunity to replicate in more regions to showcase the true regional diversity we have with our historical and cultural Native foods.\nChef Sean Foraging at Dusk\n THE SPACE WE ENVISION\nThe Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen is designed to be a community gathering place, requiring at least 4000 sq. ft. to seat a minimum of 100 people for lunch, dinner, and possibly brunch. Our vision includes a multi-use space including a meeting room and a garden, to help our customers with teaching and community experiences. Indigenous foods like native heirloom corn, squash, beans, sunflower, cedar, chokecherry, elderflower, crab apple, raspberry and fir will be showcased. The kitchen must be big enough to house our catering operation and create teaching opportunities. You can see a mock blueprint of our restaurant at this link.\nChef's Sean and Tashia Plating\nWHAT WE WILL INCLUDE WITH OUR RESTAURANT\nThe Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen, will be more than a restaurant. Through our existing catering and education business, we have been traveling around the world showcasing Indigenous food and providing teaching opportunities. We have worked with tribes and their youth, and fed elders in over twenty nations, have flown to India for the Slow Foods World Forum on Indigenous foods, Italy to cook at the James Beard American Restaurant at the World Fair Expo and New York City for the United Nations. \nWe have already established a brand that is based on combining the best of our Northern American Indigenous foods with community building. Consequently, our space will have community meeting space and room for Chef's Table. We will continue to partner with our existing network of other executive Native chefs, to hold dinners, which would celebrate and showcase the cuisines of other tribal regions. We will host weekly rotations of regional and national Native artists, singers, dancers, storytellers, poets, and chefs, connecting our cultures with food in the way they have always been linked and celebrated. We will continue to celebrate and showcase seasonal selection of Indigenous teas. Our outdoor space will be critical, complete with a patio and outdoor grill/Comal to share the traditional preparation of our foods.\nPlates from one of our numerous catering events...\n HOW WE PLAN TO SPEND THE MONEY\nThe funds raised will secure business loans and economic development funds to purchase a building within the Minneapolis / St Paul area.

With your help and patience, The Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen will become alive and lead the future of Native American cuisine to preserve and showcase the foods and culture of Midwest's Native Americans.\n\nRestaurants are notoriously risky enterprises. However, the national climate is ready for this concept, a deeper notion of farm to table, increasing the concept further, thinking woodlands to table, lake to table, prairie to table has existed for centuries and with our already established success within the marketplace we are ready to bring this back. We have been humbled by the attention of NPR, Art Culinaire, Thomas Keller's Finesse Magazine, Cowboys and Indians, The Guardian UK, Mic.com, 2015 Expo, and James Beard. Through this regional, national, and international support, we have grown a successful and profitable catering business to service international customers, while garnering over 10,000 followers on social media. \n\nWith your support, we can house this cusp of potential in the right location, in a rich urban Indian community of Minneapolis/St. Paul in a building designed for teaching, serving, and creating community. If our Kickstarter is unsuccessful in raising the minimum $100k we need to begin, then we will have to reassess our strategy and make a calculated decision, the more we raise above our goal, the more freedom we will have to create the space and extend our impact.\n\nFood is culture. It connects us in new and important ways. Come, be a part of The Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen. Experience Indian Country in ways that previously have been impossible. Invest in the next generation of Native chefs. Invest in a food concept that is innovating the field. Invest in more than farm to table. Invest in lake to table, woodlands to table, prairie to table. Invest in more sustainable practices and the wisdom of a People that continues to deepen our relationship with environment. Be a part of a movement. WOPILA.

The 2017 version!\nnearly entirely different from the previous calendar!\nLet's start at the beginning.\nI'm Dr. Dante Shepherd. For the past eight years, I've been producing Surviving The World, a daily photocomic with a chalkboard and labcoat and lessons touching on just about everything (science, literature, creeping people out, you name it). The comic is a mix of humor and education combined with complete destruction of the fourth wall. In my real life, I'm an actual professor, and in STW, I pretend to be.  And the comic is a whole lot funnier!\nOne of over 2800 STW comics\nPage-a-day calendars?\nWe previously made a page-a-day calendars for 2014 through a Kickstarter, and they came out friggin' amazing.  6.25 inches by 6.25 inches, weighty, full color, utterly beautiful.\nThe 2014 ones came out friggin' amazing. So let's make new ones for 2017! With new content!\nYou could plaster your door or your fridge with them.  You could plaster your dog with them.  The stand-alone content worked perfectly as a page-a-day calendar, and given that there are now over 2800 comics to choose from, you'll get a solid 365 days of content!\nNot only that, but these calendars will contain 50 ORIGINAL STW COMICS!  That's on top of pulling from the best of the previous 2800+ comics!\nLook at these beautiful pages! Let's do it again!\nAnd each page has other content to enjoy!  Besides a comic on each page you get:\n- a fake international holiday inspired by a real historical event for every single day of the year!\n- a rudimentary word-of-the-day, basically making your calendar two-calendars-in-one, but in this case, we reaffirm the quality of your present vocabulary!  Who needs to learn new words when you're already good at words!\n- a cloud name for each day of the year! Hurricane centers tell you what hurricanes are called and some weather channels tell you what winter storms are called, but this calendar goes even further and unilaterally tells you what the clouds themselves are named!\nWhat else?\nTo thank you for your contribution to the campaign, there are number of pretty cool rewards available at the different tiers, many of which will only be available through this Kickstarter. These rewards may even increase your happiness, which, hey, who doesn't want that?  \nWhat are some of these great rewards?\nWell, let's talk about them!\nRecognition on the Surviving the World site itself! (And you'll even get a nickname of questionable coolness!)\nA PDF form of the 2017 calendar!\nA hard copy of the 2017 calendar!\nA leftover hard copy of the 2014 calendar! \nMagnets depicting classic STW mazes to help hang up the pages of the calendar that you display!\nMaze for Magnet #1\nThe STW class report card printed on a whiteboard, for your own personal life assessment!\nInitial report card design!\nA STW-specialized black dry-erase board!\nA personalized mini-slate chalkboard with a permanent lesson, personalized for whatever subject matter you want!\nSomeone last time requested their slate lesson be about \"potatoes\"\nAn original maze painting on canvas, with colors of your choosing!\nI will even once again eat a pound of raisins (and hate every second of it and be utterly miserable in more ways than one that day), just like last time!\nThere are even crazy tier levels, like getting a ball of cat hair with your rewards, or having me draw a mustache on my face on every page!\nAnd may reward tiers include various combinations of these rewards!\nAnything else? \nActually, yes! There are a number of STW items which you can directly choose to include as a reward if you add it on to your backing tier. These can include additional calendars as well. First, select the reward tier that you're interested in, with the amount necessary to support the campaign at that tier. Then, make your donation an additional amount to reflect the add-on item that you wanted. This will cover the shipping of both items, too.\nThe pricing for the add-on items are as follows:  \nAn extra calendar = $25\nA set of 4 black-and-white STW mini-books containing lessons from the site, signed and personalized = $10\nA set of 12 STW squid-themed Christmas cards = $12\nA velociraptor USB containing over nearly 50 different velociraptor impressions = $15\nAn official STW labcoat = $40\nA signed official STW labcoat = $45\nStretch goals?\nIf we're fortunate enough to hit the target and keep on going from there, we will not only continue to improve the content of the calendar itself but also improve the content of the rewards that you receive!  So consider, if we break the following overall tiers:\n$27,500 \u2013 FLURRY OF CHALKDUST: the calendar will contain 12 new STW comics - ON TOP OF THE 50 ORIGINAL COMICS already part of the calendar!  So a total of 62 ORIGINAL COMICS!\n$30,000 \u2013 THE AUDIOBOOK: a digital recording of me reading the entire calendar will be provided to all backers\n$35,000 \u2013 THE SOUNDTRACK: a soundtrack listing to go with every calendar page will be provided to all backers\n$40,000 \u2013 REFRIGERATOR EXTRAVAGANZA: two additional magnets to the magnet set for every A-PLUS and higher level\n$45,000 - TO BE ANNOUNCED as we get closer \nSo fingers crossed!\nAll of this and all of that sounds awesome!\nI agree!

You will love these calendars!\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe calendar design is complete, and most of the content is already prepared.

Kickstarter-funded, finished, and delivered!\nThe gods and heroes of ancient times were only human.\nBut a little faster, a little stronger, a little wiser, than the rest of us.\nTime and history expanded the stories of their lives, transforming them into myth and legend-- transforming them into gods.\nPerhaps their descendants still walk among us.\nPerhaps you are one of them.\n\u201cThe Hidden Houses\u201d are the modern-day descendants of the gods of every mythology and culture on earth. Calling themselves the Secret People, or the Hiddenfolk, their ancestry gives them extraordinary talents and magical powers, but also an ancient struggle to control the last remaining places on Earth where the Mythic Age survives.\nPre-production image of characters from the novels: Maread MacBride and Aeducan Brigand.\nIt's a fairy tale. Your characters live in the 21st century. Yet they also live in places where cupboard doors open to magical gardens, fantastic creatures still stalk the night, and wizards invite people on adventures. Hidden in forests, mountain tops, caves, and even big city neighborhoods, the Freeholds, as such places are called, preserve what the world was like when the gods still walked among us.\nIt's a political thriller. Just as nations and corporations in the real world compete for control of sea ports and oil fields, your characters must struggle to protect their Freeholds from rival houses. The Hidden World has a \"Secret Commonwealth\" with democratic parliaments and an informal constitution; but the Lords of the many Freeholds still fight a \"cold war\" among themselves to protect and increase their territories. For without the Freeholds, your characters lose touch with their ancestral sources of power. They become ordinary mortals, or they die.\nPre-production image: Eric LaFlamme and Ildicoe Brigand, over the village of Fellwater.\nIt's based on the Kickstarter-funded fantasy fiction series Fellwater: The Hidden Houses, written by the same author. The game thus takes place in a rich and full world, with a long history for players to explore. You don't need to have read the books to enjoy the game. But the novels are included in some of the backer rewards. Reviewers on Amazon and other places have favourably compared the books to the work of Neil Gaiman and George R.R. Martin. These books are completely finished, and will be delivered immediately after the campaign succeeds!\nThe rules are designed to emphasize character customization, and mythology-inspired storytelling. Players create characters by choosing one each of the following:\nFour Sources: each is a wellspring of magical power and also a philosophical world view. Choose from The Earth, The Elements, The Mind, and The Divine.\nTwelve Lineages: the character's cultural background. Become a Kami, a Deva, a DeDannan, a Manitou, an Orisha, a Djinni, and more!\nSeven Paths. Play as an Agent, a Fighter, a Mystic, a Scholar, a Rascal, a Ranger, a Jack, or as any multiclassed combination!\nFour Seasons of the Soul, from the adventurous and innocent Spring, to the wise and battle-hardened Winter.\nThis makes over 1,300 possibilities for your character's basic identity. Once the game is underway, the player can multi-class in as many Paths as she wants, and learn Talents for each Path in almost any sequence. So the possibilities for unique characters are nearly endless.\nFinally, you can join (or opt out of joining) one of the Hidden Houses themselves-- the hundreds of sub-lineage family dynasties that rule the Freeholds of the Hidden World. Take this quiz to find out which House from the novels you should join!\nPre-production image: Siobhan Summercraft, Amergin DeDannan, Carlo DiAngelo, and \"a friend\".\nThe game's in-house engine is a skill-based system where players \"level up\" by raising their skills to certain thresholds, and learning Talents that belong to their chosen Paths. The rules take less than three minutes to learn, and are designed to keep as much dramatic tension and surprise in the game as possible. Moreover, the game will come with compatibility rules for popular game engines like Pathfinder, Apocalypse World, and d20. Download the 118-page preview document here to find out for yourself right now!\nThe game is finished. But it's not yet ready for release.\nThe text of the game is complete, and runs to more than 250 pages-- and that's without illustrations! But as an independent game designer and publisher, I know that players expect and deserve a professionally made product. Your contribution will allow me to pay for editors and proofreaders, hire experts to write compatibility notes for other game engines, as well as hire layout designers and artists. In fact more than half of the budget is for art and design. If the campaign is successful, I will bring in more artists, and if we reach our stretch goals we'll make as much of the art as we can in full colour.\nI'm the author of sixteen books, and a TED speaker, and twice a successful Kickstarter. By day I'm a philosophy prof at a local college. Having an M.A. and Ph.D in philosophy means that I understand logic, algorithms, cosmology and metaphysics, political theory and strategy, and the principles of mathematical game theory \u2013 perfect for designing an RPG system, as well as the larger world views and conflicts in which the characters find themselves. I've invented several games for use in my college classroom as teaching tools, one of which, Iron Age, my students encouraged me to publish. Check the backer rewards-- you can get that game here too! (In fact, if your backer level allows you one of the novels but you'd rather have this game, I'll be happy to send it instead.)\nAt the same time, from my B.A. in drama, I also understand narrative arcs and dramatic tension\u2013 perfect for world building, character design, and the like. On top of that, I\u2019ve also undertaken a lifelong study of mythology and folklore \u2013 I\u2019ve published several books on the topic \u2013 which is helpful for all those things I've mentioned here, and more.\nPre-production image: Miranda Brigand and Old Hobb.\n A final note: Games are good for us.\nGames help us develop all kinds of skills, from hand-eye coordination to strategic planning. They help us build empathy with team-mates, and they can encourage the kind of competition that leads to excellence. Games can even be used to explain social justice issues, or to assist people recovering from illnesses. And, of course, games are fun! \nI also think that storytelling games like this one are important because it's through storytelling that we explore and experiment with answers to life's most important questions. Therefore, I've crafted this game with a few philosophical dimensions. But the philosophical side is mostly in the background. There's also giant gorillas with four arms.\nPre-production image: Paul Turner and a gargantacore.\nBet your intro philosophy books didn't have those!\nSo, come and play in my back yard!\nI've had a lot of fun writing this game, and I want to share that fun with you.

For my previous Kickstarter project, and my self-published novels, I used Amazon Createspace as the printer and distributor. I'll be using it again for this project, too. I also have an account with Library & Archives Canada, so I can issue my own ISBN's, and so I anticipate no delays there. But if anything of a technical nature were to interrupt the project, I have scouted some excellent local printers and bookbinders who I can work with instead. (Of course, if Amazon were to fail, it would be because the entire internet has failed, and we will all have bigger problems.)\n\nI will keep the backers completely informed about the production process at all times, and with complete transparency.

These occult Lodges attracted the elite of London society \u2013 poets and politicians, actors and heiresses, alchemists and aristocrats scheming against a backdrop of cut glass, in the age of absinthe.\nYou play one of these eccentric characters, choose a faction and an agenda \u2013 do you want to proceed through the mystic Grades to achieve enlightenment? To take over? To destroy from within? \u2013 and speed from location to location to secure ancient knowledge, spread rumours, and foil your opponent\u2019s efforts.\nA s\u00e9ance gone horribly wrong. A gentleman approached after a Mason\u2019s meeting with an inquiry if he\u2019d be interested in something more\u2026unconventional. A book dealer looking over an incoming tome, and knowing more than he lets on. Somewhere in London, between Scotland Yard and the Blind Beggar, is the key to someone\u2019s lifelong obsession. Seek it out. But will you use it, sell it, or destroy it?\nThrow the best parties, summon demons, and keep it out of the papers!\nThe game is built around a simple d6 system new players can master in minutes. The GM is a \u201cshow-runner\u201d who narrates each session\u2019s 3 act structure by introducing new plot points along the way. As a stretch-goal, we will create an integrated Pathfinder Compatible version of the game (thanks to Steven Saunders of Black Goat Games).\nThe game is illustrated in part by Aly Fell, and for colour we\u2019re including flash-fiction from Jordan Stratford (Wollstonecraft), Brendan Myers (Fellwater), Blake Northcott (vs Reality), Astra Crompton (Otherworlds), Scott Jones, Steven Saunders, Kiri Calaghan, Carl Grindley and others.\nIn the game, your character will meet up others to complete certain assignments given to you by your Lodge superiors. You'll track down ancient manuscripts, occult artifacts, conduct elaborate rituals \u2013 and foil your rivals from doing the same. Your party will venture from one authentic turn-of-the-century London location to another, and at each stop you'll be interacting with the environments, character and events potential to each locale. The role of a dice is always a factor \u2013 or is it unseen influence?\nThe Story So Far\nThe mechanic, game description, character archetypes, locations, items, rival factions and plot-events are already written. Pledgers will receive a beautiful library of digital assets which will make gameplay more real and immersive. We\u2019re looking for your help, so we can include the fantastic artwork, flash fiction, and more game scenarios in the first edition of the game as we release it. This will make the game as gorgeous and deep as we know it can be.\nThank you for your support!\nAs a complement to the character class system used by other mechanics, VAULT OF ADEPTS introduces over 20 distinct character archetypes for you to use as a starting-off point for your own character: The imposter, the impresario; the diplomat and the debutante, the clergyman and the curator. Each approach brings with it its own biases and skills, vulnerabilities and assets.\nFor the first release, we have descriptions of over 20 locations in 1900 London, and a dozen plot-events that can occur in each one. An accusation of theft in the British Museum, or a fire at Whitechapel Station. Mysterious hooded figures in Hyde Park, or an attempted seduction in Watkins Bookshop. The locations are illustrated with period photographs and maps.\nThe game is magic-agnostic: while the characters are casting spells and gathering tomes and artifacts, the results can be explained away by coincidence and suggestion. No fireballs (aside from Molotov cocktails), but rather a wearing away of resistance, and subtle persuasions. And of course, the chance of the dice-roll.\nThe streets of London are dangerous: We\u2019ll walk you through combat with sword-canes, umbrellas and hat pins, and the Victorian discipline of Bartitsu \u2013 the mixed martial art of Sherlock Holmes. And you never know when a Derringer in the garter might come in handy.\nWe've registered with Paizo to make this Pathfinder Compatible!\nReaching our goal will allow us to pay our contributors and license the artwork. The game uses a simple mechanic as an example, but can be used with any system with a modicum of adaptation. Exceeding that goal and reaching $12,000 allows us to seamlessly integrate Pathfinder Compatibility. Why Pathfinder? It's the best-selling RPG system in the world, and has millions of established players familiar with the mechanic. This opens up the adventures of VAULT OF ADEPTS to more players, worldwide.\n$17,000 STRETCH GOAL: Rival groups are spouting across the Continent, and more secrets are emerging from the vaults of the Bibliotheque Nationale. Lodges and Cemetieres, bookstalls and brothels all have their part to play. What undocumented treasures arrived from Napoleon\u2019s expeditions into Egypt? With your help, we can unlock the City of Lights.\n$22,000 STRETCH GOAL: Across the Atlantic, lines of loyalty and lineage are being drawn. Whole new cults emerge and quickly recede into the marshes of Massachusetts. What fortunes have washed ashore and taken root here, and what secrets squirrelled away between the Athenaeum and Beacon Hill?\n$27,000 STRETCH GOAL: Flash fiction (around 500 words) is fun and gives the game some flavour, but an anthology of short fiction (2000-5000 words) set in the world of VAULT OF ADEPTS would be marvellous.

You have helped make THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA (released ten years ago this year) the cult classic that it\u2019s become, and we are grateful. Never has there been a more hands-on way to be a part of what we do than through the ingenious mechanism that is crowd-funding. Kickstarter was made for our particular fanbase, and is the ideal vehicle for bringing the third and final film of the Lost Skeleton trilogy (as it will now be known) to life. Not only will it allow our Skelites (if we can call you that) to fund THE LOST SKELETON WALKS AMONG US and become directly involved with the production, it will allow us to reach out to others, folks who have yet to discover our particular brand of absurdity. In an era where cinematic comedy is somewhat lacking in the silly and sublimely ridiculous, not to mention family-friendly, we believe there is a greater audience for our brand of wacky and Kickstarter can help us find them. Or them find us.\n WHO IS THE LOST SKELETON? \nAt the center of this series is one of the most expensive and complex movie monsters ever conceived. Actually, he began as a plastic skeleton used for medical studies and cost around 98.00 on eBay. The original LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA was conceived as a loving spoof of bargain basement 1950s scifi-horror movies and a skeleton seemed so absolutely basic (and cheap), particularly amusing when given a stentorian, arrogant and bitingly sarcastic demeanor; far haughtier than his feeble presence could justify. We\u2019re not sure where he came from, we\u2019re not even sure exactly what he wants. Aside from the absolute power atmosphereum can give him and something like world domination. \nWHAT STARTED IT ALL - THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA\nWhen Larry Blamire was looking for a creative outlet while trying to survive the Dotcom Crash of 2000 he was suddenly hit with the idea of a low budget movie that was supposed to look low budget; a loving spoof to the 1950s low budget scifi films he\u2019d grown up on. The resulting movie THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA, an exercise in cheeky absurdity and good clean fun, followed a determined scientist who likes to say \u201cscience\u201d a lot, his faithful clueless wife, a pair of confused aliens, an evil scientist, an exotic woman made from four different forest animals, an escaped monster (the Mutant) and the title character, the world\u2019s haughtiest world-dominating skeleton. This labor of love was shot in 10\u00bd days with a wonderful cast that\u2019s become a stock company and working \u201cfamily\u201d (calling themselves Bantam Street), and premiered at the Egyptian Theatre before a wildly enthusiastic audience of almost 600. Among them was Sony\u2019s Michael Schlesinger who was determined to pick it up. He did and the movie was released theatrically and on DVD in 2004. Overall, the reviews were pretty spectacular, as in this sampling:\n\"A hoot.....Cadavra reaches comic heights that approach the 'Your stupid minds! Stupid, stupid, stupid!' speech from Plan 9.\" -- Glenn Kenny, PREMIERE MAGAZINE \n\"A single, giggle-inducing mutation... A '50s sci-fi spoof that's a silly hit to the funny bone.\" -- Michael Rechtshaffen, HOLLYWOOD REPORTER\n\"Parodic bull\u2019s-eye scored! ... A deft parody of \u201850s Z-grade sci-fi and horror pics, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra will delight...!\" -- Dennis Harvey,VARIETY \n\"Insanely entertaining\" -- Tim Cogshell, BOXOFFICE MAGAZINE\n\"Not just a spoof of Fifties sci-fi/ horror pictures, but a movie of great verbal imagination in its own right ...A charming exercise in escalating absurdity... Blamire seems to invent entire worlds of absurd imagery... This is a gift, and one hopes to see Blamire carry it to greater lengths in future projects... --Tim Lucas, VIDEO WATCHDOG\n\"Tinfoil spacesuits, rubber-ribbed aliens, and ray guns.... Writer-director-star Larry Blamire re-creates B-movie scenes with precision.... Cadavra's low-rent indie roots... make it that much more amusing. -- Jon M. Gibson, WIRED MAGAZINE\n\"A cheerfully trashy, dead-on spoof of the B-movie genre.\" -- Megan Lehmann, NEW YORK POST\n\"Blamire nails Ed Wood's trademark syntactical acrobatics, and a sublimely awkward set piece featuring masquerading aliens recalls the dinner scene in Eraserhead drained of queasy dread. May be 100 percent cult-in-a-can....\" -- Mark Holcomb, VILLAGE VOICE\n\"A parody of B-movies stupid enough -- and yet with just enough brains -- to appeal to the most discriminating fans of the genre.... 'Lost Skeleton' might just come close to comedy perfection. \" -- Michael O'Sullivan, WASHINGTON POST \nSECOND OF THE TRILOGY - THE LOST SKELETON RETURNS AGAIN\nThough not a fan of sequels, and fueled by a legion of fans that wanted more Skeleton, in 2008 Larry Blamire hit upon an idea for a revisit while watching a jungle adventure on TV. What if super clean-cut Dr. Paul Armstrong became bitter and was living in the jungle and drinking heavily because science let him down? The idea was ridiculous enough and the plot elements all grew out of this notion. It would give the fans the return to these characters they\u2019d been clamoring for as well as allowing a slightly different genre to be spoofed; the 1960s adventure matinee. With strikingly Bernard Herrmannesque music from John Morgan and William Stromberg and imaginative old school production design from Anton Tremblay--not to mention Frank Ippolito\u2019s fun rubber suited monsters--this film had a slightly different flavor while retaining the original\u2019s sense of the ridiculous as everyone treks into a remote region of the Amazon in search of another elusive element, jerranium 90. All the cast returned, and quite a few new faces were added including Trish Geiger, H.M. Wynant, Daniel Roebuck, Kevin Quinn and Frank Dietz. The film was shot by A.J. Rickert-Epstein, now Blamire\u2019s go-to cinematographer. Instrumental in the execution of the film was producer Mark Allen Stuart, who will be executive producer on THE LOST SKELETON WALKS AMONG US (Mark is now Chairman and CEO at Hydraulic Entertainment of which Larry Blamire is Senior VP). Mike Schlesinger, having worked with Blamire and Bantam Street since TRAIL OF THE SCREAMING FOREHEAD, was also a producer on the film. THE LOST SKELETON RETURNS AGAIN was released in 2010 and the boys back at the lab are planning a 5 year anniversary issue of film in 2015. \nTHE LAST OF THE TRILOGY - THE LOST SKELETON WALKS AMONG US\nWhere THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA was set in a rural area and THE LOST SKELETON RETURNS AGAIN the jungle, THE LOST SKELETON WALKS AMONG US is firmly in suburbia. Yes, everyone's favorite all-powerful skull could be living right next to you. We find rock scientist Dr. Paul Armstrong and his wife Betty leading the quiet life in the suburbs alongside next door neighbors Kro-Bar and Lattis who have decided to live on earth under the names Hildon and Clackie Pottadew. Meanwhile obsessed renegade East Neulmanian scientist Dr. Neesha Krome has bought the fragments of the Lost Skeleton's crushed skull and managed to piece them back together (sort of) using a highly sophisticated method of tape, bandaids and elmer's glue. The Lost Skeleton forms an alliance with her to take over the world, once his full powers are restored. But for that they need atmosphereum and Neesha quickly detects a source for the powerful element in the peaceful Blendview neighborhood. They move in right next to Paul and Betty and to fit in undetected, Neesha places her skull partner inside an automaton that happens to look exactly like deceased government agent Reet Pappin, a resemblance most confusing to the Armstrongs. After the strange new couple (going by the names Charko and Nettie Panamalanman) ingratiate themselves Betty takes it upon herself to find the awkward Charko/Lost Skeleton/Reetomaton a job, though he seems qualified for very little. At the same time, Animala, sensing a disturbance with her keen animal senses, makes her way from the Amazon. Jungle Brad, now City Brad, shows up in his new job as plainclothes policeman. Seems he's investigating a series of Radiation Murders that have taken place in Blendview, somehow unbeknownst to Paul. Sure enough, we are soon witness to the nocturnal prowlings of a mysterious monster that leaves traces of radiation at the scene of each crime. Atmosphereum, Jerranium 90, a powerful criminal organization, a stalking creature, the return of General Scottmanson, the president of the United States, uncomfortably awkward neighbors--all things come to a boil, leading to a fever pitch of stark raving terror and a duel of giant monsters that rains destruction upon the once peaceful Blendview, promising the world will never be the same. But rather, different. \nTHIS KICKSTARTER PROGRAM\nThis Kickstarter campaign will allow us to raise the money to shoot and complete the film, which we then plan to distribute ourselves (and believe us; for indies this is the way to go). Easily the most ambitious entry in the trilogy we really want to wrap things up in style; with a cast about three times larger than the original film. The climax with its monster effects and cataclysmic destruction will be overseen by TV\u2019s Monster Man himself, Cleve Hall, no stranger to recreating kaiju-style mayhem. We want to do this right or not at all, and this is the amount that will make it happen. Because the film is set in 1963 suburbia we cannot simply go out and shoot on the streets or in actual homes. The logistics of this would prove costly and time-consuming (not to mention being at the mercy of every lawn mower and leaf blower around). Also it would mean constant company moves, which are incredibly time-consuming. The perfect solution is what we did with DARK AND STORMY NIGHT: shoot the whole film on a sound stage. \nCAST AND CREW\nWriter-Director: Larry Blamire \nExecutive Producer: Mark Allen Stuart\nProducer: Michael Schlesinger \nLine Producer: Melanie Elin \nProduction Designer: Anton Tremblay \nCinematographer: A.J.

This is the absolute minimum allowed by the Screen Actors Guild, plus an additional ten percent for the performers\u2019 respective agents. These are the kind of folks that make this series what it is, and of course they have a pretty good idea they\u2019re going to have fun. A large portion of the budget will go to the sets that comprise the film\u2019s suburban setting--the \u201cstudio look\u201d will be important to the overall ambience. Add to that a decent lighting package, the best cameras we can get (we\u2019re shooting digital), props for a fair amount of sets, and period costumes for a fairly large cast. For musical score we are licensing various cues represented by David Schecter\u2019s wonderful Monstrous Movie Music label; choice vintage music that will perfectly color the period proceedings in that classic monster movie feel. We have some exciting incentives (including two speaking roles as well as crowd-terrified-by-giant-monster parts!) and we look forward to having you on board. Our fans are the best in the world; the most vocal, the most enthusiastic, and believe me that enthusiasm is infectious. They've always been a part of the Lost Skeleton experience. Now's a chance to be even more involved; as fellow producers of what we think will be the best, and funniest, movie in the Lost Skeleton Trilogy.

I will tell the audient void...\nIt\u2019s a player vs. computer (or tablet) game based on senet, an ancient Egyptian board game. We\u2019ve animated and illustrated the gameplay with the 1920s occult-investigator aesthetics of HP Lovecraft\u2019s horror classic \u201cNyarlathotep.\u201d\nWhere most dungeon-crawlers begin at the beginning, we cut to the chase. Your team of investigators has already discovered the big bad, and now it\u2019s a race to escape the labyrinth. Can you get all your team members out alive, to seal the cultists and their terrible reality-destroying amulet inside? Or will the cultists avoid the traps, beat you to the exit, entomb your team and unleash an unspeakable horror on the world?\nWe\u2019re building this in Unity, a tested and proven cross platform environment, so the game will play on PCs and Macs and Android tablets and iPads. It\u2019s fun.\nThe real-world board game version. Ours is weirder.\nIt\u2019s a chase game, played for over five thousand years. You and your opponent have five pawns each. Thrown sticks are like rolled dice, generating a random number of moves you can make. The first player to remove all their pawns from the board wins. But there are ways of moving your opponent\u2019s pawns backwards, and ways of protecting your pawns from attack. A copy of senet was found in the tomb of King Tutankhamen. So let\u2019s call it play-tested.\nActual game concept art\nInto the lands of civilization came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the sciences of electricity and psychology and gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless, yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude. Men advised one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished, for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare. \u2013 HP Lovecraft, \"Nyarlathotep\"\nIn Lovecraft\u2019s story he\u2019s a resurrected pharaoh, back from twenty seven centuries of sleep, and aligned with an unspeakable evil. He travels the world putting on Tesla-like displays of (1920s) technology. To see these exhibitions is to be driven mad, and his cult of worshippers threatens reality itself.\nInstead of static pawns, we\u2019ve added some classic Lovecraftian archetypes to make up your team.\nThe Scholar: An elegant bald-headed black man, carrying a thick, ancient tome shackled closed in heavy chain. Perfect for whacking cultists with.\nThe Antiquarian: A no-nonsense Englishwoman in a practical hat and a sensible tweed suit, she carries a cartoonishly large flashlight. Perfect for whacking cultists with.\nThe Nun: Oh, she does not approve of all these cultist shenanigans. Not. At. All. She has a giant iron rosary which turns out to be perfect for whacking cultists with.\nActual game concept art\nThe Detective: Fedora and trench coat and guns a-blazin\u2019, he\u2019s a two-fisted hard-boiled iron-jawed crimefighter.\nThe Mechanic: With pigtails sticking out of her aviator helmet, she carries an overlarge wrench - and we know what that\u2019s perfect for.\nIt\u2019s a casual game and takes about 20 minutes to half an hour. While it\u2019s very simple to learn, it can take a long time to master, and there is still the element of chance. Similar to something like backgammon in that regard. If backgammon had cloaked and hooded cultists trying to destroy the world if you lose.\n\u00a9 Michael Lee Macdonald\nOur lead artist for the project is Michael Lee Macdonald, aka Alchemicheal, who's work has been compared to the seminal master Mo\u00ebbius.\nOriginal music is being composed by Gil Luna, known for his kickstarter-fueled Cthulhu Rises soundtrack.

The series begins with Katie and Eric, two twenty-somethings who, while having problems in their relationship, accidentally become involved in the struggle between two factions of an ancient secret society, descended from Celtic and Roman gods.\nBook Two: Hallowstone. As Eric grieves the death of his lover, the flamboyant Heathcliff Weatherby Wednesday helps him find her killer. But in return, Heathcliff makes some unusual demands. As the mystery deepens, Eric grows unsure of who to trust.\nBook Three: Clan Fianna. Accused of a crime he didn\u2019t commit, Eric is banished from the Brigantians.

In 2013 I was a TED speaker, at TEDxGuelphU. And a previous Kickstarter project of mine, \"Clear and Present Thinking\", created a free college-level textbook on logic and critical thinking which is now used in many colleges and universities, including Canada's biggest: the University of Toronto.\nI'm a philosophy professor by day. So I know about power relations, and moral dilemmas, and the metaphysics of a believable and interesting fantasy world. I've also got a Drama degree, so I know about characterization, dramatic timing and tension, and the power of language and storytelling. I've put these skills together to create what I hope you will agree is a compelling and memorable series of novels.\nI like writing fantasy because good fantasy bends the rules of reality precisely to draw special attention to reality, and our real lives. Good fantasy can be full of magic spells, fantastic monsters, and amazing landscapes \u2013 but in the end it's really about people, confronting the natural immensities of fate and free will, reality and illusion, good and evil, life and death, and all things in between. Of course you can explore such things in any genre. But I just think it's interesting and fun to do that in fantasy. And that's what I'm doing with Fellwater.\nYou're a fan of science fiction, fantasy, and drama, and you prefer to support independent artists and creators.\nYou enjoy stories about conflicted heroes who don't necessarily get the girl in the end. (Sorry for the spoiler there.)\nYou're the kind of person who wonders, as some of these characters wonder, what the rat race is really for, and whether there's more to this life than what meets the eye.\nIf any of this sounds familiar, then I've got a series of books for you.\nA mock recruitment ad for one of the factions in the novels.\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVery few. Since the majority of backer rewards are delivered electronically, those rewards will not get lost in the mail. The print books will be drop-shipped directly from the printer, which reduces costs and hassles for me, and improves delivery time for you. \n\nI'm going to use CreateSpace.com as my printer. It's an Amazon company, so if it goes bankrupt, it will be because the entire internet has crashed, and we'll all have bigger problems than an unfulfilled Kickstarter campaign. \n\nAll the backer rewards are finished, and almost ready to go. They just need, well, a little editing. The audiobooks are not yet recorded, but I already have all the equipment that I need for the purpose. \n\nOne notable \"challenge\" is the fact that this campaign is set to end right in the middle of my exams. I will be up to my neck in marking papers for most of the month of May, and I'll have less time to work with the editor. But this is mostly a scheduling problem, not a logistical one. I've therefore set a delivery date of September 2014 for all backer rewards. But it's entirely possible that things will be done much sooner than that. Backers will be kept informed by frequent updates, and posts on my Twitter and Facebook pages.\n\nAnd if my editors disappear? I've a backup plan for that, too.

But where does Clive Barker find his primal inspiration?\nClive has said from his first interviews that he keeps a brush and ink next to his bed to capture fragments of dreams, and that his stories originate as visuals first- the works on canvas are more often than not Clive's inital introduction to the characters and universes that he then picks up a pen to illuminate.  The most recent example of this is his world of Abarat:\n\"I'm painting these pictures in the expectation that... interesting, strange characters and landscapes will come into my mind and into my mind's eye and appear on the canvas through the brush. There is something willfully strange about this process- that you stand back at the end of a night's work and you look at something and you say, 'Where did that come from?' I mean, I'm not the only artist who does that - lots of artists do that, I know. And it's been wonderful because if I had created Abarat from words- if I'd written Abarat and then illustrated it... it would not be anything like as rich or as complex or as contradictory a world as it is. Because this is a world which has been created from dream visions...  What I'm doing is finding stories that match the shape of my dreams.\"\nBook cover mockup.\nIMAGINER is the first comprehensive volume of the artwork of Clive Barker.  Featuring over 75 artworks and over 160 pages, the book will be a gorgeous large format of 10\" x 13\" inches.  There have been marginal explorations of Clive's artwork in the past, but the most important part of this project is that the book is composed of entirely ALL NEW and ULTRA HIGH RESOLUTION image captures.  The detail is impeccable, and Clive flatteringly declared the difference in detail of the new captures compared to previously printed ones like the difference between \"chalk and cheese\".  (Which means they're really, really good!)\nThe purest, most direct path from the raw creative mind of Clive Barker to our world is through his artworks.  We are in the process of exhuming and documenting a lifetime of genius; these artworks are the origin points of characters we recognize, and hold hints of stories yet to come.  We expect this first book to be the beginning of a series of volumes examining his work in great detail, and are also in the process of documenting his creative process on film for a documentary titled Clive Barker: Imaginer.\nThis is an art book of the highest quality, and is being created with the utmost attention to detail to present the artwork as though you were witnessing the paintings and drawings in person.\nWhat makes a \"fine art\" book?\nThe capturing of images is incredibly important- for this book we have used a high-resolution scanback camera with a Hasselblad lens; all artworks were carefully lighted, and are being painstakingly color corrected as we speak.  Many books that you see are 8.5\" x 11\" or smaller because it's a cutoff point for pricing.  The next plateau is 9\" x 12\".  The artwork of Clive Barker looks best printed in an even more dramatic 10\" x 13\" format- since we are going directly to the fans with this we can avoid the demands and concerns of mass-market publishing and print this book at a beautiful large format that shows the artwork in the best possible manner!\n\"The Believer\" Oil on paper.\nTHE REWARDS\nOn January 18, 2014 we begin the celebration of Clive's artwork with an exhibition at Century Guild gallery in Los Angeles, where Clive's artwork will be hanging amidst works by important Symbolists including Alphonse Mucha and Franz von Stuck, drawings from 19th century Austrian masters Gustav Klimt and Koloman Moser, and an impressive selection of German silent film and cabaret artworks.

Funds will also pay for travel and expenses, and for reward fulfillment. \n\nThe goal is to use half of the Kickstarter funds for content creation and the other half for the printing of books and Kickstarter incentive rewards. \n\nAdditional funding will allow me to find more experienced models, travel to more distant locations, and procure more elaborate props.\n\nCost breakdown of a sample shoot- approximately $300 per shoot\nModel - $100\nProp - $100\nLocation and permit - $50\nExpendables and other miscellaneous expenses - $50\nWith 12 photo shoots completed by the time of launch, PRIMAL has already cut $3,600 out of its minimum funding goal. With a minimum of 30 shoot sessions needed to complete the book, that leaves 18 shoots still to be funded, and a balance of $5,400. With half the Kickstarter funds going towards rewards, that is a minimum balance of $10,800 for the remaining shoots and production costs. This however does not directly equate to another shoot in the book for every $600 over the goal. \nI feel that 30 sessions is the minimum for a quality book with enough variation. The maximum however is constrained by scheduling, and limited to approximately 40. Simply put, more funding means more (and better) models, props, locations, and a better final product. \nStretch Goals\nAny additional funds raised beyond what is detailed above will go towards PRIMAL's stretch goals! At $12,000 PRIMAL will be able to hold a release gallery and party in Los Angeles at the completion of the project.  The extra money will go towards printing, location, and drinks. At $15,000 there will be some surprise goodies for absolutely everyone who participates, as well as 10 extra pages in the book! \n\nI also know how hard it has been for me to get this project going, and how hard it is for other artists. for this reason I am participating in kicking it forward. a percentage of the profits of this project will be funded back into other kickstarter projects!  \n\n\nREWARDS\n\nWith the exception of the limited quantity rewards, any reward can be added to any pledge level by pledging that reward's dollar amount above your pledge level. This can be used to purchase additional quantities or combine rewards that are not normally offered together. \n\nPlease contact me with any questions.\n\nAbout the book. \n\nThe finished product will be an 8\"x10\" softcover book with 50+ pages printed on premium luster archival photo paper for the richest colors and highest image quality. Printed by Blurb.  \n\nAlthough some images will appear online in the gallery and on social media, there will be many images in the book that will not appear anywhere else. \nAbout the prints.\n\nSome of the images are not suitable for all ages. To see the images as intended please follow this link to my site.  (NSFW)\n\nThe set of 5 framable 8x10s will consist of selected images that are the most iconic and most representative of the collection as a whole. \n\nThe prints will be made by ICON in Los Angeles at the end of 2014 after the final images have been selected. To add the prints to a pledge level that does not normally include them, add $150 to your pledge amount.\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many elements that must come together to make this project successful. I\u2019m certainly not too prideful to admit that I can't do this all on my own.\n\nThe greatest challenge to realizing the best version of this project is the physical design of the book. I am confident in my ability to create photographs... but the same cannot be said for the writing and graphic design skills needed for the final product. Although I have done print-on-demand books before this one will be my biggest undertaking yet. I may need some help with the layout and design of the book but luckily I have many creative friends who are willing to help.\n\nAnother challenge I am currently experiencing is difficulty finding male models willing to shoot nude. This is something that will become easier the more sizable my budget becomes. Kickstarter funding is absolutely essential to make this the best project it can be.\n\n\nThank you, \n-Nicholas Freeman\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "the time has come", "update_content": "All the books have arrived and I have begun printing all of the rewards and gallery pieces.

The prints will be featured, have music and drinks, and of course many of the models from the series will attend. It would be open to everyone and I'm really hoping that we can make it happen, but it'll only happen if we hit $12,000. \n\nThe next goal is a bigger one. At $15,000 I will add a minimum of 10 pages to the book, including new concepts that wont be happening otherwise, and I'm working on something big to share with all of you - but its not ready to share yet... lets hope we get to it.
