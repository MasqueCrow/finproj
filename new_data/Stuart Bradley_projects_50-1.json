[{"backer": "Stuart Bradley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "I love to draw. The drawings I like best make me laugh. During the pandemic, I created two new jigsaw puzzles, Rogues Gallery and Lackluster Circus. If you get them now, you\u2019ll be ready for your next quarantine, house arrest, or hibernation.\nOodles of unpleasant characters covering some unpleasant wallpaper.\nRogues Gallery is a collection of framed portraits...peculiar characters covering a swath of curious wallpaper.\nLogically, the world's worst circus must be somewhere. Could this be it?\nLackluster Circus is a gaudy collection of traditional circus acts that have refined their performances to a modest level of mediocrity. And there are enough clowns to make any sane person queasy.\nWhat sponsors get. Your reward can be one puzzle or both. Each is a 1,000-piece puzzle that will measure 19.75\" x 27.5\" (50 cm x 70 cm) when you put it together. The puzzle pieces come in a reusable poly bag in a sturdy, two-piece box with a half-size cheat sheet to help you if you get stuck.\n********\nWhy a jigsaw puzzle? Puzzles are great because you can do them alone or with others. You get to set the pace. You can do the whole puzzle in one marathon session or drag the effort out over weeks. Solving a puzzle sharpens your cognitive skills and helps you learn to focus on details. Snapping a puzzle piece into position feels good and probably releases a flood of endorphins. How nice. And jigsaw puzzles don\u2019t require any batteries, instruction manuals, or wifi.\nGreat puzzles have something to look at on nearly every piece. Never any boring blank areas.\nWhat makes a puzzle great? I believe the best jigsaw puzzles have three vital qualities. First, lots of color. Next, oodles of details. No boring expanses of sky or snow. Last, a good puzzle is puzzling\u2014a little mysterious and full of false clues, duplicates, and distractions.\nI designed both of these puzzles to give you abundant colors, beguiling details, and mild mystery.\nHow difficult are these puzzles? Challenging, but not so exasperating that you will have to be institutionalized. Not as difficult as last year\u2019s Ocean Commotion puzzle.\nThe challenging Ocean Commotion puzzle (detail) is still available for the fearless.\nYou\u2019ll receive an overview of the whole image on the box base and the half-size cheat sheet, so you and a friend can both refer to the complete image while working on the puzzle. If you believe the puzzle is too easy, try solving it without referring to the cheat sheet. If it is still too easy, do it blindfolded.\nWhere are these puzzles going to be made? These puzzles will be made at Sarah's XZY puzzle workshop in China. (We know that sounds like a ridiculous, made-up name, but it\u2019s real.) Printed and bonded to specially made, heavy puzzle board to prevent delaminating and reduce paper dust. Housed in a sturdy clear poly bag and nestled in a robust two-piece box.\nPuzzles make good gifts...easy to wrap.\n\u201cDon\u2019s puzzles are always loaded with interesting and unexpected \u201d\n\u201cThese puzzles will make great gifts for folks with a high tolerance for nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cThe world would be a better place if more people stayed home and worked on puzzles.\u201d\n*******\nWhen can I expect these rewards? Assuming nothing calamitous happens, you should be enjoying these puzzles by September 2021. Probably sooner. \n********\nShipping. The cost of shipping is automatically added to your pledge based on if you live in the U.S. or Canada.\nJust the local neighborhood. We are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, once we ship all rewards, some extras of these jigsaw puzzles will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get Rogues Gallery and Lackluster Circus puzzles there.\nWho are these creatures? Do any remind you of anyone in your circle of family or friends?\nCustoms. Sometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected seemingly by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring your jigsaw puzzles during their next trip.\nTracking number. You will receive a tracking number when we ship, so track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\nFulfillment is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nPlenty of diverting details to entertain you.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects, including previous jigsaw puzzles, are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com.

With white paisleys on a dignified gray background, these bandanas will be 100 percent cotton printed right here in the good-old USA using duplex printing like the quality bandanas I grew up with.

We like to invent fun and useful things. Launching this project on Kickstarter, We want to bring Clobe out to the world successfully!\n Desk accessory that imitates the planet earth\nPut it on your desk and see how the world is turning. Clobe is super functional desk accessory that you can only meet here on Kickstarter.\n\n As you know, the Earth rotates once a day on its axis. And the sunlight always covers half side of the planet rotating. The core design concept is to describe the sunlight reflecting on the Earth so that we can see where is in daytime, where is in nighttime, time, season, some kind of natural phenomenons all at once.\n\n Also it can charge devices like smart phones, earbuds with high performance wireless charger module in it.\n24 O'Clocks\n\nGet Informed \nClobe is first designed as clock. However, it shows you not only the time but also date, temperature, humidity which we want to see in our life so frequently. Just tap the right corner of the screen to see what you want.\n\n\nWorld Clock \n Turn the globe to see the time of a specific city you want to know. Let the city face forward then the time being shown will automatically change.\n\n Almost every capital cities and some popular cities are here. All the cities are in specific time zones that are divided by UTC(Universal Time Coordinated) from -11 to +12. However, a few cities don't use the time zones where they are in. In that case, they have their own time zone given in brackets after each name.\n\n\nThe seasons are always changing\nThe Earth rotates about an imaginary line that passes through the North and South poles of the planet. This line is called the axis of rotation and tilted about an angle of 23.5 degrees relative to our orbital plane - the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n\n When the Earth orbits with the tilted axis of rotation everywhere except the equatorial regions takes different amount of energy from the Sun everyday. That is why the seasons are changing.\n\n\nWireless Charger\nQC 2.0/3.0 adapter is required. Otherwise, charging system will be unable.\n10W charging mode for Galaxy series\n7.5W charging mode for iPhone series\n5W charging mode for other devices\nNon-slip rubbers on charging bed\nCharging bed dimension : 140mm/5.5in * 88mm/3.5in * 30mm/1.2in which fits every smart phone and also AirPods\n\n\n4 brightness levels\nIt's mood light\n Clobe is designed to look like the real Earth in real time. The light inside describes the sunlight reflected from the Earth in universe. The light keeps rotating once a day and changing the angle according to the date.\n\nImagine when you are lying on the bed in your room and there is a Clobe mildly glowing on the desk at night. This is a beautiful Mood Light. Of course, you can easily turn ON/OFF the light by tapping it or your smart phone.\nBrightness is adjustable within 4 levels.\n\n\nSettings\n You can adjust time, date with control buttons behind or your smart phone via Bluetooth. Once you have done it, Clobe remembers the data with a mercury cell in it so that you don't need to do that again even after it loses power.\n\nYou can also adjust the brightness of the globe and information screen.\n\nDST, date format(yy/mm/dd), 12h/24h format set them all with your preference.\n\n\nColor temperature is also adjustable.\n3000K / 4000K/ 5000K/ 6000K\n\n\nCharging adapter is not included\n It works with 5V/1A adapter if you don't need to charge any other devices. If you want to charge you need to use QC2.0/3.0 adapter.\n\nWhat you can do with smart phone via Bluetooth :\nTime & Date Setting\nTurn On/Off mood light\nAdjust brightness\nDST(Daylight Saving Time) On/Off\nPlay with the light\n\n\nAU$1 is about US$0.74\nShipping\nUS, Australia : AU$20\nThe rest of the world : AU$22\nRewards don't include additional duty and taxes that may be charged as per local laws of importation.\n\n\nWhat's in the box\nCharging adapter will not be provided. To charge any other devices, QC2.0 or QC3.0 adapter is necessary.\nColor options are DARK GREY, WHITE, BROWN. The selection will be asked after this project ends. White is with yellow LEDs.\nSuper Early Bird will get the first delivery.\n\n\n\nCan it be operated in a cordless mode? No it can't. Sorry for the confusion by images. It doesn't have a battery in it not to increase the cost.\n  How long is the USB A to C cable included? It's 1.5m long. Or 59in.\n  How is the texture? Matt and soft. We could not demonstrate as perfectly as it is because we are not experts in camera... Sorry. However, it's definitely high-quality. Not toyish.\n  Are the time zone lines correct? The vertical lines on the globe are simplified version of the time zone lines which is kind of zigzag in real life. Though they are not the same, you can get the accurate time of a specific city if you know its time zone.\n  Is the brightness of the dot-matrix adjustable too? Yes. You can adjust either the light in globe and the dot-matrix separately.\n  Showing mode : The light in the globe can move as you want by a smartphone application regardless the time and date. It will be fun!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first crowdfunding project in our career so we can not be 100% sure about everything that will come in the future.

We have already inspected and approved the pre-production prototypes. So fabrication can start as soon as the project reaches its funding goal.\nBoth bags will be produced at Bella\u2019s textile workshop in China. She and her team do great work and have delighted us with their prototypes.\nPack your bags and you\u2019re ready to go.\nWhat the critics are saying\nBoth bags look great.

Brilliant.\n*******\nHandles over shoulder leaves hands free for fighting zombies.\n********\nExcellent gifts for anyone contemplating an exit.\n*******\nShipping. The cost of shipping will be added to your pledge based on where you live. Because shipping is restricted during the Covid-19 pandemic, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, when global trade is restored, some extras of these bags will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get Skedaddleosaurus Bags there.\nSometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you dinosaurs during their next trip.\nIf you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home. \n Shipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\n Leftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. A good place to find some unusual gifts.\nDon Moyer, Pittsburgh, May 25, 2020", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is using established production methods\u2014textile printing, cutting, sewing, etc. We don\u2019t need to quarry any unobtanium or invent anti-gravity devices. The design of both bags is complete and I\u2019ve already tested prototypes, so we are good to go. The most likely threat is some unanticipated obstacle in the production schedule that will slow us down. Perhaps insidious microbes will disrupt global supply chains or manufacturing capacities will be diverted to produce hazmat suits. Who knows? I\u2019ve built extra time into the schedule to accommodate mild disruptions. But biggies could surprise us all.

After previous four playing card projects (modestly successful due to the support of our backers) that were entirely focus on the theme of change and transformation, we decided to explore something different - street graffiti. We have always been interested in street culture, which Flagrant Agenda started off with, particularly graffiti and how it can be use as an medium to make a point. After at least two unsuccessful attempts to come up with a concept and design that we are pleased with, we stumbled upon MILTZ.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nMILTZ https://miltz.myportfolio.com is a young and talented graphic artist from Japan and we are particularly intrigued with his project, Shibuya Bluffiti. The juxtaposition of negativity associated with graffiti and the possible normalization of graffiti as a part of a neighbourhood and the modern interpretation of a traditional lettering style showed us a new way of looking at graffiti - graffiti does not have to always be counter culture and anti establishment. While change usually happens by going against the norm, it can also happen by working within a system.\nThis collaboration between us and MILTZ has taken in quite unexpected directions with very fascinating bouncing of ideas and crafting of visual elements to be included in the deck. May we present the Edo Karuta Playing Cards. \nThe aesthetic mainstay of Edo Karuta is the ubiquitous Edomoji, Japanese typographic and lettering styles that were invented and vastly popular during the Edo period. They are primarily used for advertising and branding in the various trades that sprung up during the prosperous epoch before the advent of modern Japan. You can still see many traditional Japanese brands using Edomoji in their marketing efforts. Walk by any Japanese restaurants and you will bound to see banners with Edomoji written on them. In Edo Karuta, these typographical elements are superimposed onto each other to make up interesting and visually arresting motifs, the signature style of MILTZ that we saw in his Shibuya Bluffiti project. You can see these representations most clearly in our card backs. \nThe pips are stylized motifs of the 4 seasons\nThe Edo period of Japan was chosen, or shall we say, fallen upon us as the thematic mainstay of Edo Karuta. Edo period can be considered the golden age of pre-industrial Japan. The Pax Tokugawa that was enabled by the unification of Japan by the Tokugawa Shogunate allowed for unprecedented economic growth as well as the flourishing of arts and other cultural pursuits. However, the Edo period was also characterized by isolationalist outlook and the cementing of strict societal hierarchy that lead to what some say as a general slow-down of industrialization. The Edo Period  ended with the arrival of the external powers that the Tokugawa regime cannot resist which lead to a modernization spur.\nThe aesthetic and thematic mainstay bring us back one full circle in terms of change. Edomoji symbolizes the merchant class, the beneficiary of the Pax Tokugawa and the catalyst for change due to the upset of the social order - on the surface of the system, all is rosy but change is already set in motion by the actions within the system. Alas, the last straw usually comes from outside the system, in this case, black ships appearing over the horizon.\nTuck Case  \nMeaning of the stylized edomoji on our tuck case\nCard Back \nThe thick border of our card back with MILTZ's signature superimposition of two different edomoji scripts\nPLAY\n\nPrimary Joker\nThe Aces\nEach of the aces include a haiku, short, 3-phrases poems based on the four seasons from Matsuo Bash\u014d (\u677e\u5c3e\u82ad\u8549, 1644\u20131694), recognized as the greatest of all haiku masters.\nThe 4 haiku and their rough English translations:\n\u2663 \u6625 (Spring) | \u6625\u3082\u3084\u3084\u6c17\u8272\u3068\u3068\u306e\u3075\u6708\u3068\u6885 | After a long winter, plums began to bloom. The moon has come.\n\u2666 \u590f (Summer) | \u99ff\u6cb3\u8def\u3084\u82b1\u6a58\u3082\u8336\u306e\u5302\u3072 | Although it is the season of the flower of Tachibana, Suruga-road smells of tea.\n\u2665 \u79cb (Autumn) | \u671d\u8336\u98f2\u3080\u50e7\u9759\u304b\u306a\u308a\u83ca\u306e\u82b1 | A monk is drinking tea in the garden in the morning. Chrysanthemums bloom in front of their eyes.\n\u2660 \u51ac (Winter) | \u521d\u96ea\u3084\u6c34\u4ed9\u306e\u8449\u306e\u305f\u308f\u3080\u307e\u3067 | The first snow has fallen. The snow piles up on the daffodils, and the leaves are bent.\nCourt Cards\nThe court cards feature subtle differences when view from different orientation with the graphical differences inspired by how the characters' lives and personalities have changed throughout their lifespan. The overall illustration is based on ukiyo-e motifs, poses and animal mascots with bold visual arrangements and liberal use of colours.\nTokugawa Ieyasu, the founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Tokugawa Yoshimune, the eighth shogun and considered to be the best shogun in Tokugawa Shogunate\n\nTokugawa Tsunayoshi, the fifth shogun, also widely known as the 'dog shogun' for his love of dogs\nTokugawa Yoshinobu, the last of the Tokugawa shoguns\nYoshino, highly accomplished courtesan who was conferred the highest rank of Tayu\nKasuga no Tsubone, influential female politician in early Tokugawa shogunate that contributed greatly to the stabilization of the new regime\nKatsushika Oi, consummate female painter in the style of ukiyo-e\nTenshoin Atsuko, official wife of the 13th shogun and key figure in the peaceful transition of Edo period to Modern Japan\nHattori Masanari, head of Tokugawa founder's castle guards\nHoninbo Shusaku, Go master and nicknamed the 'Invincible' for his 19-game undefeated winning streak\nRaiden Tameemon, legendary Sumo wrestler\nHijikata Toshizo, the last chief of the special squad, Shinsengumi, formed by the shogunate to protect its interest in the final days of the Edo period\nSecondary Joker \nEDO KARUTA features:\nTwo colour schemes - The red/white Daimyo deck and the black/gold Shogun deck\nPrinted by United States Playing Card Company\nTraditional cut and magic finish\nAvailable in 2 editions - the Basic and the Special\nPremium metallic ink for Shogun deck\nFully customized seal\nFor Basic - a classic Bicycle deck with a standard tuck case\nFor Special - custom pressed tuck case with special deck sleeve.\nThe Special Edition of both Daimyo and Shogun deck come with a custom design tuck case and deck sleeve. As the artwork for Edo Karuta fills all available space in a deck, the tuck case and deck sleeve are modified to showcase the inner tuck case and deck sleeve artwork while maintaining the structural integrity of the deck. \nYou can see the prototype of rendering of the tuck case and deck sleeve below for both Daimyo and Shogun deck. The tuck case is open from the front, thus allowing the whole of the inner tuck artwork to be seen. The middle portion of the tuck case, when opened, is also hollowed, which allows the card back to be seen immediately when the tuck case is open. When cards are removed, the rest of the inner tuck case artwork will be revealed.\nSticker seal for the Daimyo Special Edition will be printed on foiled paper\nThe stylized edomoji (\u8ced\u535a\u5c01) on the sticker seal refers to the ban on gambling during the Edo period. Ironically, underground gambling and creative ways to overcome the prohibition flourished. We toyed with the alternative meaning of the phrase, \u5c01, also meaning 'seal',  to put in on the sticker seal.\nArtwork of the outer and inner deck sleeve for Daimyo Special Edition\nSticker seal for Shogun Special Edition will be printed on textured paper\nArtwork of outer and inner deck sleeve for Shogun Special Edition\nAs part of our decks, we will also be rolling out custom minted coins as add-ons. Previously, we had Agenda EDC Coins as part of our playing cards campaigns. We think of coins as an natural extension of what we did with playing cards as they are related to playing cards in spirit as they are both are used by magicians in variety of tricks, collected vehemently by collectors, and, are instruments of chance. \nEdo Karuta Coin will again be a high quality offering that we have and help us provide a different, more durable and tactile way to express our ideas. We are hoping to again ride on the wave of the EDC (Every Day Carry) movement where coins are an integral and essential part of the movement and present opportunities for our ideas to be carry around and ponder upon every time the coins are being handled.\n  Six Different Finishes for Edo Karuta Coin\n6 different finishes from left to right - Antique Silver, Satin Gold, Black Nickel, Antique Copper, Antique Brass, Antique Gold\nThe Edo Karuta Coins will be die struck out of of a base brass material by CoinsforAnything and are 2\u201d (approx. 50mm) in diameter. The coins will come in 6 finishes \u2013 Antique Silver, Antique Gold, Antique Copper, Antique Brass, Satin Gold and Black Nickel \u2013 and will feature smooth edges. All coins will be minted in USA.\nFUNDING GOAL // SGD$22,000 \nSTRETCH GOAL 1 // SGD$25,000 <CRUSHED PREMIUM STOCK>\nFor add-ons, you need to be already pledging for a reward.\nClick on \u2018Manage your pledge\u2019 and under the pledge amount of the reward you pledge, increase the amount accordingly to each of the add-ons price (see below).\nHelp us with this process by dropping us a message after you have adjust your pledge to include the add-ons with the details of your add-ons.\nRespond to the post campaign survey asking you for the details of your add-ons. If you have any question, do feel free to drop us a message as well.\n Group 1 Countries include US, SG, HK, UK, JP, DE and AU.\nEdo Karuta Coins are available in six different finishes.\nFlagrant Agenda started off in 2014, focusing on street fashion and serving as an outlet to express ourselves on issues that we feel strongly about. We have, since launching our first project in Kickstarter in 2017, transited to being a lifestyle label and exploring a wider range of apparels and products. A strong focus on graphics and illustrations with a contemporary and urban overtone continues to be our modus operandi.\nOur apparels and products are strongly driven by issues related to our surroundings, the environments we grew up in, what we encounter in our everyday lives and the society at large. On the fun side, we enjoy experimenting how these issues and themes can be realized visually. On the reflective end, we seek fulfilment in understanding how people who grew up and live in different cultures interpret these themes and gaining insights into similarities and differences in the way how people think.\nWe are grateful for all the support that we have gotten for the 3 projects that we have launched so far on Kickstarter - Agenda Playing Cards V1, Mini Agenda Playing Cards, Agenda Playing Cards Redux and Agenda Playing Cards Facade. Kickstarter is a wonderful platform that have extended our capacity to experiment with our ideas in ways that we could not have done before and, of course, provide platform to reach all of you who have supported us. On that note, we will continue to strive to explore and improve the way we bring our ideas to life.\nFollow on Instagram\nFollow on Twitter\nLike the Facebook page", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk to any project now is the ever changing situation related to COVID-19.

If the situation deteriorates, we promise to refund all the pledges and hope for a better time to relaunch our project.\n\nIf the project is going ahead, we sincerely seek your understanding if there is any minor hiccups along the way.

Del Fiore. Tangled decorations balance the rationality of the geometric shapes and stylized architectural elements complete the composition.\nFlorentia Antica Ace of Hearts, back and box.\n\"Florentia Nova instead was born as a free and dynamic artistic expression, without constraints or fear of the contrasts between ancient (or classical) and modern.\"\nThe back design combines a clean geometric basis with dynamic elements. Its beating heart is the coat of arms of the Medici family, which is supported by two cherubs and surrounded both by a dancing ribbon and a laurel leaves frame.\nFlorentia Nova Ace of Hearts, back and box.\nFrom the sketch to the final Ace of Spades of Florentia Nova.\nThe Jokers of Florentia Antica are Giotto, one of the most famous Italian painters and architects (legend says he was able to draw a perfect circle by hand) and the \"Marzocco\", the heraldic lion and symbol of the city of Florence.\nThe Jokers of Florentia Nova are Leonardo Da Vinci - he needs no introduction: a 360\u00b0 genius in many fields - and the \"Porcellino\" (Italian \"piglet\"). This figure is the main subject of THE Florence fountain par excellence, which is linked to good fortune according to a special popular tradition that will be soon presented in our project updates.\nThe court cards of Florentia Antica and Florentia Nova are all different... and definitely full of surprises.\nA comparison between the KoC of Florentia Antica and Florentia Nova, Dante Alighieri and Giovanni dalle Bande Nere.\nA comparison between the QoH of Florentia Antica and Florentia Nova, inspired by sculptures made by Bartolini (from Prato) and Cecioni (from Florence).\n\nIt has become a tradition for Passione Playing Cards to produce a luxury double-deck tuck case, shaped like a book, which is a work of art in its own. Florentia Aeterna will hold both Florentia Antica and Florentia Nova cards together in a limited, hand-numbered edition.\nFlorentia Aeterna double tuck case.\nFlorentia Aetena back and front view, plus a detail of the art print.\nThe Florentia Aeterna (eternal, timeless) tuck case is the evolution of Acheronte and Pinocchio double boxes and will be printed by Archivio Tipografico in Italy (see Business Partners section) on very special stock. Whoever has acquired one of our previous double boxes already knows what to expect (top quality!) However, more information will be disclosed during the campaign.\nFlorentia Aeterna double tuck-case uncut sheet.\nAs a special feature, the uncut sheet shows a frame that would normally be cut.\n\nFlorentia Fine Art Prints enhance the quality and the detail of the illustrations which substantiate the decks. Printed on luxury paper, hand-numbered (only 99 available!) and signed by the author, the limited art prints are conveniently included in the top tiers (see the Rewards Description section).\nFlorentia Fine Art Print.\nFlorentia Fine Art Prints are 35cm x 50cm. Letterpress technique will be used to print them.\n  Details of Florentia Fine Art Print.\nBut now let\u2019s have a closer look at the two main decks.\nFlorentia Antica represents a classical and elegant vision of Florence. Touches of gold enrich the detailed black and white illustrations.\nDepicted in Florentia Antica, you can find important historical figures from Florence; as concerns the all custom aces, they represent some of the most iconic sculptures and monuments that you'd admire when visiting Florence \u2013 especially the so-called 'Loggia dei Lanzi'.\n  Hearts and Clubs of Florentia Antica.\nDiamonds and Spades of Florentia Antica.\n\nFlorentia Nova somehow represents the blooming of the Renaissance: innovation, dynamism, and freshness are the keywords. Unexpected neon touches add a modern look to the cards.\nDepicted in Florentia Nova you can find important historical figures from Florence; as concerns the all custom aces, they represent some of the most iconic sculptures and monuments that you'd remember after visiting the Italian city.\nHearts and Clubs of Florentia Nova.\nDiamonds and Spades of Florentia Nova.\nFlorentia Aeterna will be printed on cotton paper with gold foil and hot impression. The limited-edition tuck box will be hand-made in Italy by letterpress experts. \nFlorentia Aeterna double tuck case.\nThe following image is a rendered version of the Florentia Aeterna uncut double tuck case. You will be able to order it as an add-on item as well or find it conveniently included in the top rewards.\nFlorentia Aeterna tuck case.\nThe two decks are doubly protected: first with a wide lid that \"closes the book\" and then with two individual flaps.\nThe outer lid of the Florentia Aeterna double-deck reveals the individual illustrated flaps.\nThe double tuck case opens like a book and shows a technical drawing inspired by Santa Maria del Fiore.\nTo better understand the content of each tier, please check the following table.

Meanwhile, friction between Dr Frederick Treves and his friends comes to a head over his disastrous dabblings in the dark arts, and old enemies make an unwelcome return.\nAs always, thanks to our returning backers for your continuing support, we couldn't do this without you. And if you're new to our comic, a warm welcome to the sensational adventures of The Elephantman, the most remarkable human being ever to draw the breath of life! \nPuppets is a perfect jumping on point for new readers, but you can also check out the series from the beginning by downloading issue #1 for FREE.\nISSUE #9 PREVIEW\nCheck out the cover for issue 9, and the opening pages, all drawn by Luke. If you love them as much as we do, the artwork is available as pledge rewards.\nISSUE #10 COVER\nISSUE #11 COVER\n\nTHE WORLD OF MERRICK\nMerrick: The Sensational Elephantman is a Victorian penny dreadful pulp adventure comic set in 1880s' London. Based on a fictional version of the life of Joseph Merrick, it steps between historical facts and turn of the century folklore juxtaposed with the superhero comic conventions of super powers, masks, secret identities and fantastic adventures.\n\n\n\nQUALITY COMICS\nIf you've encountered any of our physical issues of Merrick I'm sure you have noticed the print quality and the nice distinctive feel they have, it's something we feel really passionate about.\nWe're striving to make every issue of Merrick something special, an item that you will want to keep. These are not disposable comics.\nBoth issues are beautifully presented, full colour, standard US size comics printed on heavy stock 120GSM uncoated bond paper. Issue #9 is 24 pages, #10 is 20 pages, #11 is 28 pages, all plus covers.\nAs with all single issues of Merrick, issue's #9 - #11 will be limited numbered runs of 500 never to be reprinted with the same cover.\nA maximum of 2 print runs for each issue.\nAll single issues are shipped bagged and boarded to ensure they reach you looking as great as they went out.\nWe'll also send you digital versions of each issue in .pdf and .cbr formats so you can enjoy issues of Merrick on the move on your tablet, smartphone or PC.\nAlthough issue #1 of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman is completely sold out, there is still a chance to build an impressive collection of single issues by picking up copies of #2 - #8 with less than 60 copies of Merrick #2 left!\nDon't worry about missing any of the story, you can download issue #01 in .PDF/.CBR absolutely free. \nGetting up to 11 issues is a huge achievement for any comic series. We're super excited to be making more books. Everything we've published to date is available on this Kickstarter.\n\nTHE TEAM\nTom Ward: Writer and creator of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman. Tom is also co-creator and writer of Doc Dino and has been published in Comichaus, The Grime, British Showcase Anthology and has a story in Rum Row later this year. @highbrowtrash  \nLuke Parker: Artist, colourist, designer and co-creator of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman. You may have also seen his work on SEX, or The Winternational (Image Comics), or Halloween Eagle (Dark Horse Comics). @artofparker www.artofparker.com \nMicah Myers: As a freelance comic book letterer, Micah has lettered a host of comics for Image, Dark Horse, IDW, and many more. @micahmyers\nClare Lenton: Freelance editor and senior content designer, with a Masters degree in English Literature, specialising in Gothic literature. @ClareLenton\nTHANK YOU\nThanks to the amazing Kickstarter community, we have been able to create and release the first 8 issues of Merrick, a one-shot spin-off; Treves: A Restless Night and a special cross-over issue; Merrick & Crowe: Birds of Prey. \nWe love making this comic, and we think it keeps getting better as a series as we learn and improve as creators, and we have you guys to thank for that for giving us these opportunities.\nNow it's time to continue Joseph Merrick's story so we've returned to Kickstarter to hopefully fund the fourth arc.\nAll our books, plus prints and t-shirts, are available at our webstore www.merrickcomic.co.uk or digitally over at Comixology. \nWHAT THE REVIEWS SAY\n\"In each issue, you can feel the love, sweat, and tears the team put into their work. Although the art and some story beats take inspiration from Mike Mignola and some Hellboy, it stands apart creating its own history in indie comics, and it'll carve out its own slice in your heart and brain, making you crave more of the world.\" - www.comicbookyeti.com\n\"the art and story in Merrick grows with confidence in every issue and with each arc Ward and Parker find their voice more and more \u2013 as well as feeling free to experiment with where the story is heading. The artwork also becomes more imaginative and iconic (and less derivative), with Parker creating this dark and angular style which manages to perfectly evoke Victorian London, but also has a modern edge to it at the same time. A book that really definitely deserves the use of the word sensational!\" -www.pipedreamcomics.co.uk\n\"Merrick started off as a character surrounded by myths who I felt I had half an idea of where this adventure could go \u2013 but the creative team have surprised me time & again and that\u2019s made me come back to the title to re-read, rediscovery and enjoy.  A great character that has been filled up with endless potential thanks to Tom & Luke and eight issues in there\u2019s still so much more for it to give.  Can\u2019t wait for issue nine and beyond.\" - ComicsAnonymous", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not my first, second, or indeed third rodeo, this is my EIGHTH Kickstarter.\n\nI have delivered on all my previous projects, and things are a fairly well oiled machine at this point. The art for issue #9 is already completed, and will be heading to be lettered as I type this.\n\nI've scheduled in plenty of breathing room on the completion date and I will always keep you updated on our progress.\n\nI love making this comic, it really is a passion project for me and I am 100% dedicated to getting it finished and out to you all.\n\nObviously the COVID-19 pandemic is currently making things somewhat unpredictable. Currently the UK post offices are still open and our printer is still working, but these things could change. Digital issues will of course go out as they are ready.

My sketchbooks are filled with silly things that I like to draw. A few months ago I found myself drawing apes as they would appear in the line waiting to get through airport security. Wouldn\u2019t that make a marvelous jigsaw puzzle?\nWhy a jigsaw puzzle? Puzzles are great because you can do them alone or with others. You get to set the pace. You can do the whole puzzle in one marathon session or drag the effort out over weeks. Solving a puzzle sharpens your cognitive skills and helps you learn to focus on details. Snapping a puzzle piece into position feels good and probably releases a flood of endorphins. How nice. And jigsaw puzzles don\u2019t require any batteries, instruction manuals, or wifi.\nMore than 100 primates and a few aliens being extruded through the indignities of air travel.\nWhat makes a puzzle great? I believe the best jigsaw puzzles have three vital qualities. First, lots of color. Next, oodles of details. No boring expanses of sky or snow. Last, a good puzzle is puzzling\u2014a little mysterious and full of false clues, duplicates, and distractions.\nI designed the APES AND ALIENS puzzle to give you abundant colors, beguiling details, and mild mystery. \nHow big is the finished puzzle? There are 1,000 puzzle pieces. Once you put the Apes and Aliens puzzle together, it will measure 19.75\" x 29\" (50 cm x 70 cm).\nHow difficult is this puzzle? Challenging, but not so exasperating that you will have to be institutionalized. We included an overview of the whole image on the box lid and base, so you and a friend can both refer to it while working on the puzzle. If you believe the puzzle is too easy, try solving it without referring to the image on the box. If it is still too easy, do it blindfolded.\nPuzzles make great gifts because they are easy to wrap.\nWhere are these puzzles going to be made? These puzzles will be made at Sarah's XZY puzzle workshop in China. (We know that sounds like a made-up name, but it\u2019s real.) Printed on specially made, heavy puzzle board to prevent delaminating and reduce paper dust. Housed in a sturdy clear poly bag and nestled in a robust two-piece box with an image of the finished puzzle on both the lid and base. \nMy two previous jigsaw puzzles in Kickstarter were smaller. Now they are rare collectibles.\n*******\nShipping. The cost of shipping will be added to your pledge based on where you live. Because shipping is restricted during the Covid-19 pandemic, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, when global trade is restored, some extras of this puzzle will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get puzzles there.\nSometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your puzzles in their luggage next trip.\nIf you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\nShipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhat\u2019s going on?

We have fully stretched the game to perfection unlocking 15 Stretch Goals along the way that have upgraded all of the components, added some additional backstory cards, some mini expansions, a solo mode and expanded the Art Forgery case into a deeper experience.  We are looking forward to supporting Lawyer Up with a bunch of new case expansions down the line!\nClick the 'Late Pledge' button above and you'll be able to pledge/pre-order via Gamefound. Remember, this option will only be available for a limited time so act fast!\nIf you miss the Gamefound.com pledgemanager, you can visit our online store at https://shop.rockmanorgames.com to place a preorder (or just buy the game if it's available)\nIf you have any questions, be sure to check the FAQ or our most recent Kickstarter updates before messaging us directly!\nMeticulously designed and developed by Samuel W. Bailey (Forbidden Stars, Talisman: Cataclysm) and Mike Gnade (Maximum Apocalypse, the Few and Cursed) over the last 4 years, Lawyer Up is an asymmetrical two-player courtroom drama card game where one player is the noble prosecution and the other the steadfast defense. Each game begins with the Discovery phase, where players draft vital evidence to support their case and bury evidence that might help their opponent. Next comes the Trial phase, where players call witnesses and play powerful arguments along with the evidence they drafted into their examination pools. To form a coherent line of questioning, players will need to chain together their cards by matching bias symbols. The player who can best examine the Witness by generating the most influence will spend the difference to sway the Jury to their side. Every game is different, but the lawyer with the best case and most convincing arguments will be sure to get the verdict they are after!\nThe core game includes the base decks for both the prosecution and defense along with all the other components (jurors, bias tokens, etc) you need to play any case of Lawyer Up.  The core set also features two unique cases to play: The Art Forgery Case and the Murder Case.\nThe Art Forgery Case is a shorter case (6 Witnesses instead of 9) that focuses on learning the arguments and procedures in the base Prosecution and Defense decks.  It is all about drafting the paintings from famous Dutch painters and using the right evidence to replay them from discard piles.\nThe Murder Case is your modern Law and Order murder trial.  Jessica Fairmount was found standing over her father, covered in his blood, but insists that she was only trying to save him. The wealthy socialite has a lot to gain with her father's murder, but did she do it? This case features major asymmetry between the Prosecution (who can lock jurors to their side) and the Defense. The Prosecution must get all the Jurors to believe she is guilty while the Defense only needs one Juror to believe in her innocence for reasonable doubt.  \nLawyer Up is divided into two phases, the discovery and trial phases.  The discovery phase is a drafting phase representing both attorneys working back at their offices going through all the evidence of the case. During this phase, players simultaneously draw 3 cards and add one card to their deck, one card to their opponents deck and bury the last card.  This means that every time that you play a case, your deck will be unique.\nPlayers will not only draft unique decks, they will also select their legal strategies and Witnesses.  The trial phase of the game is typically made up of 9 rounds of witness examinations. During this phase, players take turns calling witnesses and chaining together legal arguments fighting to win the witness and influence the jury.\nYou can only play cards from your hand that share at least 1 symbol with the card previously in your Examination.  You can't jump from legal argument to an emotional one, because that would confuse the jury.\nAs you win witnesses, the jury will be swayed more and more to your side.  Each case can have slightly different win conditions, but in general whoever wins the most witnesses will have the jury on their side and win the case.\nFor the first time ever, Rock Manor Games has two deep thematic expansions already developed and available as part of this campaign!  Each expansion offers up new mechanics and win conditions - while staying true to the drafting and easy to learn card play of the core game.\nBetween February 1692 and May 1693 more than two hundred people were accused of being witches in colonial Massachusetts. This case takes a look at this infamous time in America's history, where mass hysteria is taking hold of the judicial system.\nThe Witch trial features over 80 unique illustrations by Abigail Larson whose art beautifully captures the time period.  The Witch Trial does away with the jury and is instead lead by an angry mob who is ready to hang anybody they believe is a witch. The goal of the Prosecution is to hang 3 witnesses as witches before they run out of cards.  The defense is scrambling to keep the mob under control and prevent a full blown witch hunt!\nThis case transports you back to Atlantic City in the 1920s where Carmine Monacelli is put on trial for conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act.  Carmine is accused of operating a network of criminals involved in bootlegging, murder, gambling and more - but he's a powerful man in AC so it's going to take more than some Federal Prohibition Agents to take down this Godfather. \nThe Godfather expansion features over 80 unique illustrations by Nabetse Zitro and introduces a Dossier deck. As players win witnesses, they are able to reveal or discard the top card of the Dossier deck.  The prosecution needs to prove Carmine's Mafia connections by revealing these Dossier cards while avoiding the powerful criminal activities such as \"Jury Tampering\" and \"Swim with the Fishes\" that the defense has shuffled into the deck.  \nWhile these expansions are planned for retail release, we plan on spreading out their release over a few months.  Kickstarter backers will get everything first! well before any of it enters retail and distribution.\n Tons more previews in the playlist below!\nRetailers \nWe love to work with retailers from all around the world. Brick and Mortar Retailers who back at our retailer pledge will receive an early demo copy of the Art Forgery case to promote Lawyer Up in their store.  The demo copy will be ordered shortly after the campaign ends and produced in the USA with the Game Crafter (most of the videos above feature such a prototype).  The shipping associated with this pledge is for the prototype only.  All orders for the actual game will be handled outside of Kickstarter.\nSomeone from Rock Manor Games will contact you after the Kickstarter to help you with your personalized order.  Retailers are NOT required to pay for their orders upfront, we simply invoice you for your order and ask that you pay the invoice before Kickstarter fulfillment commences (~6 months later).\nIf you're an online retailer or simply not interested in contributing on Kickstarter, signup as a retailer here. We will email you closer to our retail release so that you can get Lawyer Up into your store.\nGroup Pledges\nWe do not have a specific Pledge Level for Group Pledges and plan on handling this in our Pledge Manager.  If you have a group of friends and are looking to pledge for at least 6 copies of Lawyer Up, message us on our website at rockmanorgames.com/contact and select the Subject \"Group Pledge\".  You will need to make sure you pledge for at least 1 base game here on Kickstarter and then we will import you as a group pledge into the pledge manager after the campaign is completed.\nWhen our pledge manager is sent out via email, you will be asked to fill in your address and you will be charged for shipping at that time.  You must fill out the pledge manager and pay for shipping to receive your reward.  We know that high shipping costs are the worst, so we are offering a $5 shipping discount to all of our Kickstarter Backers. Here are our estimated shipping costs for this project. Keep in mind these are just estimates based on our 2020 shipping rates and costs could change based on a variety of circumstances.\n1: Lower 48 States\n2: Canada, Hawaii and Alaska\n3: Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, and Switzerland\n 4: Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam \n 5: Rest of World does not include Afghanistan, Brazil, Bolivia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Niger, North Korea, Russia, South Africa, Syria, Somalia, Yemen. \nWe have key fulfillment partners in the US, Canada, Australia, China and the EU and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT. We have typically shipped EU rewards from a German depot. For this campaign, it's possible we may ship UK rewards from within the UK if necessary We'll make this decision as we get closer to fulfillment, based on the fees/customs/taxes after Brexit has occurred.  If you have any specific shipping questions before pledging, please message us on Kickstarter.\nAbout the Team\nGame published by Rock Manor Games, owned and operated by Mike Gnade.

I thought it was a typo and they added an extra zero.  After talking to 2 different UK fulfillment partners, I have discovered that not only was the quote correct but it's the result of some BREXIT policy changes with VAT calculation that start January 2021.  TLDR your government requires us to prepay 20% VAT on the MSRP.  That leaves us in the predicament of either shipping everything from the EU (and having you deal with VAT/customs/import etc) or figuring out a way to invoice and collect the VAT fees for each UK backer and then shipping from within the UK.  I'm currently investigating ways to best handle this unfortunate reality.  I feel the best result would be to figure out a way to invoice everyone in the UK for the VAT based on their order so it can ship UK friendly, but we could also just ship from the EU and see how it goes (no one really knows with BREXIT looming).

I recently retired from the United States Army.  I served two tours in Afghanistan and two in Iraq as an infantry officer.  I am frustrated by the poor outcomes of both those wars - in great part because we repeated the mistakes of Vietnam.  The Vietnam generation did a fantastic job of recording the lessons of that war in books; yet those books had little impact on Afghanistan and Iraq.  The purpose of this project is to transmit lessons from the war in Afghanistan to current and future generations through video. \nTo accomplish this, I will read The History of The Peloponnesian War, written by Thucydides, and consider how it applies to the Afghanistan War.  The History of The Peloponnesian War is divided into eight books, and I will make one video for each book.  In each video I will orient the viewer to the text and then I will let Thucydides' narrative draw out my experiences in Afghanistan.  By considering my combat tours through the lens of The History of The Peloponnesian War I will highlight some lessons that are relevant for future conflicts.  Below is my video from Book One of The History of The Peloponnesian War: \nWhat do you receive for backing this project?\nYou receive a subscription to my videos in a course format on the Teachable platform.  The teachable platform will enable you to watch the videos, read and download my notes on your web browser or on a phone app.  As a backer, you will receive an exclusive video not available to the general public and I will list you in the credits.  You will also receive any stretch goals that are unlocked - see the stretch goal section below.  Please be aware that I will make the core videos and notes available for free to the general public on YouTube, my website, and Facebook because I want to educate as wide an audience as possible about the war.\nWho was Thucydides?  \nThucydides was an Athenian General who fought in the Peloponnesian War, the great Greek conflict between Athens and Sparta that lasted twenty-seven years, from 431-404 BC.  He was defeated by Sparta and then exiled by Athens.  He wrote his military history of the war as it happened, taking advantage of his exile to throughly research events. Because of the rigor he applied to his research, many believe Thucydides, and not Herodotus, is the Father of History, or they refer to Thucydides as the Father of Scientific History.  He is considered one of the great military philosophers.  Check out this white board \"explainer\" video about Thucydides:  \nThucydides Testimonials\n Thomas Jefferson wrote to John Adams in 1812: \"I have given up newspapers in exchange for Tacitus & Thucydides, for Newton & Euclid; & I find myself much the happier.\"  Reference.\nGeneral of the Army George C. Marshall said in 1947: \"[I doubt] whether a man can think with full wisdom and with deep convictions regarding certain of the basic international issues today who has not at least reviewed in his mind the period of the Peloponnesian War and the Fall of Athens.\u201d  Reference.   \nStretch Goals\n FUNDED!!! $250 (funding goal) = Nine Videos & Notes.  If the project is funded you will receive access to the course that you purchased on Teachable  (Thucydides Ponders Afghanistan or Sun Tzu Ponders Afghanistan).  I expect to release them in early August.  Each course will include nine video talks and pdf notes to accompany them.    \n FUNDED! $500 = Google Earth Flyovers.  The geography of the Peloponnesian War can be confusing for modern readers.  If we reach this funding level I will produce eight google earth flyovers to highlight the key locations.  The flyover videos and KMZ files will be available in Teachable.  Check out my effort below (which will be much improved with funds for professional help!): \nPLAY\n\nFUNDED! $750 =  Maps.  If we reach $750, I will add nine maps to help clarify key parts of Thucydides' narrative.  These maps will be available in Teachable.\n FUNDED! $1,250 = Infographics.  At this funding level, I will add nine infographics to illustrate some of my takeaways from the Afghanistan War.  These infographics will be available in Teachable. \n $2,500 =  Podcasts.  If we reach $2,500, I will have someone(s) interview me about my video and record the interview.  The audio files will be available in Teachable, and I will also let you know where to find them on podcast software.\n $4,000 = Video Transcription to Podcast.  At this funding level, I will have the audio from my video transcribed into a podcast.  The audio files will be available in Teachable, and I will also let you know where to find them on podcast software.\n $5,500 = White Board Videos.  At this funding level, I will add nine white board videos to help explain key concepts from The Peloponnesian War or my lessons from Afghanistan.  These videos will be included in the Teachable course.  Below is an example that I made myself where I discuss a lesson from the Iraq War drawn out by Sun Tzu's The Art of War.\nAbout John Lemay\nI recently retired after serving 25 years and 7 months in the United States Army.  My career began at West Point and upon graduation I became an infantry officer.  I did two tours in Afghanistan and two tours in Iraq.

The Athenians sent a huge expeditionary force to conquer the island.  The Spartans responded by sending a very small force to rally the Sicilians against their invaders.  The result - the complete destruction of the Athenian Expeditionary Force - changed the course of the Peloponnesian War, eventually resulting in Sparta' victory.

But I believe that President Bush's speech on April 17, 2002 at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) illustrates the basic US strategy for the following 19 years.  At that point US operations in Afghanistan had transitioned from CIA / Special Forces \"unconventional warfare\" to conventional warfare.  President Bush then made a speech at VMI, where George C. Marshall graduated from, on the occasion of awarding the George C. Marshall Award to ROTC Cadets, and then went on to compare the US occupation of Afghanistan with the post World War 2 Marshal Plan for Europe.  The US strategy was to prevent terrorists from using Afghanistan as a base for operations by creating a new Afghan government that was a Republic allied to the United States and equipping it with a military capable of controlling Afghanistan's territory.   To accomplish this the United States would implement a \"Marshal Plan for Afghanistan\".

Spartan strategy required two elements - controlling Attica with land forces and then controlling the Aegean Sea.  Sparta had the army to control Attica from the start of the war but it took them 27 years to achieve naval superiority in the Aegean.  In addition to building their own navy, they had to weaken Athens' navy.  There were two ways of doing this - the first was by winning naval battles.  But before the Athenian disaster in Sicily it was almost impossible for Sparta to defeat Athens at sea.  The second was by freeing Greek Cities from the Athenian Empire.  The Athenian Navy was enormously expensive and required the tribute of many Greek Cities to maintain.  It could be attritted by slowly depriving Athens of tribute."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "Fear, Honor and Interest Infographic", "update_content": "Team,\nHere is the first Thucydides Infographic by Luis!

Sparta voted for war after Athens, which had an eastern facing empire that dominated the Aegean Sea, moved westward into the Ionian Sea.

The blue \"Joan of Arc\" deck is the first in a series of six famous decks we plan to release in 2020...  \nThe very first transformation deck issued by Cotta is from 1805. This deck is probably the most famous of all six, and is incredibly scarce. Original illustrations were fiddling artworks done by hand, on copper plates that were manually engraved with stipple and etching, and the cards were printed on linen period stock that was 97 mm x 69 mm in size, with blank card backs and squared corners at that time. Only the court cards were hand-colored, while the number cards used red stencils.\nCotta\u2019s transformation cards were very successful and became a role model for later transformation decks from other publishers. And since the card backs were blank, individual cards were sometimes used by the nobility as visit cards and for leaving messages, so these playing cards often became multi-purpose items.\nThere are many historical values in the series of decks! But if you are only interested in the deck details & images instead of history & backstory, then please skip about half way down.\n The story behind these playing cards, which probably conceal the most of the world's playing card secrets, begins in T\u00fcbingen, a city in southwest Germany.\nThe atmosphere here is bursting with memories and experiences of the past. Visitors today can still enjoy the small stairs, narrow alleys, and pointed gables that shape the silhouette of old T\u00fcbingen on the way to its famous castle. T\u00fcbingen is home to one of Europe\u2019s oldest universities and even today combines the colorful bustle of an university town full of students with the flair of a restored medieval center and a touch of many ancient cultures. The Romans already left some traces of their presence here in AD 85, but the city itself dates from the 6th or 7th century. Little wonder that this city attracted many eminent notables and artists, who found it inspirational for their work. \n The idea behind the concept of Cotta's transformation decks was to create a series of six decks on an annual basis from 1805-1811. Each deck would focus on a different theme, with the first set based on Schiller's play Jeanne d'Arc, which was about the famous historical figure Joan of Arc. \nForming a \"Card Almanac\" (Karten Almanach), each card in the deck would represent one of the 52 weeks in a calendar year. At the time it was popular to print various almanacs, which were special pocket books for the new year, and often included a short poem or quote for each week of the calendar year. It was a logical move to connect each of these 52 weeks with a playing cards.\nJohann Friedrich Cotta (*April 27, 1764 - December 29, 1832), publisher, industrial pioneer, and politician, the man at the helm of family publishing house J. G. Cotta (founded yet in late 17th century by his grandfather Johann Georg Cotta *1631 - 1692) from T\u00fcbingen, Germany, around 1804 went on to produce a series of six playing card almanacs in successive years from 1805-1811, with a new deck appearing in all but one of those years. \nIn addition to Johann Friedrich Cotta's high standing as a publisher, he was a man of great practical energy, which flowed into various fields of activity, he promoted even many reforms and supported talented individuals. It is also noticeable that in such period of his life he published numerous works of his own literature, political materials, and also yearbooks.\nCotta did have the goal of replacing the \"inelegant\" designs of contemporary German playing cards with a more artistic high-quality deck. But these playing cards were not intended for playing games with in the first place, but rather for stimulating discussion about the \"themed\" images on each of the cards. Each year the court cards were designed to represent another theme, while the number cards featured pictures that were largely independent drawings without a common topic, since they were especially intended as conversation pieces and depicted happenings.\nThe Cotta's famous house was the place, where among other brilliant German authors of the time, the works of Schiller and later of Goethe were published there in its journal pages, as well as journal's major contributor was Heinrich Heine, who with his early lyric poetry has inspired even composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert who set his works into music... \nSo the picture that emerges from this time in Cotta's life is that he was constantly engaged in thoughtful conversation with literary men, and enjoyed close friendships with leading figures of the day like Schiller, Huber, Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel, and others, many of whose works he published.\nJohann Friedrich Cotta's long term friendship with the famous German poet, dramatist, philosopher, and historian Friedrich Schiller was well known. In 1795 Schiller and Cotta founded the Horen, a periodical that became important for students of German literature. Schiller's goal was to use his work to infuse higher ideas into the common lives of men, by giving them a nobler human culture, and \u201cto reunite the divided political world under the banner of truth and beauty.\u201d It was as a result of this relationship that Goethe became part of a close circle of friends with Cotta and Schiller. Even today there is evidence at Cotta's house of Goethe having slept there. \nIt is probably this friendship that gave birth to the idea of creating a unique decks of transformation playing cards with the purposes of igniting discussion about the \"themed\" picture on each card. This was after all a time when people were open to such ideas, and producing a series of playing cards as almanacs for a continuous period of years was a natural development.\nWith help from you the backers we plan to produce the entire 6 deck series! The color of each tuck box created by Azured Ox has been inspired by Goethe's experimental optic and color theory, since Goethe was an important contemporary of Cotta, along with Schiller. (Goethe's deepest immersion into colors was during Cotta's decks issuing.)\nLimited Edition Decks\nStandard Edition Decks\nGoethe\u2019s spent years on his theory (built on wavelength theory of light broken into 7 colors demonstration after Newton), which became a personal obsession in his last years, and which he considered more important than his literary works.\nGoethe believed that colors arise from the interaction between light and darkness, light and dark edges along the spectrum; that colors are realities, phenomena of nature... His color theory was intended to be a paradigmatic model for natural science in general, and Goethe was concerned with the psychological effects of each color, as well.\nHe believed that colors symbolize different values and that colors have a clear effect on the mind and feelings. Goethe had little use for concepts of divinity or for systematic thinking. His theory formulated a psychological and philosophical account of the way we actually experience color as a phenomenon.\nMuch of historical happenings, influences and activities would later find a place in the Cotta decks, including events in the life of Cotta's own family and of notable figures like Schiller and Goethe. Other important influences include the literature, art, history, politics (e.g. Napoleon's invasion), and religious reforms of the time, which all served as an important context to shape the art in the decks themselves. \nFor example, Schiller experienced a grave illness that led to his death, and this around as well as many more is even depicted in the playing cards from the Cotta decks. In short, there is significant evidence of such connections between the artistic pictures and the immediate context that produced them.\nIt is especially significant for the way it displays meaningful and inspirational happenings from the time; in this first deck, such as Schiller on his death-bed (Six of Clubs) or sadness of Goethe (probably depicted on Nine of Clubs), assumed depictions from life of noble families, etc...\n First almanac deck: Jeanne d'Arc (Year 1805) \nThe images on the court cards are characters inspired by Schiller's play \"Die Jungfrau von Orleans\" (\"Joan of Arc\"). \nThe central figure of Joan of Arc is depicted as the Queen of Spades, the Maid of Orleans who inspired the French army to victory, but was later burned at the stake.\nFeatures:\nPrinted by USPCC on Classic Stock\nPoker Size\nEmbossed Finish\n52 Cards + 2 Extra Jokers + 2 Extra Collectible Cards\nMetallic Ink On Box & Backs\nCustom Numbered Seals\nPuzzle Image on all Tuck Spines of the Series\nDigitally Hand-Recreated and Designed by Azured Ox\n Produced By Will Roya \nCotta's first deck was designed by Countess Mary Day von Jennison-Walworth (sometimes spelled with a single `n'). Her maiden name was Beauclerk, and she was the wife of Count Francis Jenison Walworth (1764\u20131824). She was an illegitimate (twin) child who led a very colorful life, and finally settled down somewhat after marrying Count Francis in 1797. (Probably, she was creating illustrations in Stuttgart.)\nWe are limiting this 1st deck to only 1,000 copies with numbered seals. We may print a small amount additional decks without seals to meet demand or for a special edition. \nThe entire 6 deck series is in many ways designed by Azured Ox to meet collector's demand (as \"collection of historical books\") and will be produced with the piece of puzzle image on each tuck spine (left side of box) to create together nice display of the Tuebingen monument surroundings, where the idea for Cotta's decks was born. \nThe publisher's name was placed on the Ace of Clubs as follows: \"A Tubinge chez J. G. Cotta, Libraire.\"\nThe transformations on the number cards have no reference to each other or to the court cards (as well lots of them might be considered as unexplained mystery).\nThe court cards were designated with the words \"Valet\", \"Dame\", and \"Roi\", which are the French terms corresponding to the Jack, Queen, and King.\nIn the first deck, beside Joan of Arc depicted as the Queen of Spades, other individuals closely associated with Joan include Etienne de Vignolles or La Hire (Jack of Hearts), who helped Joan to victory in the battle of Patay in 1429; and Raymond (Jack of Diamonds), a peasant who was Joan's page.\nKey political leaders who figured prominently in the events surrounding Joan's life are also represented, including King Charles VII (King of Hearts), the French monarch who relied on Joan's help to reach the Rhiems, the traditional place of coronation; Charles' mother Isabeau (Queen of Hearts), who was in league with Charles' enemy; Charles' mistress Agnes Sorel (Queen of Diamonds); Charles' opponent Philippe the Good (King of Diamonds), an ally of England; and the king of Naples, Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou (King of Clubs), who lost the kingdom after defeat in battle. General Talbot (King of Spades) was the English commander of the outpost of Orleans at Saint Loup, who was wounded in battle, captured, and was part of a prisoner exchange.\nBoth Joan's \"sister\" Louison (Queen of Clubs) and Montgomery (Jack of Clubs) are fictional creations of Schiller, while the fictional Lionel (Jack of Spades) is the character who holds up Joan's sword in a location revealed by the voices that she supposedly heard telling her to help.\n Clubs: Montgomery, Louison (Joan's fictional sister), Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou (King of Sicily) \nDiamonds: Raimond (villager), Agnes Sorel (Charles' mistress), Philippe de Bourgogne \nHearts: Etienne de Vignolles (La Hire), Isabeau de Baviere (Charles' mother), Charles VII (King of France) \nSpades: Lionel (knight), Joan of Arc, Talbot\nAt last we came with an idea to reflect opposite of noble life and to bring closer to you even more of the unique artistic history placed on extra collectible playing cards...\nAlso we thought it could be interesting to put another illustrations from the far past on the additional extra cards, in respect to year almanacs, we came with an idea of twelve calendar months in the series as exclusive collection of unique historical artworks...\nAn absolutely original playing card masterpiece to hang on your wall (double sided)\n New Standard Deck Rewards\n Please note: Limited edition decks are no longer available for add-on.

The Deck will NOT be available elsewhere\n Limited Print Run, by the Legends Playing Card Co. \n54 Completely Custom Playing Cards. Each Card have Original illustrations \nPrinted on the Classic Finish (which is the highest quality card stock that Legends Playing Card Co. has to offer)\nTuck box is Shadow Black with Amber Orange Foil [SUCCESS] Stretch Goal #1\nCard Back with Shiny Amber Metallic Ink (54 cards) [SUCCESS] Stretch Goal #2\n Limited Antique Brass DEALER COIN, Made in the USA \nShipped from the USA by the Gambler's Warehouse \nLimited Dealer Coin available now!\nLet's dive now into the deepest imagination and fears of the ancient Greek civilization with \"SKOTOS\" (\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 from Ancient Greek \"Darkness\" ) :\n Silenus was the old rustic god of wine-making, companion and tutor to the god Dionysus. It was believed that he acquired arcane knowledge and was able to predict the future. He plays an important role in the myth of King Midas and his lust for gold.\n The Sphinx was sent by the gods to plague the town of Thebes as punishment for some ancient crime, preying on its youths and devouring all who failed  to solve her riddle. She's involved in the infamous myth of the Theban prince Oedipus.\n Every day this giant wild boar would come crashing down from his lair on the mountain of Erymanthos, attacking men and animals all over the countryside, gouging them with its tusks, and destroying everything in its path. It's connected to the myth of the Twelve Labours of Heracles.\n The Aetos Kaukasios is a giant eagle that was summoned by Zeus to be used in the punishment of Prometheus. Prometheus was chained to the top of a mountain so that every day the Eagle would fly to him and eat out his liver. Since he was immortal, his liver would regrow and would be eaten out the next day.\n She was a Gorgon, a chthonic female monster, and a daughter of Phorcys and Ceto. Gazing directly upon her would turn men to stone. She was beheaded by the hero Perseus, using the sword Harpe, who thereafter used her head as a weapon until he gave it to the goddess Athena to place on her shield.\n Cerberus the three Headed Dog was the multi-headed dog who guarded the gates of the Underworld, preventing the dead from leaving, and making sure that those who entered never left.\nIt's a monstrous lion and could not be killed with mortal weapons because of its golden fur which made him impervious to attacks. The creature's claws were sharper than conventional swords and could cut through any armor. It was slain by Heracles as part of the first labour, which earned him the Nemean Lion's hide.\nThe Chimera is a mixed beast from Greek lore whose body typically consists of various bits of a lioness, a goat, and a serpent. It is known to breathe fire while the snake portion is venomous.\n The Cyclops Polyphemus was encountered by Odysseus and his crew, and instead of helping them, he ate and killed various members of the crew and trapped the rest in his cave. When Polyphemus slept, Odysseus blinded him with a wood stick in retaliation of what he did.\n Chiron the Centaur was notable for his youth-nurturing nature. His personal skills tend to match those of his foster father Apollo, who taught the young centaur the art of medicine, herbs, music, archery, hunting, gymnastics and prophecy, and made him rise above his beastly nature.\n Its lair was the lake of Lerna in the Argolid. Lerna was reputed to be an entrance to the Underworld, and archaeology has established it as a sacred site older than Mycenaean Argos. In the canonical Hydra myth, the monster is killed by Heracles as the second of his Twelve Labors.\n He was the offspring of the Cretan Queen Pasiphae and a majestic bull. Due to his monstrous form, King Minos ordered to build a huge maze known as the Labyrinth to house the beast. The Minotaur remained inside receiving offerings of youths and maidens to eat. He was killed by the Athenian hero Theseus.\n Pegasus remained a mysterious creature capable of everything, symbolizing the divine inspiration or the journey to heaven, since riding him was synonymous to \u201cflying\u201d to the heavens. It was represented as a goodhearted, gentle creature, somewhat naive but always eager to help.\nFor his service and loyalty, Zeus honored him with a special immortality turning Pegasus into a constellation on the last day of his life.\nPIPS of Skotos are inspired by genuine ancient Greek symbols discovered on pottery Art, Shields and Armours decorations.\nTo stick with ancient greek aesthetic, I have chosen the Orange/Red Cinnabar and Brown Sienna colors to contrast with a slight Pentelicus marble effect. To embellish and balance the Design, each card is represented with two Ionic columns with the respective greek number on top of it.\nThis superb tuck box illustrates ancient Greek Patterns and symbolism such as Greek Keys, Waves of the Mediterranean sea, Flowers and Sun decoration.\nYou also notice the shield looking part with the capital Lambda (\u039b) referring to \u039b\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd, which was the Hellenic name of the Spartans. Athenians did the same thing, putting an alpha (\u0391) on their shields as a symbol for Athens \u1f08\u03b8\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9.\n As you can see the overall look is directly inspired by the distinguished ancient \"Red-Figure\" Art, one of the most important styles of figural Greek painting. I have chosen Premium Amber Foil and Shadow Black Paper to render this authentic aesthetic for SKOTOS | Amber Foil unlocked with Stretch Goal #1 [SUCCESS] \n The cards back let you appreciate a meticulous sense of detail with Greek Keys, Waves of the Mediterranean sea, Flowers, Sun, the renowned Laurel Wreath and the enigmatic maze structure designed to hold the Minotaur : The legendary Labyrinth of Knossos | Amber Metallic Ink unlocked with Stretch Goal #2 [SUCCESS] \n Dealer Coin can be added to any pledge\nSide 1 : SKOTOS\n  \"SKOTOS\" (\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 from Ancient Greek \"Darkness\" ) decorated with ancient Patterns and symbols such as Greek keys, flowers, Dory spears, and olive leaves.\nSide 2 :  Athenian Hoplite Helmet\n  Heroic Athenian Hoplite Helmet decorated with ancient Dory spears, olive leaves, and greek keys. Hoplites were courageous heavy infantry citizen-soldiers and Athens was the richest and most famous city-state in ancient Greece.\nAfter you have backed the project at your  chosen reward tier,  click on the \"Manage my Pledge\" button at the  right, and increase your  pledge by the \u20ac Euro amount of your chosen  Dealer Coins\nAntique Brass Dealer Coins are limited metal coins with a large Diameter of 2 inches (50mm).

As a way to bring a smile to the faces of our customers, I learned a few VERY SIMPLE card illusions (\"tricks are what whores do for money\" -Gob Bluth). During the process I fell in love with playing cards, magic, and cardistry. Short story long, I talked to some WONDERFUL individuals (including Brendan Hong and Gio aka Thirdway) and they inspired me to create a deck for the pharmacy. I reached out to an incredible illustrator, Russell Gray, and after almost a year of brainstorming and countless adjustments, we created the Meadowlark Deck. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.\nIf you find yourself in Lincoln (Nebraska), I encourage you to take a 10 minute detour south and visit the pharmacy. I would love to see your cardistry moves and card illusions!\nQUICK OVERVIEW:\nPrinted by United States Playing Card Company on Art of Play trademark stock and finish\n Metallic Copper Ink \nFully CUSTOM Back Design, Court Cards, Pips, Aces, and Jokers\nFulfillment by Art of Play \nShipment estimated to begin in October 2020 \n GIVEAWAYS!!!! Follow @meadowlarkdecks on Instagram\n**NOTE: All images are renderings. Final product is subject to change**\n******** UPDATED April 12, 2020 ********\nLUXURY EDITION NOW AVAILABLE!!!!\nThe cards will be printed by Cartamundi. The card backs will be cold foiled with yellow gold (replacing the yellow of the standard card back). The tuck box will be printed in Greece by Lotrek (Oath Playing Cards) and will be double foiled (with yellow gold and copper foil). The bottom of the tuck box will be hand numbered. This edition will be limited to no more than 400. The price for the Luxury Edition deck will be $35.\nCUSTOM HALF-BRICK BOX UNLOCKED!!!! \nCopper foil on a black paper with a small amount of white to bring it all together. For every 6 decks that you pledge, it will be shipped in one of these half-brick boxes. For example, if you are a \"Full Brick\" tier backer, then you will receive 2 half-brick boxes with 6 Standard Edition decks each. If you are a \"Triple Deck\" tier backer and add on 3 of the Deluxe Editions (unlocking soon?), then you will receive 1 half-brick box containing 3 Standard Edition decks and 3 Deluxe Edition decks.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.\nDELUXE EDITION UNLOCKED!!!!\nCopper foil on a black paper stock with the yellow and white as the accent colors. Inside will be a yellow gilded deck! We are doing our best to match the yellow from the deck with the gilding, so it might be more of a yellow gold to make sure that it is shiny (see render below). The Deluxe Edition decks are available as an add-on for $30 per deck.\n****Remember! The Deluxe Edition Deck will be added for FREE as a 13th deck for all \"Special Brick\" Tier backers.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBACK DESIGN\nThe poker-style back design intended to take the Bicycle Rider Back and give it a retro yet modern feel. The Meadowlark was drawn in a fashion to be cohesive with the rest of the deck including the court cards, Ace of Spade, and Jokers. The back design is perfect for magicians, cardists, poker players, and art enthusiasts alike.\nCOURT CARDS\nThe goal with the court cards was to give the traditional courts a modern update while maintaining a retro feel. Keeping with the theme of Meadowlark Pharmacy, we mixed some subtle (and some less subtle) items into each court card. We hope that you enjoy finding them as much as we enjoyed adding them.\n\nJOKERS\nTruth be told, the jokers were one of the hardest things to nail down. There were multiple versions, but when Russ sent me these I was so excited that we had the perfect jokers for the deck.\nI mean... how cute are these guys?! Am I right?????\nACES\nThe number cards will have a standard layout with custom pips (we got a little crazy with the prototype). For the Aces we wanted to continue to tie together the rest of the deck, making it feel custom yet functional. Which one is your favorite?\n\nTUCK BOX\nThe tuck box will be a matte finish stock with embossing as seen in the picture below. These custom tucks will be produced by Clove Street Press.\nSTRETCH GOALS (UPDATED)\n $9,000 [UNLOCKED] = Upgrade tuck box to have copper foil replace the copper ink\n $12,500 [UNLOCKED] = Custom Half Brick Boxes and Seal (see pictures below)\n $15,000 [UNLOCKED] = Deluxe Edition with gilded deck will be available as Add-On for $30 per deck \n Giveaways will be held (more info on Instagram so follow us @meadowlarkdecks)\n\nADD-ONS\nPosters and Postcards:\nShashin with Masuta Design (@masutadesigns on IG) has designed a beautiful \"RX\" poster! I just received the postcard sized prototypes for the 2 posters we will offer and I LOVE THEM. The posters are 11x17 and will be numbered and signed. Each poster is limited to 25 and will cost $25 (for USA) and $28 (for International). The postcards will come as a set of 2 (one of each) and will be $8. You can add these on by managing your pledge and adjusting the pledge amount accordingly.  Please be sure to message me so I can keep a total count of the posters sold and let everyone know when no more posters are available.\nHere is the Postcard Sized Prototype of the RX Poster (playing card added in picture to show scale)\nHere is the Postcard Sized Prototype of the Initial Design of the King of Hearts (playing card added in picture to show scale and final design)\nDeck Protector created by Retro Rocketeers:\nThis is a full wrap deck protector made from Eco-friendly Bio-plastic and hand finished with gold leaf paint. The edges are beveled for extra comfort in your hands and when carried in your pocket. The deck (including tuck box) slides in from the top and the bottom has a hole so you can push the deck up and remove it easily. The pictures don't do it justice but I hope that you can at least get an idea. The cost is $25 and can be added by simply clicking on \"Manage your pledge\" and adding $25 onto your total. Please message me after this to inform me that you are adding one onto your pledge so I can make sure that I have all the proper information during fulfillment.\nAdditional Decks:\nWould you like more Standard Edition decks? Really?!?! WOW!! Thank you!! Simply add $15 onto your current pledge. This will include shipping, so no need to add more than that. If you want more than that please message me and I will let you know how much to add (will give a little discount with multiple decks).\n**If you have any troubles or if you have any questions, please message me and I will be happy to assist you**\nFulfillment\nFulfillment will be handled by Art of Play.

I apologize for my ignorance and for my broken promise of yellow gilding. I have worked continuously with the gilders and Art of Play regarding foils and what we can use (ie- different gold colors), and after multiple failures, we decided to go with a copper gilding.

The first launch of this kickstarter was unfortunately unsuccessful, but I am optimistic that we can make to the goal this time! \nThe Beekeeper's Playing Cards\nThe Beekeeper's Playing Cards is a custom, fully illustrated poker card deck which I have been designing on and off for the past two years. What started out as four prototype card designs for a class assignment has become an amazing journey of learning and experiences. Now that I have finished every hand-painted illustration, I am overjoyed to finally have the opportunity to share them with you!\nWhy bees?\nThe fuzzy little creatures that buzz around in your garden are often overlooked as just another stinging pest. Many people just assume all of  the yellow and black-striped insects are out to get them, when really, they are all different and each play an important role in the ecosystem. Honey bees, one of the leading pollinators, are crucial to the  environment, but their population is declining. I hope to spread awareness of the significance that these adorable flying fluff-balls hold for our survival.\nThe Cards\nEvery card in the deck contains a detailed illustration, hand-painted in watercolors.\nEach individual illustration was carefully planned and designed to thoroughly represent its assigned card.\nThe King features the worker bee, as they are the ones truly in control of the colony. All female, these worker bees have the power to overthrow the queen and raise a new one, if they so desired.\nThe Queen is, of course, the queen bee. She is the most important bee in the hive, as she is the only one who can lay fertilized eggs, which create worker bees.\nThe Jack is represented by the Drone. The only males in the hive, the drones' primary function is to mate with the queen.\nEach Ace features a different style of man-made bee hives used by beekeepers throughout history and around the world.\nThe types of honey bees\nThe four suits have been redesigned from the traditional pips to represent different plants that honey bees love to frequent. Each number card features its suit's plant, with its respective number of bees and corresponding flowers for them to pollinate.\nThe Diamonds have been re-imagined as crimson clover.\nThe Hearts are made up of crocuses.\nThe Spades have become the blossoms of teasels.\nAnd finally, the Clubs, which are envisioned as white clover, complete the set.\nDiamonds\nHearts\nSpades\nClubs\nOn the Joker cards is \"The Busy Bee\", who spends all of her time making delicious honey.\nJoker\nOn the back of the cards is a honeycomb pattern. This will be printed right to the edges, so there will be no white space or margins. \nBack of cards\nEach deck of cards will come in its very own tuck box.\nTuck box cover\nManufacturing\nThe cards will be professionally made in the USA by The United States Playing Card Company. For more information on the company, you can visit their website at https://usplayingcard.com/about-us/\nOther Backer Rewards\nFor the reward tiers that include signed artwork prints, here are some examples of what they may look like. Frame styles and colors may vary, depending on availability in the coming months, but I will try to keep them as close to the samples as possible. The frames will all have a wood-grain finish, and the prints will be matted. The prints will be full size of the original illustrations (aside from the worker and drone bees, which will be scaled to the correct ratio next to the queen. The queen, however, will be full sized, measuring about 3 inches tall), making them about 20-30% larger than what is on the cards. The largest of the illustrations, \"The Busy Bee\", measures about 4 inches in height.\nThe Busy Bee sample\nHives sample\nHoney Bees sample", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with viewing anything online, colors may vary from the physical product. This is due to different devices having different color settings, as well the fact that computer screens display color using light (RGB), while printers create color using pigment (CMYK). I will do all I can to keep everything as true to the original colors as possible, but unfortunately that is the nature of reproducing traditional artwork.\n\nOther risks that are beyond my control may include delays in manufacturing, delayed shipping, or product damage in shipping. Each product will be carefully packaged to ensure safety while shipping, but in the case that damage does occur, contact me and I will replace it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sarah Herrmann\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nHi!

No longer science fiction, now you can discover Martian mountains, valleys, and riverbeds  - many of which are still unnamed.\nFrom Cover to Cover, We Made Every Page Count\n218 masterfully created topographic maps of the Martian surface\n  Detailed introduction on the history of Martian exploration\n  An alphabetized index of over 2,000 named places and geographic features\n  Locations of historic and future human landing sites\n  Comprehensive index map to guide readers to areas of interest\n  Standard cartographic elements such as scale-bar, north arrow, and projection\n  A carefully selected quote from the late astrophysicist Carl Sagan printed on the back cover\n  A synopsis of what it takes to map a planet from scratch\n  A personalized message from the RedMapper Team\n  A special Thank You page commemorating Kickstarter Pledgers who helped us get The Mars Atlas to print\n  Mars Portal access: Use Mars Portal alongside The Mars Atlas \nTrack the Evolution of The Red Planet with Mars Portal\nImagine if we had satellite images and maps of a pre-human Earth. With Mars Portal, a web-based map of the entire planet of Mars, we now have that capability with our Red neighbor.  An online community with features similar to Google Maps, you can use Mars Portal along with The Mars Atlas to learn about the planet, its history, and its future.\nMars has never been more accessible to explorers, students, and enthusiasts alike. Go off-world with The Mars Atlas and Mars Portal as your guides. You now have unprecedented passage to humanity's next frontier:\nPLAY\n\nZoom in on the Curiosity Rover's path and the landing site of Viking. Glide over the water-filled polar ice caps.\nTraverse the majestic cliffs of Valles Marineris. Dive into calderas atop Olympus Mons\u2060\u2014the largest mountain in the solar system (more than 2x the size of Everest).\nAlthough the Atlas is designed as a tabletop reference book, it contains the most up-to-date map data available as it draws from data collected by NASA's previous Mars missions and orbiting satellites. It is the comprehensive cartographic representation of the Martian surface.\nWith The Mars Atlas, you can examine the actual places on Mars that appear in research, the news, and popular writing. Learn where these places are, their relative location to one another and plan your future adventures!\nThe sweeping plains and colossal cliffs of the Red Planet are clearly visible in the red-to-blue elevation relief with accompanying topographic lines. Use the alphabetized index to find more than 2,000 features and places already named including mountains, craters, valleys, and plains.\nStep into Mankind's History on The Red Planet\nSince 1971, international space agencies have sent at least 14 artificial objects to the surface of Mars, including the in-operation Curiosity rover and InSight lander. Retrace their steps (and tracks) with precision and follow along as new explorers arrive:\nPreview the Journey for NASA's Mars 2020 Rover\nLaunching this summer and arriving at the Jezero Crater in February 2021, the Mars 2020 Rover will search for ancient signs of life in the rocky sediment. Study its landing zone in The Mars Atlas and visit its new home in Mars Portal!\n Our Mission for The Mars Atlas and Mars Portal \nThe Mars Atlas was born out of the idea that if you're going to land a ship, construct a colony, or travel on Mars, you need to know where you are going.\nHere in the 2020s, we're globally set on going to Mars; so what better time to introduce accessible maps for our increasingly space-conscious society?\nIt is our hope that The Mars Atlas and Mars Portal result in an increased awareness and contextual understanding of Martian geography, resulting in impactful conversations that benefit our drive to go there.\nIt is our intention to deliver these tools in the form of detail-rich illustrations and immersive experiences so any generation can access and enjoy the journey to Mars.\nIt is, after all, our collective destination.\nPushing the Boundaries of STEM Education\nOur development team built The Mars Atlas and Mars Portal on the premise that every person should have access to space. We are inspired by the idea that young students will pick up a copy and have an appreciation for space exploration ignited within them as we were with some of the greatest milestones in our history. Perhaps one of these students will go on to play an active role in the settling of the Red Planet.\n Meet the Astrocartographers \nThree years ago, our founder Eian Ray had the honor of participating in an exercise to map NASA\u2019s future missions to Mars. He discovered that the public has limited access to the geographic information of our red neighbor.  Because of this, the RedMapper team decided to create a detailed set of maps in the form of an atlas, that draw readers to the otherworldly places of Mars, most of which have yet to be explored. \nPack Your Bags to Mars with These Rewards\nThere are several different reward levels. The Mars Atlas is offered as a standalone reward or combined with one year of Mars Portal access. If you only wish to use Mars Portal, access is offered in a lifetime, one year, or a \"sneak peak\" 30-day option. Both  are offered as individual or classrooms/small groups reward levels, depending on how you wish to use the product. Look for rewards that include the special Mars Poster Pack featuring poster maps of four prominent locations - one of which being the landing site for NASA's 2020 Mars Rover mission... As a bonus, a couple rewards include clues to guide you to special Easter eggs hidden within the map! Read the rewards section to learn more.\nOur Launch Equation\nAll funding acquired through this campaign will be applied to:\nFinal copy-editing process of The Mars Atlas\n  Preparation for publication\n  Upgrade mapping software and other tools RedMapper requires so that we can continue to produce these and other useful products on into 2021 and beyond.\n  What the Future Holds for Us\nMapping other planets is a huge endeavor. It requires a lot of time, patience, and especially computing power. As RedMapper evolves it will:\nContinue to provide Martian map content including The Mars Atlas and Mars Portal\n  Significantly improve the resolution of next generation Martian map products (up to 10x resolution!)\n  Prepare future editions of The Mars Atlas using this improvement\n  Develop an educational curriculum on interplanetary mapping technology and processes to encourage other students and professionals in this important work.\n  Present this map work at the 2020 Esri User Conference - the world's largest event dedicated to geographic information system (GIS) technology.\n  Join Our Growing Community\nPledge to one or more of The Mars Atlas rewards and own your very own Mars Atlas. Be one of the first 200 Kickstarter contributors to have your name added to a special contributor page, forever memorializing you as a contributor to the ongoing research of our Red neighbor.\n  Spread the word on social media and email! The Human species may well be the first life-forms to establish a presence on two planets.

Life is good!\nThe Things-Could-Be-Worse Mug is designed to remind you how lucky you are.\nThese mugs are big, giant, jumbo versions of the classic Things-Could-Be-Worse Mugs I introduced on Kickstarter in 2015. People requested larger mugs to help them satisfy big appetites.\nThese porcelain mugs feature my drawing of a traditional blue-willow paradise discombobulated by more than a dozen calamities, perils, and pests. You\u2019ll find...\n              \u2022 hairy fiend\n              \u2022 giant frog\n              \u2022 pirates\n              \u2022 cephalopod\n              \u2022 unpleasant blob creature\n              \u2022 voracious sea monster\n              \u2022 UFOs\n              \u2022 aggressive pterodactyls\n              \u2022 rambunctious robots\n              \u2022 zombie poodle\n              and other suspicious animals and shrubs.\nDetails to charm and edify.\nWhat do you get? Sponsors of this Kickstarter project will receive sets of two identical 20-ounce mugs decorated with my multi-calamity drawing. These mugs are made and decorated by the award-winning Kristoff porcelain workshop in Poland using the traditional in-glaze technique. The mugs are food safe, microwave safe, and dishwasher safe so you can use them every day to remind you of all the problems you don\u2019t have. \nA big mug for creatures with big appetites.\nThe Things-Could-Be-Worse Mug is NOT like those cheap ceramic mugs you get free from the auto body shop or the veterinarian. This is fine porcelain that will enhance your dinner table today and could also delight your descendants for generations.\nComparison of the classic TCBW mug and the new mug.\nThings-Could-Be-Worse Mugs make perfect gifts. So, consider getting extras\u2014especially for your coffee-loving friends.\nYour Things-Could-Be-Worse Mugs are sure to become treasured family heirlooms cherished for their beauty, utility, and humor. Plus, these mugs help you achieve inner peace by keeping life\u2019s setbacks in perspective and promoting a healthy attitude of gratitude. Things could be worse.\nIn-glaze porcelain is fired at extra-high temperatures to allow the image to melt slightly into the surface of the plate. Connoisseurs will appreciate the beauty of the in-glaze technique which the artists at Kristoff have been refining since 1831. This is the look of porcelain you see in museums. Sweet.\nQuality porcelain like you see in museums.\nWhen will you receive your mugs? I\u2019ve already completed this mug design and inspected multiple samples and approved a production prototype. Production can start as soon as I have enough pledges. Assuming nothing calamitous happens, you should be enjoying your favorite beverage in an amazing mug in August 2020. Probably much sooner.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are nearly ready to ship, I will send out a Kickstarter address survey. I can\u2019t send you your reward until you send me your current address. So please complete the survey as soon as it is available. If I don\u2019t get your address within 12 months, I'll assume that you no longer have an interest in receiving your reward.\nShipping. Mugs can ship anywhere in the world. Postage charges vary depending on where the package is going. Porcelain is heavy, so postage costs are shockingly high. But for a treasured heirloom that may last generations, you might be able to justify the expense.\nRead this if you are outside the U.S. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to reward shipments. I have no way of predicting what customs fees might be and if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your porcelain in their luggage next trip.\nIf you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\n Shipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\n If you missed my previous Kickstarter projects, you\u2019ll find a few earlier pieces, including the classic Things-Could-Be-Worse Mugs, at Calamityware.com.\nDon\u2014Pittsburgh, February 9, 2020", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the pre-production proof has been approved. So if I get enough sponsors, I can green-light production without delay. I\u2019m using a workshop that produces porcelain for monarchs and potentates and has perfected production techniques over 180 years. So technical problems are unlikely. The biggest risk is that production will take longer than anticipated\u2014perhaps because a potentate gets into the production queue ahead of us.\n\nI promise that I won\u2019t stop working until all my sponsors receive their things-could-be-worse mugs.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 43 or more", "title": "A: One pair of mugs", "descp": "Set of two matching 20-ounce porcelain TCBW mugs with multiple calamities to remind you no matter how bad your day might be going, it could be far worse.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["944 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 84 or more", "title": "B: Two pairs of mugs (four mugs)", "descp": "Set of four matching 20-ounce porcelain TCBW mugs with multiple calamities to remind you no matter how bad your day might be going, it could be far worse.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["238 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 164 or more", "title": "C: Four pairs of mugs (eight mugs)", "descp": "Set of eight matching 20-ounce porcelain TCBW mugs with multiple calamities to remind you no matter how bad your day might be going, it could be far worse.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["29 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 240 or more", "title": "D: Six pairs of mugs (twelve mugs)", "descp": "Set of twelve matching 20-ounce porcelain TCBW mugs with multiple calamities to remind you no matter how bad your day might be going, it could be far worse.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Big Mug: Update 5", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Big Mug: Update 4", "update_content": "Huzzah!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Big Mug: Update 3", "update_content": "Half baked."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Big Mug: Update 2", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Big Mug: Update 1", "update_content": "Off to a big start"}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "1,237 backers pledged $79,194"}, {"Project launches": "FEBRUARY 9, 2020"}]}], "comments": [{"username": "Al Porterfield", "content": "Love it.

The post was received very enthusiastically with tons of messages and comments. That was the point we decided to pursue with full efforts for a Deck of Playing cards on the theme of Rocket Science and SpaceX.\nYou can see the post here - Instagram Post\nHow the deck is organized?\nThe entire deck is themed on Rocket Science and SpaceX. Each Individual suits are sub-themed as follows:-\nHearts: Rocket Science Concepts\n13 cards on various fundamental concepts related to Rocket Science. 3 of them shown below.\nClubs: Epic Orbital Rockets \n13 cards on epic orbital rockets of the world. Priority is given on the type of payload and any extra-ordinary features. 3 of them shown below.\nSpades: Renowned Scientists and Innovators\n13 cards on renowned scientists and innovators who have made significant contributions to the field of Rocket Science. 3 of them shown below.\nDiamond: SpaceX, Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy\n13 cards dedicated to Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and various others tested works of SpaceX. 3 of them shown below.\nJokers\nJust in case you got friends(!) who are flat-earthers. You got one card for them! And one card for a person whom we all love a lot - Elon Musk!\nBackground\nWe wanted the cards' backside to share the story of the evolution of rockets. A trio of past, present and future images is what we came up with.\nPackaging\nThis is what you will get in your hands -\nQuality \n100% plastic (PVC), 310 GSM, 290 microns, Premium printing.\nResistance to bending, tear, and water (ensuring long-term life)\nFront side: Matte finish for good grip.\nBackside: Semi-glossy, for an aesthetic look.\nAll this has been discussed with our manufacturing team and actual cards from the portfolio passed the above-mentioned specifications. Feel free to comment/message us for any suggestions or feedback or queries on the above.\nTechnical Specifications \nWe Need Your Support\nWe need your support and backing to meet the minimum order quantity required for starting the production. Your continuous support in the design of cards and content has already helped in bringing this project to the current stage. On the accomplishment of the Kickstarter goal, we will be able to meet the required cost quoted by the manufacturing team and get the Rocket Deck in your hands.\nAny queries - reply promised in 24 hours\nFeel free to directly message us on Instagram or simply shoot an email to - spacexfalcontech [at] gmail.com. We promise you of getting your query addressed in 24 hours. Maximum. Any day of the week.\nTimeline\nSpecial Thanks \nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank two people who connected with us on Instagram and volunteered to help us in this project - \n1. Ma\u00ffa Cant\u00fa Ledezma, a card collector, and creative artist from Mexico. She helped in deciding the technical specifications, card quality and provided nice design critique.\n2. Christian Seiser, a card collector, and designer from Germany. He did extensive design review for some of the cards and helped in fine-tuning of the cards' design.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have worked through many iterations of design of each card and based on feedback from 1000s of fans on Instagram, finalized the artwork. We have tested the quality of sample decks from our manufacturing team and also got pricing and terms in writing. We have taken into account various factors that go into pricing and we are very confident in timely delivery of the product. As with any project, unforeseen events can occur, but we've done everything we can to keep unknown factors to a minimum. \n\nWe are all ears to the feedback from backers and due to that, there could be minor adjustments to the design of cards seen in the above photos.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title":

The book turned out great and we intend to duplicate it's look and feel, but with a more literary feel.  \n We're planning to ship your book out in December using USPS.

He not only witnessed natural and man-made disasters, but also war zones and famine; he covered royal tours, political events, the famous and the infamous, the needy and the poor.\nHe has won numerous awards, including the British Press Photographer of the Year an unprecedented seven times, the United Nations Gold Medal in 1990 and the International Photographer of the Year in 1994 (La Nation, Argentina). \nIn 1992 he was honoured with an MBE for \u2018Services to Journalism\u2019; in 2001 he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the UK Picture Editors Guild and in 2011 he received an Honorary Fellowship of The Royal Photographic Society.\nMujahideen Fighters during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan\nQueen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, poses for a regimental picture with the Irish Guards, on St. Patrick's Day\nFamilies living on a giant rubbish tip in Brazil\nJohn Downing: Legacy is a long overdue celebration of his illustrious career. Press photographers are often overlooked for their contribution to photography but it is their images that define how we see the world's events unfolding on a daily basis. John Downing's work is right there at the pinnacle of photojournalism.\nMother Teresa\nThe Beatles at the Sgt Pepper album launch\nDeer Stalking in Scotland\nThis is an important book demonstrating that despite the pressures John worked under, he produced quality photographs time after time. Every day press photographers are given an assignment with the challenge of capturing images that will immediately reflect what is happening - be it a war zone, disaster or a striking portrait of a personality. Success is often measured by claiming the front page - something John managed on many occasions.\nA landmine victim in hospital, Bosnia\nSophia Loren in her Paris apartment\nThe Queen during the State Opening of Parliament\nJohn Downing: Legacy covers some of his key assignments, including most major wars and international events. He travelled to East Pakistan/Bangladesh, Rhodesia, Beirut, Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Croatia, and over a dozen visits to Bosnia.\nHe was beaten and imprisoned in Uganda by the regime of Idi Amin. The Daily Express described its front-page headline as, 'World exclusive pictures taken inside the black hole of Kampala'.\nInside the Kampala Prison\nTogether with writer Kim Willsher, John was one of the first journalists to visit Chernobyl after the nuclear explosion.\nA mother holds her dying son, believed to be a Chernobyl victim\nHe lived rough for many weeks with guerrilla fighters in several wars; the Anyanya in Southern Sudan, the Contras in Nicaragua, and the Mujahideen in Afghanistan.\nAfghan Warrior\nA Russian tank enters Kabul\nRwandan refugees\nAnd - as the video cryptically refers - he was the only photographer inside the Grand Hotel, Brighton, when the IRA bomb exploded in a failed attempt to kill PM Margaret Thatcher and her government. This led to further world exclusive photographs.\nInside the Grand Hotel, Brighton, seconds after the bomb exploded\nAmongst all these key images were thousands of others; royalty, street scenes, celebrations, landscapes - occasionally with a humorous take. All in a day's work for one of our finest photographers. This book is his legacy.\nRotten Row, Hyde Park, London\nPrince Andrew shares a joke with fellow helicopter pilots\nPrincess Diana leaves hospital with newborn Prince Harry\nFamilies sleeping on the streets of Kolkata (formally Calcutta)\nReward Prints\nReward print #1 - Skinhead arrested in Southend\nReward print #2 - Russian soldier on duty in Kabul\nReward print #3 - Battersea Power Station in the snow\nReward print #4 - Back to work after the Millennium celebrations, 3rd January 2000\nThe Book\nJohn Downing: Legacy will be a hardback book with dust jacket, size 270 x 290mm (landscape) and 192 pages.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nJohn Downing: Legacy is being published in collaboration with Bluecoat Press, who have published over 200 books and run many successful Kickstarters.

Me too.\nDraw every day...to keep abysmal gloom away.\nI draw every day. Over the years, I\u2019ve experimented with countless different blank books and always been disappointed. Until now.\nEarlier this year, I found a bookbinder, named Ann, who can make me reasonably priced books with all the features I crave. (See detailed list below.) This Kickstarter project is about making books for people who want the same features I desire in a sketchbook, notebook, or journal. \nI call this design the Landing Zone Sketchbook because taming wild ideas begins when they land in your sketchbook. \nWhat makes a sketchbook great? \nLarge enough to capture big ideas but small enough to carry everywhere, every day.\nInviting feel. Not slick or rubbery. Dark to hide schmutz. Landing-zone icon differentiates front and reminds you what a sketchbook is for\u2014giving ideas a safe place to land.\nPages stay open without a struggle. One hundred pages means you have enough space to sustain a productive streak.\nHeavy, white (not yellow), acid-free paper with smooth surface that welcomes pencil, pen, and brush pen without show through. No tyrannical lines or grids to inhibit sketching.\nA place to stash clippings, emergency cash, business cards, postage stamps, templates, and other necessities.\nElastic closure loop, ribbon to mark your place, radius corners to soften knocks and prevent damage.\n\nWHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\u201cThe binding cloth is soft. Like a cross between a cloud and the belly of a baby mink. I think I\u2019m in love.\u201d\n\u201cThe paper is smooth and delightful to draw on with pencil or ink. It erases cleanly without damaging the surface.\u201d\n\u201cI wish the LZ Sketchbook included a heater for drawing on cold mornings. But for this price, it\u2019s a very good deal as is.\u201d\n\u201cThe mysterious icon on the cover suggests membership in some elite inner circle. Well, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cDon talks about a \u2018sketchbook\u2019 but these are prefect for a journal too. Blank pages to record life\u2019s passing parade, bitch about injustices, or noodle ideas for a screenplay.\u201d\n\u201cCarrying a notebook makes you look smarter by hinting that you\u2019re the kind of person with valuable ideas that are worth recording.\u201d\nWhy two? All of the pledge levels are for multiples of two sketchbooks so I don\u2019t have to diddle with single copies. That helps keep costs down. If you really only need one sketchbook, you\u2019ll have one to give away to a lucky friend. \nOriginal drawing. Pledge level D includes an original drawing. Don picks the subject. It\u2019s bound to be something weird. It will arrive loose and require matting and framing. If you prefer to have me draw in one of the sketchbooks, you\u2019ll have to say so when you make your pledge. That might be a good reward choice for someone who prefers rare collectibles.\nTESTING\nI tested a prototype of the LZ Sketchbook and was delighted. Here are some of my drawings from the first week of testing.\nPLAY\n\nSCHEDULE\nWhen will you receive your rewards? All the production details have been worked out and the prototype tested. As soon as I see support for this project, I can ask the workshop to start the first production batch. You can be making notes and doodling in December 2019, maybe sooner. If a second batch is needed, those sketchbooks should be done in January 2020.\nBlank books like this make great gifts. Why not just get ten?\nSHIPPING\nWhere to? Kickstarter will add the cost of shipping to your pledge based on where you live. \nInternational shipping. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to print shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most shipments slide through without any extra duties, but a few sponsors may find that a customs fee has been slapped on. I can\u2019t predict it or avoid it. Customs costs have been built into shipments to Australia and the European Union. Everywhere else it is a gamble. If you can\u2019t tolerate the notion that you might get hit with a customs charge, you probably shouldn\u2019t support this project. Or maybe you should move?\nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to me. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled when they are nearly at your house, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly\u2014before the authorities send the package back.\nShipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\n\nTitle page includes drawings from Don\u2019s sketchbooks. Some are parts of my previous Kickstarter projects. Recognize anything?\n\nLOOSE ENDS\nUpdates and progress reports. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m an obnoxious pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and if I know the answer, I\u2019ll add the Q and A to the FAQ section of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. Not only is this a good place to find some unusual gifts, but it is the only place you\u2019ll find the world\u2019s greatest shower curtain and the amazing book, Monster Etiquette.\nDon\u2014Pittsburgh, September 8, 2019", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 43rd Kickstarter project. I\u2019m starting to understand how they roll, so the risk is relatively small. The design is complete and the prototype tested. Only proven bindery techniques are called for\u2014no technological innovations are required.\n\nOf course, the project is still vulnerable to all the problems that fickle fate can throw at us (meteorites, wrinkles in the time-space continuum, fallible human beings, etc.). For example, in the extremely unlikely event that there are more pledges than I have sketchbooks, the bindery will have to make a second batch. If that many people want LZ Sketchbooks, I\u2019ll be truly flabbergasted.\n\nI assure you, this project will get my almost-full attention until production is successfully completed. I haven\u2019t let any of my Kickstarter sponsors down yet.

It's a tribute. A history. A love letter.\nThis is the extraordinary story of Notre Dame de Paris.  \nWhat is the story about?\nThe Girl and the Cathedral is not a dry retelling of history. Rather, in the spirit of The Little Prince, it is the extraordinary tale of a small girl with an island in the Seine. There, she begins a garden\u2014but not a garden of flowers. It will be a garden of people, she says: Paris. \nIn the center of her garden, the little girl plants her greatest treasure of all: Notre Dame de Paris. She watches as heaven reaches through the cathedral's windows. She wonders as the people in her garden change through kingdoms and empires and revolutions. She weeps as war ravages and burns. Over 850 years of history, her garden changes\u2014as people must. And through it all, her most beloved flower, Notre Dame, resolutely offers divine solace and light, and the little girl learns much about life, freedom, love, loss, and the glory of new beginnings. It is a story about Notre Dame, but much deeper, it is a story about all that Notre Dame has stood for. \nThe little girl admires the most beautiful flower in her garden: Notre Dame de Paris.\nIncludes faux stained glass windows built right into the cover\nBuilt into the front cover are a series of stained glass windows (made with printed clear plastic). Hold the book up to the light, and each window glows!\nComes with a fold-out timeline of architectural and period drawings\nA stunning 4-page flap folds out to reveal original architectural drawings and artwork of the cathedral throughout the centuries.  \nIntroduces children to famous figures\nAstute readers will find references to famous Parisians who changed the world.

Her people loved her. She loved her people. Her song rang across the city and across the years, bells mingled with mystery through the ups and downs of joy, war, suffering, prosperity, and happiness. Her story spans the ages of kings, emperors, presidents, revolution, and change. \nAnd then, like most of the world, we were stunned as we watched flames erupt through her roof. Like the light that pours through her windows, we had come to believe she would always be there\u2014a beacon of hope and inspiration, a quiet touch of the divine in the midst of the world's clamor.\nWe are grateful to know that Notre Dame will always be there, due in large part to the generosity of the world and those that love her. \nWhile that reconstruction goes on, we wish to offer a tribute of our own\u2014a story of hope and love, of life and rebirth. In this book, through illustration and prose, we pay homage to the grand story of Notre Dame\u2014who she is, how she was, and what she has come to mean to millions the world over for 850 years. And in the spirit of giving back, we pledge that for every book sold, we will donate a book to kids in need\u2014book for book.

Let\u2019s make big, fine-quality porcelain bowls festooned with oodles of robots.\nGet it? A big serving bowl decorated with a big crowd...for when you are entertaining a big crowd.\nWho needs a deep porcelain bowl loaded with robots?\nTop quality. A true work of art. Like the previous Calamityware dinner plates, this platter is fine porcelain produced at the award-winning Kristoff workshop in Poland using the in-glaze technique. Final production will feature white porcelain with a rich blue image. Food safe, microwave safe, and dishwasher safe.\nA close look reveals scads of robots and some other surprises.\nIn-glaze porcelain is fired at extra-high temperatures to allow the image to melt slightly into the surface. Connoisseurs will appreciate the beauty of the in-glaze technique which the artists at Kristoff have been refining since 1831. This is the look of porcelain you see in museums. Sweet.\nWith in-glaze production, sharp, detailed decorations are permanently fused into the surface.\nOodles of Robots Bowl is bigger than previous Calamityware plates and bowls.\nThe Oodles of Robots Bowl measures 12\" (30 cm) in diameter. Big enough for duty as a serving bowl or extremely generous individual bowl. The bowl will hold 2 cups of liquid (16 oz, 500 mL) with room to spare. Stuff like mashed potatoes, veggies, or pasta can be piled high. \nIdeal as a serving bowl when you have lots of hungry robots to dinner.\nCaring for porcelain is easy. How much pampering you give your porcelain should depend on how long you want it to last. I wrote a blog post that offers practical advice about living with porcelain. Read it and follow the advice if you want to keep your porcelain pristine.\nWhen can I expect my reward? Assuming nothing calamitous happens, you should be dining with the robot gang by the end of November 2019.\nRobots galore\u2014on rim, in center, and even some on the back.\nFree shipping in the U.S.\nInternational shipping. Oodles of Robots Bowls can ship anywhere in the world. Orders outside the U.S. have a postage charge that varies depending on where the package is going. We apply the amount we budget for U.S. shipping to reduce how much you pay for international shipments, but it is still expensive. Porcelain is heavy, so postage costs are shockingly high. But for a treasured heirloom that may last generations, perhaps you can justify the expense.\nRead this if you are outside the U.S. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to porcelain shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your porcelain in their luggage next trip.\nWe\u2019ll be using the U.S. Postal Service for these shipments because that seems to minimize the number of packages that get hit with customs fees, and there are no extra broker fees added. \nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\n********\nBig enough to share doesn\u2019t mean you must share.\nProject updates. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that I\u2019ll feel like a pest. You can also receive a trickle of news about designing, producing, and enjoying Calamityware plates (and the other projects Don is working on) by joining the email list at Calamityware.com.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section of this page.\nMore than 40 Kickstarter projects have sprung from the drawings in my sketchbooks.\nPrevious projects. If you missed my previous Kickstarter projects, you\u2019ll find leftovers from all my previous projects at Calamityware.com. While supplies last. Not just porcelain\u2014there are some other unusual products there, too, that began as Kickstarter-Don projects.\nWant to see more of Don\u2019s drawings? I post a new drawing of something almost every day on Flickr. You can see my preliminary Calamityware sketches and drawings in this Flickr album.\nDon\nPittsburgh, August 11, 2019\nLoad them up. These bowls are ready for the big time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the pre-production proofs have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors, I will green-light production right away.\n\nI\u2019m using a workshop that produces porcelain for monarchs and potentates and has perfected production techniques over 180 years. So technical problems are unlikely.

Five decades later, man's most outstanding milestone continues to thrill us as if it had happened yesterday. Apart from loving flip books, we are passionate space enthusiasts, and this enormous achievement has always been an inspiration to us, so we thought it would be amazing to create the ultimate flip book edition on the Apollo 11 journey, to mark the 50th anniversary of this event in history.  \nThe first volume of the Apollo 11 Flip Book Edition is based on original footage from the NASA archives, shot during the different stages of the mission. It wasn't easy  to decide which sequences should go into the flip book, since there\u2019s really a lot of incredible material available, but after some back and forth, we chose 6 sequences that reflect the most significant maneuvers of the Apollo 11 mission. Some of the sequences are edited  in multicam shots to show the action synchronized from different angles. You\u2019ll find 3 sequences on each side of the book.\n\n\nAfter testing the first prototypes, we were fairly satisfied with the result, however we still missed  some of the most important events that took place. What about those crucial moments that helped to make this journey a success, but couldn\u2019t be filmed because they happened out there in space? We wanted to create a flip book that not only tells this story, but also really makes you understand what happened out there. That\u2019s how Volume 2 came up. \nLuckily, as we have our own flip book and animation studio, the solution was not too far away: during our research we learned about the original concept art, created by NASA artists in 1966 to explain the main stages of the mission to the broader public, so we decided to select the illustrations of the stages we were missing and turn them into animations. \n\nAs a result, Vol 2 has 6 more sequences depicting the moon landing from a more technical and informative point of view, whilst maintaining an artistic approach through the handmade paintings. They are some of the most important maneuvers performed by the astronauts, such as the stage separations and docking procedures and the lunar orbit insertion of the CSM-LM module. Here they are in detail:\nConcept art created by NASA artists in 1966 to help the public understand the principal stages of the mission\nBoth flip books are intended to complement each other, so if you switch between the real footage and the animated sequences, together they become a powerful educational tool that explains the whole process of the Apollo journey.\n\nBecause we like challenges and really want to take flip books to the next level, we decided to add an interactive component to the edition. That\u2019s why we added an exclusive Augmented Reality feature to the flip book edition that gives you more insight into the three main spacecrafts used by the astronauts to accomplish this remarkable mission.\nEach of the flip books includes a different 3D model that can be displayed on your mobile device right above the flip book. On Vol. 1 you'll see the powerful Saturn V rocket, on Volume 2 the Command and Service Module docked together with the Lunar Module and when both flip books are packed together in the Anniversary Edition slipcase (Flip Book Set), you can see a real-time 3D animation of the last exciting moments of \u201cThe Eagle\u201d before it touches the surface of the moon - well actually before it touches the surface of the flip book. :)  \nEach of these 3D models will incorporate extra detailed information about the technical specifications of each spacecraft, combining videos and additional text. This way, you can not only engage with your Apollo 11 Flip Book, but most importantly, you can learn more about the mission and the vehicles the astronauts used throughout their journey.  \nFor the development of the AR content we work hand in hand with our friends from the British studio Seymour & Lehrn, specialized in creating AR and VR content for virtual experiences. With their help, we will develop our own Flipboku Apollo 11 AR app, which you can easily download for IOS and Android.  \nThose of you familiar with our last flip book project Molecularis, may already have an idea about how the magic works. If you observe the flip book in closer detail, you will notice that the edges are cut in a specific way, so that you can swap between the different sequences. This is the key to the optical illusion that gives the Apollo 11 Flip Book its unique feature of showing you six different animations, one after another - you'll have a blast watching people's faces when they see the flip book for the first time and try to understand how it works! :D \nAnd here's the secret: it all depends on the position of your thumb. You can switch between the sequences by placing your thumb either in the upper corner, the center or the lower corner of the front edge of the book. \nAs there are 3 sequences on each side of the book, the images are arranged alternately. This means that you will have sequences 1, 2 and 3 on the A-side and 4, 5 and 6 on the B-side of the book, when you turn it around. This works the same for both flip books, resulting in a total of 12 different sequences. \nWith the aim of providing you with maximum enjoyment of the whole epic Apollo experience, we have developed a complementary educational tool for those of you wanting to gain additional insight, not only about the Apollo 11, but about the entire Apollo Program. \nWho were the astronauts, which spacecraft did they use, and which experiments did they perform during the different lunar explorations? To answer these questions, we created a deck of 70 neatly designed Commemorative Cards, representing three different categories: 32 astronauts of all the Apollo missions, 18 of the science experiments set up by the astronauts at the landing site of each of the five Apollo missions to land on the moon, and 20 cards showing the vehicles and hardware that brought them there \u2013 and back to earth. \nEach of the illustrated cards includes basic information of the displayed subject, and also includes a QR code that takes you to the specific page on Wikipedia where you can find out even more about each of the many components of the Apollo Program. \nYou can also combine the cards into different groups by joining all the astronauts of a specific mission as well as their scientific experiments and vehicles, or turn it into a question-and-answer game and not only learn from it, but have a lot of fun with your friends and family.\n\nWe couldn't help but include a little flip book feature in the card deck! If you hold all the cards in the correct order, you will be able to see a 360\u00ba animation of the Lunar Module while flipping the cards with your thumb. :D \n\nFor all those passionate space lovers out there who want the full experience, we\u2019ve created an exclusive bundle with 250 units available only for our Kickstarter backers. This one of a kind Limited Edition tier includes a real fragment of mission-flown Kapton Foil that protected the Columbia Command Module during its re-entry to Earth. \nThis unique piece is preserved in a small commemorative acrylic container that comes individually numbered and with your name on it. A unique collector's item for those who want to hold a real piece of human history in their hands. \nThe Limited Edition Foil Bundle will come in a sleek packaging that we\u2019ve created especially for the occasion, along with the Apollo 11 Flip Book Set (which comes with all three 3D AR models) and the Apollo 11 Commemorative Cards. The limited edition includes a Certificate of Authenticity with additional information on the origin and traceability of the foil. \nWe are passionate about great packaging, which is why all our flip books come in their own sleek slip case which not only looks attractive, but also protects them from wear and tear. \nFurthermore, the Apollo 11 Anniversary Edition (Flip Book Set) has a double slip case with a stunning  gold embossing we\u2019ve created for this special occasion,  so that you can keep both flip books together.\nWe only use environmentally-friendly materials, such as acid-free sustainable forest paper. All materials are from local providers to keep our project as sustainable as possible (this means European materials for us). We have chosen a semi-gloss coated paper with the perfect thickness and elasticity so that the pages slide smoothly when you flip them with your thumb. \nEvery single Apollo 11 Flip Book is largely hand-produced and the whole process requires a number of steps that rely on careful supervision, which is why the entire production process will be carried out in our very own printing studio in Mallorca, Spain. Our experienced printing technicians will take care of the complex manufacturing process which requires absolute precision to ensure that the sequences perform perfectly.  Here you can see a small making-of video of the Apollo 11 prototypes:\n\nVol. 1 and Vol. 2 are two separate flip books in their own right but they complement each other beautifully. When combined, the real footage and the animated sequences provide extraodinary insight into the entire Apollo 11 mission.\nYou can choose between the following combinations: \n\n\n\nAs the campaign's rockets gain height, we have created a series of stretch goals that we will include for all our backers once we reach certain marks. \n65K EUR! We will design a Digital Pack that includes 3 items: a gorgeous Infographic with background information about the Apollo program, plus 2 Commemorative Posters: Mission Events, with the full explanatory illustrations made by NASA, including the most relevant stages of the entire mission, and the Commemorative poster for all the 6 landed Apollo missions. These files will be sent to all backers as soon as they receive their surveys and can be downloaded in high quality, in order to be printed in large format or used as desired. \n85K EUR! As a second stretch goal, all of you will receive a Set of 6 fabulous Apollo Stickers. It will include the original Apollo 11 patch, a lunar map with all the Apollo landing sites, the Lunar Module based on original NASA artwork, Lunar Orbit Rendevouz, Buzz Footprint and Translunar Injection. Here is a sneak peek at some of the designs:\nDespite their small size, a great deal of work goes into the design and development of  a flip book like Apollo 11. We have spent months on the design board, illustrating, animating and collaborating closely with our printing technicians, cutting, binding and testing to achieve this result. Since the Apollo Flip Book has almost twice the number of pages as any other Flip Book we've made so far, we had to find a new technique to get the magic trick to work perfectly. \nPrinting projects such as this one are only cost effective if you reach a certain quantity threshold, which is why we need your help to complete the final step \u2013 to finally bring the flip book to life and get it into the printers.\nThe funds will also be used to develop the AR feature, in collaboration with the British studio Seymour and Lerhn.\nFlipboku is the brainchild of animator and designer Jossie Malis and music composer Julie Reier. Besides loving animation and flip books, we're also huge space enthusiasts, so we are thrilled at the idea of creating something unique for the 50th anniversary of this memorable achievement. With Flipboku, we want to bring flip books to the next level and create unique editions, that are not only fun, but also useful either in a creative, artistic or educational way.\nSince our last project Molecularis, the Flipboku team has grown and now consists of 6 members, all working in our design and printing studio Boku Lab. The team is completed with the invaluable hands of illustrator and graphic designer Noemi Aiolo, and the 3 members of our irreplaceable printing crew Gustavo Berdayes, Tom\u00e1s Pons and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Pineda, who are responsible for the development of the prototypes and for leading the entire production process. \nWe are extremely grateful for your support and would love to welcome you on board!\nWe would especially like to thank NASA video librarian Sheva Moore for her support through the incredible film archive and Bert Ulrich from the NASA multimedia and content department, to Andy Bernstein for his support with the video narration and Victoria Amengual for her help with the writing.  Also special thanks to our webmaster Israel and our dearest Angel, Mireia, Anselm, Marcos, Raquel, Angel, Nuria, Naru, Yui, Yuko, Nadal and Alejandro for their participation in our video. \n This campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

How To Film Moving Pictures in the 1910's, which was funded here successfully in early 2018, 1907 Chicago Projecting Co.'s Entertainer's Supplies Catalog No. 122; Deluxe Edition (printed in 2015) and a reprint of the 1907 pulp novel The Great Express Robbery, funded through Kickstarter in June, 2019. \nWhy Reprint These?\nDime novels from the 1890s are extremely scarce. Ever hear stories from older family members who regretted the loss of entire boxes of baseball cards and comic books that were thrown out?  The main readers were adolescent boys who's collections oftentimes were discarded as \"junk\" by someone in the family.  Somethings do not change!  Also, the pulp paper doesn't survive well under certain conditions -- after many decades the paper can become brittle to the point they can't be read from cover to cover without shedding.\nAll four dime novels are from The Old Sleuth series, which numbered in the hundreds of published original and reprinted books and magazines from the 1870s into the 1910s.  However, a scant few of them are available today in an easy to read form.\nIf this book is funded it will reprint...\n Amzi, The Detective; or, Morning, Noon and Night In New York. A Detective Tale. (1896)\n A Detective's Daughter. An Extraordinary Narrative. (1898)\n A Struggle To Win; or, A Gypsy Boy's Secret. (1898)\n Seth Bond; or, A Lost Treasure Mystery. A Startling Detective Narrative. (1898)\nThe plots move along swiftly, are full of action and I believe will be enjoyable to most readers.  \nIf the funding goal is reached the pledges will pay for a print quantity of one hundred books plus the cost of shipping from the printing company. \nHow Was This Reprint Created?\nThe valuable dime novels needed to be taken apart so the pages and cover could be individually scanned at 600 dpi laying completely flat on a table scanner.  The covers have been extensively retouched and readability of illegible text restored.\nOne example of the thousands of print corrections made to the text.\nMost of the retouching was to reduce the yellowing on the pages, being careful that none of the printed ink was removed.  Some of the characters in the printing press had too much ink and left blotches.   Some were barely readable due to too little ink.  These were fixed by moving legible characters from other areas of the page on top of them then erasing the surrounding smudge.  The skew of the pages was also corrected and centered.  With these thousands of touch-ups the easy flow of reading has been restored.\nMore info on how this was done will be in upcoming updates!\nIf funded I endeavor to restore and reprint even more crime, adventure and romance novels from the 1860's-1910's period.\nThis proof was ordered after the novels were read and scanned. It was used a guide to fix unreadable text. The cover is temporary and is not going to be used on the finished book.\nWell over a thousand corrections were made to all 430+ pages of the four Old Sleuth dime novels.\nWhen Does It Ship? \nIf the goal is reached, all rewards will ship September, 2019.  \nAs soon as they are delivered to my house all will be packaged and mailed to backers.

Over the course of the campaign a Mystery will unfold for you to solve. A one-of-a-kind prize volume that money can't buy will be awarded to the first person who cracks the puzzle and prizes may be given to ALL backers to reward participation in the project and help us break new frontiers on Kickstarter. \nPresenting DEATH ON THE NILE \u2014 A handmade, limited edition from Thornwillow Press.\nThe Thornwillow Edition of Agatha Christie's DEATH ON THE NILE\nHaving written more than 70 novels, 14 short story collections, as well as the longest running play in history, Agatha Christie is the most widely read author of all time. Her murder mysteries, above all, brought her fame and have endured in the public consciousness for nearly a century, earning her the undisputed title of the Queen of Crime. The popularity of these novels is no real mystery at all. As Dame Agatha Christie wrote in her introduction to Death on the Nile, \u201cIf detective stories are \u2018escape literature\u2019 (and why shouldn\u2019t they be!) the reader can escape to sunny skies and blue water as well as to crime in the confines of an armchair.\u201d\nYet for all that she has been celebrated, with television, film, and even video game adaptations of her work, she is not the household name that she once was. Now, we aim to honor her legacy, and shine a spotlight once again on the enduring brilliance of her work. It is with great pleasure that we announce that Thornwillow Press, with the blessing of Agatha Christie\u2019s family and estate, is publishing the first ever fine press edition of one of her most iconic works\u2014Death on the Nile.\nLike all of Thornwillow's books, DEATH ON THE NILE will be printed letterpress and hand bound in limited numbers. Please help us create the most beautiful edition of Agatha Christie's masterpiece ever.\nA bibliographic excavation...\nWe are joined by archaeologist and crime fiction scholar Dr. A.T. Reyes of Groton and Oxford University. With a brand new original monograph and exquisitely reproduced collection of maps and ephemera from Christie\u2019s travels, Dr. Reyes is our guide as we walk in the footsteps of the great Queen of Crime through a world of ancient tombs, evil curses, and archaeological discovery. For after all, what is an archaeologist but a reader and detective of the ancient past? \nCelebrated archaeologist and crime fiction scholar Dr. A.T. Reyes of Groton and Oxford University presents the novel in the context of Christie's life... and has created a mystery puzzle to test our sleuthing skills.\nThe novel stars Hercule Poirot, the archetypal detective and one of Christie\u2019s most beloved and enduring characters. As Sophie Hannah, best-selling author and scholar of crime fiction describes him, Poirot is \u201ca miraculous blend of opposites. He is the perfect memorable caricature, with his luxuriant moustaches, egg-shaped head and fussy ways ... but he is also a real person with depth, and past pain, and a third dimension that will forever remain hidden, which makes us believe in its presence all the more.\u201d Of the more than 30 Poirot novels, Death on the Nile is among the best. Upon its release in 1937, The New York Times Book Review wrote \u201cYou have the right to expect great things\u2026 and you will not be disappointed.\u201d \nWe are offering DEATH ON THE NILE in a number of different versions \u2014 from copies bound in letterpress paper wrappers, half-cloth, half-leather, and full-leather as well as a few very special collector bindings. All of the half-leather and full-leather copies are individually hand-numbered and signed by Dr. Reyes and Luke Ives Pontifell.\n\u201cChristie\u2019s books are so much more than great puzzles,\u201d said Sophie Hannah, best-selling author and scholar of crime fiction, \u201cEach of her novels demonstrates a profound understanding of people\u2013how they think, feel and behave\u2013all delivered in her crisp, elegant, addictively readable style.\u201d \nOver the ensuing decades, the popularity of the novel has never waned. Death on the Nile has gone on to inspire countless stage, radio, television, and movie adaptations; it has even been made into a computer game and a graphic novel. In 2017, it was announced that 20th Century Fox is developing Death on the Nile as a sequel to their film adaptation of Christie\u2019s Murder on the Orient Express, with the great actor and director Kenneth Branagh returning as Hercule Poirot.\nThe edition features maps, photographs, artifacts and ephemera from Agatha Christie's travels in Egypt with her archaeologist husband that also set the stage for the novel.\nA MYSTERY for you to solve. A Spectacular PRIZE to Win:\nOver the course of the campaign a Mystery will unfold for you to solve. Created by Dr. Reyes, we present this mystery to connect you to and celebrate the spirit and legacy of Agatha Christie. \nA magnificent, one-of-a-kind prize volume that money can't buy will be awarded to the first person to crack the puzzle. But take note... the spirit of the contest is the more the merrier!\nThere will be prizes for ALL backers that reward participation. Join the contest. Get the word out. Invite others to take a shot. Build your crack team. Work in groups. The more who get involved, the more rewards there will be for everyone. Help us break new frontiers on Kickstarter.\nTHE MYSTERY CONTEST is open to all. Over the course of the campaign, 21 clues will be revealed. They will be sent to all people backing and following the project and will be posted on the project page and on Thornwillow's website. Anyone, regardless of whether you back the project or not, is eligible to win the grand prize. Additional rewards will be given to all backers of the project based on participation in the mystery and the success of the project.\nSTRETCH GOALS:\nGET 250 PARTICIPANTS BEFORE THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN (August 8, 2019 at 11:55PM New York Time) AND WE WILL RELEASE THE ANSWER TO A SECOND CLUE.\nAND/OR... \nIF THE CAMPAIGN BREAKS $100,000 WE WILL POST WHETHER TO USE THE FIRST OR THE LAST LETTER FROM EACH CLUE'S ONE-WORD-ANSWER.\nHere are the parameters for THE THORNWILLOW DEATH ON THE NILE MYSTERY:\nEach clue leads to a one-word answer.

Only one copy will ever exist.\nHow our books are made:\nAll of the design, printing, and binding are done at Thornwillow in our workshops in Newburgh, New York. We are perhaps the only fine press publisher in the world to unite these related arts and crafts of the written word under one roof, and we are committed to teaching and perpetuating them for readers today and for years to come.\nPLAY\n\nWe start with a beautiful layout.  The text is set using classical ratios of type to page, giving each book luxurious margins and elegant proportions.  \nWe set the type with an eye towards proportion and scale.\nOnce the book is laid out, the text is printed letterpress on our Heidelberg Cylinder Press. The type is literally pressed into the heavy archival stock, so that you can feel the letters as you run your fingers across the page. This is an ancient art\u2014the same process by which Johannes Gutenberg printed his books 500 years ago.\nThe pages are printed letterpress on our Heidelberg flatbed cylinder press. You can feel each letter as you run your fingers across the page.\nEach book is then folded into eight page signatures, collated and sewn together. \nThe books are sewn into \"signatures\" which assures their durability and makes them open more easily for a beautiful reading experience.\nThe books are then bound by hand by our master craftsmen, who create the highest quality bindings in the world.\nThe binding of every volume is made by hand at the press. At Thornwillow we are committed to teaching and perpetuating the arts and crafts of the written word.\nThe skills involved in gold tooling and decorating a leather binding take years of practice.\n THE EDITION: \nWe are offering Death on the Nile in four distinct bindings: letterpress printed paper wrappers, half cloth and letterpress boards, half Morocco and handmade paste papers, and magnificent full leather. Each copy will also include a letterpress printed list of subscribers in recognition of their generous support and to let future generations of readers know how this book was made possible.\nDeath on the Nile is Christie at her best. Whether you are a Christie fan, a mystery reader, or a collector, the Thornwillow edition of this great novel is the one to own.\nTHE BINDINGS:\nPaper Wrapper  |  $95  |  Edition limited to 100 more than backed\nThe Letterpress Paper Wrapper Edition\nHalf-Cloth  |  $195  |  Edition limited to 100 more than backed\nBound in cloth with letterpress printed boards\nHalf-Leather  |  Starting at $595  |  Edition limited to 25 more than backed\nBound in half-leather with handmade pastepaper boards.

Genteel but scary. Decorated on all four sides with fearsome, cookie-loving dragons to scare away timid snack pirates and discourage unauthorized withdrawals.\n2. Weighty. Heavy enough to be a murder weapon. Even before you put stuff in it, this cookie jar weighs 4.25 lbs (2 kg). Will not blow away in typical household windstorms.\n3. Food ready. Easy to clean. Dishwasher safe. Air-tight lid with silicone seal to preserve freshness. \n4. Capacious. Can hold 90 Oreo cookies! Exterior measures 5.125\"D x 5.125\"W x 10\"H (13 cm D x 13 cm W x 25.5 cm H). Opening measures 4\" (10 cm) diameter. This cookie jar may actually be slightly bigger on the inside than it is on the outside! (Research into this possibility is still underway.)\n5. Not just for cookies. Makes an excellent storage place for all your snacks. And because it looks like an innocent cookie jar, you\u2019ll find it an excellent place to conceal caches, hoards, and stashes. For example, some people have said they plan to use the cookie jar to hide secret accumulations of contraband, gemstones, antique coins, and chocolate. No one will suspect.\nA close look reveals cookie-loving dragons.\nWhat you\u2019ll get. Sponsors of this project will receive stoneware cookie jar with lid. All decorated with cookie-loving dragons from Don\u2019s sketchbook.\nSchedule.  Assuming this project reaches the funding goal, production will go fast and we should be ready to ship by the end of August 2019. \n********\nMakes a great gift. There are several pledge levels that allow you to get multiple cookie jars. You don\u2019t even have to bake cookies to fill the jar, but we have included some proven cookie recipes for inspiration in case you want to go that way.\nIs there also a cat? Yes\nAnimals? Don\u2019t forget that a handsome cookie jar is also an ideal way to store dog treats and cat rewards.\n\nODE TO A VIGILANT-DRAGON COOKIE JAR\nLosing treats to cookie pirates is the worst of aggravations.\nGet a jar to hide your treasures from unwanted observations.\nAll four sides should be embellished with dragon decorations.\nThat\u2019s the best you can do to stop misappropriations.\nLid includes more dragons and a silicone gasket for a tight seal.\n\nShipping. There\u2019s a shipping charge that varies depending on how far away you live. It\u2019s relatively small in the United States but goes up dramatically overseas because the cookie jars are heavy. Some places are shockingly high. But for a treasured heirloom that may last generations, perhaps you can justify the expense.\nRead this if you are outside the U.S. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to ceramic shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your cookie jar in their luggage next trip.\nWe\u2019ll probably be using the U.S. Postal Service for these shipments because that seems to minimize the number of packages that get hit with customs fees, and there are no extra broker fees added.\nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nCapacious interior is a good place to stash your false passports, ray gun, gold bullion, or other treasures.\n********\nProject updates. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you\u2019ll think that I am a pest. You can also receive a trickle of news about Don\u2019s projects, sketchbook, and ridiculous blog by joining the Calamityware mailing list. Sign up for our newsletter here.\nAn enhancement to any domicile.\n\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nPrevious projects. If you missed my previous Kickstarter projects, you\u2019ll find extras from the production run from most of my previous projects at Calamityware.com. While supplies last. Not just porcelain\u2014there are some other unusual products there, too, that began as Kickstarter-Don projects...including the world\u2019s most delightful shower curtain and the groundbreaking book, Monster Etiquette.\nWant to see more of Don\u2019s drawings? I post a new drawing of something almost every day on Flickr. You can see my preliminary Calamityware sketches and drawings in this Flickr album.\nDon\nPittsburgh, June 6, 2019", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the pre-production proofs have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors, I will green-light production right away without waiting until the project closes.\n\nI\u2019m using a workshop that has produced countless cookie jars for many years. So technical problems are unlikely.\n\nIf you have supported my previous Kickstarter projects, you know I always come through. Frequently, I complete my projects ahead of schedule.

We explore a fantastic and speculative world, where people in the past and present are engaged in creating compelling new futures! \nSYNOPSIS: It\u2019s 1951 in Chicago\u2019s Bronzeville and a spaceship sighting has everyone buzzing. Bonnie, a 20something  artist/columnist with the Chicago Defender, covers a not so secret society of people who dissect speculative science theories and the realm of the paranormal. \nBonnie\u2019s fascinated by this world of eccentrics introduced to her by a mysterious, handsome poet named Mandalay whose freedom she envies. The society meets in the basement of a slaughterhouse. However, when a blue haired pansexual pleasure activist from the future presents the attendees with the opportunity to live in the 2020s, Bonnie must decide whether life in the Alter Destiny is real or a dangling fantasy. \nA Spaceship in Bronzeville is a project published by Mouse Books and is was written by Ytasha L. Womack.\nABOUT YTASHA\nYtasha is an author, Afrofuturist theorist, filmmaker, dance therapist and champion of the imagination. She's author of the book Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci Fi & Fantasy Culture, a Locus Awards Nonfiction Finalist. She's also author of the Rayla Universe series. as well as the nonfiction books Post Black and Beats, Rhymes and Life, What We Love and Hate About Hip Hop. She's lectured at numerous colleges and festivals all over the world. \nShe is a Spring 2019 creative-in residence at Kickstarter and 2018 writer-in-residence with Emerson College in Boston. Much like Bonnie, she got her start as a journalist at The Chicago Defender. Although her families Chicago roots began in Bronzeville, she personally has not seen a spaceship there... although she's met people who claim they have. \n\n EXPLORING BONNIE'S WORLD \nChicago South-side, 1950s\nChicago's Bronzeville neighborhood was one of the great destinations for African Americans escaping hardships in the South during the first half of the 20th Century.  \nOur story's protagonist, Bonnie, lives and works in Bronzeville. Esoteric ideas and new philosophies were hotly debated as people looked to create new futures in the face of new opportunities. Those who came during the Great Migration created a unique culture; a blend of the aspirations and beliefs rife with robust civic and nightlife. The Chicago Defender (where Bonnie works), is one of the leading black-owned papers and was instrumental in attracting people north. \n\n1951: POINT OF TRANSITION \nMusician and poet Sun Ra was a resident of Bronzeville in the 1950's\nIt's after WWII and the African American population in Chicago has nearly quadrupled, the Red Scare is in it's early years, housing segregation is being challenged (think A Raisin in the Sun) and  the country is on the cusp of both a civil rights movement and cultural renaissance. The Regal Theater, Savoy Ballroom, and Club DeLisa were among the popular hang outs and Washington Park and the Southside Community Arts Center are hubs for the exchange of ideas. Chess and Vee-Jay Records were on the rise. Chicago's meat packing plant (where the characters meet) was at an all time high. \n\nCustom Slip Case for 3 Book Set\n Mouse Books offer a convenient alternative to reading on your phone: a phone-sized book. \nMouse Books are approachable, carefully curated, beautiful, durable, real paper books. They are small enough to go with you anywhere. They don\u2019t ring, buzz, vibrate, need batteries, and there are no screens to break.

When you are working at a small scale, every detail matters. \nOUR FIRST LIVING AUTHOR!!!\nYtasha being a good sport during late night work session planning this campaign!\nMouse Books launched by publishing  classic literature by celebrated authors like Joyce, Dostoyevsky, Austen, and Melville. All along we have been waiting for the opportunity to partner with a contemporary author on a special project. We are delighted that Ytasha agreed to work with us, and has created this set of novellas specifically for the Mouse format. \n\n WORLD-CLASS PRINTER \nThis is the actual Heidelberg Speedmaster XL 105 at eDOC that prints Mouse Books!\nMouse is obsessed with making these books extremely high-quality. We've partnered with one of the great printers in the USA, eDOC Communications from Mount Prospect, Illinois, to bring Mouse Books to life.

If pledges go above that, the more the better!\nThe Great Express Robbery (1907) crime pulp novel.\nThis crowdfunder is to get a 102 year old pulp crime paperback back into print.  The Great Express Robbery (1907) by Grace Miller White is based upon the play by A. H. Woods. It's protagonists are two young women who live near their father's coal mine somewhere outside of Old San Francisco and they deal with rough outlaws.  Including a husband with bad intentions for everyone!  The setting is barely more than a decade after of The Old West era (1865-1895)! And as you can figure from looking at the cover, train robbery is involved!\nHello!  My name is Darren Nemeth and I published two other books.  How To Film Moving Pictures in the 1910's, which was funded here successfully in early 2018, and 1907 Chicago Projecting Co.'s Entertainer's Supplies Catalog No. 122; Deluxe Edition (printed in 2015).  Both are about early motion pictures and filled with carefully retouched ephemera, some are very similar in printing as The Great Express Robbery.\nI found The Great Express Robbery a few months ago and never saw a pulp novel going back that far in person. Especially with a color cover.  While reading it the story and language was surprisingly fresh, not \u201cye old timey-wimey.\u201d The plot is brisk and I believe is enjoyable for modern readers. \nWhy Reprint It?\nPaperback pulp novels from over a century ago are hard to find.  Even more rarer is finding one that isn't shedding paper flakes and even more rarer than that are ones that can be read from cover to cover without coming apart.\nThe 128 pages story is fast paced and full of action.  I rarely read fiction and had a hard time putting it down.  Read nearly all of in one sitting which is something I've never done before.  I think that most everyone will enjoy it also.\nIf the funding goal is reached it will pay for a print quantity of eighty books. If above the goal, the more the better! \nHow Was This Reprint Created?\nThe binding of The Great Express Robbery was taken apart so the pages and cover could be individually scanned laying completely flat at 600 dpi.  The cover was extensively retouched and readability of illegible text was restored.  I doubt anyone will be disappointed. \nDisassembled so the pages can be laid flat on the scanner.\nMost of the retouching was to reduce the yellowing on the pages, being careful that none of the printed ink was removed.  Some of the characters in the printing press had too much ink and were blotchy.  Some were barely readable due to too little ink.  Those were fixed by moving legible ones from other areas of the page on top then erasing the surrounding smudge.  The skew of the pages was also corrected and centered.  With these minor repairs the easy flow of reading is restored.\nMore info on how this was done will be in upcoming updates!\nIf funded I endeavor to restore and reprint more crime, adventure and romance novels from the 1890's-1910's period.\nWhen Does It Ship?\nIf funded, all rewards will ship July, 2019.  As soon the printer, Blurb, delivers the books they will be mailed to backers.  \nThe interior pages are 100% finished, the cover is 99% finished (the bottom part shown below will be changed) and the spine is done.  The only thing left to do is the back cover! \nThe first proof. The text at the bottom will be changed.\nAfter the back cover is designed \"The Great Express Robbery\" will be finished and ready for the printing press.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLow risk.

Whose love? Our happy customers! The tiny letters and packages transcribed and crafted by Lea Redmond and her pals have charmed tens of thousands of people in the US and around the world. Y'all have asked for more and more tiny mail, so here we are!\nThe truth is: as much as people love their smartphones, they miss real mail. The world needs more letters and care packages. People want to slow down, to reflect, and to appreciate each other. Tiny mail offers one small way to do just that.\nTiny mail is a double-delight. It's as much fun to send a tiny letter or package as it is to receive one! Tiny mail is for anyone and everyone. It is most certainly for all ages. Some people love tiny mail because it's cute, while others are in it for the absurd. Whether tiny mail is adorable, hilarious, wonder-full or just plain strange, you're bound to make someone's day when your tiny letter or package arrives. (You should see our happy customer email folder!)  \nTo send tiny mail, you type out the info for your custom tiny letters and packages on our website, add real-world shipping addresses, review your order, and go through checkout. Then we wave our magic wand and turn it into a tiny version before shipping! (For reals, it's actually a careful process involving a fancy laser printer, very steady hands and excellent craft skills!)\nWhy doesn't it get lost in the mail? No worries! We package up all tiny mail (with a magnifying glass!) and ship it in a larger mailer so that it arrives safely.\nOver the past ten years, the World's Smallest Post Service has been bursting with creativity. We've released dozens of new formats to spread the magic of tiny mail: DIY stationery sets, \"Keep Me Posted\" 6-week serial stories, tiny seed packets and trowels from the Easter Bunny, anonymous \"Secret Spider\" letters, tiny chocolate package sets, patches, tiny postal ink stamps, letters from the Tooth Fairy, advent calendars containing antique postage stamps, and big batches of tiny mail as invitations and promotional mailings for art museums and other organizations. We've even transcribed wedding proposals!\nBut there's ONE thing that Lea has been daydreaming about for years...\nLea visiting the antique post office counter that she found on craigslist in Drytown, CA. Score!\nWith this Kickstarter project, we want to put even more tiny mail magic and wonder into the world. We propose to create an enchanting, museum-like, open-to-the-public brick & mortar home for our World's Smallest Post Service. We want to make a place, a magical coordinate on the globe where people can count on wonder and kindness.  Here is an illustrated list of the special moments we want to create there:\nA hot air balloon on a pulley descends from the P.O. ceiling to delight a visitor with a treat! (Thank you to the ever-talented Lauren Nassef for these animated illustrations!))\nA diorama of our postal office hiding inside the mail slot inside our postal office!\nWe'd love to put on puppet shows about the history of mail in our postal counter window!\nSend a Bay Area pal to us to redeem a birthday treat in a wall of antique brass P.O. boxes!\nWe'd like to create custom apron postal uniforms for us to wear while greeting visitors.\nNew Bohemia Signs is excited to paint our sign and windows for us!\nWe'd love to offer pressed penny souvenirs with custom imagery on the pennies!\nOur pals at Year Round Co have designed this gorgeous certificate for us!\nTo go along with our new postal storefront in Downtown Oakland, we want to make our online tiny mail experience extraordinary too! What we do is unusual, which means it requires custom programming. And Lea has a long list of cool ideas to make the web interface more user-friendly and powerful. These include: a code redemption system for gift certificates and pre-paying for response mail, better editing and preview tools, etc.\nWe are re-vamping our online ordering system with Ryuhei at Y Designs.\nWe have a quote in hand from our programmer and plan to use about half of our Kickstarter funding to pay for custom code upgrades for our site. The rest will be used to create as many magical moments (see above!) as we can afford, and to set up the new space with the amazing antique post office counter that Lea found in addition to work tables, lighting, and shelving. The more funds that we raise, the more magic we can make! (Our current monthly sales will be able to cover rent, payroll, and insurance, in case you're curious.) \nChoose a reward that you love! \nSee below for visuals of all the options in the list to the right. \nOakland artist Michael Wertz has created a sheet of faux postage stamps celebrating 10 years of the World's Smallest Post Service. They're not real postage, but you can add them to the postage stamp area on envelopes as long as you have enough proper postage too!\nAll backers will receive a WSPS patch and commemorative faux postage stamp sheet.  \nA Little Support! ($15)\nThe tiny mail certificates -- good for one classic custom tiny letter or package -- are discounted from our regular prices (once you add shipping, in case you're comparing). We hope you'll stock up for the next few years, giving us the boost we need right now to stretch into our new storefront and website. Please note: these certificates will arrive in September, once our new code redemption website is built, making the codes functional. (And between now and then, you can send tiny mail via our current website like usual.) \nWho are you excited to send tiny mail to? Who needs a little love? For what occasion or sentiment?

No gimmicks or flashy sales bombarding your inboxes, just illustrated email newsletters from Lea. Our working assumption is that you, our customers, want to be treated like real human beings -- like intelligent, kind people with excellent taste. We put our energy into making wonderful things, and hope that the rest takes care of itself. We count on word of mouth to bring us our future customers, and we're counting on YOU today. Thank you for all the support you've given us over the years, and we look forward to making tiny mail for you and yours for years to come!\nIf you know people who you think would LOVE this project, we'd be happy to mail them a free tiny postcard from you letting them know about it.

Special Delivery!\nLea in the early days, transcribing by hand for passers-by.\nLea Redmond started the World's Smallest Post Service on a whim back in 2008. The idea just popped into her head and she thought it was so hilarious that it must be done. So she sewed herself a postal uniform, crafted tiny envelopes, bought a roll-top doll desk and a fine tipped pen, and biked down to Sweet Adeline Bakeshop where the owner gave her permission to set up her tiny post office in the corner all afternoon. To her great surprise, people loved it and actually bought transcriptions from her - wow! She then set up shop monthly with the good folks at the old Curiosity Shoppe on Valencia Street in San Francisco. After being featured in Ready-Made magazine, Lea started offering tiny mail through a website. One thing led to another, and with the help of a very thoughtful Boing Boing post and a Design Sponge feature, a tiny business was born. \nHow it all began...\nPLAY\n\nHow to make a DIY tiny package from our kit...\nPLAY\n\n\nLea on NBC!\nPLAY\n\n\nA few years ago, Lea built a tiny PO diorama into a knothole in a tree at Tilden Park in Berkeley. Hikers leave trinkets and notes as they pass by. If you want to visit it, here's a map.\nLea has loved making things since she was a wee one, such as this tiny paper soda pop machine. You can explore her world at LeaRedmond.com. Her participatory art projects, such as With A Pencil In My Pocket and Sugar Books invite people to find the extraordinary in the ordinary. Lea dreams up and designs whimsical goods such as Seed Money and Matchbox Theater for her business, Leafcutter Designs. Her World\u2019s Smallest Post Service has charmed tens of thousands of people with teeny tiny mail. Lea also creates books, journals, and games via various publishers, including Letters To My Future Self, Knit The Sky, Paint Chip Poetry and Everyday Offerings. She dreams up new worlds and tries to make them at Lucky Penny Parlor, her tiny 250-square-foot studio / tea room in Downtown Oakland. Her most recent Kickstarter project funded a set of quirky activity cards called Lively Matter. She was recently the first  \"Artist In The House\" at Chronicle Books, where she turned the publishing house's elevator into a tea room.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHonestly, we've done our homework and are confident that we can accomplish our goals if we get the funding we're seeking. This is Lea's 9th Kickstarter project since 2011 (all successful so far) and she's very good at follow-through! The riskiest part of the project is probably the time-line of the custom computer programming, which is estimated but can't really be confirmed until we're well on our way into the review process. As such, we've built a cushion of time into the schedule to be sure we can deliver the tiny letter/package certificates by September. In terms of the brick and mortar aspect of the project, the trickiest part is getting enough in-person customers to justify paying someone to run the register, but our plan for that is to add hours and days as we are able and work our way up to being open all the time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "A Little Support!", "descp": "Just the goodies: a WSPS patch & sheet of our 10th Anniversary commemorative faux postage stamps.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["48 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Send ONE + goodies!", "descp": "You will receive 1 certificate to send a tiny letter (or package) through our new website.

I am please to present a 4th edition to the family ! Here is the silver and black hot foil on white paper. This special deck will be exclusive to Kickstarter and later only available in the box set edition. It won't be available alone or on whole sale.\nHow to get this new edition ?\nYou can just update your pledge and add 20\u20ac or upgrade to the new pledge with the 4 decks. Look for this button and do the upgrade. No posts costs extra !\n\nIMPORTANT : \n>> if you pledge with any early bird price, just add 20\u20ac to not lose your special price. \n>> this new edition will be included in the box with coins edition, no need to change anything. \n>> if you want more than 1 deck, the price is 20\u20ac by deck so just do your maths ...\n>> if you pledge for 3 decks you can upgrade to 4 decks. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nFollowing the success of the first edition, here is a precious metal edition. Each tuck case will be letterpress printed with gold, silver or copper hot foil. A special box set will come with real metal coins to play poker like a pirate.\nEPHEMERA: any items such as tickets or cards that were originally meant to be discarded after use but have since become collectibles. / EPHEMERIDE: French name of a paper calendar that gave you daily information all over the year.\nFrom this idea and my collection of Ephemera over the years, I get the idea of the EPHEMERID playing cards: each card comes with a unique design based of my thousands of hand-letters, invoices, bills, tickets, and photos! \nThe tuck cases are printed with letterpress printing by Studio Pression in France. We us a copper plate which makes amazing details. During the process of printing the first edition, we took time to do some test of hot foil printing and paper colors, that bring me the idea of this new edition.\nThe card are printed by Noir Arts NPCC who already print the first edition. After the tuck cases are printed in France, they are sent to them and the finalize it with a seal.  \nAs a dyslexic kid, it was always complicated for me to make the difference between the hearts and diamonds, and between the spades and clubs. So the contrast between them will be more obvious like this.\nI am also ambidextrous and I hold my cards like a left-handed ! Which means I do not see the numbers when they are only on 2 corners!\nNot only the tucks cases will be different, but also the cards colors. Here are the details.\n\n The silver edition will be limited edition, and only available with set and boxes editions.\n\nYou can choose from 100 coins or the ultimate edition with 200. It contains all the items produce for this edition : deck, dices and coasters.\nCOINS\nI am not a poker expert, but I like to play with my cousin and nephew when we have a family dinner. But I always wanted to play with real coins. I want to have a going all with the sound of metal... I will be working with Fantasy Coins, as I love the coins they made. \nAs the project reach the 400% stretch goal I will design and produce 6 different coins : 1 / 5 / 10 / 20 / 50 and 200. You can choose pledge with set of 20, 40 and add on of 80 coins (mixed). Box set edition comes with 100 or 200 options.\nHere what you will get :\n20 coins : 10x1 / 5x5 / 2x10 / 1x20 / 1x50 / 1x100\n40 coins : 20x1 / 10x5 / 4x10 / 2x20 / 2x50 / 2x100\n80 coins (add on) : 40x1 / 20x5 / 8x10 / 4x20 / 4x50 / 4x100\n100 coins (with boxset) : 30x1 / 20x5 / 20x10 / 10x20 / 10x50 / 10x100\n200 coins (with box set) : 60x1 / 40x5 / 40x10 / 20x20 / 20x50 / 20x100\n\nDICES\nI will also produce special dices with numbers on them. \n4 letterpress coasters \nI am french (did I tell you that?). On French decks, face cards are associated with historic or mythical personages. King of Spades is David, Queen of Diamonds is Rachel and the Jack of Clubs is Lancelot!  It gave me the idea to propose you to giving your name to a card! Be a jack, a queen or a king ! Or make this an opportunity for a great gift! \n12 spots are available : 4 GOLD Kings, 4 SILVER Queens and 4 COPPER Jacks. If you pledge this reward it will include a super deluxe 100 coins box edition. If you a specific card, contact me as soon as you pledge!\nIt will states your First name and the initiale (first letter) of your last name.

Kickstarter let's you know that if you don't think you can trust the creator, then don't back them. They tell you to try and research them before you back a project. I decided not to back many other projects, because I thought I was a scam. Some of them were and some weren't. And I did ask if I could get a refund for the three projects that I backed that I did lose my money, however I didn't get anything. Sure I'm upset about it, but I know that a refund isn't guaranteed, so I cant do anything about it. I just deal with it. One project that I back in 2015 and I still havent gotten the full reward yet. However he still post updates just about every month. And he shipped out half of the rewards. It's just one item from the rewards that hasn't been shipped yet. And no. It's not NEVER the creators fault. Sometimes it can be but this time and most of the times it's not. There could be problems with the manufacturer, but that's not something the creator can fix. They can't just walk in the factory and fix the machine that broke. Or completely rebuild a factory that burnt down to the ground. (Yes, both of those have happened to projects I backed.) Sure you can use the Corona virus as an excuse, because shipping and manufacturing has been very difficult to do since its started. However, that wasnt the only excuse Mr. Cup has provided since the campaign ended. For example on July 31, 2019 he asked us the backers for feedback about the back design. And he changed it to please us the backers. On November 16, 2019 he told us about the problems with his idea of wanting to hot foil the cards. And in that same update he mentioned about a few items shipping in early next year (2020). In January he mentioned he had to redesign the seals to have then printed and cut differently. He also showed all of the tuck boxes being printed. In February he announced that everything has been printed. Later in February he said the tucks and seals were being sent to Noir, and he mentioned the problem with the coin company. They told him they could make the coins but then dropped all communication with him and now he has to find a new company to make them probably at a higher price that the other company offered. In March he said the ESTIMATED time of shipment would be in April for everything except pledges that included coins, since they had just started production. Since then I'm sure that everything has been a huge pain, because everything around the world has slowed down for the Corona virus. And in his update on April 17 he said the likely shipping time will be June. He has been giving honest answers, however thing change. And unfortunately he can't predict the future.", "time": "about 1 year ago"}, {"username": "Richard S", "content": "You guys need to be patient. Especially with the corona virus going around.

Except one where usps destroyed it, but Mr Cup replaced it free of charge. I have complete trust in him and do expect him to deliver this project. I'm sure this project will be very late because of the corona virus, but there is nothing he can do about it. Also you can not get a refund from kickstarter. When you pledge to a kickstarter, you are putting your trust and money into the project the creator is making. If the project somehow fails then it's your loss and your money is gone forever.

I\u2019m Shing Yin Khor, and for the past several years, I\u2019ve been painting strange and wonderful creature friends. They appear in my webcomic, Otherworld Science, in gallery shows across the United States, and at several conventions and events annually. I\u2019ve often been asked to compile them into an art book, and I finally have!\nfinished paintings on my workbench(technically a work floor, in this case).\nStrange Friends is a postcard book featuring 20 paintings of odd creatures, furry, scaled, blerpy, and/or horned. It will be offset printed on a lush felted paper, and each postcard will be a art-print quality piece of art. The cover will be a lovely thick cardstock, with foil printing! I make beautiful objects, and I intend to make this one as fancy as I can!\nOf course, I am a very practical person, so they are also nice postcards that should be sent to people you like. \nHere are some of the creatures that will be in the Strange Friends postcard book.\nGood friends. Much friends.\nThis is a very straightforward Kickstarter - you can buy the postcard book, or buy multiple copies of the book. That's because I just want to make this book, and I want to make it a beautiful and special object! There is a one fancier option, where I'll hand-wrap the book for you so you can give it as a very thoughtful gift. For Kickstarter's Make 100 program, I am also making a care package edition, which allows me to indulge in telling weird little narratives through ephemera and other objects.\nHere is a draft of what the cover will look like! I'll be hand painting it, and updating you on its progress in Kickstarter updates. The pink bits will be rendered on the cover in shiny foil! \nDigital First Draft - Strange Friends cover.\nThe Make 100 Care Package edition\nI love making care packages, as my long-time Patreon subscribers can attest to, and this is a lovingly hand curated care-package of the Strange Friends postcard book, limited edition prints, heartfelt letters from fictional girls, and other delightful handmade ephemera and found objects. I don't want to spoil the arc of the tiny-story-in-a-package, but the keywords are: mysterious disappearances, summer camp, and special beasts. \nI\u2019m using this as a platform to experiment with new found object narratives that won\u2019t be available anywhere else!\nCombining pledge levels\nPlease pledge at the highest pledge reward level listed that you would like, and add the additional cost of other reward levels you want to your pledge. \nCosts, and other details.\nPrinting costs for this book, including proofing, fancy foil printing, felted paper, and shipping from Malaysia, will cost approximately $11,500.00. I'll be printing an initial run of 2000 copies, and have budgeted an additional $4000 for shipping costs, print consulting fees, and production of the care package items. I'm requesting a little bit under this as my goal, as I will be funding approximately 1/3rd of the project myself.\nThe print consultant for this project is Rhiannon Rasmussen-Silverstein and music used in the video is Lobo Loco's Glueworm Evening Blues, from the Free Music Project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've successfully run and fulfilled multiple Kickstarters!

Let\u2019s do something about it.\nThis book offers 50 principles to help the ill-mannered behave with civility and grace. As a public service, I\u2019ve illustrated these principles to make them vivid and easy to remember.\nFull disclosure. Actually, I wrote the book so I\u2019d have an excuse to draw strange creatures doing rude things.\nBooks don\u2019t need to be big to be useful.\nRewards. Each sponsor of the project will receive one or more copies of this rare, collectible, hardcover book. I urge you to pledge at a level that gets you extras so you can share with friends. It also makes a perfect gift for young people whose behavior leaves room for improvement. Because the books are little and easy to wrap, they make superb gifts. \nAlready perfect? If your behavior is already sophisticated and leaves no space for improvement, each page of the book will allow you to enjoy a delightful feeling of smug superiority as you contemplate how far below you most creatures are. Priceless.\nSpecifications\nThe size is A6 size (4.1\" x 5.8\", 105 mm x 148 mm). 68 B&W pages plus color end sheets and a color dust jacket. \nIllustrations. There are more than 50 drawings in Monster Etiquette and I created each of them especially for this book. It\u2019s a visual extravaganza.\nDubious poetry. Each of the captions in this book is a small poem. It has been said that a good poem helps change the shape of the universe. Well these aren\u2019t that kind of poem. These are like the poems Mrs. Katzenbarf taught me to write in 7th-grade English class...but worse. But they get the job done and may make you smile.\nGetting started with advice about introductions\nSpread addressing some airy topics.\nFrom a chapter on mealtime behavior.\nIncludes topics to help build character.\nMissed the previous book? If you missed my Kickstarter project to create the book Stay Home: The Ugly Truth About Space Travel, there are pledge levels to get them too (B and D). \n\n\n\nWhat the critics are saying...\n\u201cFarting is wrong? Who knew?\u201d\n\u201cNice drawings. They haunt my dreams.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent gift for friends\u2014especially those unaccustomed to Earthly ways.\u201d\n\u201cA perfect blend of silly and practical.\u201d\nSCHEDULE\nWhen will you receive your rewards? The book is written and the drawings are done. The page files are complete. I feel safe to promise July 2019. There\u2019s still a lot of proofing, printing, binding, inspecting, and packing to do. I\u2019ll push to make it sooner, but cannot promise.\nSHIPPING\nWhere to? Kickstarter will add the cost of shipping to your pledge based on where you live. \nInternational shipping. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to print shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most shipments slide through without any extra duties, but a few sponsors may find that a customs fee has been slapped on. I can\u2019t predict it or avoid it. \nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to me. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled when they are nearly at your house, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly\u2014before the authorities send the package back.\nLOOSE ENDS\nUpdates and progress reports. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m an obnoxious pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and if I know the answer, I\u2019ll add the Q and A to the FAQ section of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. Not only is this a good place to find some unusual gifts, but it is the only place you\u2019ll find the world\u2019s greatest shower curtain.\nDon\nPittsburgh, February 15, 2019", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 38th Kickstarter project.

I have been a woodturner for around 6 years now. I am blessed to make works of functional art for a living. I am a grateful husband to the most wonderful person I know, my lovely wife Kiley. I am a proud dog father of the cutest german shepherd you have ever seen, and tender of three sassy chickens. A chicken tender if you will..... \nAll jokes aside I am obsessed with what I do for a living. Few things bring me as much satisfaction as finishing a salad bowl that I have crafted from a tree. That being said I firmly believe that trees are best served as living organisms. Removing carbon dioxide and depositing oxygen into our atmosphere, as well as providing shelter to diverse ecosystems and being darn pretty to look at. It's easy to see why so many people are in love with trees and how important they are to society and the natural world. \nIt is vital for me to convey this importance to every person who purchases one of my wares. Most of the trees that my products are crafted from lived much longer lives than any human and were planted/grown decades before I was born. It is my upmost desire that the honor and respect I put into this raw material is evident in the final product.\nFor this campaign, I am raising funds to incorporate a custom bowl drying kiln to my shop. This will create a much quicker turn around time for my salad bowl production as well as adding more control to the process overall. The funds will be used to purchase a small dehumidification kiln unit as well as foam insulation to craft the kiln chamber. This campaign offers a unique shopping opportunity, as I have marked the prices down substantially from my usual retail price. I have added reward levels for varying sizes of bowls. If you pledge at that level, I will turn a custom bowl of that size for you specifically. Each bowl will receive my usual brand as well as a number specific to this campaign. You will receive this bowl packed carefully with a free tin of board butter as well as care instructions and a hand written thank you note.  You will find more information about the different sizes of rewards below this section as well as in the rewards menu on the right. \nIt all starts with the material. Here is a photo of some pieces of sycamore I harvested last summer. Almost all of the bowls I turn are made from salvaged trees in the Lincoln area.\nAs you can see here, I have to make design choices from the very beginning. Starting with how to process the raw material or log.\nPLAY\n\nHere you can see the initial shaping of the bottom of the bowl.\nAfter rough turning, bowls are coated with a green wood sealer to help prevent cracking during the drying process.\nA pile of rough turned bowls before getting stacked and sticker for air drying. The air drying process takes anywhere from 6-18 months. This is where the kiln comes in. Drying times can be reduced to weeks instead of months and years.\nAfter they are dry. I put them back on the lathe for final turning. You can see the color difference between the fresh exposed wood and the exterior that has been exposed for months. The bowls are then sanded to a smooth finish.\nThe final step is the oiling process. I oil all of my bowls with a high quality walnut oil made specifically for salad bowls. The pieces are oiled a number of times and then polished using a walnut oil and beeswax paste.\nHere you will find a section of finished products. The first being this figured Ash Bowl\nDeep Honey Locust Salad Bowl\nBlack Walnut Salad Bowl\nAmerican Sycamore Salad Bowl\nI hope that I have given you a glimpse into the process of making handmade salad bowls. It is a labor of love that is it worth it every single time I get to see a bowl come to life. Each and every piece is a unique tribute to it's host tree and the conditions it lived through. If you choose to support this campaign, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and promise that you will receive the very best product I am capable of making.

As badly as you wish to control the process, sometimes nature does what it wants to do. Drying bowls quicker than they want to dry naturally can lead to cracks or warping. The chance of this happening is the reason that I always expect to get 80% of the bowls I rough turn to survive. Planning this way ensures that anyone who has ordered a bowl will get one, and if I happen to have more than 80% survive, that's a bonus. Please feel free to reach out with comments, questions, or concerns.

It basically change my way of designing. My first items were my own business cards, and soon I created a set of 4 coasters to explore the possibilities. Limited (as all my products) they are sold out for a long time.\nWith first printing, I create prototype of a wood box for a set of 8 coasters, but it never goes further, only 5 were made to see how it looks like. \nTo celebrate the past 10 years, I decided to reprint the original coasters, create a set of 4 more coasters and an edition of 100 with the wood box as the part of the Kickstarter MAKE 100 project.\nWOOD MAKER\nThe wood box will be strictly limited to 100 copies, and made in France by Thibault Malet, who work with me on other projects. Based on 1st prototype created 10 years ago, he will handmade them in his workshop.\nHere is the prototype we did and want to produce. \nTHE LETTERPRESS PRINTING & STUDIO PRESSION\nThe coasters will be printed in France, at Studio Pression, my printing partner for the past 6 years. Letterpress printing has the ability to create relief into paper by adding tons of pressure while printing. It\u2019s called deep impression. And it\u2019s done at the same time, printing AND debossing, always one color at a time. The thicker the paper, the deeper the impression. For a crisper effect, we use much harder magnesium plates instead of photopolymer. Here come some pictures of last year printing.\nTHE REWARDS\nTHE LETTERPRESS CALENDAR\nAdded of the coasters I will add copies of both edition of my 2019 letterpress. They will be send right at the end of the campaign, while the coasters would be produced a little later.\nThe calendar is created with 11 others worldwide designers, each creates an unique design based on an inspiring sentence.\nThe STANDARD edition of the calendar comes with black cover with gold and black hot foil, pages are letterpress printed in black on white an grey paper. The DELUXE edition comes with a gold cover with gold and black hot foil, all the pages are hot foil printed on black paper.\nMore picture are available here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery new Kickstarter is challenge, but also an experience. Hope it will be another nice success. I will use backerkit at the end of the campaign to have the address as soon as possible for the calendars and send them as soon as possible.

It will feature over a hundred paintings, acquired from museums and private collections worldwide: we\u2019re giving life to a congeries of animals of a unique kind, a species made immortal through the craftsmanship of its painters.\nAbout the exhibition\nIn the history of art, animals of different kinds and species have been portrayed and many of them often concealed a symbolic meaning. As a matter of fact, the relationship between animals and art is a matter of iconography: for instance, did you know that the tiny dog of the Arnolfini portrait by Jan van Eyck represents marital fidelity? Did you know that the Unicorn in art symbolizes royalty and chastity? And think about the power of all those biblical characters like St Jerome and the lion, John the Baptist and the lamb... \nThe idea behind the exhibition is to bring to the public\u2019s attention the essential role that animals often had in the history of art as well as to raise awareness towards animal welfare. Furthermore, this is an opportunity to learn how the alliance between man and animal has changed - or stayed the same - over the years.  \nOf the vastness of art history, we focused on a programme of ten thematic sections: \nAnimals in sacred paintings: symbols and allegories\nAnimals in paintings with a mythological subject\nAnimals and man: a millennial relationship\nDogs\nCats\nFish, reptiles and insects\nBirds\nFarm animals\nDwarves against animals\nExotic and imaginative animals\nThanks to the partnership with the Department of Natural Sciences of the University of Pisa, we\u2019ll include essential information on ancient races and their evolution throughout the centuries. \nThe WWF cooperation and our help to the \"Backing the Rhinos to survive\" project\nBy virtue of its cultural, artistic and scientific importance, WWF gave us their patronage: so significant to us as we want to bring to the visitors attention our concern towards themes such as the conservation of biodiversity, the protection of wildlife as well as the fight against illegal hunting. We will donate part of the amount we will raise to the WWF safeguard project \"Backing the Rhinos to survive\", a conservation campaign to protect rhinos in Africa and Asia through microchipping and translocation to safer areas.\nWhy we need your support: the catalogue and the virtual tour project\nWe need a hand to help cover the catalogue printing costs as well as the virtual tour development. The catalogue will consist of 260 color pages and will be published by Silvana Editoriale, one of the most respected italian art-book editors, and it will include all these paintings as well as all the stories and curiosities behind each artwork. Furthermore, we want to bring all the backers, wherever they are in the world, along with us in a virtual tour of our rooms, to take a thorough look at all the paintings and give them the chance to learn everything about these masterpieces. An immersive, mesmerizing and very detailed virtual circuit among creatures, pets and beasts and the artful brush strokes of their painters.\nThe curator\nThe exhibition is curated by Davide Dotti, an italian art historian and curator from Brescia, Italy.\nSo far he curated 22 exhibitions in prestigious museums and cultural institutions both in Italy and abroad and today he\u2019s in charge of Palazzo Martinengo\u2019s exhibition space, where \u201cAnimals in Art\u201d will be hosted. \nOpening dates and venue\nThe exhibition will run from 19th January to 9th June 2019 in Brescia (ITALY), right in the old city center, where the beautiful Renaissance Palazzo Martinengo dwells: that is our exhibition\u2019s venue.\nThank you for your support and we hope you can come and pay us a visit in Brescia!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risks for this project are undertaken by the Palazzo Martinengo association, in charge of the exhibition.

from 200 rare travel photographs from 1870-1930 that I will restore to crisp perfection.....or select them all!  \nClimbing Paradise Glacier in Mt. Rainier National Park, Washington ( 1911-1920 )- Curtis & Miller/National Photo Company\nWhat is The Grand Tour about? \nRelive a bygone age of discovery and romance. Before the age of jet-travel and Eurorail, intrepid men and women explored the four-corners of the world via sailing ships, ocean liners, trains such as the Orient Express and the Trans-Siberian Railway, or via bicycle, camel, donkey, or foot. \nThis was an era when traveling the world was a thrilling new possibility for those with the resources, time, and pluck to take those first steps outside of their home. Few individuals had even seen photographs of such exotic places as Bali, Kenya, or Brazil and yet were brave enough to embark on extended journeys to places unknown. \nThis campaign is a celebration of that era. \nThe Rameseum of El-Kurneh, Thebes ( 1857 ) - Photographed by Francis Frith / The Metropolitan Museum of Art\nTwo-hundred ( 200 ) rare travel images from archives around the world have been selected and will be brought back to their original splendor by being digitally restored to high-definition sharpness. You will be the recipient of these newly-restored photos and can enjoy them in digital format or by taking your pick with an 8x10\" print. \nLast year, during Kickstarter's Make 100 initiative I chose to unearth 100 rarely-seen historic images for a restoration project entitled \"The Past in Focus\". The support I received from the Kickstarter community was tremendous and humbling, too. Little did I realize that so many other people were interested in seeing these rare images digitally restored!\nThis year, I am continuing the restoration work with this new endeavor - The Grand Tour. The Grand Tour is your passport to experiencing the romance, elegance, and adventure that enthralled passengers of the golden age of travel. Take a journey back in time along with me!\nView of Venice, Italy ( 1890-1900 ) Photochrom/Library of Congress\nWhat Kind of Images Are Being Restored?\nThe pyramids of Egypt, ancient ruins, Turkish mosques, the bustling Riviera, snow-capped temples of Japan, the Grand Canyon, the rushing falls of Niagara, ooh-la-la Paris..... you'll see all the locations that travel agencies such as Cook's Tours would have offered in the late-1800s. \nCoastal View of Brazil ( 1860s-1880s ) - Marc Ferrez/The J. Paul Getty Museum\nAt the conclusion of the campaign, all 200 of the restored images from \"The Grand Tour\" will be available for viewing online and you can then make your pick of which image you want to frame for your home. Enjoy a mystery? I can surprise you with a print! \nIf you can't decide which photo you would like to own, then you can own them all - The Grand Tour Image Collection will include all 200 images fully-restored as downloadable hi-res jpegs ( 1200-5800px ) so you can make 5x7\",  8x10\", or 16x20\" and larger prints yourself. \nTemple of Athena, Aegina Island, Greece ( 1850-1880 )/Library of Congress\nThe majority of these images will be unearthed from the largest and most magnificent photo collection in America - the Library of Congress - but I will peruse libraries from the far corners of the world as well... libraries such as the Rijksmuseum, the National Maritime Archives of Australia, The J. Paul Getty Museum, and The British Library. \nPromenade and Grand Salon, Trouville, France ( c1890-1900 ) / The Library of Congress\nLibraries make it a practice to scan photographs and then upload them to their archives untouched and unrestored. Most need color correction, sharpening, and a great deal of spot cleaning to bring them to vibrant life again. It takes me anywhere from 10-45 minutes to clean and restore each photo. If \"The Grand Tour\" gets successfully funded, I'll be taking time off from my small business to focus on the digital restoration of these 200 images. \nThe original image scans will come from a variety of different photo types: albumen prints, glass plate negatives, photographic prints, stereoviews, photochroms and autochroms. \nOne of the photographs before restoration......\n....and then after restoration!\nMy sister and I operate a home-based photo business, so making beautiful photographs is our specialty. All 8\"x10\" photographs will be printed and cut by hand in our home studio. They will be printed on Canon premium luster photo paper with Chromalife inks ( 150+ year lifespan ). All photos are archival so you'll have a print that one day will be as old as the image printed on it!  \nTHE GRAND TOUR COLLECTION \nThis grand image collection contains all 200 photographs restored for this project. Each image is in JPEG format at 300dpi, ranging in size from 2500-5500 pixels ( 1.5-6mb each ). Since this makes for a very heavy file, they will be zipped up neatly in one downloadable .zip file. Since the project is not completed yet, I don't know what the full size of this zip would be, but make sure you have space on your computer! \nWhat could you do with these files? Just about anything you like. Almost all of the photographs are in the public domain meaning you are free to be as creative with them as you like. The few that are licensed as Creative Commons or Attributive will be marked as such. You could use the photos for a book project, make albums with them, frame them as wall art, or if you want to open up your own photography gallery and sell prints, you could do that, too! \nThe collection will also include a listing of with each photo's title, the photographer ( if available ), date, and source ( this is especially useful if you want to browse more photos on your own! ). \nTHE PAST IN FOCUS - SECOND EDITION\nThe second edition of The Past in Focus was completed last July but only offered as a pre-order to those who backed the first Make 100 project. Now it is available for everyone! \nThis collection contains 100 rare historic photographs dating from 1851-1946 and, unlike the first edition of The Past in Focus, each digital file is sent in its largest hi-res size so you can make prints for yourself. All images are in the public domain. This, too, will be sent as one downloadable large .zip file containing all one hundred individual JPEGS. \nHere is a tiny sample of some of the photographs included in this edition: \nLeigh Brintnell outside his Fokker Super-Universal airplane ( 1935 )/ Provincial Archives of Alberta\nArizona. Grand Canyon, photographer suspended on climber's rope ( 1908 )/Kolb Brothers Photographers\nPlaying a game of \"sl\u00e5 p\u00e5 ring\" at Folkefjellet ( 1910 ) - Paul Stang/Fylkesarkivet i Sogn og Fjordane\nStrongman Paul Remos hoists his son in the air to feed a giraffe at the zoo ( 1930s )/Library of Congress\nNavajo Indian warming hands over fire in tepee ( 1915 ) - William J. Carpenter/Library of Congress\nDancing Lesson - The \"Mazurka\" ( late 1800s ) - Karl Karlovitz Bulla/The J. Paul Getty Museum\nSAILS & SPARS COLLECTION\nThis bonus set of 25 photographs includes images of yachts, three-masted sailing ships, steamers and ocean liners dating from 1870-1930. All images are fully-restored hi-res jpegs sent in one downloadable .zip file. \nTHE BONUS SETS\nTake a peek at my first Kickstarter campaign - The Past in Focus - and you will see that as the campaign grew in size more and more photos were added onto it.

The aim of this Kickstarter project is to find homes for 100 of my original drawings in art collections like yours.\nWhere do these drawings come from? These are drawings from my previous Kickstarter projects creating porcelain, textiles, t-shirts, books, and other nonsense. There are also some new drawings from projects that are not yet complete but may appear on Kickstarter soon. The suite of drawings has already been selected. It includes monsters, aliens, exotic creatures, and a few robots.\nI draw characters every day. Get one to add whimsy to your art collection.\nWhat is the reward for supporting this project? In addition to the warm glow you will experience from supporting the arts, you will also receive a unique, original drawing. These are signed ink drawings on heavy-weight, acid-free paper. You\u2019ll also receive a lavishly pompous certificate of authenticity to document the drawing\u2019s back story.\nYour drawing will be matted (also acid-free) so you can pop it in any sufficiently elaborate 8\" x 10\" frame. Or you can have your framer redo the whole thing from scratch. Perhaps a gilded frame with cherubs?\nDocumentation will make it easier when you give your collection to an art museum later.\nWhy would someone want one of these drawings? That\u2019s an excellent question. Here are three reasons:\n\u2022 Like to have original artworks in your art collection.\n\u2022 Like weird creatures doing inexplicable things.\n\u2022 Like to receive packages from Don.\nHere are some samples from the suite of 100.\n[21] Bug-eyed alien with pipe\n[17] Orc in a bunny suit\n[14] Creature coping with inadequate gravity\n[15] Enthusiastic alien with mismatched eyes\nLet Fate decide\nWill sponsors be able to choose their drawing? No. I have no way to manage individual requests without driving myself mad. Instead, sponsors and drawings will be matched up randomly by blind fate.\nEach original comes in a mat like this so it\u2019s ready to pop in a standard 8\"x10\" frame.\nWhen will the rewards go out? This project will be active until the end of January. By the time the project ends on Kickstarter, all the drawings will be packed up and ready to ship. As soon as Kickstarter collects the pledges, I can send out the address survey. Shipping should be able to start around March 1, 2019.\nInternational shipping. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to print shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most shipments slide through without any extra duties, but a few sponsors may find that a customs fee has been slapped on. I can\u2019t predict it or avoid it. \nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to me. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled when they are nearly at your house, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly\u2014before the authorities send the package back.\nUpdates and progress reports. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m an obnoxious pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and if I know the answer, I\u2019ll add the Q and A to the FAQ section of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. Not only is this a good place to find some unusual gifts, but it is the only place you\u2019ll find the world\u2019s greatest shower curtain.\nDon\nPittsburgh, January 4, 2019", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 37th Kickstarter project.

A faint tap-tap-tap at the window? A scratching at the door? Those are the sounds of my nightmares trying to get in. They want to tell their stories and delight in making you gasp. They've already filled one book full of mystery and now they are back and want to slide onto the pages of another book to make you shudder and snort in terror forevermore.\nHello! I'm the writer and creator of the Bertram Fiddle Adventure games and work as a children's illustrator and character designer at  Rumpus Animation in Bristol, UK. Last year I self-published 100 Days of Mystery - a collection of scratchy ink drawings set in a Victorian world full of crooked houses and creepy characters that I kickstarted as part of the Make100 initiative. It took me a lot longer to complete than I intended, but I was really happy with the result and have decided to try and make another book continuing the themes of befuddlement and dread. \nBy backing this project you will help make this gloriously twisted book of drawings and stories become a reality and be the first to hold it. Hours of delirious rapture are guaranteed!\nSome of the 100 Original Ink Drawings from my last project\nShe clutched the box to her chest, her heart trembling like a bowl of jelly being eaten by an unruly five year old\nIt was so much fun to get back to drawing with ink on paper instead of being hunched over a computer screen all day. The illustration ideas come from a strange and peculiar version of Victoriana which blends my love of comedy, Hammer Horror and Victorian novels and are heavily inspired by Edward Gorey, Arthur Rackham and Tim Burton. In this world anything is possible, although it will usually be soggy and/or flea-ridden. I found that once I started the ideas all came tumbling out and there were many I never got the chance to put in that first book. It seems a shame to waste them and I'd love the chance to make another volume binding them together for all to enjoy.\nHe stumbled towards a pot of inconceivably large onions and crouched down low behind it\nI draw them with a scratchy old dip pen in Japanese ink I picked up in Tokyo on pure white A4 270gm card. The extra shading is done with a brush and the same ink. For printing purposes I will scan the originals and may alter the contrast to achieve the best print results but won't alter the drawing in anyway. This will be a book of pure inky, scratchy splodginess.\nThe accompanying stories will be no more than a page long and are written in the style of Victorian fiction, with nods to Edgar Allen Poe, Conan Doyle and a generous dollop of Lovecraft.\nA spread from the 100 Days of Mystery book I self-published last year\nAs with the first book I am, once again, going to collect my drawings and put them in a book along with 50 short stories. A book guaranteed to make your bookshelf 35% more intriguing and one all your friends will covet. \nThe money raised will cover the cost of printing the 150 page, perfect bound softback books in black and white. They will be A4 portrait sized with a 300 gsm spotUV cover to match the first book.\nREWARDS\nBackers will get a copy of the 100 Days of the Macabre artbook, which will be designed and printed to match the 100 Days of Mystery book that I have already completed.\nBackers of the limited edition original ink drawing will receive a signed copy of the book and a hand-drawn original artwork that is featured in the book.\n100 Days of Mystery\nUnbelievably we\u2019ve reached our total all ready and this book of dread and befuddlement shall now become a reality! Huzzah! As we\u2019ve still got quite a few days to go let\u2019s see how far we can go! \nIf we are able to reach these stretch goals then every backer will have their pledge upgraded to include the new rewards. \nSTRETCH GOAL 1 - UNLOCKED!\nNow we have reached \u00a38500 I will include a set of 4 Stickers in everyone\u2019s reward.

The question is, \"What are we reading?\" If you are like us, you can only take so much social media and online journalism. Mouse Books offer a convenient alternative to reading on your phone: a phone-sized book. \nMouse Books is literature for a mobile lifestyle. Our books are approachable, carefully curated, beautiful, and durable enough to go with you anywhere. They don\u2019t ring, buzz, vibrate, need batteries, and the screens never break. \nHOW IT WORKS\nSTEP 1 - Subscribe and get a year of Mouse Books delivered right to your door. \nSTEP 2 - Mouse Team cranks away making the BOOKS, BLOGS, and PODCASTS. \nSTEP 3 - Enjoy literature without having to cart around huge books.\nWe launched last year on Kickstarter, and in Season 1 we grew the Mouse Book Club to 40+ countries and all 50 states, shipping 30,000+ books!!!  Mouse is back for Season 2 and we feel we have made nearly every aspect of the reading experience better!\nSPECIFICATIONS\nMouse Books are carefully crafted to optimize the reading experience in a very compact format. When you are working at a small scale, every detail matters. \nQUARTERLY THEMES\nMouse encourages you to make connections between what you're reading and the larger world. This starts with the books we pick. Each quarter, the Mouse editorial team selects full texts, excerpts, short stories, speeches, poetry and more built around a theme.  Together they form a conversation around an important topic: a literary playlist. \nTHIS YEAR :\n LAST YEAR:\nKICKSTARTER SPECIAL: FOUNDERS EDITION\nOn the morning we first thought of the Mouse Books idea, the VERY FIRST book we tested was The Blue Hotel by Stephen Crane. As a special offer for the Season 2 campaign, we've created a limited Founders Edition of this book and will mail you a copy IMMEDIATELY when you make a pledge. This book is not for sale and available only to people who back this campaign.\nMOUSE MICRO-LIBRARY\nGet the first 15 Mouse Books in a sweet box set. Authors included are: Herman Melville, Jane Austen, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Jonathan Swift, Walt Whitman, William Shakespeare, Andrew Marvell, John Donne, Charlotte Bronte, Gustave Flaubert, Homer, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry David Thoreau, and Thomas Paine.\nMOUSE BOOKS MAKE GREAT GIFTS!!!!!\nSince starting Mouse Books, the number one comment we receive from people is, \"I think this is really cool, BUT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD LOVE THIS!\" If you back the Season 2 campaign at the gift subscription level by December 19th we will guarantee delivery of a GIVING Series 3-Pack with custom gift card by Christmas.  \nMOUSE READER REVIEWS\n\"I love small things that are beautifully made.\" Clarissa in San Antonio\n\"I was reading the Murders in the Rue Morgue and another passenger was so very intrigued by the Mouse Book, I had to give it to them. It was the most wonderful idea, they were very happy. But now, I wanna finish reading it for myself. What are the steps to ordering another copy?\" Joel in Austin (we gave him another copy...)\n\"\u201cI am once again smitten with literature. This new medium (Mouse Books) offers a unique approach, an engaging appeal to consider, to ponder.\" Tim in Portland\n\u201cI LOVE being a member of the Mouse Club!! I smile every time I see my card in my wallet.... mostly because I think about what an amazing thing you\u2019ve done. Experiencing the written word tactically is not only irreplaceable and difficult to articulate, but it is vital we read, caress and FEEL the power the written word possesses. We have strayed so far!!\u201d Kelly in Walla Walla\n\"Congratulations on an awesome year of books! I love the surprise in this shipment and it's a great way to showcase the year. Looking forward to year 2!\" J in Collinsville, OK\nWORLD-CLASS PRINTER\nWe are obsessed with making these books extremely high-quality. We've partnered with one of the great printers in the USA, eDOC Communications from Mount Prospect, Illinois, to bring Mouse Books to life. And since our printing partner is local to our Chicago-based team, we know our quality standards are upheld during every print run.  \nThis is the actual Heidelberg Speedmaster XL 105 that prints Mouse Books!\nTHANK YOUUUU!!!!\nIf you are NEW to Mouse Books, THANK YOU for making it through the whole description!

It is a porcelain platter, shaped in the texture of a well known city and contains the main architectural landmarks. These trays can be used for presenting food, storing items or a great addition to any interior. By running a crowd-funding campaign, Studio Lorier tries to raise enough funds via Kickstarter for a diverse collection of the most popular cities around the world. \nEach plate and landmark is handcrafted in their Rotterdam based studio. All miniature buildings are slib-cast into self made molds. The landmarks are joined as a solid connection and all is finished with a non-toxic, food safe glaze that is even dishwasher proof. \nDuring the crowd-funding campaign, people can support the project by funding it. Rewards vary from a set of mini landmarks, to an embossed city plate including it's architecture. You can even get a fully customized plate, made to order. Supporters can choose from a list of the most popular cities, that will expand when extra funds will be raised. During the campaign, backers have the possibility to get the city plates for the lowest price ever until December 4th 2018. \nStudio Lorier is a design firm that is based in the Netherlands.

It's a beautiful deck of playing cards that will be your indispensable companion in the new world of weed.\n    Each of the 56 cards focuses on one key element of cannabis, providing a concise explanation and a detailed illustration. Whether you're new to cannabis, or an old hand, The Weed Deck will improve your understanding of the drug.\nThe contents of the deck have been painstakingly researched and designed to provide a deep and comprehensive overview of the cannabis field. \nAnd the casino-quality card stock with linen texture makes the deck perfect for all your favourite card games.\n  The Weed Deck covers all of your questions about cannabis. From the basic (How long will I be high for? How should I store my weed?), to the more advanced (How does THC interact with my body? What is \"dabbing\", and do I dare try it?)\nThe main subject areas are shown below:\n        The deck is being manufactured by Legends Playing Card Company, the producers of some of the finest decks in the world. They'll use state-of-the-art presses and top-end card stock to print a deck that both looks and feels amazing.\nIf you prefer to ingest your cannabis information in a more traditional format, The Weed Book is just the thing. It contains all of the same content as the deck, in an elegant hardcover book format.\nThe larger page area gives the beautiful illustrations room to shine. Take The Weed Book on your next dispensary visit, or put it on your coffee table as a conversation starter.\n        Below are the items that are available. Your reward will ship in early December, 2018, once manufacturing has been completed.\n        The Weed Deck and The Weed Book will be manufactured and ready to ship by early December. This means you can give the ultimate Christmas gift to any \"canna-curious\" friends or family members.\nBen Barrett-Forrest is the creator, writer, and designer of The Weed Deck, living in Victoria, British Columbia. This is Ben's third deck of educational playing cards launched on Kickstarter.\nCelia Krampien is the illustrator of The Weed Deck. She lives in St. Catharines, Ontario, and has worked for clients like The LA Times, The Globe and Mail, and Scientific American.\nThe video was filmed and edited by the lovely Ben Kerr: http://benkerr.ca/\nAnd social media is being handled by the talented Vanessa Elie.\n Previous Decks\nIn the past 4 years, Ben has released two educational decks of playing cards: The Design Deck, and The Font Deck. They have now sold over 10,000 copies, been shipped to 90 countries, and are used as curriculum aids in several colleges and universities. \nYour can purchase a deck for yourself at this link.\nThe Weed Deck works beautifully for card tricks. It has rotationally symmetrical card backs with a striking design, and silky finish for easy card handling. \nWatch magician Jason Verners bust some jaw-dropping moves with The Weed Deck below.\nPLAY\n\n        We'd love to tell as many people as possible about this new way to learn about cannabis.
