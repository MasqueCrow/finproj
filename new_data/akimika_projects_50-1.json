We're Nova and Mali, and we like making collaborative gay art projects. Our goal is to create an art book full of famous works of art you probably recognize, but we're making them gay, trans, and POC inclusive!\nYou want to see the Birth of Venus but trans? We got you.\nLeyendecker but lesbians? We've got that too.\nSuccessfully funded in only two hours, and stretch goals all reached in five hours!\nKickstarter marked us a project they love and we've been featured in the Mary Sue and Fangirlish!\nMock-up of the front and back cover of the book\nOur hard cover art book will be in full color, filled to the brim with beautiful reimagined works of art from Ancient Greece to 20th century Rockwell. \nA mock-up of the book's interior, featuring Aadorah's finished piece and Blackdistraction's WIP\nThe cover has been beautifully painted by Shouty (Shouty_y), reimagining Fragonard's The Swing as a new stunning piece! We've gathered over 60 artists from around the world and each is creating a new piece of art for us.\nOur wonderful artists!\nOur campaign graphic design was created by our very own Floh (FlohGna) who is also illustrating a piece for the book. Thank you Floh!\nThis is our second project - we successfully ran Lady Tarot Cards last year (2020), reaching all of our stretch goals and more with nearly $40,000 raised. Quite a few artists from the cards have come over to work on this book too and we're thrilled to have them back.\n(Small note: we are out of the tarot cards - we ended up selling them all! We are not planning a reprint at this time as it would take over 500 orders to consider it which is basically an additional KS campaign!)\nSome of our tarot cards!\nOur tarot cards with their foiled sides and their tuck box\nOur Book\nMock-up showing the book's cover\nOur book will be 8.5x11 inches and have a soft matte touch hardcover and filled with over 60 different works of art from over 60 artists! This is an ongoing project with art still being created - some designs may change but the overall feel will of course be the same.\nAll orders of the book will now include 1 holographic print from cleocatart - their piece is based on Leighton's The Fisherman and the Syren.\nMock-up of the interior, showing Vicky's WIP and Pien's finished piece\nThe Merch\nOur merch pack and the shiny bits!\nEach merch pack will have:\n 1 sticker designed by karlovycross (design coming soon based on Le Flirt a La Rose by LeClerc) (this might end up being a glitter or holographic sticker too!!!!)\n 1 metal bookmark designed by mayticks featuring Hades and Persephone, Theseus and a Fury, and Orpheus and Eurydice!\n 3 holographic art print 6x9 inches of fidisart's piece based on Mucha's Flirt and two more yet to be determined!\n 3 random postcards from a selection of art from the book\n Your choice of 1 of 3 acrylic charms designed by rosefinchie and renstrapp! Rose  designed two charms: one with cave hand paintings and one with Artemisia Gentileschi. The cave painting design is being workshopped into possibly being glow in the dark, and Artemisia is a clear charm! Ren created a design with Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace as girlfriends.\n An embroidered patch designed by Mayticks! Her patch features Hades and Persephone...and some innocuous pomegranates.\nSome designs are still TBD as our artists complete their work!\nClose up view of our shiny shiny bookmark from Mayticks!\nSupport Levels/Pledge Tiers\nEarly bird pledge description and graphics\n The first 20 people to pledge for the book and book/merch levels get a discounted price!\nThese early bird tiers are:\nArt book - digital and physical - $35 (plus shipping)\nArt book (digital and physical) and merch - $60 (plus shipping)\nPledge levels and graphics!\n Our normal support level tiers are:\nDigital book only - $15\nMerch only - $30 (plus shipping)\nArt book (digital and physical) - $40 (plus shipping)\nArt book (digital and physical) and merch - $70 (plus shipping)\n2 x Art books and merch - $130 (plus shipping)\nA reminder: if we unlock levels below in the stretch goals, those items will be automatically included in your pledges!\nOur limited edition tier\nFinally, we have one limited edition tier! This tier includes the books and merch PLUS a limited edition linograph print from Mayticks of her version of Klimt's The Kiss (A3 size - 29.7 x 42 cm, 11.75 x 16.5 in). We have 25 prints available!\nArt book (digital and physical), Merch, and 1 print - $150 (plus shipping)\nMayticks' lino prints!\nWe will be using BackerKit for this project and you'll get emails from them later on about shipping addresses. You'll also get a chance to add-on any additional items and a few leftover merch choices from Lady Tarot Cards. Finally, you'll be able to pre-order more copies and merch through there before we launch our online store - when the store launches, the prices will no longer have the discounted KS prices you find here!\nReminder: Kickstarter doesn't charge you unless/until we get funded - that means your card won't be charged until May! You can adjust your pledge or cancel it until May 5. We of course hope you won't cancel a pledge, but understand that things are very tough right now.\nThis book will not be reprinted - this is a one run deal and we'll order enough to cover the KS orders, our pre-orders in the store, and enough to stock the store for a while. After we run out, that'll be it!\nOur Stretch Goals\nGraphic showing our unlocked stretch goals!\nALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED ON DAY ONE!!!\nAt $35,000, all the books will have a soft touch matte hardcover!\nAt $40,000, all merch packs will include your choice of 3 acrylic charms, designed by rosefinchie and renstrapp!\nRenstrapp is creating a keychain design with Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace as girlfriends, and rosefinchie designed two charms: one with cave hand paintings and one with Artemisia Gentileschi. The cave painting design is being workshopped into possibly being glow in the dark!\nAt $45,000, all merch packs will include an embroidered patch designed by Mayticks! Her patch features Hades and Persephone...and some innocuous pomegranates.\nAt $50,000, all merch packs will include 3 holographic prints (1 from fidisarts and 2 others), and all physical orders will include 1 holographic print from cleocatart - their piece is based on Leighton's The Fisherman and the Syren.\nNEW STRETCH GOAL!\nThis campaign has surpassed all of our hopes and is firmly in the WOW category! We're announcing a new stretch goal for $150k - a solid 3D metal keychain featuring Mayticks' Hades and Persephone design!! This would be included with every merch pack, and available for purchase as an add-on after the campaign in the Backerkit survey. Let's get to work sharing this around so we can get these bad bois unlocked!\nMayticks' design for the keychain\nMayticks' keychain!\nThe Timeline and Funding\nOur timeline is of course dependent on a lot of things, including but not limited to: artists finishing their work, products being made in a timely manner, shipping to us with minimal delays, packing and shipping everything (it's just the two of us so it might take a few extra days!), and then shipping out to you!\nIdeally, our timeline is as follows:\nApril - May - Kickstarter campaign runs and the funds get sent to us in May\nMay - June - Artists complete their pieces\nJuly - August - We compile everything and get things sent to production. Some of the merch is already ready to go - the biggest work will be for us to format the book for print to ensure the highest quality images.\nSeptember - November - A nice big window for us to receive and send out the goodies, ideally BEFORE the holiday postal rush.\nWe will be keeping everyone up to date with updates as we go through the process, especially when we receive products in the mail! This is going to have some really amazing things created and we can't wait to be able to show you.\nOur funding process covers the products, shipping, and all the taxes/fees, and everything else is used to pay our artists and mods!\nWe've been through this rodeo before so we know some backers forget or miss the backer survey when we ask for your address. It is your responsibility to make sure your email is correct so we can send you important updates and messages! We will hold your pledge goodies for six months after we send out the last call message, and we will try our absolute best to get in contact with you - we don't want anyone to miss out. After that six months, we will no longer hold your goodies and cannot offer a refund - we have a very small apartment and we need the space!\nShipping\nWe will ship anywhere in the world in sturdy cardboard mailers. We are not responsible for lost or damaged packages, and many will take a long time to get to you especially for our international friends. We are also experiencing a much higher volume of orders than we expected so even with the help of a few friends, our packing/sending process will take a little longer - please be patient with us :)\nWe CAN ship to the UK, even with the new VAT rules, thanks to the project being a book! Shipping is expensive right now with many countries/postal carriers adding extra surcharges to their rates - please be aware of that when you click through to the shipping options. Most packages are $15/30 for domestic (USA) and international packages.\nWe are not responsible for any additional customs/duties on packages. We will be declaring them as printed matter/books/postcards/bookmarks/etc as appropriate and we of course hope there won't be any issues - the labels will not include any indication of LGBT content.\nOur digital book can be emailed easily to anywhere anytime! (after, of course, it's made and ready to send out this fall!)\nAbout us!\nNova and Mali have been married for a few years now and spend most of their free time working with their endless cycle of rescue foster kittens! They ran a successful project during 2020 to create nearly 800 decks of tarot cards and sent them all over the world.\nPhoto of Mali and Nova from their wedding photos", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risk, assuming we get funded, is timing. Our timeline is a best guess - things can go awry with quality control and shipping to us, causing delays. We will communicate these issues as best we can as they happen, and keep everyone informed.\nLately the shipping scene is a mess.

If you couldn't make it in time, wishlist Breakwaters on Steam and join us on Discord.\nIf you have questions about the rewards, please message us on Kickstarter or reach out to use on Discord or Twitter.\nIn the ocean depths lies the key to defeating Titans and bringing calm to the waves. Sail the waters to find new islands & resources to build, craft, and survive.  Explore the world and uncover ancient secrets about the truth of the Titans if you wish to save the people on the land.\n\nBreakwaters is a unique exploration survival game that is on track to ship single player and co-op gameplay later this year, but we need your help.  Partner with us to take Breakwaters forward so it can release in its best possible way and add your personal touch to the world.\n\nKey Features\nOnline co-op and Single player\nMassive ocean sim that creates a unique interactive open world experience\nDefeat Titans as large as an island and fight Golems as big as a house.\nGather crystals and refine them into items which displace and deform the ocean revealing rich resources below.\nBuild  structures that interact with the world scale ocean simulation.  Turn a valley into a lake or open the doors and flood the lowlands.\nCraft items to suit your play style whether it be farmer, explorer, adventurer.\nBuild and customize your boat to handle Titans, rough weather, and local enemies.\nMassive world filled with procedural islands and unique biomes.\nDynamic time of day and weather.\nBreakwaters has a powerful ocean sim at its core.  It interacts with everything in the world and you can interact directly with it.  Build walls to hold it back or use refined crystals to displace it and venture into its depths.\nRefined Yellow Crystal repels water revealing resources below\nRefined Blue Crystal creates water\nUse ancient lighthouses to reveal submerged structures full of monsters and treasure. \nDiscover ancient ruins hidden below the water\nTitans are ancient relics of a past civilization.  They roam the ocean, destroying anything that gets too close or draws their attention for too long.\nTurtle Titan - A large biped Titan which displaces water anywhere it walks.  Its armor prevents any attack of opportunity.\nSerpent Titan - Swimming in the ocean depths, they cause whirlpools and typhoons.  Defeating a Serpent Titan requires either a fast or a strong boat.\nCrab Titan - There is little recorded evidence of Crab Titans.  What has been recorded indicates they walk up from the oceans depths directly onto an island and attack anything unwise enough to stand in their way.\nTitans are relics of an ancient civilization\nThe destructive force of a Titan can scare even the most prepared, but the rewards gained from defeating one are said to be greater than anything found on any island.\nTitans have multiple unique destructive attacks\nThe world is full of different biomes and unique resources.  Build a boat, add contraptions to fit your play style, and set off for adventure.\nExplore the world to find new biomes, islands, and people with unique missions.\n Traveling by raft, boat, glider, or on foot are all useful depending on the situation.\n Although the world is ravaged by Titans, there are also massive creatures which are more friendly and willing to let you say hello.\n \"Its dangerous to go alone\"... bring a friend!\nOnline co-op is important to us in addition to a compelling single player experience.\nBuild a home base together\nExplore the world with friends in online co-op\nRefined Crystals\nThe ocean water in Breakwaters contains unique minerals which form into powerful crystals.  Each type interacts with water in a different way, and can be used to power Items and Contraptions for unique results. \nHarvest plants from land and sea. Find rare seeds to grow in your farm.  Some plants are like rice and will require flooded fields while other plants require dryer soil.\nBuild, earn, or buy new items to improve your ability to build, attack, defend, and farm.\nSome weapons can be improved by inserting crystals into slots as upgrades.\nWeapon upgrades \nItems can be upgraded on a work bench by placing a Skill gem in a weapons socket. Each Skill gem integrated into a weapon will increase its capability.  Skill gems are harvested from the world and are considered valuable trade items among the locals.\n\nThe world of Breakwaters is populated by many creatures, each with their own way of surviving.  In addition to each type of creature and monster in the world there are different skill levels and difficulties.\nContraptions provide powerful ways to interact with the world.  Improve your home, make survival easier, or set up automated defenses.\nCrystals and contraptions go hand in hand to make unique items and new interactions with the ocean.\nCannons: great for combat and chopping trees down!\nMove water around and power contraptions with pumps and pipes\nGrab sunken treasure from the ocean floor\nScoop items into a wagon for quick transport\nCooking!\nBiomes and islands are procedural spawned in a unique way for every player.  They are populated with plants, animals, and unique points of interest to explore.  Everything in the world can be destroyed or harvested except ancient stone, the same material Titans are mostly carved from.\nEach biome has unique plants, animals, and monsters\nFor the initial early access launch, our goal is to ship the Tropical, Rocky, Pine, and Swamp biomes.  A variety of plants and animals are planned for each biome along with unique point of interest interactions.  Some of these interactions are small local experiences, others create large changes which affect the water and islands across the world.\nProcedural Islands with infinite variety\n Weather is a dynamic element in the world impacted by many factors.\nThe time of day\nProximity of a Titan\nThe current state of nearby ancient structures\nUnique powerful items\nLightning can start fires. Fires can be put out with Refined Blue Crystal.\nThe result of weather on the world can range from mild to dangerous.  Large waves can make it difficult to sail.  Thick fog can obscure a nearby island.  Lightning can damage you or catch trees on fire.  Rain washes down hills, collects in valleys, and adds to the ocean sim.\n\nUnique day/night sensitive plants and animals create different resources based on what time of day they are harvested.\nDynamic day and night cycle\nDuring the day you can harvest regular coral, but at night you can harvest bio-luminescent coral.  Unique plants and animals only exist at specific times of day, like fireflies at night.\nBiolumenesent plants and animals\nUncover an ancient mystery long hidden deep within the ocean and become a Breakwater, a protector of the people.  Voyage across the seas and defeat ancient Titans that have ravaged the oceans for centuries.  Displace the ocean and delve into their depths to find rare resources.\n\nTitans, ancient relics of a past civilization, have disturbed the oceans and destroyed the land for as long as anyone can remember.  The only thing we know is they are connected somehow to the power crystals which form from the ocean waters.\nDiscover the world's secrets, delve into the ocean depths, and become the hero long needed; become a Breakwater.\n\n Michael Bross (composer/audio director/sound designer) \nMichael is composing all of the music for Breakwaters.  He has composed for Ratchet & Clank, Oddworld, Honor of Kings, Counter-Strike GO, and many other games.  Above is the Title song he recently finished for the game.  We are extremely excited to have him on board and cant wait to share more of his work with you.\nWe are currently in the middle of Production for Breakwaters and are expecting to ship into PC Early Access in late Q2 or early Q3 2021.  We are planning for a Beta around mid April followed by an Online co-op beta when those features are ready to test in larger groups.\n\nProduction will continue after PC Early Access launch to add additional world, enemies, missions, new community requested features, items, and bug fixes.  We estimate a console early access build around September (TBD based on console approval speed).  Full product release to all platforms is expected to happen in late fall 2021.\nPlanned localization\nWe are a small indie studio started in 2019.  Our team is made up of 4 people who have been passionately working on Breakwaters together for the past 6 months.  Before that, Breakwaters was a solo project started in the summer of 2019.

Limited resources, however, restrict how much we can pay them, but as we are able to raise money beyond covering our basic costs, we can ensure they are paid well for their work! Each stretch goal of $800 will go towards giving our artists a 25% pay raise! We'll have four stretch goals that, if met, will double our artists' pay!

Hidden in nebulas and surrounded by reefs off the Arabian coast lies the ancient island of Dioscoria. Founded by priestesses and sages cast out by the hierophants of their homelands, it is a safe haven for mystics, misfits, rebels, and outcasts from neighbouring and distant shores.\nSheltered from the wrath of the orthodoxies, this Discorian society favours empathy, playfulness, and prowess of the mind. To celebrate these traits, Dioscorians cherish one pastime as old as the island itself\u2014Sefirot, a game of divination.\n\n\nThe game of Sefirot combines the worlds of Tarot divination and board gaming into an activity that is both meditative and playful. It is played in numerous variations on different playing fields, using a deck of specially designed Tarot cards.\nTree of Life - the solitaire board\nThe game includes 3 variations:\nsolitaire mode (Know Thyself)\ncooperative 2-player mode (Lovers\u2019 Discourse)\ncompetitive 2-player mode (Warring Planets)\nAs the players place their cards onto the playing fields, higher powers decide upon each player\u2019s destiny, their triumph, or their downfall. \nStarfield - the 2-player mode board\nIn addition to being the central component of the board game, the meticulously designed custom Sefirot Tarot deck also provides new journeys into the realms of Tarot.\nSefirot is suitable for an audience from 12 years onwards and has an average playing time from 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n\nVery early in this project, game designer Georg Hobmeier and artists Eli Baum & Viv Tanner decided to venture beyond the well-trodden paths of the Rider-Waite-Smith and Marseille Tarot conventions to create a distinctive new kind of Tarot deck. This deck would become the centerpiece of the game of Sefirot.\nFor their inspiration, the creators chose the ancient island of Dioscoria. Based on esoteric tales,  pieces of history, and many strands of yarn between, this mystical place would become the heart of their ongoing creation, while also drawing from traditions like the Judaic Kabbalah to which they have a personal connection. \nThis Dioscorian Sefirot deck provides novel ways to interact with Tarot cards, while also introducing the world of Tarot to an audience beyond those interested in the occult and divination.\nEvery card in the Sefirot Tarot deck has been designed from scratch, through a process that includes copious hours of reference collection and research. The deck draws inspiration from existing Tarot conventions while seeking its own path, to create a final design that challenges the status quo of existing Tarot orthodoxies.\n\nThe game of Sefirot may be played on two distinct fields, printed on a double-sided board. The Tree of Life is used for the solitaire mode, while the celestial Starfield is utilized for 2-player variations. Both fields have been developed with the same attention to detail as the Tarot deck, and the board comes crafted in the finest quality.\nRichly decorated with elements of Dioscorian lore, the board not only serves as a play area for the game, but provides additional layers of meaning for those wishing to engage in the divination process.\nThis is one of the unique propositions of Sefirot\u2014play the game on these fields as a simple leisure activity, or, use the cards to explore your inner-self or your relationship with another person. Explore the fields even deeper to discover the hidden meanings of their constellations and symbologies.\n\n\nThe rules of Sefirot are purposefully accessible, devised from a blend of solitaire and other card game mechanics. The game is not meant to impress with complex instructions, but rather to foster exploration and communication.\nWhile Tarot cards have always been used for casual card play, our proposition\u2014to use them in a hybrid capacity (for both a game and divinatory activity)\u2014is new. We see this as an exciting starting point for new discourse within the board gaming and Tarot communities. We welcome our backers to actively participate in this journey as we develop new rules and variations that utilize the Sefirot deck.\nYou can find a preview version of the rules here. Please be advised that the Ace of Pentacles pledge will not come with this document, but the final version of the rules for this edition that will also have the appropriate visual components. \nFor those who want a more visual introduction to the game, the wonderful people of Moonshadow Garden made this exquisite video. It's a session of Sefirot's coop mode, hosted by our game designer Georg: \n\n\nThis project offers 10 backable tiers, and several optional add-ons. We also have several additional items and upgrades that were already unlocked:  \n\nTwo stickers & one sticker set: free for all physical tiers\nFree bookmark: all physical tiers\nFree upgrades on Tarot deck components: any tier or add-on that includes the standalone Tarot deck\nFree upgrades on board game components: any tier or add-on that includes the board game\n Altar Cloth: free for Queen of Pentacles, Queen of Wands & King of Pentacles, can be purchased as add-on otherwise\nOne additional free print for all tiers and add-ons containing prints\nFree gold foil upgrade on art book: any tier including the art book + the add-on\nFree accordion fold with Dioscorian scenery: all physical tiers\n  Precious art prints, each measuring 5.8 \u00d7 8.3 inches, as featured in the Three of Cups pledge\nThe full Sefirot deck with 78 Tarot cards, printed on premium card stock and housed in a slide box, as featured in the Nine of Pentacles pledge\nTwo 1.5\" hard enamel pins based on elements included in Sefirot, the mysterious celestial beings Ophan and the Ouroboros, as featured in the Nine of Cups pledge\nThe Sefirot board game: a spectacular flip-top box with a two-sided board, a bridge-sized (3.5 x 2.25\u201d) deck of 78 cards and a rulebook, as featured in the Ten of Pentacles pledge\nThe formidable Sefirot art book, featured in the Eight of Pentacles pledge: With approximately 120 pages, this 8.27 x 11.69\" book will feature all the art used in the Tarot deck and game\nThe King of Pentacles pledge will provide all items of this campaign. They will be housed in a large wooden case handcrafted by Budapest\u2019s most respected box makers.\nThe King of Pentacles pledge is also watched over by the loving grace of a 7-7.8\" custom hand-painted figurine of The Empress.\nFigurine crafted by Bakano\u00eb.\nPlease be advised that the displayed graphics and designs still might be altered for the final product.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also get various items on top to create your own custom bundles. These can be added when making a pledge. We also have a handful of mystery items that are yet to be revealed throughout the campaign.\n\n\nWe look forward to unlocking these stretch goals with you to reveal a plethora of upgrades! The further we go, the more opulent these upgrades will become.\n\n\nWe know the Sefirot deck and game board will shine beautifully on their own. But with support from backers, we can give Sefirot an even more luxurious, collectible feel and quality.\nTo produce the majority of the items for Sefirot\u2014the Tarot deck and board game, along with all the presented components and add-ons\u2014we have selected one of Europe\u2019s oldest card factories. With skilled craftspeople and centuries of experience, they will work with us to manufacture every part of Sefirot to meet exceptional standards of quality.\nIn the true spirit of Kickstarter, this project has already been substantially developed. We are asking for your support to bring it to fruition. With our Kickstarter goals fulfilled, we will work with our backers during 2021 to complete dozens of card designs and finalize all the components of Sefirot. Then, once we make sure everything is just right, we will start manufacturing for delivery in Spring 2022.\n\n\nWe intend to both produce and ship from Central European facilities. This gives us a very equitable price for astonishing quality. It also means a smaller environmental impact, since our goods won\u2019t need to travel several times across the globe.\nShipping costs will be calculated and charged after this Kickstarter project concludes. Costs will be collected via our pledge manager, using Stripe. (At that time, you will also have the opportunity to make additional purchases through this pledge manager.)\nThe following are rough estimates of shipping costs for the Sefirot Tarot deck or board game. Note that these are merely estimates. Accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address, and purchasing additional items may increase these costs. \nEU VAT is included in all of our rewards and will not be charged additionally!\n\n\n\nSefirot is being made by the game developers of Causa Creations in close cooperation with the artist duo Eli Baum and Viv Tanner.\nSupport Crew\nAdditional support for this project has been provided by Small Furry Games (editorial, consulting, copywriting), Moonshadowgarden (ads, additional media), Bakano\u00eb (3D Sculpting), Wobblersound (trailer audio mastering), Thomas Ortsik (research, press), Lisa Nielsen-Spieler (trailer voice over), Reinhold Bidner (trailer motion graphics), Christian Knapp (analytics & finances), Brian Main (additional communication), Sarah Hiebl (design consulting & coaching), gold extra (production support), and Leali Heyman (Hebrew consulting, dentistry).\nThank you to all the supporters who have helped us reach this milestone through the power of kind words, helping hands, and cunning playtesting!\n\n[Original trailer music: Discovering the Lost City by Max H.]\n[Lavender 3d Model by: https://sketchfab.com/mounica.choco9]\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo back a Kickstarter project is to put your faith in its creators.

Each card reflects the traditional symbolisms of the Rider-Waite deck with an original stylistic twist. \nWhat makes this deck special is not only its traditional value, but also its ability to tell a new story. With just one flip-through of this deck you will find strength underneath a lion's gaze, wander with knights and kings, and dance beside stars.  I hope everyone who experiences this deck will feel like they are part of its story, as I did when I created them.  \nMajor Arcana (please note: metallic ink will shine brighter when printed)\nTo hear more about the creation process, behind the scenes footage, and more, check out this Art Prof interview!\nABOUT THE DECK\n- Each of the 78 original cards are hand painted with water color and gold leaf paint. A  border and back design were added digitally.\n- Each card is 2.75\" x 4.75\"\n- The deck will come in a custom tuck-box\n- The gold detailing on each card and the tuck box will be printed with metallic ink\nEdit: The original 300 coreless value paper will be upgraded to better quality, stronger cardstock! I'm leaning towards Black Core Premium cardstock with linen texture, which is very durable and satisfying to hold. This is subject to change, as I'm still doing lots of research to provide you with the best quality card deck possible.

My friend Charlotte introduced me to tarot in high school. \"Some artists make their own decks,\u201d she told me, \u201cit\u2019s a crazy project to take on, there are 78 cards.\u201d The thought of a project of that scale excited me, and Charlotte\u2019s words kept rolling around in my mind for years. As my friends and I delved deeper into reading tarot, my interest accelerated, and I began researching the history and symbolism around the Rider-Waite deck.\nprocess sketches\nA project this intense deserved my complete attention, which wasn't possible as a full-time college student. When the 2020 quarantine drove the world into lockdown, I realized this was the window of opportunity I needed to start. \nArthur Waite, co-creator of the traditional Rider-Waite deck and author of Key to the Tarot, describes tarot as an art form that \u201cembodies symbolical presentations of universal ideas, behind which lie all the implicits of the human mind\u201d. I filled an entire sketchbook with notes as I studied his writings, completely enthralled by the little stories he described within each card. I decided that in my own deck, I would try and retell these stories through my own contemporary artistic language.\nprogress sketches\nI first sketched all of the designs lightly with ballpoint pens on watercolor paper. Then, I painted over each card with watercolors given me by my grandmother, a professional artist who taught me to paint when I was five years old. While I worked through the deck, I discovered a small jar of gold leaf paint in a box of my old art supplies. I added a few details onto one of the cards on a whim, and fell in love with how beautifully the gold reflected light.\nThe day finally came when I walked into my kitchen with all 78 cards piled high in my hands, ready to declare the project complete. I have entered 2021 having created something I am genuinely proud of, and I would love to share it with you all!\nThe Deck, unedited (please note: borders will be added on printed cards)\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$12,000--- Two Piece Box UNLOCKED!\nThe original tuck-box has been upgraded to a lightweight two piece box, with metallic gold detailing. Artwork will be similar to the tuck box design above (finalized design coming soon!)\n$15,000 + --- Extras UNLOCKED!\nAs we progress past $15,000 (wow!), I am working on special add-ons for those who backed The Deck tier and above! Some of these add-ons will include:\nAn extra card design\nEnamel pins\nCustom tea-towels with a Curious Travels inspired design, which you can use as a spread for tarot reading!\nI am currently working on developing the artwork for all of these bonus items, and will update as soon as they're ready!

It is an animistic and an ethnic religion based on some myths, multitudinous gods, nature and natural phenomenon.\u3000And the Latin word \u201canima\u201d which is the origin of the word \u201canimism\u201d means \u201cto give a life to something that cannot move without life\u201d and it is actually the etymology of animation.\nIn other words, the animation culture can be originated from the culture that gives life to all lifeless things and move them, respects them, and believes in them.\n\nThe reason why Japanese animation has attracted so much attention is that there is so much energy in creative objects that are created by Japanese creators who have believed in animism genealogically. \nAnd the cards that are made based on such\n\nAnd the cards that are made based on such wisdoms are the JAPANESE ANIME

How JAPANESE ANIME TAROT was created \nin production and finished\nHave you ever seen a Japanese animated tarot with beautiful graphics made for the world?\nIn fact, most animated tarot cards are not planned or designed in Japan.

It went well. With the help from the Kickstarter and Tarot community, I was able to get them printed and shipped out.\nHaving never produced a deck of cards before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.\nThat being said, there were a few things that I was not personally satisfied with. \n\nFirst - the box. The box was not what I had imagined at all, and I felt that I could improve on it drastically. The new box is a more sturdy box with a top and bottom. It will be matte black with uv coating accents. \nSecond - the accompanying booklet. This was a small insert that provided some great information, but it wasn't very substantial. Not a lot to it. The new booklet is a guide to the major arcana. While the majority of the pages are dedicated to the Major Arcana, there will also be meanings for the suits and the bonus cards as well. Is will conveniently fit in the box with the cards and will be about 26-30 pages long.\nThird - the finish. I got them glossy. A lot of people really love the gloss, but I felt like it may be a little too much. I want to see what it will be like in a matte finish.\nFourth - the lack of borders. I had originally designed my cards with borders, but changed my mind midway through the last campaign. While I still love the borderless version, I have a feeling that the black borders will help everything pop. \n\nWith all of these changes, I still wanted to add a little extra to make this version stand out from the original. Here are some more changes.\n\nBacks - Instead of the gold foil stamping, I am opting for a black foil stamping. I have a feeling it will give them a unique quality that is not found in a lot of decks.\nBonus cards - With the last printing, I includes 4 unique bonus cards - This time around I am adding an additional 6 bonus cards for a total of 10 bonus cards.  I really like creating these cards, and I may just go crazy and do an entire Oracle deck eventually.\n\nI am really excited to take the knowledge I have gained from the first version of Tarotbot and create another unique version. I really hope you enjoy these additions.\nPlease enjoy some of the images of the deck below.\n Here are some links to reviews and flip throughs of the original Tarotbot deck:\nhttps://youtu.be/7d22uGK2kno\nhttps://youtu.be/_LXWFidgEks\nhttps://youtu.be/8smYRi2ZyCY\nhttps://youtu.be/r0xQqVeOxLw\nhttps://youtu.be/u9vPFxR7DW4", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving experience printing and shipping products like this in the past, I don't foresee any real problems.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "The Helpless", "descp": "\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot\n\u2022 Digital edition of the Major Arcana guide booklet\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "The Impostor", "descp": "\u2022 Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Digital edition of the major Arcana guide book\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book\nPrint edition of Tarotbot - Black\nPrint edition of the Major Arcana guide book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["269 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "The Demon", "descp": "\u2022 Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Digital edition of the major Arcana guide book\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book\nPrint edition of Tarotbot - Black\nPrint edition of the Major Arcana guide book\nSun, Moon, Stars Altar Cards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["93 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "The Witch", "descp": "\u2022 Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n\u2022 Sun, Moon, Stars Altar Cards\n\u2022 Black Gemstone Pendant\n\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Digital edition of the major Arcana guide book\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book\nPrint edition of Tarotbot - Black\nPrint edition of the Major Arcana guide book\nSun, Moon, Stars Altar Cards\nBlack Gemstone Pendant", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 95 or more", "title": "The Scarecrow", "descp": "\u2022 2 x Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 2 x Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n\u2022 2 x Sun, Moon, Stars Altar Cards\n\u2022 2 x Black Gemstone Pendants\n\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Digital edition of the major Arcana guide book\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n2\u00d7 Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n2\u00d7 Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n2\u00d7 Sun, Moon, Stars Altar Cards\n2\u00d7 Black Gemstone Pendant", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["41 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 350 or more", "title": "The Plague Doctor", "descp": "\u2022 10 x Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 10 x Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Digital edition of the major Arcana guide book\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n10\u00d7 Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n10\u00d7 Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Production Update - Addresses as well", "update_content": "Hello!\nI just wanted to update everyone on the production.

You will see new attempts at animation. New attempts do not mean something eccentric.  We see it as the ability to make videos to order, to the project's potential.\nThis project of ours is based on three resolves, which we want to see crystallized. The first new attempt in this project stemmed from the originality of the original work. We felt that the original work had unique expressions not confined to the framework of manga. Likewise, we would like to create an animation that is not bound by the framework of animation even though it will be an animation. All the production members are ready to face this challenge head on.\nSecond, we developed the animation's workflow in house. With Directors Yutaro Kubo and Satomi Maiya at the center, we will look to the union of creators engaged in animation through a totally different process in advertising, in-house production and cell animation.\nThird, we will aim to create a movie with a consistent concept despite its long length. Creating long movies takes more resolve and determination than creating short movies, even in using just one-time expressions. New attempts that seem outrageous at first glance always need to be started by someone with a strong resolve. We are looking to artwork that will be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with innovative existing movies. And it is with this resolve that we will take on this project.\n<WIT STUDIO Producer Kenta Yamada>\nIn this project, the biggest challenge was probably the fact that people allowed us to work as the directors. In usual circumstances most people would think that using us, with little experience in the field of TV animation, would be risky.\nBut the key point of this project is that we needed to think of a new approach to producing from scratch. It involves not just thinking about how to bring the storyline to life but with what kind of lines and texture should be used for the art and characters. We are focusing on these small details, exploring the best approach for \"The Girl from the Other Side.\" We hope that we can bring a movie to you that is new yet unique \"The Girl from the Other Side,\" with the original work's uniqueness and appeal sealed in animation. Stay tuned!\n When the animated short-film was produced before, the original world of \"The Girl from the Other Side\" was fully respected with distinctive expressions of animation. I was impressed by such challenges and potentialities of expressions at that time. This time, with the great cooperation of many people, an one-hour animation, much longer than the previous one, will be produced. I would be so happy if we work on this project together with you guys to make the new animation much more splendid. Thank you for your cooperation in advance.\n <<Message>> WIT STUDIO representative: Joji Wada\nThanks to the support of many fans, WIT STUDIO was able to celebrate its 10-year anniversary this year. To date we have released many works, including \"Attack on Titan\" and \"The Ancient Magus' Bride\" and now, we would like to explore new ways of expression and publishing in anime to help us move forward to the next phase.\nIndeed, you may call this work a blueprint for that potential. Thankfully, the short OAD movie has received positive reviews far beyond our expectations. Due to these positive reviews we decided to create this \"art animation\" in a long movie. We look forward to this new challenge to the diversity of animation.\nThis crowdfunded project is an attempt to improve the quality of this movie and to let more people know about it. We would like this attempt to be an opportunity for animation production studios and anime fans all around the world to connect with each other, however little.\nThis project is a huge challenge for WIT STUDIO as we head toward the next 10 years. We appreciate your kind support to our production team, as the team forges ahead to future possibilities.\n\n<<Message>> Original work editor: Kyohei Shinpuku\nThe sunlight does not cover everything in the morning, and the darkness does not reveal everything at night. This is the quiet story of the two, living patchy evenings\u2014the story of \"The Girl from the Other Side.\" Thanks to the readers of the original work truly loving Shiva's dedicated love and Teacher's poignant honesty, we were able to draw this story to the end. The author and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\nIn a world that does not change for the better, how can two people with different points of view accept each other? Living in today's world we are always posed with this question, which is illustrated in this original work by Nagabe in manga forms reminiscent of children's story and poetry. This work is filled with five years of Nagabe's heart and soul.\nHow about taking this extremely pure and beautiful crystal and turning it into a movie, maintaining its purity and in a way that portrays the original work more accurately ? I would like to make it a story that everyone who loved the original work truly wishes for. When I came to that point in my thinking, I felt that we needed help from you who loved the original work, in addition to the original framework of producing animation. Yes, no one else but you, from around the world, who love the original work.\nThe closure of this story work will mean the end of our beautiful friendship, but this project will be a new beginning for the friendship between you and \"The Girl from the Other Side.\"\nYour kind support is deeply appreciated.\nIn Japan, it usually takes a budget of over 10 million yen to create one episode (about 25 minutes long) of a TV animation.  \nBefore we begin I would like to reassure all our supporters that the production committee has already secured a certain amount of production funds to create this long animation, and that there is no risk of this project being completely aborted.\nThat said, we intend to use the support fund from you for the activities shown below.\n[(1) Fund to improve the production quality]\nUsually a TV series requires the flow to become efficient, from drawing original drawings to movies, colorings and photo shooting, as the process involves many staff members.  However, in \"The Girl from the Other Side,\" we will put in more effort and time than we would in the usual workflow, devoting more effort into photoshoot processing to present the original work's fairy-tale-like worldview. (* For the actual image, see the comparison below.)\nPLAY\n\nUsually for animations created with WIT STUDIO, photoshoot processing section shown above is worked on jointly with external production companies, but this time we will organize an internal photoshoot team for the first time ahead of production. It is a special use of the fund to make this work stand out as an art animation.\n[(2) Promotional expenses]\nWe will use the fund for the items below for the PR to notify people around the world of this product.\nCost of organizing advance screening with staff talk show\nCost of producing an online event with English translation\nA translation fee to release production interviews to overseas media\n* We will use the fund for other PR measures to communicate this work's appeal to as many people as possible.\n* Details of the descriptions above are subject to change.\nWe intend to move things forward ensuring as much transparency as possible to our supporters on the use of the support fund. Your kind support to the long art animation project \"The Girl from the Other Side\" is greatly appreciated.\n [Available only in Japan] \uff08\u203b\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u5185\u9650\u5b9a\uff09\n\u300c\u3068\u3064\u304f\u306b\u306e\u5c11\u5973\u300d \u756a\u5916\u7de8\u30b3\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u7279\u88c5\u7248 \u203b\u9577\u7de8\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u53ce\u9332DVD\uff06\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30a4\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u96c6\u4ed8\u5c5e\n  [Special Edition] Comic Book, a spin-off story of \"The Girl from the Other Side\" <with DVD of the animated feature \uff06Art Book of color illustrations> \n*Only Japanese-language version is available.\n        *Another reward of Blu-ray package is available for residents outside Japan.\n\n\uff3bTier1\uff3d-Digital Reward for beginner (\u00a51980)\nProject Reports Browsing Rights\n The rights to browse exclusive reports about the progress of the project and its ongoing products, which will be delivered more than once per month during a certain period (*tentatively from May 2021 to March 2022).\nHigh Resolution Wallpaper\nA well-designed digital wallpaper, which is suitable for both PC and smartphone.\nPromotional Video Screening Rights\nThe rights to screen promotional videos of the animated feature through a link provided in advance of the release to the public. *The screening link will be tentatively delivered in fall 2021.\n\uff3bTier2\uff3dWebsiteCredit\uff06Design Works Data Edition (\u00a54980)\nThanks for your help .

To protect its hard-earned knowledge from the outside world the school sealed itself within an immense, opalescent bubble, waiting for the day when it could unveil the culmination of its progress. But that day never came, and the school was left to molder within its impenetrable cocoon. \nYou, treasure hunters, have found a way in.\nThe Academy Chrysalis is a scenario for Trophy Gold, a collaborative roleplaying/ storytelling game about treasure hunters exploring an environment that doesn't want them there.\nThe Academy Chrysalis takes the feel of Trophy Gold and blends it with ideas of Dark Academia, experimental magic, and barriers to knowledge. In doing so, it seeks to interrogate ways of knowing as systems of power, and explore what it means to treat knowledge as a thing to be treasure-hunted.\n(Oa, the Knowledge-Giver. Art by Ezra Rose)\n(What is Trophy Gold?)\nTrophy Gold, by Jesse Ross, tells the story of treasure-hungry adventurers in a dangerous world. Easy-to-understand rules and quick character creation make it a perfect entry point for roleplaying newcomers, and its uniquely collaborative mechanics make it a refreshing take on storytelling for seasoned roleplayers.\nIn Trophy Gold a Game Master - or GM - uses a pre-designed scenario like The Academy Chrysalis as a framework to tell a story with other players who embody treasure hunters. Whenever treasure hunters want to learn more about the world or do something dangerous, the players roll different combinations of six-sided dice to determine the outcomes of their actions. Importantly, the GM and the players all work together to interpret these outcomes, leading to beautifully creative and engaging stories that the GM couldn't have envisioned alone. \n Never played Trophy Gold before? No worries - the rules are included in the zine. \nTrophy Gold scenarios rely on themes - atmospheric tools that the GM uses to evoke coherent imagery during play. The use of a theme helps tie descriptive moments back to the greater ideas in the story. In the Academy Chrysalis, navigate a world tied together with the theme of bubbles: scenes of encasement, iridescence, fragility, weightlessness, and popping reality pervade the school and its grounds.\n\n(Things contained within)\n(Cover, details not final)\nThis 5.5 x 8.5\" zine will include:\n Basic rules for playing Trophy Gold that will prepare you to run a game, even if you've never done it before.\n A 6-set incursion (i.e., an adventure with six acts) that has the treasure hunters explore the grounds of a ruined magical school. \n Unique tables for character creation, including names, backgrounds, skills, equipment, and rituals.\n New items, monsters, and scene-setting aids to help the GM create engaging play sessions.\n A new mechanic that adds an extra dimension of utility and chaos to ritual casting.\n Approximately 32 pages of content in total - saddle stitched and printed on 130# matte cover and 80# uncoated black and white interior - professionally printed by Mixam.\n(Sample layout, details not final.

Abbot lies a forgotten gold claim registered to one Jakob Weidner. Decades ago, maybe more, Weidner packed up his family of six and built a homestead on a small, unforgiving parcel of land in a desperate bid to strike it rich. Initially he was called a fool, but, for a time at least, rumor was that Weidner had actually managed to find something in the mine. Then everything went quiet. Perhaps tragedy struck the family before Jakob could make good on it or, perhaps, driven to anger by ridicule, he simply chose to break with society altogether. No matter what happened, the mine still sits somewhere on the mountain, waiting for the right person to uncover its location and retrieve whatever riches it keeps hidden...\nThe Lord of Wolves is a grimdark Trophy Gold incursion originally written for the Trophy Gold Incursion Contest in 2020 and inspired by dark legends and histories of the American west, Appalachian folklore, and western horror movies like Ravenous(1999). In it, your treasure hunters will brave an abandoned and treacherous mountain pass in a desperate bid to recover whatever gold might have been excavated from the lost mining camp beyond. Along the way you'll hazard vertical ice shelves and flesh-starved animals; you'll stumble into the horrible history of the mountain and learn the tragic fate of the family that once called the pass home while attempting to survive the ever-darkening echoes they've left behind. Will you return from Jakob's Folly? And if so, would it be better if you hadn't?\nSince the initial Incursion Contest submission, The Lord of Wolves has been edited, vamped up with new occupations and backgrounds, adorned with dozens of haunting illustrations, and laid out beautifully in a half-letter zine format that gathers darkness the deeper in you go.\nWhat awaits you...\nA 26 page, 5.5\" X 8.5\" digital zine for use with the Trophy Gold rpg system\nA tale of desperation and hunger set in an abandoned mountain mine camp\nFully illustrated throughout with both original artwork and manipulated public domain images from the late 1800s\nBespoke randomized loot tables and special new rules\nFive sets filled with evocative props, heartbreaking traps and treasures, and unique and deadly monsters\nFour new Treasure Hunter occupations\nFour new Treasure Hunter backgrounds\nA sinister yet deceptively innocent villain to carry forward into your next incursions\nEvery copy purchased above asking price will generate a free community copy once The Lord of Wolves goes to Itch.io \n\nBecause this is our second Zine Quest project this year, we're running The Lord of Wolves as a PDF only campaign. We know that will turn many of you off, but it will help us focus on completing our previously funded game, ALL MUST BOW, while we learn the ins and outs of dealing with a printed and shipped product on that front. The good news is The Lord of Wolves is already complete in every way and will be available immediately following the campaign, so you won't have to wait months to receive it. It's also priced lower than most other PDF products we've seen and if you grab it while it's on Kickstarter you'll be saving about 50% off the final Itch.io price.\nIn The Mine...\nContent Warning\nThe Lord Of Wolves contains the aftermath of violence against women and children, and depictions of cannibalism. If any of these are a trigger for any member of your playgroup please talk to your group before running this game or consider finding a different incursion entirely. Additionally, the author and Bleak Horizons Press recommend using safety tools at your table to insure that everyone involved is respected, has a voice, retains a positive experience, and, of course, feels safe before, during, and after play.\nSome recommended safety tools include:\nThe X-Card by John Stavropoulus. For more information please visit the Google Doc page HERE. \nLines & Veils, a device developed by the gaming community at large. For more information please click HERE.\nFurther information on safety tools in general can be found on the Gauntlet RPG Forums at https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/tools-of-the-table.html\n\nEx Libris...\nRyan Hatt wrote The Lord of Wolves and is responsible for creating the cover art, layout, formatting, textures, some original illustrations, and all artistic manipulations of public domain art found within. He is also the co-writer and principal illustrator for ALL MUST BOW, our flagship project that just successfully funded here during Zine Quest, as well as co-owner of Bleak Horizons Press.\nJosh Flaccavento helped to proofread and edit The Lord of Wolves. He is also co-writer and designer for ALL MUST BOW and the other half of Bleak Horizons Press. He is co-host of the \u201csuperhero\u201d podcast \u201cTales from Stringersberg\"which is worth investigating.\nMelissa Brigham proofread, edited, and consulted on the interior art for The Lord of Wolves.

In daily life, this can be powerful because we can intuitively know things that others miss.\nBut when we experience trauma\u2014whether a major incident or a seemingly small heartbreak\u2014we can end up holding that trauma in our bodies.\nUsually, this happens without us even realizing it! And what is heartbreaking is how frequently we respond by disconnecting from our bodies.\nThat\u2019s why I have created the Chakra Healing Tarot.\nNo matter what you have been through, no matter what you are facing now, even if you have zero experience with Tarot, the goal of the Chakra Healing Tarot deck is to help you connect with your inner healing.\nThe archetypes of Tarot have been combined with the wisdom of chakras (your energetic body) in this Chakra Healing Tarot deck. With this deck, at any time, you can immediately pinpoint which chakras need attention, why they need attention, and how to give them the attention they need.\nHere are the specs of the Chakra Healing Tarot deck:\nBased on the Rider-Waite-Smith tradition\n78 full-colour standard Tarot-sized cards (2.75\u201d X 4.75\u201d), printed on high quality 350 GSM art cardstock with a smooth matte finish\nBorderless imagery with rounded corners; card titles on each card\nCard backs are fully reversible\nSturdy, full-colour keepsake box\nA comprehensive guidebook to help you every step of the way. Perfect bound, 200 pages (100 double-sided pages), Tarot card-sized, comes in the box with the cards\nThe deck combines Eastern spiritual knowledge (the chakras) with the wisdom of the Western mystery traditions (the Tree of Life in Qabalah)\nThe glowing jewels on each card make it clear which chakra(s) you're working with and where they are in your body\nThe artwork and guidebook are fully complete and will be sent for printing once the campaign is successful!\nIn the Chakra Healing Tarot deck, you will see that Major arcana cards take you to sacred temple grounds at the top of a mountain.\nMost of the Major arcana cards have TWO chakras on them! This means there is an important connection between two of your chakras, and it is a connection that\u2019s worth exploring.\nThree of the Major arcana cards have ALL the chakras on them, indicating key milestones on your journey through the Major arcana. These three cards with all the chakras include the Fool, Wheel, and World cards. \nHere are some of the Majors!\nThe Minor arcana cards take you to four magical kingdoms:\nWands: This suit takes you into the mystical caves at the base of a sacred mountain. These cards represent your spiritual and aspirational energy (how you are motivated, your values)\nChalices: These cards take you to a flowing, watery kingdom. This suit represents your emotional energy (how you feel, includes ALL emotions!)\nSwords: This suit takes you to a kingdom in the clouds. These cards represent your mental energy (how you think, your mental cycles)\nPentacles: These cards take you to an enchanted forest. This suit represents your tangible energy (how you give or receive tangible things. Tangible things are things you can touch and feel like money, belongings, your physical body, etc.)\nIn the Chakra Healing Tarot deck, the Minor Arcana cards have ONE chakra on them. Check out the Minor kingdoms below!\nHere are some of the Wands!\n Check out a few of the Chalices!\n Aren't these Swords just breathtaking?\n These Pentacles, though!\nEach deck includes a 200-page (20,000 words) Tarot-sized guidebook complete with instructions, card meanings, a Chakra Healing Tarot meditation, Tarot spreads, and a Chakra Healing Tarot ritual. The guidebook will fit into the box with the cards.\nEach card meaning in the guidebook includes:\nWhich chakra(s) the card corresponds to\nA Chakra Healing Message\nKey phrases that are grouped into \"Vibrant\" and \"Suppressed\"\nThe planetary/elemental energy associated with each card, based on the planet, sign, or element assigned to each Tarot card in the Western mystery tradition\nTraditional key phrases so that beginners can build up Tarot knowledge\n Tarot Newbies: Even if you have never picked up a Tarot deck before in your life, that's okay! This deck is gentle, beautiful, and accessible. The guidebook is comprehensive and will guide you every step of the way! You will be able to read these cards for yourself.\n Tarot Enthusiasts, Advanced Readers, and Professional Readers: This deck applies a chakra healing lens to your existing knowledge of the Tarot. This can enhance your readings with additional energetic body insights\u2014a powerful complement to the archetypal wisdom of the Tarot. Of course, you can also use this Chakra Healing Tarot as your go-to deck for clients who are drawn to the magical, diverse art.\n Reiki Practitioners and Other Energy Workers: Created by a Reiki Master, this deck can help you identify the chakras your clients most need assistance with during a session. Pulling a card from this deck can help you pinpoint the relationships between chakra issues for your clients. The Chakra Healing Tarot will also provide you with insights into the context and nature of the issue. These are all powerful insights that will help you provide even greater support and healing to your clients.\nAs a certified Reiki Master, Malumir has worked with clients' energy centres extensively. Through this experience and her own healing over the years, Malumir has seen the importance of helping people connect with their bodies by healing their chakras.\nAn experienced Tarot reader, Malumir\u2019s passion for the Tarot is a long-term, committed relationship! She firmly believes that the complexity and universality of the Tarot system and the archetypes it contains can help anyone find the insights they need. This is why Malumir has created the Chakra Healing Tarot!\nAlso an NLP Master Practitioner and public policy professional, Malumir is so passionate about helping people rediscover the inner power that has always been within them. Neurologically atypical and living with less visible [dis]abilities, Malumir also loves cycling, running, and is always thinking about her next tattoo!\nElla Mazur is a Toronto-based artist working in ink and colouring her works digitally to create vibrant dream worlds.\nHer art is inspired by the magic all around her: the diversity of creatures and plants that inhabit our planet, the endless depths of the ocean waves, the enchantment of the forests, and the mysteries of the stars in the sky.\nMalumir is so grateful that Ella was willing to take her on as a client for such a significant project! Ella has created such stunning art that has brought Malumir's written descriptions to life so perfectly.\nYour support for this campaign means everything to me and for this Tarot deck! The revenue from this campaign will go toward the production of this deck. \nReaching the crowdfunding goal means that each backer will receive one copy of: \nChakra Healing Tarot deck, First Edition, first print run\nGuidebook for the Chakra Healing Tarot deck\nCertificate of Authenticity\nMystery Magnet\n And of course, there are some super exciting stretch goals!! Let's see how far we can take this together!\nThe artwork and guidebook are fully complete! That means that as soon as the crowdfunding successfully concludes, I will be able to send the deposit and artwork to the printer!\nThe production and delivery time from the time I send the files to the printer to the time I receive the decks' shipment is approximately 3 - 4 months. Barring any unforeseen challenges, I expect to receive the decks in Summer 2021. I will ship the decks out as soon as I receive them.\nI will ship out orders by backer group (via Backerkit) based on geographic location as the primary filter. My home is extremely small and I will be doing all the shipping myself, so will need to keep the assembly line process as simple as humanly possible!\nI don't expect any production issues with my incredible and very experienced Tarot printing company. Still, I will be sure to update you all at least biweekly on the status of production.\nYour support means everything to make this deck a physical reality! Please support this project so that I can bring it into your life!\nShipping for this deck will be collected AFTER successful crowdfunding (via Backerkit). Why? Because of the way crowdfunding works, if I raise funds needed for both the deck and the shipping, once the crowdfunding platform fees are taken off as a percentage, I could actually be OUT money and not have enough to pay for shipping!\nSo, to keep things simple, your shipping will be extra and will be charged separately AFTER successful crowdfunding (see estimates below). I will be using Backerkit to collect shipping from you; I\u2019m sure many of you are very familiar with Backerkit! If you're not familiar, Backerkit is awesome! It lets you track progress and get updates as campaigns you support develop and deliver, plus it makes life easier for creators by keeping your info up to date and helping to make sure the shipping you pay makes sense for where you live. PLUS - this way, it's a little easier for you to manage the costs, because it spreads out the costs of your reward and shipping. \nEstimated shipping costs: So that you can plan for the extra shipping charge, below are estimated shipping costs. If I can get a better discount once fully funded (depending on the number of backers), I will reflect those in the shipping costs. Here are the estimates at this time for a single deck (larger shipments may cost extra):\nCanada: $12CAD (about $9USD)\nUS: $15CAD (about $12USD)\nUK: $25CAD + $15CAD for VAT (see note below) (in total about $31USD)\nOther International: $27CAD (about $21USD)\nA few more notes on shipping:\nCustoms: Your deck will be declared on the customs form as a \"Tarot deck,\" without exceptions. It is your responsibility before backing to confirm that your country permits Tarot decks' import. If the package is seized by customs and not returned to either one of us, then regrettably, the order is non-refundable. If, however, customs returns the deck to me, to even out the burden of cost between us, I will issue you a refund for the cost of the deck only (no refund on postage fees).\nUK orders - VAT fees: New VAT rules as a result of Brexit mean that I need to collect VAT on UK orders. Lots of creators and small business owners simply are not accepting UK backers/orders at this time, but I want to at least give you the option! This means that I will be collecting VAT at the time that I collect shipping for UK backers, via BackerKit. I am not liable for any additional customs fees or charges your country may charge you though. \nNon-UK international orders - customs or VAT fees: It is your responsibility to be current on any customs fees or VAT taxes that may apply to you on your order. I am not liable for customs fees or VAT taxes that your country charges you, the importer, for purchasing overseas, nor am I responsible for any delays in delivery on account of customs. Please be aware that some countries do not permit the import of Tarot or playing cards, so please check to confirm that your country permits the import purchase of Tarot or playing cards. For customs purposes, I must declare the contents and full value of the package. I appreciate your understanding in this matter.\nShipping times: As we are all very aware, the global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the volume of shipments delivered by ALL carriers worldwide. As carriers work to adjust to these significant increases, shipments can often be delayed. Please be patient and kind. \nTimely pickup: While most shipments will go directly to your door, you may receive a notice to pick up your parcel from your local delivery or post office. If you receive a notice to pick up your parcel from your local delivery/post office, remember that you only have a limited time to pick up the parcel. If you don\u2019t pick it up before that date, it will be shipped back to me (or will disappear into the ether and will be permanently lost!). I will not be responsible for replacing or refunding any missing orders because you did not pick up your parcel on time. If it is sent back to me, I will ship it out to you again, but you'll be responsible for the cost of postage to reship. \nDelivery date: The delivery date provided is my best approximation made in good faith but cannot be guaranteed due to factors that may be out of my control. You will be kept up to date at least biweekly on the deck\u2019s progress during the production and delivery (to me from the printer) phase. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first experience crowdfunding a project, and I do work a full-time job. However, I have put my part-time Tarot, Reiki, and coaching services on hold since Autumn 2020 so that I can focus my evening, weekend, and vacation time to work on bringing this deck into the world! I am committed to getting these decks into your life with your help of a successfully funded campaign!\n\nThe artwork and the guidebook are already fully complete. I want to get these decks into your life as soon as humanly possible, so I will provide the artwork and deposit to the printer once this crowdfunding campaign is successfully concluded!\n\nI do not expect any production issues.

As we all know, the global COVID-19 pandemic has been a factor in timelines for shipping services in the past year. Regardless, I will be sure to provide you with biweekly updates on the printing and shipping status.\n\nNon-refundable: Please read through all descriptions of the deck carefully before deciding to back the Chakra Healing Tarot. I will not issue refunds because you have changed your mind or decided that you do not resonate with the deck once the project is backed. You would be free to sell your copy second-hand or used.

(Please note that these photos are not exactly representing what is in the goodie bags as they will be filled with brand new artwork that is not yet drawn!)\nWHY EXACTLY \u00a315388.00?\nAll of the target money is going to help cover the never-ending costs of the tattoo studio I operate. We have had barely any chance to work, and therefore almost no income since the end of March last year, but I still have rent and bills to pay on the shop and after so many months of COVID closure I had maxed out my credit cards, drained my savings and exhausted my options for loans and am now left with 2 options - close the studio and make my amazing colleagues redundant, OR see if I can raise it through merch sales! So here we are - I am giving our little tattoo shop ONE last chance of survival by making these tarot cards.\nAs for a cost breakdown:\nAlthough the latest news from the government is promising, there are expected to be disruptions and restrictions placed on the tattoo industry in the UK until the end of summer. Plus, as I am completely out of money, I can't even front the costs of re-opening at this stage (things like re-stocking equipment and paying staff). This means I am likely to have to keep paying rent and all the bills that go alongside running my business without any guaranteed income for another half a year. This figure for this alone comes to \u00a36,848.00.\nBut I didn\u2019t want to just ask for charity to cover these costs, I want to create something that you guys have been asking for! But of course this incurs some costs too; the production and postage of these cards. To get them a good quality, and to buy them in a relatively small batch (around 400 as this is my goal amount of sales) the cost of the production is \u00a36,100.00. I also had to account for a certain amount of worldwide shipping included in the price**, as otherwise shipping becomes prohibitively expensive, so that accounts for another \u00a3900, taking the total to \u00a313,848.00 \n**(Depending on where you are in the world there are small fees for postage for all the rewards so please check this before you make a pledge). \nThe final cost is a combination of taxes, payment processing fees and the fee for kickstarter itself; if I hit my target it\u2019ll cost me at least \u00a31540.00 in fees and taxes, so to be able to afford this campaign I have to include that one last cost, bringing the grand total to \u00a315,388.00.\nI look at that figure and I don\u2019t know if I am gunna be able to make it. But I know how many people our little shop has touched. And I know that I am going to create the best artwork and pour my love and heart and soul into every drawing I do here.\n\nAlso - there is no risk with this donation for you! If we do not raise the money needed to save the shop, and the money needed to produce the cards and prints, you get your donation back. But please at least pledge something cos it might mean we can keep the studio and if we can then you can still come get tattooed by all your favourite artists here at Granny\u2019s Attic Tattoo.\n\n***For full disclosure - I applied for and received the self-employed grant - unfortunately this is calculated purely on profits, and totally neglects expenses of a business such as mine. As the expenses of my studio are not much lower than my turnover annually, this means that I actually make a very low amount of profit per year - and this in turn means that when my calculation came through it was not even enough to cover the rent of my small flat, let alone enough to live off and support the studio on. I have also contacted our local council multiple times for financial assistance but to no avail.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course there are some risks and challenges to overcome here, but the main one is actually selling enough decks of cards. 400 sounds like a darn big number. But I really have faith in my ability to create a mind-blowing product and I hope you can see the potential like I can!\n\nThe other risk is having issues with the manufacturer which could potentially cause delays. But I plan to combat this by giving a later deadline than originally planned - I have left 2 whole months to allow for issues with production to arise and be rectified and still get the cards shipped out to everyone by July 2021.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a39 or more", "title": "Signed A5 print", "descp": "Heavyweight textured recycled card print at A5 size.

The LUNA Tarot cards visualize those who walk in the realm of night and guide you to interpret the messages given.\n\nWhy revisit the Ethereal Visions Tarot Deck?\nWhen Matt first approached the Ethereal Visions Tarot project in 2016, the intent was to stay true to the traditional Art Nouveau style of the early 1900s. Over the past few years, the deck has gained world-wide attention touching so many lives. Many of the deck admirers have reached out to Matt requesting a second deck with more diversity. This spawned the Dreamscape Oracle Deck (which began shipping in October/November 2020). This oracle deck allowed Matt to explore that same original Art Nouveau style but with more diversity and creativity.\nThe overwhelming response that the Dreamscape Oracle received inspired Matt with images to update the Ethereal Visions Tarot Deck. That creative spark has yielded The LUNA Tarot Deck, a revisited version of the Ethereal Visions Tarot Deck with more diversity, richer colors, special iridescent silver foil, and 8 brand new cards (stretch goals could release more)!\nThese two beautiful decks long to be used together to deliver the messages where the Dreamtime veils part and the moon whispers her secrets.\nUNLOCKED: Two bonus cards have been added to the deck! It will now be an 80 card deck!\n\nThe LUNA Tarot Deck consists of 80 cards. Each card is illuminated with special iridescent silver foil stamping unique to that specific card design.

Not only will each card be an original piece of artwork but the incorporation of iridescent silver foil to the deck has exposed new challenges.

Clearly, I haven't changed much.\nI'm constantly juggling side projects in addition to my job making games. I don't finish  many of those projects. I definitely didn't plan on finishing this deck when I started it nearly three years ago. But something about it kept me coming back, slowly making one card at a time as the world changed around me.\nMore of my work can be found at shermansplanet.com.\nThe Deck\nThe deck contains 78 sturdy tarot-sized cards (2.75\" x 4.75\") with a smooth matte finish. It comes in a rigid two-part box with designs on the top and sides.\nInsects, with their metamorphoses and biological castes and extreme ecological diversity, provide a wealth of symbolism that can be worked into a tarot deck. Each individual card has been paired with an insect, but additional symbology is spread across multiple cards. For instance, five cards in the major arcana line up to tell the story of the Fool's Journey as portrayed by a universal symbol of change and growth: the monarch butterfly.\nEach of the minor arcana suits is associated with a type of eusocial insect that appears on the aces and court cards: bees (cups), termites (pentacles), wasps (swords), and ants (wands). Other motifs tie the entirety of each suit together.\nThe Guide\nThe companion guide is a perfect-bound 4\"x 6\" booklet with a smooth finished matte cover. It contains a short intro and a full page description of each card. Here are two sample pages:\nStretch Goals ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll cards have been designed and the entire guide has been written, and I've received satisfactory proofs of both products.

This desire for personal gain is at the heart of the game \u2013 it drives the players to take risks, betray each other, and ultimately cause the kind of chaos that echoes through time and renders the future unrecognizable.\nRooted in Trophy and inspired by Ray Bradbury's A Sound of Thunder, Echoes of Chaos is a narrative-first system that features players taking on the roles of Tourists: time travellers who have an ulterior motive for visiting the past. Working with the Game Master and their fellow players, Tourists will attempt to achieve their selfish goal, but in doing so run the risk of altering the future in wild and unpredictable ways. \nYou will begin by creating this world together: deciding what the Present is for your tourists... is it cyberpunk dystopia, a shimmering utopia, or a slightly more tech-heavy version of our own world? What do your characters love and hate about the world they are departing from? Working together you'll set a baseline for the way things are... and then watch that world unravel as you loot the past.\nUsing a risk-based six-sided dice pool, you'll adventure through time in pursuit of your selfish goals (and helping or hindering your fellow Tourists in pursuit of theirs'), slowly earning Echoes - the consequences of interfering with the past. In the finale of the game, these Echoes will determine how much the future has changed, through a variety of fun and creative randomized tables... or you and your table can decide what you think changed!\nThe goal of Echoes of Chaos is to provide a fun guideline for exploring chaos theory, the butterfly effect, and other time travelling hijinks while leaving plenty of room for customization and improvisation. Follow the rules or just use them as inspiration - whatever helps you and your players have the best adventure!\nHow to Play\nA session of Echoes of Chaos begins by creating The Present: this is the world your characters will be departing from to travel back in time. The creation of The Present involves setting some baselines for the world: the type of government, the state of the world (at war, on the brink, at peace), the nature of culture, etc. This can be done in advance by the Game Master, decided on collectively at the start of the session, or randomized by rolling on a table. Once the state of The Present is decided, the players choose their characters.\nCharacter creation is a lightweight process in Echoes of Chaos, involving deciding on a Motivation: this is the ulterior motive your Tourist has for travelling to the past and your main objective for the game. You will also get to equip your character with Enhancements that will grant them powers, at the cost of Stress... you might have a cool laser rifle, but knowing that you're smuggling it will make you more paranoid and prone to panic. With Motivations in mind, you will then determine the nature of your Tour.\nEach game is made up of several Tours, where the characters will attempt to achieve their goal and cause the Echoes that will alter The Present in a variety of ways. The group is travelling together, so much like taking a shared Uber, your Tourist may end up in some unexpected time periods and situations and can decide to help or hinder the group as they see fit.\nEventually, after each Tourist has attempted their goal, the Tourist return to the Present, where the Echoes of Chaos they have caused will determine how much has changed from what they left behind. In this finale, all the classic time travel consequences come true (think Back to the Future: Part II's Biff World) and the characters must reckon with what they've done.\nTogether in a single session, you'll create a new world, explore its past, then destroy its future... for fun and profit! (Well, maybe not profit. But definitely fun!)\nWhat's included in the Zine?\nFull rules to run Echoes of Chaos\nLightweight set-up for easy one-shots\nRandomized tables to generate The Present and the effects of the Echoes of Chaos\nAdvanced rules for non-randomized set-up, alternative scenarios, and modified gameplay\nTime travel hijinks! Future-altering consequences! Real-time, collective speculative fiction creation!\nThe Inspiration\nHi! I'm Tom, the designer of Echoes of Chaos. I've always loved Ray Bradbury's creative, exciting short stories and A Sound of Thunder has always captivated me: a team of hunters goes on a time safari to hunt a tyrannosaurus rex, on the condition that they stay on the designated path... needless to say, things go badly, and a panicked hunter steps on a butterfly, turning the utopian future they left into a fascist hell. It's fun, Twilight Zone-y stuff and has inspired lots of fun stories, from The Simpsons' time travel toaster, to the movie Butterfly Effect, to a somewhat questionable film adaptation of the short story itself, and more.\nPrompted by The Gauntlet and ZineQuest, I started thinking about fun ways to remix the brilliant Trophy RPG by Jesse Ross and realized there was a fun opportunity to build on the themes of Trophy - greed, hubris, and the slow erosion of the characters - and apply it to a time travelling sci-fi adventure: and so, Echoes of Chaos was born!\nHaving GMed professionally for a podcast network for the past few years, I've grown to love narrative RPGs that leave a lot of room for collaboration and mutual world-craft - leaving the players room to help develop the world and story they're interacting with. Echoes is an extension of this, with the players and GM working together to build (and destroy!) the world. My hope is that it will create short, memorable adventures - and do the memory and legacy of Ray Bradbury proud!\n...well, prouder than Butterfly Effect did. I hope.\nStretch Goals\nWe've got lots of fun stretch goals planned, from a Campaign version add-on (to play over multiple sessions, returning between Tours to The Present which has been altered more and more each time), to a printable deck of random Pasts, Presents, and Consequences, to being able to pay our collaborators more (our cover art is by the amazing winters860 who really went above and beyond!)\nAll this and more (?!) will be announced once the project is funded!\nSpecial Thanks\nI was able to commission our cover art thanks to a generous loan from The Gauntlet, an amazing RPG community (including CODEX magazine, Trophy, Brindlewood Bay, and more) and I quite literally could not have done this without them. If you're into RPGs (and really, if you're still reading this I gotta imagine you are), please check them out: they are an incredibly supportive and engaged community. Extra special thanks to Jason Cordova (creator of Brindlewood Bay, which is absolutely brilliant) for setting this all up.\nAnd thanks to winters860, the amazing artist who created our cover - an absolute joy to work with and I can't recommend them highly enough.\nAnd, of course, to the great Ray Bradbury: for inspiring this, and so much more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this is my first Kickstarter AND my first RPG, I have kept the scope relatively small: the game itself is already fully designed and in beta testing (playtest videos coming soon!) and since it is only being distributed digitally (through Drivethrurpg.com) I do no foresee any major delays to delivery.\n\nIt's important to me that you get this game into your hands as soon as possible (and in the best possible state it can be in!) so we're keeping it nice and simple: I will be finalizing the game after the playtest period (Feb-March), doing one final edit in April, then getting the game to you in May: it's already done, but I want you to have the best version, not the first version.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 3 or more", "title": "PDF - Everyone Can Play Edition", "descp": "Times are tough, but we want to make sure that everyone can enjoy some time travel adventures and escapism.\nHaving reached our funding goals, we're happy to be able to offer this tier for anyone who wants a copy, but might not be able to afford/justify the expense of the full-price game right now.

Finally, both characters have a Secret about their shared past which is revealed during the final scene if the game\u2014offering a final dramatic chance to influence how the story ends.\nYou might play characters such as:\n A Seeker with a family curse, who is an Elder, Fighter, and an Outcast, seeking to slay the monster which haunts the woods to put an end your family curse. \nA Dweller who once was a lost hunter, now Ancient, Ravenous and Many-Limbed, seeking to reunite with your long-lost kin so that you may look on the beauty of the world outside. \nMechanics\nTOKEN adapts the dice rolls from Trophy Gold and adds a new mechanic of its own. Dice rolls may result in the player gaining a Token, acquiring a Scar, or increasing the threat of the Forest:\n Reflection Rolls (similar to the Hunt Roll in Trophy Gold) are made when searching the Forest for clues of the other. \n Challenge Rolls (similar to the Risk Roll in Trophy Gold) are made when facing a threat of the Forest directly.\n Enticements tie both characters more closely together as Tokens may be exchanged to heal Scars and change Instincts. \nEpilogues\nThere are 3 ways the game can end:\nA player gains 3 Tokens, narrating their first reaction when both characters meet.\nThe Forest gains 3 Tokens, and a growing horror engulfs both players.\nA player gains 3 Scars, and is mourned by the other in an epilogue.\n(art by Ezra Rose)\nListen to an actual play of TOKEN:\nHear Gabriel introduce and play TOKEN on the You Are Not Alone podcast:\n Part One (intro, character and setting creation, start of actual play)\n Part Two (continued actual play and epilogue)\n Listen to interview about the project: \nGabriel discusses TOKEN with Marx Shepherd on the Yes Indie'd Podcast\n\n\n \u201cThe game is fantastic. It is a really beautiful game that helps to challenge how we view others. It asks us to look at relics of a life lived and figure out how those artifacts change our characters. I love RPGs for their power to increase empathy and Token does this so well.\u201d \n\u2014Blaine Martin, creator of the You Are Not Alone podcast\n\n(cover, details not final)\nTOKEN will be an estimated 48 pages, including:\ngame rules, discussion of safety tools, touchstones to inspire your game \nextensive tables for character and setting options, unique character sheets\n6 unique scenarios from guest writers including character and setting options\ngorgeous atmospheric layout design by Cathode Youth \noriginal artwork by Ezra Rose and Madeleine Ember \n Stretch goals will further expand the game! \n(Sample layout - details not final)\nThe zine will be printed by Mixam, on 130# matte cover and 80# uncoated paper for the interior\u2014the same beautiful quality of production as our previous game Candlelight. \nPDFs will include a hyperlinked Table of Contents and will be delivered via Itch.io or DriveThruRPG, your choice.\nAll digital-only pledges will include a Print on Demand code for DriveThruRPG.\nGOAL MET! $3000 - Expanded Scenarios.

Once we reach this goal, the game will include:\n A game soundtrack featuring atmospheric soundscapes, a Forest Choir and a number of original ballads to further illustrate the themes of TOKEN. \n An additional scenario written by Gabriel Robinson inspired by one of the soundtrack ballads \n A Lore Generator which will use a series of tables to create legends or fables about both Seeker and Dweller characters. \nCurrent Stretch Goal: \nAt $6000, TOKEN will include:\n\nCUSTOM TOKENS! These will be available as physical add-ons in the form of POGS (yes, those collectable cardboard milk caps from the mid-90's).

Many folks have asked about a solo variation\u2014this variation will let you play as either Seeker or Dweller.\n   A version of the game for younger players or anyone wanting to play with a lighter, more whimsical tone. If you want to play with younger family members, this gives you an option to create a fairytale or legend together, this give you that option! This will be delivered as a digital supplement, formatted for printing at home or mailing as a letter!\n   An additional song for the soundtrack to accompany the supplement, titled My Monster and Me. This song tells the story of a young person seeking to meet the creature they've heard stories about and really brings out the theme of empathy that's central to TOKEN. It's inspired by stories like Where the Wild Things Are.

This tropical island features a setting loosely influenced by Southeast Asia. You'll see this come across the lore, world-building, crops, animals, and more. Nestled in between the equator and northern tropic, Coral Island is graced by four seasons per year.\n\nThis is Coral Island. Segmented into 7 different areas, your farm is located on the left side of the map, just on the outskirts of town.\n Starlet Town is the heart of Coral Island. Not only is it roomy and features a butterfly garden, but this charming little town also has stories hidden behind its townies.\nThe Beach is rich with sparkly white sands, seashells, and seasonal fruits. On the pier sits a handsome old Inn and a gateway to ocean exploration, the Diving spot. \nThe Lake perhaps guards the most magical place in Coral Island. Find your way through the wooden bridge and discover the ancient temple. It\u2019s believed to be the main source of water and where the island's rich soil originates from.\nThe Forest is a mystic sanctuary for wildlife, filled with ruins and who-knows-what. Underneath the musky floor, it's a hoarding place for messages from the past, the Cavern.\nThe Lookout used to be a place where locals prepared for battles of old and whatnot. As time passed, the Lighthouse is now solely used for navigational aid. Come here and enjoy wicked sunsets and pick some wild fruits on your way home.\nThe Woodlands used to be part of the Forest, but since the arrival of humans, it is now tamed and family-friendly, without losing its green allure. Walk alongside the river to see the School, Taco Truck, and houses belong to those who prefer quiet nights over paved pathways of the town.\n Hillside, sandwiched between the Forest and Woodlands, is the perfect combination of green and privacy. Take a peek at the Vineyard and familiarize yourself with the local Carpenters.\n\nThe Coral Three were said to be the Goddess of Flowers, Merfolk, and Giants. Once upon a time, they worked together to maintain the balance of Coral Island. \nThe Goddess of Flowers was worshipped by both Merfolk and Giants. To this day, locals continue to believe that the Goddess is responsible for rejuvenating the island's water, soil, and well-being.\nSubmerged artifacts suggest The Merfolk Kingdom protected the oceans. It appears they were tasked with ruling the underwater world around Coral Island, making sure that order was maintained.\nLegend has it The Kingdom of Giants existed to cultivate the rich soil of Coral Island. Ruins around the island depict Giants, and what appear to be humans, farming alongside one another.\n\nPufferfish Drilling Corp. is a disgraced company whose goal is to drill oil on and around Coral Island. Set to open this Spring, they plan to lobby their way into the community and collect properties to secure voting rights.\n\n\nWe hope to color your days in Coral Island through music.

Since we've passed our Console Stretch Goals, Coral Island will also be coming to Nintendo Switch, Playstation, and Xbox! \n\nWe understand that localization is very important. Coral Island will launch into early access with Bahasa Indonesia and English support. Shortly after, we will update the game to support the additional 8 languages seen below.\nBased in Indonesia, our team currently consists of 20 passionate talents. This includes both permanent crew members and remote collaborators. Although this is our first game as a studio, our team is comprised of veteran and junior game developers.\nYou can learn more about us on our website: www.stairwaygames.com\n\nOur goal is to release the best version of Coral Island. We believe the only way to achieve this is through community involvement. With Kickstarter, we hope to build a community of passionate backers and involve you all in the process of development. All in service of producing the best farming game we can create.  \nSo far, development has been entirely self-funded. Although we have enough funds to complete the game, there are several features we would love to add but don't have the resources to do so. It's always been our dream to play a farming game that features changing seasonal outfits for NPC's, or finally, having kids grow up! We hope Kickstarter helps us realize some of the stretch goals we have for Coral Island.\nAs backers, we invite you to join our Discord to see daily developer diaries and have a direct open line of communication with us. \n\nDevelopment began in October 2019. Initially, we focused on preproduction and coding core features that now serve as the foundation of Coral Island. Over the last 6 months, we've shifted gears into full production.  \nOur focus right now is finalizing and polishing content for the Alpha that will be released to Alpha Farmer tier backers and above. From there, we'll work alongside the community, releasing two content updates and iterating feedback into the game before eventually launching into Steam's early access.\n\n\n\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped 5,000+ creators make their projects a reality, raising over $300MM through crowdfunding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been working on Coral Island for close to 15 months now. \n\nThe two biggest challenges we see ahead for the project are developing alongside community feedback and, provided we reach the stretch goal, implementing the multiplayer component into the game. \n\nDepending on the amount and type of feedback we receive, the dates for milestones on the development timeline may shift.

A purely visceral form of personal musings from paper, to screen, to book.\n\nWithin it are odes to the fantastical, natural, celestial and mundane, with an everyday touch. Some illustrations are present to send a clear message; others just silly doodles, but made with love all the same. \n\nEach illustration's goal is to bring the viewer a sense of peace, a wayward thought, or a nostalgic reprieve - weightlessness.\n\n\n\nThat's about it, really.\nHello, I'm Geneva! I like drawing and fantasy.\nYou see, I like being all poetic and deep and stuff, but have a hard time expressing it in real life through words and actions. So I try to express it and my fleeting thoughts as best I can through drawing. \nA proprietary focus is on people of color, most notably black women. I try to portray the true beauty and softness of black women especially, as so much of this is seemingly lacking in other forms of media. As a black woman myself, I feel as though it's my duty to showcase our grace for others like me and beyond, who longed to see fantastical portrayals of it our whole lives.\nYou can find more art on my portfolio HERE, Instagram HERE, and Twitter HERE.

The Tories have been in power since 2010. \nDue to National Health Service cuts, trans healthcare has become increasingly hard to access. The waiting list for a first appointment at a gender identity clinic is now 300 years. They don\u2019t want to outright refuse you; that would imply that the health service is over capacity or underfunded. Instead they will simply add you to the end of the list and wait for you to die. \nBut they are fools. For you have learned the secrets of immortality. And you will get to the end of that waiting list, even if it means waiting another millennium.\n\ncover image\n\n\nThe Game\nLichcraft is a rules-light tabletop RPG set up to be played with 2 or more players. The play is inspired by Forged in the Dark systems, with a simple D6-pool resolution mechanic. Instead of choosing classes or players, characters begin by choosing their politics, hobby, day job, and magical source, and use attributes from these to add to their dice rolls. \nGive this game a try if you like dystopian settings, collaborative world-building and play,  magic wielding queer characters,  interesting and individualistic ways of spellcasting, and undeath as a metaphor for... something.\n\nPremise\nIn this game, you play trans characters in dystopian Britain,  50 years in the future.  You have been trapped at the bottom of a waiting list for vital gender affirming healthcare. The list is far longer than a mortal human lifespan. \nAs a result you have decided to pursue lichdom. Over the course of the game you will gather all the components for the ritual necessary to become an undead creature of great arcane power, at which point you may either transform yourselves however you choose, or wait things out in your new immortal bodies- you have all the time in the world.\nThis is a game about spite, necromancy, being trans, and a 300 year long NHS waiting list. Although the game itself deals with serious themes, it is set up to be tongue-in-cheek, satirical, super queer, and intimate. \na basic character sheet\nWhat You're Backing\nThe core game has already been written and is available to download on itch.io. Backers will all get access to the digital PDF, available as soon as I can send you a backer email. This kickstarter will enable new layout and art for the current game, as well as the printing of a physical zine for #zinequest3. \n\nThe zine itself will be printed on A5, with one colour (neon pink) and interior and exterior illustrations.  It includes core rules, play examples, safety tools, a character sheet, and adventure generation tables, as well a a set of rituals to help with your ascent into lichdom. \n\nYou are also backing a cool project produced by  a trans writer and contributed to by trans and disabled artists and writers. That's it. \n\nStretch Goals\n\u00a3900 : More art! Interior illustrations for Lichcraft will be added to by Ema (@spookymeal) Ema is an amazing trans artist and game writer who draws beautiful characters. You can check out her work here: https://spookymeal.tumblr.com/ \n\n\u00a31000: Expanded Rituals page by Sam D (@sdunnewold) Sam is the  writer of Doskvol Breathes, and their writing is incredibly thoughtful, emotional, and reflective. The ritual pages for Lichcraft already offer a chance for players and characters to reflect on the game, their own identities, and their experiences in the process of lich ascension. An additional rituals page from Sam would expand this and give more options for the game's conclusion. You can find Sam's work at https://stone-arch-bridge-troll.itch.io/ \n\n\u00a31,600: More art by Kristen (@KristenChin8) Kristen is the cover artist and, if we meet this stretch goal, I'll be able to pay her to illustrate each title section of the zine. Any more money raised after this will just go towards paying everyone involved in the project more.  \n\nAnd our new 10k stretch goal: 4 alternate quarter page settings for th game!\nAt \u00a310,000, the final zine will include four quarter page alternate settings for lichcraft- each with their own unique vibe and one additional d6 table. Lichcraft 4069: a Wargamepunk alternate Britain, featuring an immortal queen ruling with an iron fist, and many, many trans orcs. LICHCRAFT IMPERIUM: The Year is 269 AD. Long have the romans held dominion over your province. But you and your super queer gang of raiders are going to change all that. And also become liches. Lichcraft 1869: A Western version of lichcraft, trans cowboys* robbing trains and taking names. Lichcraft 200069: Trans space pirates taking on the space tories. It\u2019ll work, I promise .\nSpotlights\nOne of the amazing things about Zinequest are all the fantastic creators and projects involved.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCovid and Brexit: Both COVID-19 and Brexit do present possible risks to the shipping of the physical project.
