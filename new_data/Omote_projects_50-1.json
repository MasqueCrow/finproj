The Grand Duchy of Reme is the region home to classic adventures released by Necromancer Games for D20/3.x and Frog God Games for Pathfinder, Swords & Wizardry and Fifth Edition. \nMore than 10 adventures have brought life to the Grand Duchy of Reme. The Lost Lands Campaign Sourcebook funded in January is expected to be over 700 pages and all of them are full of information. By necessity each region was described broadly, but there are still a wealth of history, politics and other details to be explored, experience and expanded in the Grand Duchy of Reme. \nThe Grand Duchy of Reme is a system neutral hardcover volume designed to be useful for campaigns independent of system preference. Specific details that affect the characters in the Lost Lands there are System Encounter Books. These companion volumes are softcover (or PDF), that contain reference stats for use with the Region book along with detailed encounter tables for the region.\nAdditionally, 3 classic adventures previously unavailable for Pathfinder, Swords & Wizardry, and Fifth Edition are back. These are offered as either softcover add-ons in backerkit or as free stretch goals in PDF (see reward sidebar).\nMock-up of Grand Duchy of Reme. Final release will differ slightly\nThe city of Reme itself is ancient, with world-spanning trade \u2014 the eternal citadel of the Loreclans, where the ashes of legendary barbarian kings reside. This land lies near the slow collapse of the nearby Empire of Foere, and the rise of Bard\u2019s Gate to the East. The Rhemish watch these events with cold eyes rather than concern, for they live in vast regions that devour invaders. Their land is eternal; their people can be forced back to the plains, but in the plains they can abide for as long as need be. They are \u2014 as a people \u2014 the ultimate hunters. The fall of Foere is like the fall of an antelope upon the plains; the rise of Bard\u2019s Gate is little more than the stepping-up of jackals before the body. The Grand Duchy of Reme simply waits and watches \u2014 for Reme is the dwelling-place of the world\u2019s wolves.\nReme is a unique fantasy civilization whose structure is determined by the one overriding fact of its geography \u2014 the country is a vast, grassland plain. The realm is dominated by the culture of the ancient Loreclans: the urbanized and settled ones, and the nomadic clans of the interior. The Loreclans owe a certain fealty to the Dukes of Reme, who are the final arbiters of the ancient law of the plains, but between the Loreclans and the Dukes there are also the mysterious Pashtars: arbiters, judges, and mediators who roam the plains where their service takes them.\nThe city of Reme, of course, is one of the wonders of the world of the Lost Lands, home of powerful spell-casters and perhaps the greatest mercantile and war fleets of the Crescent Sea. It is also, however, steeped in the culture of the vast plains of the interior. It is a place where assumptions are dangerous, for it is no standard fantasy environment \u2014 it is a culture that will be entirely new and foreign to your players, a place to truly explore as well as adventure.\n***NPCs & Loreclan stretch goal(s) PDF rewards will be fulfilled as a single PDF volume as they are unlocked***\n$15,000 - Funded!\n$17,500 UNLOCKED- The System Encounter Book, the Tower of Jhedophar, the Grey Citadel and the Siege of Durgam's Folly will be added for Pathfinder version 1.0 as add-ons at additional cost.\n$20,000 UNLOCKED-  A detailed regional non-player character presented in an illustrated one-page PDF, for use in Reme.

The tower is guarded by a massive labyrinth filled with deadly traps, vicious adversaries and unlikely allies. Who among the brave may wrest the Mandrake Staff from Jhedophar\u2019s bony grasp? Remember heroes, dragons and liches do not let loose their treasures lightly!\nJhedophar is about to take your party through his welcoming tower. Art by Adrian Landeros.\nWill the adventurers take the dragon's deal and attempt to slay Jhedophar in his fortress of evil or take the Lich\u2019s deal and rid his tower of the pesky squatter Exeterus once and for all? Designed for characters of 13th-15th level, the Tower of Jhedophar offers just the right mix of fast-paced action and clever role play. \nThe Grey Citadel $14 PDF, $24 Softcover plus PDF in same version as print)\nAdventure in Dun Eamon: Demons roam the streets of the city of Dun Eamon, criminals rule the night and an important local power figure has gone missing. Can your heroes unravel the clues that lead through every social element of the city, into the hearts of its inhabitants and far below its streets in search of answers?

These ship separately from the main reward at no extra charge for backers pledging $40 or more.\nThe city awaits.\nSpecial Note to the Temple of the Frog Pledge\nThis premium pledge requires some explanation. First of all: All shipping costs are included with this pledge level. The Temple of the Frog Pledge gets you an invite to join the Froggies at North Texas RPG Con 2020 in June or at Gamehole Con in November 2020 (your choice of 1). At this event, we will pay for your:\nConvention badge \nHotel room \nMeals and beverages\nAll you pay is your transportation to and from the convention! Shipping is also FREE, anywhere in the world! This is where you get to hang out with us behind the scenes, eat dinners with us, play in our games during the day, and generally stay up late without your parents telling you that it's bedtime. Ask any of our fans that have bought this pledge before, it\u2019s truly a wonderful experience! This reward also includes automatic entry into a game game run by Frog God at North Texas RPG Con or at Gamehole Con! \n\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way). PLEASE NOTE! The POD option for this books is a softcover book and is NOT library bound. That being said, it is significantly less expensive to ship if you live outside the US. \nThe Grand Duchy of Reme will be included in the Frog God Games World Anvil project slated for 2020 release. This reward was unlocked in the Lost Lands World Setting funding project along with opportunities for commercial use.\nWorld Anvil is the ULTIMATE Worldbuilding Toolset & RPG Manager Created for Writers, Gamemasters, & Creatives.\n...and with it you can...\n-Build the complete, living world behind your incredible novels, games, and art.\n-Showcase your worldbuilding, novels, characters, campaigns, maps, and timelines to perfection, and invite your fans and players to explore!\n-Secure.

Click the Join a Server button and copy and paste this into it https://discord.gg/GaXW2TX \nBackerKit\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward! \nDigital Reward Shipping\nWe will email groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\nWhen the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw, or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds\nIf for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter, Backerkit, and Paypal.  \nOverseas Shipping\nThis hardcover book likely will cost around $60 to $80 to ship to non-US customers. We continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We actually have considered not even selling books overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart. Due to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70, or even $100 to reship. We discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service. We will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books \u2014 and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all overseas shipments. We hate to do this \u2014 but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.

The game is intentionally rules-light, putting the focus of play on imagination, improvisation, and fun. The rules are optimised for ease of use at the table, with meticulous attention to wording and layout clarity. What's more, Old-School Essentials is 100% compatible with the classic Basic/Expert game from 1981, meaning that decades of adventure are at your fingertips!\nOld-School Essentials comes in two forms: a chunky tome and a modular boxed set. The content is identical. Choose one or both, depending on your preferred format!\nThe first two Old-School Essentials supplements \u2014 adding extra classes, spells, and combat options \u2014 will be available as optional add-ons in BackerKit (following the completion of the Kickstarter)!\nDigital mock-ups. Final products may vary. Some new cover art in progress.\nSee below for in-depth info on all products!\nPDFs\nAll books will also be produced as extensively hyperlinked PDFs. Once the Kickstarter has finished, backers will get early access to PDFs in their current, near-finished forms. Once all artwork is in place and everything is finalised, the final PDFs will be sent out to backers.\nFree Basic Rules PDF: To whet your appetite for this game, you can download a free PDF, featuring the basic rules for creating characters, adventuring in dungeons, combat, magic, and spells. Includes the complete rules for four classic fantasy character classes: the cleric, fighter, magic-user, and thief.\nKiller Features of Old-School Essentials\nUsability: Old-School Essentials is meticulously edited and laid out, with the aim of maximising ease of reference during play. No more searching for references scattered across multiple pages. No more scanning dense paragraphs of text to pick out details. Everything in Old-School Essentials is logically organised and collated, and presented in a quick-to-read format based on \"control panels\" \u2014 two-page spreads presenting a single topic in its entirety. (See page examples below or check out the free Basic Rules.)\nModularity: The rules of Old-School Essentials are divided into \"modules\" \u2014 cleanly separated chunks of related content. For example, the core rules of the game are cleanly separated from the rules for the classic fantasy character classes. This makes it simple to swap out any of the modular components of the game's rules with alternatives \u2014 perfect for referees who love to customise and tweak. We have lots of plans for further rules modules in the Old-School Essentials line, building on the core rules to take the game into a myriad of different settings and genres, from science fantasy to post-apocalyptic to sword and sorcery.\nConvenience: All books are produced in handy A5 (Digest) size for convenient use at the table. The small, modular books in the Black Box make it easy to find what you need. Want to look up a spell? Just grab the book of spells. No need to navigate a big tome to find the right section.\nQuality: We're set to produce the Old-School Essentials books at a deluxe level of quality \u2014 hardcovers with sewn bindings. These will be beautiful and seriously durable books!\nCompatibility: Old-School Essentials is a 100% accurate restatement of the original Basic/Expert rules (B/X), with nothing added, changed, or removed. All material written for the B/X rules over the last 38 years can be used with Old-School Essentials, without any conversion effort whatsoever!\nRefinement: The original Basic/Expert game presents a wondrously solid rules set, but the rules are not without areas of confusion and contradiction.

Includes full rules for sentient swords. This book contains all magic items from the Basic/Expert game.\nRules for sentient swords\nFor those who prefer all of their RPG rules in one book, rather than divided into modules \u2014 this is what you've been waiting for! Everything that's in the Black Box, combined into a single 256-page, A5 (Digest sized), hardcover tome.\nThe Old-School Essentials core rules plus all of the classic fantasy genre content, all in one meaty hardcover book. This book is a complete restatement of the Basic/Expert rules, meticulously edited and laid out for maximum usability and ease of reference.\nSpecial Kickstarter Price!\nBackers can get the Rules Tome at a reduced price of \u20ac25. The final retail price will be \u20ac30.\nThere's Also a Super-Deluxe Limited Edition!\nIn conjunction with our manufacturer, we're delighted to be able to offer a super-deluxe and highly limited edition of the Rules Tome, only available to backers of this Kickstarter!\nThe limited edition book will be wrapped in luxurious black leatherette, and foil stamped with the Old-School Essentials logo plus a design based on the cover illustration. (We'll post updates on that design as work on the cover illustration progresses.\n\nThe Rules Tome and the Black Box present a loving restatement of the classic Basic/Expert rules from the 1980s. But this is just the beginning of the Old-School Essentials line \u2014 we have many more books in the works, taking the game into a vista of different worlds and genres.\nAs part of this Kickstarter, we will also be producing a pair of hotly anticipated books to add Advanced magic and character options to your games! These new options are inspired by the beloved Advanced rules from the 1970s, and carefully scaled to mesh smoothly with the lower Basic/Expert levels of power and rules complexity.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Genre Rules\n56-page A5 hardcover\nThis book adds:\n 9 new human classes: acrobat, assassin, barbarian, bard, druid, illusionist, knight, paladin, ranger.\n 6 new demihuman race-classes: drow, duergar, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, svirfneblin.\nOptional rules for choosing race and class separately.\nAdvanced rules for poisons, combat options, and more.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Druid and Illusionist Spells\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by players with spell-casting characters\n106 new spells that can be used by bards, druids, gnomes, and illusionists, ranging from 1st to 6th level.\nMore Advanced Fantasy Books...\nWe plan to continue expanding Old-School Essentials with more Advanced books, bringing in monsters and magic items inspired by the Advanced rules.\n\nDeluxe Quality\nAll books in these deluxe editions will be high quality hardcovers with sewn bindings. In addition to their high durability, a great thing about books with a sewn binding is that they can lay open flat!\nWhat's more, we have stretch goals lined up for extra trimmings, to further increase the quality of these books. See below for more info on what we have planned, if the initial funding goal is surpassed.\nThe Team\nWondering who's behind all of this? Allow us to elucidate:\nGavin Norman: Author of Old-School Essentials (and formerly B/X Essentials), co-creator and principle author of the critically acclaimed Dolmenwood campaign setting, and founder of Necrotic Gnome. Gavin has driven the Old-School Essentials project since its inception, and is the mastermind behind the writing, editing, and layout.\nAndrew Walter: Visual genius behind a vista of weirdness, including Dolmenwood and Troika! Andrew's flights of imaginative fantasy feature on the covers of the five books in the Black Box. Four of these are complete (as shown in the product mock-up above). Andrew is now working on a completely new cover for the Core Rules book in the Black Box.\nPeter Mullen: Revered for his fantastically imaginative work on the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG and many other old-school games, Peter is working on a brand new piece that will grace the cover of the Black Box and the Rules Tome, and full 4-panel art for the front of the referee screen!\nStefan Poag: Prolific and beloved creator of weird and wonderful fantasy art, including many pieces for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Metamorphosis Alpha, and many others. Stefan created the cover art for the Advanced Fantasy rules modules.\nInterior artists: A crack team of artists is tackling the interior illustration of the books, including: Luka Rejec, Matt Ray, Michael Clarke, Alex Mayo, Tom Kilian, Sean Poppe, Kyle Latino, Thomas Novosel.\nPlus full-colour art plates by: Thomas Denmark, Rachel Quinlan, Jon Hodgson, Olivia Politz, Tom Kilian, Sam Mameli, Emma Lazauski.\nWhat's This About 1981?\nThe 1981 Basic/Expert Fantasy Adventure Game sets (also known as B/X) have experienced a vibrant renaissance over the last decade. Many players have returned to (or discovered for the first time!) the simple rules and imaginative open space of the Basic/Expert game, with the focus on ease of play, adventure, wonder, and mystery.\nRenewed interest in this vintage game has led to the creation of a wide array of retro-clones: games that restate or are inspired by the rules of the Basic/Expert sets. In fact, the B/X rules (and games based on them) are the most popular rules in use in the old-school gaming scene.\nOld-School Essentials is exactly such a retro-clone, and we're immensely proud to be a part of the renaissance of these beloved rules.\n100% Rules Accuracy\nThe material in the Black Box and the Rules Tome forms a complete retelling of the classic Basic/Expert rules, including all of the classic fantasy classes, spells, monsters, and treasures.\nOld-School Essentials has been developed with equal measures of love and precision. The ultimate aim of this project is to produce as accurate as possible a restatement of the revered B/X rules, while improving the structure and presentation, and fixing errors and contradictions in the original rules. (For those with a passion for rules archaeology, this document describes all the areas of the Basic/Expert rules which are clarified in Old-School Essentials.)\nThe resulting books are the product of over two years of meticulous research, rules archaeology, and discussion.\nA Single Optional Addition \u2014 Ascending Armour Class\nModern iterations of the world's most popular RPG use an Armour Class system where AC values start at 10 and go up. This is known as Ascending Armour Class. (The default Armour Class system in B/X has AC starting at 9 and going down, known as Descending Armour Class.)\nFor those more familiar or comfortable with Ascending Armour Class, this optional rule has been fully integrated into Old-School Essentials. All AC ratings are presented in a dual format, for example: AC 7 [12].\nThis is the single rule we've added to the game that is not present in the original Basic/Expert rules, and it is strictly optional \u2014 Descending AC remains the default.\n\n\u20ac16,000 \u2013 Purist Character Sheet [UNLOCKED]\nDesigned by Gavin Norman.

That said, Necrotic Gnome has been relentlessly producing high quality old-school content since 2012. The team behind Old-School Essentials is by no means new to producing games! We are renowned for our communicative and transparent development process, so you can be sure of receiving a steady stream of updates as the project progresses.\n\nThe risks involved in this project are low. The text of the Rules Tome and the books in the Black Box is 100% finished. The layout of all books is done. The cover art for most of the books is done. About 50% of the interior illustrations are in place. All that remains, development-wise, is for the artists to get working on the final illustrations, to be slotted into the layout.\n\nWe've previously worked with the printer who'll be manufacturing the books, so their professionalism and commitment to high quality are known factors. They do excellent work, fast.\n\nThe box manufacturer isn't someone we've worked with before, so that is a slight unknown, but in case of an utter fall-through in communication, we have a second box manufacturer lined up.\n\nAs for the stretch goals, the majority of them are designed such that they will not add delays to the production and fulfillment of the main campaign goals:\n\u2022 The physical upgrades to the books don't entail any additional development time. (They just cost extra!)\n\u2022 The referee screen (as noted above) will be shipped separately from the books / box, so any unexpected delays in development there will not delay the whole project.\n\u2022 Development of all the digital stretch goals (character sheet PDFs, the rules reference website, etc.) likewise does not impact the delivery of the books / box.\n\nThe stretch goals that require additional print production (the Advanced books and the introductory adventure) are the main extras that could, in principle, cause delays. However, all of those products are already written. They just need to be laid out and illustrated. This extra work has already been factored into the planned shipping dates, so the risk is minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Halfling", "descp": "PDF of the Rules Tome.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Sprite", "descp": "PDFs of all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Gnome", "descp": "PDFs of the Rules Tome and all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["321 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Fighter", "descp": "The Rules Tome \u2014 at the special Kickstarter price!\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["658 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "Dwarf", "descp": "The limited edition, foil stamped, leatherette cover Rules Tome.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nLimited super-deluxe Rules Tome with stamped leatherette cover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["110 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "Magic-User", "descp": "The Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["582 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "Elf", "descp": "The Rules Tome plus the Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["603 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac75 or more", "title": "Retail Fighter", "descp": "Five copies of the Rules Tome for retail.

The Lost Lands contain locations now legendary in the annals of roleplaying, from the depths of the massive dungeons of Rappan Athuk, to the city of Bard\u2019s Gate, the Desolation of Tsar, the Blight, the demon-tainted Sundered Lands, the chaotic tumult of the Borderland Provinces, and the fabled Northlands. These publications offered hints of the sweeping scope, deep history, and epic grandeur of the Lost Lands.  But only hints.\nFor well over a decade, a Lost Lands campaign world has been our customers' most requested project...\n...and the time of the Lost Lands has now arrived!\nThe Primary Reward\nOver 42 years in the making, this is the definitive guide to the world of the Lost Lands!\nThis massive volume includes the history of the Lost Lands, a wealth of detailed maps, cultural information about its nations and peoples, and a huge gazetteer containing descriptions of the world's countries, cities, waterways and geography. For the first time, readers can explore the length and breadth of the great continent of Akados, including regions never before described, and far Libynos, home of the Desert Kingdoms and many ancient cultures alien to the folk of Akados.\nThe book weighs in at approximately 700 pages in full color, with maps by award-winning cartographers and beautiful, original artwork to place you directly into the world itself in all its glory and terror.\nEntirely system-neutral, the guide can be used with any game system you choose.\nThe Lost Lands are the setting for a tremendous array of over 150 individual adventures and sourcebooks already published by Frog God Games and Necromancer Games, many providing statistics in multiple game systems. All of this material is available to provide an almost inexhaustible resource of ready-made adventures and epic quests! Future Frog God Games products set in the Lost Lands will be built into the ever-growing canon finally revealed in this volume.\nAbout 4000 example pages of Lost Lands Adventures Pictured Above\nA small sample of some of these already-existing adventures include Rappan Athuk, Sword of Air, Slumbering Tsar, Bard's Gate, Necropolis, Cyclopean Deeps, The Borderland Provinces, The Blight, and Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms.\nAuthors of adventures which have, over two decades, explored the Lost Lands include Clark Peterson, Ed Greenwood, Bill Webb, Gary Gygax, Matt Finch, Jim Ward, Morten Braten, Jeff Harkness, John Stater, Bill Kenower, Nate Paul, Dennis Sustare, and Alex Kammer.\nThe authors of the guide to the Lost Lands include Bill Webb, Greg Vaughan, Matt Finch, Vicki Potter, Pat Lawinger, Anthony Pryor, Rhiannon Louve, Tom Knauss, Mark Greenberg, Ken Spencer, Casey Christofferson, and Thom Wilson.\nShipping\nInternational shipping on a book this size may be quite expensive. If you are a non-US customer, please read the shipping information below. We anticipate shipping to be $80 to $100 for most countries, and could even be more. Shipping for the tapestries (and only the tapestries) is calculated into their price for Canada, the UK, the EU, and Australia. \nSpecial Note to the Temple of the Frog Pledge\nThis premium pledge requires some explanation. First of all:\nAll shipping costs are included with this pledge level.\nThe Temple of the Frog Pledge gets you an invite you to join the Froggies at North Texas RPG Con 2019 in June or at Gamehole Con in November 2019 (your choice of 1). At this event, we will pay for your:\nConvention badge \nHotel room \nMeals and beverages\nAll you pay is your transportation to and from the convention! Shipping is also FREE, anywhere in the world! This is where you get to hang out with us behind the scenes, eat dinners with us, play in our games during the day, and generally stay up late without your parents telling you that it's bedtime. Ask any of our fans that have bought this pledge before, it\u2019s truly a wonderful experience! This reward also includes automatic entry into a Tegel Manor game run by Bill Webb at North Texas RPG Con or at Gamehole Con (this session is on Halloween, and is not open to general registration) in 2019!\nBackers may add any of the following to their pledge for the indicated additional cost, in addition to the standard rewards for the tier pledged:\nExtra Poster Map--An extra copy of the 6-panel poster map of the world setting: $20.\nMap Super Pack--An estimated 12, 6-panel posters of the world map (so on a dramatically larger scale than the regular poster map): $50.\nTapestry Map--A 71 x 72 inch cloth tapestry map of the world setting: $140. This item will ship separately and will ship free to the US, Canada, the UK, the EU, and Australia! Shipping is still charged for all other products. \nLeather Book--Real cowhide leather edition of the hardcover book: $300.\nPathfinder Addendum--An addendum book providing rules for including the Lost Lands in a Pathfinder game, including things like cleric domains and deities, as well as archetype character classes: $40 color softcover book, $20 PDF.\n5th Edition Addendum--An addendum book providing for rules for including the Lost Lands in a 5th Edition game, including things like cleric domains and deities, as well as archetype character classes: $40 color softcover book, $20 PDF.\nSoftcover Print Copy of the Lost Lands Developer Notes--Copy of the developer notes for the world of the Lost Lands, comprising over 100,000 words: $50, softcover book.\nWe decided to do something a little different this time for stretch goals. We feel that everyone at a tier above the $1 level ought to benefit from hitting those goals, and it so happens that we've got lots of ready-made digital adventures that take place in the Lost Lands. So when each goal is hit, expect a new adventure to be added as a PDF file (your choice of Pathfinder, Swords and Wizardry or 5th Edition) to all pledges of $15 or more. That's right! You get adventures to get started in the game world for FREE!\nPlease note these are PDFs only. Dead tree versions are available on the FGG website.\nHours of entertainment in the Lost Lands.\nUNLOCKED!! $55,000 -- The Missing Pin by Alex Kammer (for 4 to 6 characters from 2nd to 4th level) \nA valuable ruby pin has been stolen under strange circumstances, and its owner is willing to pay capable adventurers to track it down and return it. It will not (of course) be that simple. Nothing in the Lost Lands is as it seems. What looks like a heist perpetrated by a rival family in fact turns out to be an inside job. Reginald Reed, the very person who initially contacts the party, stole the valuable pin himself because he has fallen under the sway of a fey being who lives in a backwater marsh a few miles upriver. And then, things got worse. \nUNLOCKED!! $60,000 -- Nightstone Keep by Ed Greenwood (for 4 to 6 characters from 4th and 6th level)\nThis location-based adventure is centered on a ruined, long-disused stone keep in a wild forest. The characters will be able to explore the ruins of the keep, which have become a plant colony, and attempt to wrest a powerful treasure from the clutches of the araunglyd, a gigantic sentient fungus. \nUNLOCKED!! $65,000 -- The Covered Bridge by Kevin Wright (for 4 to 6 characters of 4th to 6th level)  \nAre the characters up to the challenge of solving the centuries-old murder of a historic hero? Within the adventure, the characters are caught up in the haunted memories of the ghostly knight and help him to accomplish his heroic deeds. While doing so, the party becomes familiar with his world and the murder suspects, picking up clues to their motivations and actions along the way. At the end of the adventure, an enraged spirit confronts the characters and demands that they name his killer. If they can do it, they are richly rewarded; both in treasure and the knowledge that they let a good man finally find rest. If they fail, they must face the chilling wrath of the deathless phantom.  \nUNLOCKED!! $70,000 -- A Midnight Council of Quail by Lance Hawvermale (for 4 to 6 characters from 3rd and 5th level)   \nThe Archdruid Cadrryn is so old and mystical that his very presence often affects the natural world around him. Over the years, his close association with the region\u2019s quail population has bestowed upon the birds a sentience uncommon to normal avians. With slightly advanced intelligence, the quail now act as local sentinels, reporting back to Cadrryn on all matters that transpire in his domain. But the druid has been away for more than a fortnight on business of the Druidic Order of Oescreheit, leaving the quail to decide on important events without his wise hand to guide them. When the birds learn that a sinister force has infiltrated the nearby village of Eorls Gedreas, where many of them roost upon the thatched rooftops, the quail convene to determine a way to fight back.\nUNLOCKED!! $75,000 -- Lost Lands Commercial License and a Community Resource Hub for Backers/Supporters\nThe Lost Lands are opening up! At $75,000, Frog God Games will set up a license agreement that, at no charge, allows third-party publishers to commercially publish adventures, supplements, fiction and other written material set in the Lost Lands. Frog God Games material older than 18 months is available to expand upon and use as a springboard for your stories and adventures. Rights to third party-created content are retained by the creator and can be sold through any gaming or fiction marketplace determined by the creator. Simple guidelines apply (no indecent material, no harassment or encouragement of harassment of actual persons, no *-cist or *-phobic, no real world intrusions into fantasy games, etc.). Want to create new levels in Rappan Athuk? Go right ahead. Wish to reunite the Sundered Kingdoms? Great. Desire to expand upon otherwise unexplored locations? By all means! Want to go into the past and explore ancient times? Go forth and conquer!\nExample of the thousands of illustrations and maps that will be available for 3rd party publishers or really awesome Game Masters.\nWhat is more, Frog God Games is currently developing a community hub that will contain resources like reference materials, a published adventure directory and access to almost 2,000 illustrations that have appeared in Frog God Games and Necromancer Games products, all for use by creators. The Hub will be free to backers for at least 3 months and will have a very minimal fee thereafter (only to pay for maintenance and compensate the coordinator behind everything).\nOther details will be forthcoming in updates and other channels as they are developed. \nUNLOCKED!! $80,000 -- MCMLXXV (1975) by Bill Webb\nThis module is intended to show how old school roleplaying provides enhanced descriptions and provides not only storyline and encounters, but creates a feeling of \u201cbeing there\u201d. 1975 is meant to take you back to that time the \u201cold-timers\u201d talk about with a look of wistfulness in their eyes. Join us as we all travel back to 1975. The other members of Frog God Games would like to go on record that we did attempt to change the title, but Bill Webb is the one who approves printer proofs.\nUNLOCKED!! $85,000 -- Grimmsgate by Matt Finch (for 4-6 characters of 1st Level)\nDeep in the wooded wilderness, the village of Grimmsgate is an outpost town on a seldom-traveled trail, right at the edge of nowhere. The village\u2019s half-ruined temple of Law, dilapidated inn, drunken blacksmith, exiled trader and a few fur-trappers are enough to keep the bloody-minded denizens of the dark forest at bay, but nobody really expects the village to still be there in another ten years. The woods have become too dangerous for the trappers who once caught animals for fur, and merchants no longer travel the poorly-maintained road. Grimmsgate is an introductory adventure for the Swords & Wizardry tabletop roleplaying game. \nUNLOCKED!! $90,000 -- Rogues of Remballo, by Matt Finch (for 4-6 characters of 1st Level)\nA city adventure set in the Borderland Provinces, the City of Remballo immediately gets first-level characters embroiled in strange plots, sinister intrigue, and fierce battles. Is the thieves\u2019 guild of Manas encroaching on the territory of the Remballo guild? What is hidden in the sanctuary-courtyard known as the Four Corners? How is the powerful banking house of Borgandy involved with all of it? What starts as a straightforward mission actually involves a host of complications \u2014 some of which can be deadly if the characters don\u2019t play their cards right. \nUNLOCKED!! $95,000 -- The Riot Act by James Spahn (for 4 characters averaging 2nd level)\nThis adventure highlights several locations in Bard's Gate, especially those in the Bridge district. A mixture of encounters includes roleplaying, investigation, dungeon crawling, stealth, and combat. The adventure does not require any specific classes or races, though bards and rogues may be useful given the nature of their special abilities. It is assumed that the PCs are sympathetic to the Lyreguard or other agencies that serve the interests of Bard\u2019s Gate \u2014 or at the very least that their loyalty can be purchased for a few gold coins.\nUNLOCKED!! 1000 Backers at $15 or more -- Bard's Gate\nBard's Gate is a full color, 500+ page city supplement, detailing the city and lands nestled in the shadow of Stoneheart Valley. Hundreds of shops and merchants populate the city, and adventure lurks behind every corner. Full-color illustrations of Bard's Gate's notable inhabitants, along with beautifully illustrated maps and a 6-panel poster map enhance the sense of wonder the city brings. Bard's Gate also features eight different adventures in and around the city, taking characters from 1st level to 10th level or higher.\nUNLOCKED!! $100,000-PDF Copy of the Borderland Provinces Gazetteer free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $105,000-PDF Copy of the Players Guide to Barakus free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $110,000-PDF Copy of Players Guide to the Sundered Kingdoms free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $115,000-PDF Copy of the Player's Guide to the Northlands free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $120,000-PDF Copy of the Player's Guide to the Blight free to all pledges of $15 or more.\nUNLOCKED!! $125,000-PDF Copy of the Player's Guide to Bard's Gate free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $130,000-PDF Copy of the Borderlands Provinces Journey Generator free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $135,000-PDF Copy of the Tales of the Lost Lands Volumes 1-3 (short fiction) free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $140,000-PDF Copy of the Tales of the Lost Lands Volumes 4-6 (short fiction) free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $145,000-PDF Copy of Bill Webb's Book of Dirty Tricks free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $150,000-Isle of the Angry Apes, brand new adventure by Ken Spencer, more details soon.

PDF is free to all pledges of $15 or more, a softcover module a softcover module will be available for a $15 add-on!\n$180,000-???\nBook Quality\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way).  \nPLEASE NOTE! There is no POD option for this book like we have offered to overseas customers on smaller books--this thing is just too big to glue bind. It would fall apart and you would be unhappy. \nBackerKit\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward! \nDigital Reward Shipping\nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\nWhen the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds\nIf for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter, Backerkit and Paypal. \nOverseas Shipping\nThis book likely will cost around $80 to $100 to ship to non-US customers. We continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out.\nWe actually have considered not even selling books overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart. \nDue to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70 or even $100 to reship. \nWe discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service. \nWe will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books--and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all overseas shipments. The shipping of the map only (6 panel map, no additional materials) will NOT incur the insurance charge, however postage will be charged at cost. \nWe hate to do this--but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas. \nWe are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (23!)

It has been a fantastic run and far exceeded our expectations! Trollzah and thank you again!\nCastles & Crusades: Raglesborg Den of Iniquity is the next installment in the Inzae adventure series by the co-creator of Castles & Crusades: Davis Chenault. Raglesborg Den of Iniquity is an  80+ page adventure module that plunges you into that city of thieves. With over 60 encounter areas, a hundred+ NPCs, and hundreds of adventure ideas, Raglesborg is a true treasure trove for your gaming table. \nWhy Kickstarter\nThree Years and Running thanks to your support! With this Kickstarter, we intend to bring to all fans of Castles and Crusades and especially those who have ravaged through the Death in the Treklant, Bergholt: By Shadow of Night, and Bergholt: Beneath the Black Moon series another installment in the line to more fully flesh out the Inzae setting. We proudly bring to you, the most dangerous city in the world, Raglesborg: Den of Iniquity.\nFurthermore, all that content, needs its own box. With this Kickstarter we intend to raise funds to manufacture a box designed to contain all the Inzae material. Called Crucible of the Dragon, this box set will be large enough to hold Death in the Treklant, By Shadow of Night, Beneath the Black Moon and Raglesborg, as well as the world map and primer!\nThe City of Raglesborg\nLocated on the coast near Bergholt and south of Halpveg, Raglesborg is hidden in those deep and treacherous fjords of that untamed and brutal land, the Urstin Peninsula. Raglesborg, like the wild and treacherous lands about it, is a city like no other in the known world. \nPeopled with pirates, cutthroats, brigands, thieves, murderers and worse, this is a horrid city. Most of the wretched seafarers who pirate the turgid waters of the Interzae, the cruel bandits who roam darkened roads, and the malicious outlaws who prey on the weak eventually make their way to this city of thieves. They come to trade in ill-gotten goods, revel in sins with the plunder of their criminal labors or hide away from those who seek to impose upon them the laws and rules that bind other men together. Raglesborg is not for the faint of heart. Danger abounds! \nMountains of gaming material, NPCs and adventure hooks.\nRaglesborg is a completed manuscript. Its ready for editing and a little art. All we need to do is raise the funds to make it all happen.\nAbout the Crucible of the Dragon Box\nThe Crucible of the Dragon box set is the adventure arc that begins with Death in the Treklant and ends with Den of Iniquity. The box will be a sturdy game box and large enough to contain the adventure books Death in the Treklant, Bergholt: By Shadow of Night, and Bergholt: Beneath the Black Moon, Raglesborg: Den of Iniquity, the World Map and Inzae Primer.\nThough the box has not been made yet. It will follow the form and design of our previous Aufstrag and Canopy of Green boxes. Check out the video to see the quality. \nDo I need Inzae to play Raglesborg?\nNot at all. Though all of Davis\u2019 material is created and written for Inzae, it is easy enough to port to any homebrew or other setting. \nDo I need the other three books to play Raglesborg?\nNot at all. Raglesborg is only loosely tied to Death in the Treklant, By Shadow of Night and Beneath the Black Moon. Use it or ignore it as you see fit.\nDo I need the Castles & Crusades Rules Set to play Raglesborg?\nThat would probably be a good idea, however, C&C is an attribute-based RPG created in 2004. It is very similar to other RPGs on the market today, including the 5th Edition of the world\u2019s most popular RPG.\nWhat do I need if I want to start playing Castles & Crusades?\nThe cornerstone book for the GM (our CK) and the player is the Players Handbook. Scoop up the Monster book (any one of the three) and you have all you need. Check out all 100+ Castles & Crusades titles in our store here! \nWhat comes in the $10 Pledge level? Do I get the encounters?\nThe $10 pledge level comes with the Raglesborg book and any and all pledge levels that are included in that book. For instance, each of the Encounter Areas added via stretch goals are included in that level.\nWhat about an All Digital Level?\nIts already there! Pledge at the $10 level and add on the digital content from the list below to build it. For instance, if you want to add the Digital version of Death in the Treklant, choose the $10 pledge level and add $10 to that for a total of $20.\nI have some of these books but not all. Where do I get them?\nUse this list to ADD-ON to your pledge.  For those not familiar with Kickstarter, you simply increase your pledge by whatever amount you choose for the add-ons.  Then when the survey comes out, you will let use know what the extra money is for.\nADD ONS\nDeath in the Treklant, Digital: $10\nDeath in the Treklant, Print & Digital: $30\nBergholt I: By Shadow of Night, Digital: $10\nBergholt I: By Shadow of Night, Print & Digital: $30\nBergholt II: Beneath the Black Moon, Digital: $10\nBergholt II: Beneath the Black Moon, Print & Digital: $30\nRaglesborg: Den of Iniquity, Digital: $10\nRaglesborg: Den of Iniquity, Print & Digital: $30\nDamnation & Desecration, Digital: $5\nDamnation & Desecration, Print & Digital: $10\nCaverns of Ambuscadia, Digital: $5\nCaverns of Ambuscadia, Print & Digital: $10\nBurning Firmament, Digital: $5\nBurning Firmament, Print & Digital: $10\nA Princely Heritage, Digital: $5\nA Princely Heritage, Print & Digital: $10\nInzae Primer, Digital: $5\nInzae Primer, Print & Digital: $10\nWorld Map, Digital: $5\nWorld Map, Print & Digital: $9\nSTRETCH REWARDS\n$1,000 Raglesborg Funds: FUNDED!If we hit our goal you'll receive this Den of Iniquity.\nEARLY BIRD ENDS: Back 128\n$5,000 Additional Encounter Area: UNLOCKED!

We asked Dog Might for a design that would pair well with the Dragon d20 and their team stepped up with a beautiful, custom version of their Dragon Sheath dice box for us. It came out fantastic! These boxes are utterly gorgeous and Dog Might's reputation for quality speaks for itself. These are exclusive to Black Oak Workshop's Dragon d20 project and will not be available again after the project has completed!\nThere are two variations of the boxes.

Of course we have to credit Clark Ashton Smith...but our roleplaying roots lie in Tegel Manor.\nTegel Manor was mind-blowing in 1977 and it remains cool today.\nFirst published in 1977, Tegel Manor is the oldest of \u201cHaunted House\u201d adventures in fantasy roleplaying, and probably the very first megadungeon ever published. The Manor is a sprawling edifice of 250+ rooms filled with tricks, traps, puzzles, monsters, and situations both humorous and horrific. The huge manor house has been the curse of its owners, the Rump family, for generations \u2013 no matter how many times they have tried to get rid of it, the ownership manages to come back to them. \nTegel Manor is a full house...\nThis intertwined and sinister relationship between the house and its chosen family is a history of horror, evil, and greed. There is a lot for the characters to learn about the curse, and their knowledge might just keep them alive long enough to tell the tale.\nThat scar is the smallest one in the Rump family!\nIf you\u2019ve already seen the 1977 version of the Manor, there\u2019s a lot more for you to learn in this updated and expanded 5E version of the classic. This printing contains expanded descriptions of the rooms, new areas, new monsters, new magic items, and much more, all with spectacular color illustrations.\nAt the start of the Kickstarter, the book will be a perfect bound softcover, but if we get 250 backers purchasing an edition of the book, it will be upgraded to hardcover, free of charge!\nIn addition to the Manor itself, this book contains:\nA 4-level dungeon under the Manor, fully detailed.\nThe Temple of the Frog and the Monastery of Garm, as well as a full length new adventure-The Sanctum of Madness!\nA detailed handling of Tegel Village, the wilderness area, the black dragon lair and even the pirate lair and tower along the seacoast.\nAll 100 members of the Rump Family are described and detailed, and many even have portraits done!\nOver a 15 new monsters and dozens of never before seen magic items!\nand one more thing...\nThe Map of Tegel Manor\nThe map was revolutionary to gaming when it was introduced.  Our cartographer is the famous Alyssa Faden \u2014 we\u2019ve gone all-out on quality for this project.\nA reproduction of original 1977 map.\nWith this new release it is getting a bit of an upgrade...\nAlyssa Faden, map goddess and Frog God favorite, has been working on making the Sine Qua Non of Fantasy Gaming Maps. Using details from both the original and the newly written material each room now reflects the chaotic, creepy and often violent nature of the Manor. This is done at an incredibly high resolution which will keep the minute details she captures visibly pleasing when zoomed beyond what is normal in online games or projection based set-ups.\nSo just how big is it?\nExpect to be amazed at the poster map included with all book pledges (except PoD, see below). Six panels, full-color and high resolution will be awesome when printed on a poster over 2 feet wide, truly beautiful.\nThe larger tapestry map will be immersive and useful; a true showpiece that enhances the table-top experience itself. The nearly 6' wide cloth map is a worthy tribute to the famous 1977 map utilizing the technology of 2018.\nHuge-resolution that can print a landmark dungeon map to 6' wide? Awesome.\nBut it even gets more awesome than that. The map file is designed to be printed in sections at resolutions ready for 28mm scale. With enough battlemaps minis could be used throughout the Manor letting your players utilize the eye-popping map details in their adventures. \nYou are making 28mm battle-maps of Tegel Manor!!!??\nNope.\nBattlemaps, even 50 of them, just are NOT ENOUGH for Alyssa's map. We are using her masterpiece to create something truly unique and previously unavailable - at least not for general sale. What Alyssa is delivering (and we have prototyped) is a 28mm scale representation of Tegel Manor. Frog God, as a company, already has plans to roll out the 144 square foot map of the Manor at conventions (and some of our homes). \nThe Dawn of Time...\nWhat do we mean by \u201can edition?\u201d Isn\u2019t it just for 5e? Not to worry, old-school gamers, if you prefer the old-style rules we\u2019re also printing another version of the Manor for the 0E rules using Swords & Wizardry.\nTegel, like the City State, began as a small booklet and a few loose maps as \u201cInstallment Material.\u201d Bob, of course, placed it into his Wilderlands world-setting, but in time it grew to stand on its own as an adventure module. \n\u201cTegel Manor, like Fortress Badabaskor, is what I call \u2018first gen JG.\u2019 It was written before we had the huge influx of the creativity that the Dungeoneer crew brought to us. It was before the help of Jaquays, Hinnen, and Sering. It was pure Bob and Bill, drawing from their own talents and the input of their original gaming group.\u201d - Bob Bledsaw II.\n\u201cIn the early 80\u2019s, Dad gave me the Tegel Original Playtest Map that he and I had worked on all those years ago. To him is was a functional blueprint, but to me it was a work of art. I framed it as such, and it hung in my home, usually above my desk. Maybe it is because I always saw myself as simply a Guild Artist. Very little of my own work at the Guild ever made it into words written.\u201d - Bob Bledsaw II.\nSeveral fun tidbits have been uncovered since the early days...\nFor example, Bob\u2019s unpublished notes on Tegel\u2019s Entrance and Library included the following:\nButler Bertalan, a Balrog Ghost is accompanied by Maid Applesauce, an Amazonian Vampiress. He asks to take wraps and cloaks. He will indignantly leave through the West wall if refused, sarcastically telling you to \"Be that way!\" The Maid Applesauce will wink at any party-member before taking bat-form and flying out the North entrance.\nThe windows are of yellow, orange, and white colored magical glass panes; giving the room a golden hue during daylight hours. These Magical Panes cannot be broken and have the following magical property: during daylight hours, they will drop intelligence of characters by 1 every 3 turns, and the wisdom of males by 1 every hour, until they are reduced to blithering, drooling idiots. \nWelcome to the thrills and chills of the granddaddy of all haunted house adventures \u2014 the quirky and terrifying masterpiece that is Tegel Manor!\nWhy is Frog God doing this project?\nWay back in 1977, this kid discovered the realms of wonder that are Fantasy Roleplaying while travelling to camp in a motor home. Years later, that kid started has written or produced hundreds of books to support the game. That kid was me, and 42 years later (the day this launched!), I still remember the magic that Tegel Manor inspired. \nTegel Manor was where, for me at least, it all began. First as a player, and shortly afterwards as the Game Master. I will never forget that first session\u2014my poor, 1st level cleric was the only one who made his saving throw for some fear effect, and was left alone to face a dozen skeletons. I made my turn roll\u2014and managed to finish off the final two horrors that could only in my mind be the terrible creatures that I remembered from Jason and the Argonauts.\nLater that session, I recall moving the right arm of a statue and it spitting out a magic scroll! It was all fun and games for me until I was robbed by Roughneck Rump the Rotund on the way back to town. \u201cStand and Deliver\u201d he said. We were far outmatched by him and his icky goblins with bows\u2026ah well, we survived (except Richard\u2019s magic-user). \nThat birthday, all I wanted was this game. My parents obliged me by purchasing a white box set (at of all places Nordstroms!). I returned a couple of sweaters I got that year and used my money to get two sets of dice (I still have them!), a copy of Outdoor Survival (yep\u2014still have it too), and a single module\u2014Tegel Manor. Being the youngest, I was immediately elected Game Master (so the older guys could be players). They thought they could take advantage of the little kid\u2026well, they quickly learned from that mistake.\nFor the past 42 years, I have been running the same campaign, set in a mix of the Wilderlands and my own creation. Tegel Manor figured prominently in the foundations of my game. I still pull it out now and again and run it for my kids, at conventions (3 TPKs at one convention two years ago). \nOver the years, I was fortunate enough not to just meet, but actually work with, Bob Bledsaw Sr. While at Necromancer Games, we were able to complete the Wilderlands of High Fantasy, the City State of the Invincible Overlord and even Caverns of Thracia. We had just started working on Tegel when Bob fell ill, and the project was never completed. I had even figured out how to make a map (impossibly big for 2007 technology) that would accommodate 28mm figures for the entire manor itself. I was grief stricken when we were unable to continue with the first love of my roleplaying life.\nThen, two years ago, Frog God and Judges Guild agreed to revise and revisit Tegel Manor. I took charge of the project myself, and with help from several friends, we have created what I believe is an expanded version worthy of the modules legacy. No longer are the Monastery and Temple just boxes on a map. The single lines of the town are revised and expanded to detail each location, and the wilderness areas are filled out as well. Lots of those \u201cblank rooms and rat tunnels\u201d now have contents and lead places. After all, I spent 42 years running this module\u2014I added a great deal of content in that time. \nThat being said, the whole remains true to the snarkiness and tongue-in-cheek puns of the original. This book is to me, canon, and all revisions were checked to ensure they met my standards for the look, feel and smell of the historical book.\nI was finally able to get a way to create a full scale 28mm map of the manor (see premium pledges), and the artistic cartography of Alyssa Faden and Robert Altbauer will not disappoint. Artem Skukyav\u2019s creepy, almost gothic art was chosen specifically to capture the haunted house look of the place, and overall I am extremely proud of the work my team did to create this masterpiece.\nBW\n112318\nPledge Levels\nThe Frog God's Palace is posh and there are many formal events!\n$1 or more\u2014Skeleton\u2014Thank you for your support!

In his teens, Halloween led to Dad's only run-in with the law. He was pushing over outhouses (still a common sight in our neighborhood) when he slipped and fell into the dung-pit. His band of hooligans abandoned him when the owner emerged from his house with a shotgun. Dad was arrested for vandalism and had to ride to the police station on the fender of the squad car (a sickening embarrassment he never forgot).\nTegel Manor has its share of pits. \nOnce it was decided to make Tegel the October 1977 Installment, Dad asked me to create a cover for it, and asked for some art to include in it. At the time I was a pencil-artist. I was very accomplished with a pencil, but wary of ink and pens. That is why the Flying Turkey (the Company Logo) had to be inked over by my father. The same became true for the Tegel cover. Dad inked over my very detailed pencil drawing to make it print-ready: this explains the oddities of the details in that first cover, which was really a half-cover or thick banner taking nearly half of the booklet top. \nThe instruction from Dad was, \"I need a drawing of a Haunted House this size,\" and gave me the dimensions. The drawing did little to illustrate the enormous castle-like complex that became Tegel, but it did have a Halloween feel. My own inspiration came from the opening credits of Saturday-Morning's Scooby-Doo with bats flying by, but I had nothing but memory to draw from (video tape being a rare commodity in 1977). \nIn 1985 the Guild went into self-imposed hibernation, but interest in Tegel resurfaced. Colonel Lou Zocchi (of Avalon Hill and Gamescience fame) loved the module, and partnered with Dad to release a revised and expanded version through Gamescience in 1989. Lou had been one of the Guild's earliest distributors, and he and my Dad had shared a long mutual respect. Dad contributed little to this project, as Zocchi employed the skills of author Niels Erickson (Wizard's Realm) for the expansion. As previous versions of Tegel had all been for D&D, Erickson stripped out the mechanics to conform to a Universal or Generic System. \nOver the next decade, the Gamescience Version was the last word on Tegel, but then shortly before Dad's death in 2008, fans began coaxing out a Tegel for the D20 game system, and the online bulletin boards began to drum up interest in seeing it come together. Dad passed away in April of 2008, and after a month of grieving, I reluctantly stepped into his shoes. One of the first things I had to do was find out what was owned, what could be published (with or without royalty agreements) and the status of each title. Three of Dad's longtime friends, each a little worried for what might become of the Guild, offered personal assistance and advice: Bill Owen (Dad's longtime friend and Guild founding partner), Dave Arneson (author of Blackmoor and First Fantasy Campaign), and Colonel Lou Zocchi.\nIn the Guild's archives was two partial manuscripts on Tegel, both from the Guild's Sunnyside Days. One was a play-tested Tegel II, which seemed more of an expansion to the story line, while the other was a cruder more humorous (with adult content) pitch with the working title Rump Romp. As Lou had published the last version of Tegel, I asked him what he thought might be added or revised. He said there were some mechanical problems with the portals in his Gamescience version, and that he and my father wished to expand to include the rooftop. They had agreed on the use of four imps to be encountered there, named Aquis, Fortis, Gingis, and Vitus... and several jokes followed. Lou has long been an accomplished magician, but he has real talent at comedy too.\nDave Arneson too had some input on a Tegel Sequel. He told me Dad had devised a storyline (possibly shooting for a Christmas release) wherein Tegel would be encountered but all doors and windows blocked as if by magic, the manor aglow in a strange light. The only way to enter was via the roof and chimney (the chimney working as a time-portal) shooting you back in time, the soot tagging your date from which you came). The goal was to free a certain Elf named Kringle who had mistakenly come down the wrong chimney, landing amid the fiendish Rumps of Tegel Manor. This I tied to the folder Dad had the materials in, on which he had written the title Night of the Living Rumps. \nIn 2017, I was at the North Texas RPG Con speaking with Bill Webb, who was instrumental in keeping the Guild alive over the last two decades. He brought some of the Guild's best works to glorious hardback grandeur, keeping Judges Guild in the ears of the industry, while introducing our line to a new generation of gamers.  Bill let me know how much Tegel meant to him personally, and so we agreed to make this happen. I sent the original Tegel Playtest Map to the Webb Family as a gift to Tegel's biggest fan, and for all he has done to help the Guild along.\nBook Quality\n All Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way).   \nBackerKit\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward! \nDigital Reward Shipping\nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\nWhen the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nOverseas Shipping\nWe continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. \nDue to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70 or even $100 to reship. \nWe discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service. \nWe will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books--and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all non-POD overseas shipments. The shipping of the map only (6 panel map, no additional materials) will NOT incur the insurance charge, however postage will be charged at cost. \nWe hate to do this--but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas. From now on, we will be offering anything that is practical as overseas PODs, this book included. What this means is that smaller books/modules/maps may not be available as POD products (there is a set up fee that is substantial for each book, and we have no way to do weird shaped products (like maps) via this service.\nWe are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (22!)

Best of all, domestic backers are guaranteed to receive these stockings in time for Christmas 2018!\nThis will be a short and direct Kickstart. There will be no stretch goals, but every backer receiving rewards will receive a set of dice which will be included in their shipment in addition to the items from their selected reward level. This should help 'kickstart' your stocking stuff efforts in style! See The RPG Sets section for more details.\nThe Dice Stocking is our highest quality and largest dice bag to date. That's right! It can serve as both a sturdy stocking to hang from your mantle and also as a dice bag complete with drawstring! These stockings are as tough as Yukon Cornelius and strong as the Bumble. They can hold a whopping TWENTY FIVE standard sets of RPG dice and the loop can take the weight. These are not the cheap stockings found on most store shelves - they are built geek tough and will last for many years!\nThe green exterior is a soft, low pile velvet material - not the stiff velvet you see in a lot of small dice bags. The red interior is smooth satin like all our bags. The red drawstring stays tight when pulled and the loop can take the weight. Put these out for the holidays and Santa will surely reward you and yours with loads of geeky goodness!\nAnd for those of you with a sharp eye, that glowing, oversized d20 on the mantle is made by none other than Jolly Blackburn over at Amber's Secret Cove. Check out their line of great products!\nThe stockings come in two distinct designs that backers can choose from during the pledge manager process. You can choose from the The Dice Stocking or The Geek Stocking for each bag you receive! Although the retail on these stockings will be $15, backers of this project will be able to purchase additional stockings in the pledge manager for $13.\nMany Uses!\nHere are a few of the uses we thought of!\nThe Reward Levels\nThere is a reward tier for each reindeer! More directly, there are 5 distinct reward levels of which four have an early bird level. This has led to more reward levels that preserves the theme and gives our backers greater opportunity to get a deal!\nThe RPG Sets\nThe dice are standard sized RPG sets consisting of 7 dice per set and each of the options feature a 'pearlescent' design that shimmers in the light. They are good quality and we are offering ten different color mixes that backers can choose from as part of the pledge manager process. You can pick the color for each and every set that you back for from the available colors! These are great dice and perfect for backers who like to customize their dice by re-inking.\nEvery backer receiving rewards will get one of these sets included with their rewards to help start the stocking stuffing properly! As with any set backed for or purchased in the pledge manager, backers can select the color option for this included set from the ten offered on the project during the pledge manager.\nThese dice will not not be offered by Black Oak on our web store - we are only offering them as part of this project. Backers will have the option of adding additional sets as part of the pledge manager at a cost of $5 per set.\nAdd Ons\nAll Black Oak Workshop products currently in stock will be available for purchase during the pledge manager, so you can be sure to pick up some extra geek and dice goodness to fill your new stocking with!\nRetailers\nWe would love to earn your business retailers! Verified brick and mortar stores are welcome to back at the single bag level and then contact Black Oak through the project or through our website here. Retailers receive a 50% discount with a 10 stocking minimum order. You can expect to receive your orders well before Christmas (just as all backers will). This will mean there will be enough time to get these in front of your customers!\nShipping\nWe have an excellent success rate at meeting or even beating delivery goals from all of our previous projects so you can count on these making it in time. If you back, you will receive these by Christmas of 2018. Our only exception here is international backers. We cannot guarantee shipments to international backers will arrive by Christmas. However, we can guarantee they will ship the first week of December which should allow plenty of time, but there is no way we can provide any assurance for those backers outside of the USA.\nThank you for checking out our project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf funded, our priority will be to meet or exceed backer expectations.

All our Dungeon Tiles use 1\" squares.\nWe will also be able to produce these sets without the lamination, for people that want a matte finish to their tiles!\nThey have also been designed (where possible) to be as location neutral as can be, so you can mix and match sets and create dungeons for any part of your campaign world. We are launching with three sets of tiles but depending on funding and stretch goals there will be more to choose from.\nThe current Stretch Goal will unlock large wilderness battlemats that are each the equivalent of a single set of tiles. There will be three wilderness battlemats (plain grasslands, a single road and a fork in the road). They can be laminated or cloth topped and will be 27 1\" squares by 17 1\" squares. \nAdditionally if we hit this stretch goal, the KS exclusive detail tiles will be double sided and feature an alternate version of the same detail on each side, allowing for multiple colours and designs.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nEvery Backer will recieve the following tiles in the same format of their pledge (digital/physical).\nOne 4x4 Spell Circle Room\nEight 2x2 \"Extra Detail\" Tiles\nDungeon Realm Sets\nDepending on your pledge you will get to select 1 or more of the following Dungeon Realms sets. All Squares are 1\".\nThe Base Set: Everything you need for a basic Dungeon.\nThe Expansion Set: Larger rooms with unique details, perfect for adding interest and flavour to a basic dungeon.\nThe Sewer Set: Send your adventurers into the dark, dank depths of the sewers...\nThe Prison Set: This set adds plenty of extra rooms and passageways including Prison cells, a torture chamber, guard rooms and more. This set also works as a great addition to the base set allowing you to layout a huge Dungeon!\nThe Mansion Set: This set adds enough tiles to create the floor plans for an old mansion or town house. There is a mix of stone floors and wooden floors, allowing for these tiles to be mixed in with all our existing sets for maximum potential.\nLaminated Neoprene or Cloth Topped Neoprene? \nEveryone has seen playmats that are used almost ubiquitously for wargaming now. Essentially large-scale full colour printed mouse-mats, these have enabled gamers the world over to have beautiful looking gaming tables without the mess of trying to model one themselves. \nNeoprene is a wonderfully non-slip material when placed your tabletop (or many surfaces for that matter) and for me this is incredibly important. Gone is the need to tack or tape cardboard tiles down or worry that a small breeze or errant limb will knock the tiles across the table. \nCloth topped neoprene gaming mats are usually quite matte with only a hint of shine from the printing process. By choosing a laminated finish instead you add a very definite shine but this creates the perfect \u2018dry-wipe\u2019 surface for your dungeoneering needs.\nDue to the lamination process tiles with this finish do naturally have an ever so slight curl at the very corners as you can see in the pictures. I have found that this is almost completely unnoticeable when using the tiles on your tabletop during a game, but is accentuated when viewing photos online, taken at oblique angles... \n Hoe does Laminated Neoprene Behave?\nPLAY\n\nIndividual Tiles?  \nA conscious decision was made during design that we wanted each tile to be an individual room or passageway, so that the Dungeon Planner would have maximum autonomy in designing their layout. With squares tiles containing a selection of rooms you often have to lay the tiles out in a grid that makes everything feel just a bit planned and lifeless (imagine the twisting Gothic streets of Bruges, versus the gridded layout of Milton Keynes in England).\nTile Sets  \n All dungeon tile sets will be available as add-on items:  \nCore Set: \u00a330  \nSewer Set \u00a330  \nExpansion Set \u00a330  \nPrison Set \u00a330\nMansion Set \u00a330\nIndustrial Fantasy Set \u00a330\nFurther sets will be added here as they are unlocked.  \nDice Trays\nWe also have a small range of Dice Trays featuring our Dungeon Tile artwork. These are printed cloth topped neoprene with poppers at each corner to assemble. The trays are 8\"x7\" when lying flat. \nDice Tray: \u00a315\n All rewards will be set as standard shipping via Royal Mail.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the small nature of this Kickstarter the risks and challenges are also minimised. The design of the sets is near complete, the test prints have been successful and the manufacturer is more than capable of the workload.\n\nThe supply chain for this Kickstarter is also small, with less links in the production line turnaround time will also be reduced and allow me to react to any issues very quickly.

These are our most generic tiles, designed to be the foundation that all other sets build from.\n2. The Sewer Set\nEveryone needs a good sewer to go adventuring in. This set was designed to let you build some dark, dank sewer encounters, maybe as part or a larger dungeon or as a dungeon in and of itself!\n 3. The Encounter Set\nThis set is designed to add a flourish to your dungeon with unique rooms and spaces. These tiles are far more decorated and detailed adding interest to your dungeon.\n\u00a35000 - 1 x Free Spell Circle Feature Room (LOCKED)\nThe first stretch goal is a free 4\"x4\" tile that can be used as a small room by itself or layered with many other rooms to create a new or different feature.\nAll backers of physical tile sets will receive one of these tiles, digital backers will receive a digital copy.\n\u00a37500 - 4x Free 'Small' Feature Tiles (LOCKED)\nOur second stretch goal is a set of smaller 2\"x2\" tiles each with a small feature that can help drive your adventurers on to new goals or simply create an interesting feature. We have a mysterious trap door, a ornate pool of holy water and two as yet mysterious tiles...\nAll backers of physical tile sets will receive one of these tile sets, digital backers will receive a digital copy.\nFurther Stretch Goals\nFurther stretch goals include new Add On items like a room expansion set, a passageway expansion set, a mansion tile set, a grungy sci-fi tile set, an industrial fantasy tile set, a second encounter set with new 'boss rooms' and if we get there a Japanese style tile set. There will be more news on these as the campaign progresses.\nLaminated Neoprene?  \nEveryone has seen playmats that are used almost ubiquitously for wargaming now. Essentially large-scale full colour printed mouse-mats, these have enabled gamers the world over to have beautiful looking gaming tables without the mess of trying to model one themselves.\nNeoprene is an incredibly non-slip material when placed your tabletop (or many surfaces for that matter) and for me this is incredibly important. Gone is the need to tack or tape cardboard tiles down or worry that a small breeze or errant limb will knock the tiles across the table.\nNormally neoprene gaming mats are printed onto a cloth top so despite a slight metallic sheen, are usually quite matte. We have been able to add a layer of laminate to our tiles, removing the metallic sheen, enriching the colours and most importantly creating the perfect \u2018dry-wipe\u2019 surface for your dungeoneering needs.  \nIndividual Tiles?  \nA conscious decision was made during design that we wanted each tile to be an individual room or passageway, so that the Dungeon Planner would have maximum autonomy in designing their layout. With squares tiles containing a selection of rooms you often have to lay the tiles out in a grid that makes everything feel just a bit planned and lifeless (imagine the twisting Gothic streets of Bruges, versus the gridded layout of Milton Keynes in England).\nFinally... \nNeoprene tiles are much easier to store than any 3D tiles and yet with the laminated colour print still have a visual appeal on the same level (or better) than most 3D sets.\nTile Sets\n All dungeon tile sets will be available as add-on items:\nCore Set: \u00a330\nSewer Set \u00a330\nExpansion Set \u00a330\nFurther sets will be added here as they are unlocked.\nDice Trays\nWe also have a small range of Dice Trays featuring our Dungeon Tile artwork. These are printed cloth topped neoprene with poppers at each corner to assemble. The trays are 8\"x7\" when lying flat. \nDice Tray: \u00a315\nAll rewards will be set as standard shipping via Royal Mail. \nPledges for larger numbers of sets may need to be sent via Courier and so will usually be more expenisve than the listed prices here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the small nature of this Kickstarter the risks and challenges are also minimised. The design of the sets is near complete, the test prints have been successful and the manufacturer is more than capable of the workload.\n\nThe supply chain for this Kickstarter is also small, with less links in the production line turnaround time will also be reduced and allow me to react to any issues very quickly. I will be personally checking each order as it is dispatched for quality control.\n\nOur first Kickstarter, for card game playmats featuring Sumi-e artwork smashed its funding goal and was delivered on time without any issues!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "David Robotham\n3 created \u00b7 19 backed\nI'vebeen gaming for more years than I care to remember and have been actively producing design content for almost every game I have...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Level 1", "descp": "At level 1 you will receive any one Dungeon Realms set of your choice, plus any free unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign closes, through our pledge manager.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "All-In Digital", "descp": "At the 'All in Digital' level you will receive a high resolution digital copy of every Dungeon Realms set we are able to produce through this Kickstarter along with a digital versions of all stretch goals unlocked.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a355 or more", "title": "Level 2", "descp": "At level 2 you will receive any two Dungeon Realms sets of your choice, plus any free unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign closes, through our pledge manager.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a380 or more", "title": "Level 3", "descp": "At level 3 you will receive any three Dungeon Realms sets of your choice, plus any free unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign closes, through our pledge manager.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Skulls and Flames!", "update_content": "Good morning everyone,\nI thought it would be fun to show off a few images of the Encounter Set rooms as they have some great details.\nFirst up we have the aptly named Skull Room, great when you want to add an extra layer of foreboding to the Dungeon..."}, {"status": [{"Project is canceled": "OCTOBER 15, 2018"}, {"Project launches": "OCTOBER 9, 2018"}]}], "comment_no": 4, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2022259695/dungeon-realms-dungeon-tiles-for-tabletop-rpgs", "project_name": "Dungeon Realms - Dungeon Tiles for Tabletop RPGs (Canceled)"}}, {"backer": "Omote", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Ballista is a new line of adventures and gaming material published by Arcana Creations. The books in this series are all about providing a basic, rules-light, gaming experience making it easy to get into and start playing.\nWith our CA $3500 reached, we are producing an additional adventure to the original 5. All backers who pledged CA $6 or more is entitled to a copy of this 6th (as yet unrevealed) Ballista release matching the formats of their pledge level.\nOn top of that, we have also reached our 74 backer goal unlocked access to the BETA copy of the Ballista Rules Companion to all backers once it becomes available.\nArcana Creations is a small hobby-publisher that has produced material for the Castles & Crusades role playing game from Troll Lord Games, as well as material for Swords & Wizardry from Frog God Games. We have collaborated with other publishers such as Brave Halfling Publishing in the past, but now mainly focus on growing and increasing our own product output. 2017 saw the launch of the Arcana Elements imprint to produce non-gaming related books as well as the launch of the new Ballista line in 2018.\nThe concept behind the Ballista line has changed a lot from inception to implementation. The purpose of this campaign is to properly launch a new gaming line which is compatible with various editions of the world's most popular RPG as well as its relatives and simulacra. With that in mind, the goal of this campaign is the publication of FIVE gaming modules which will need very little additional rule books to actually play.\nIt is important to stress that Ballista is not a new game system. As written, these modules are compatible with systems like Castles & Crusades, Swords & Wizardry, and many others. However, included in every book on the inside cover is a basic rule set to allow you to run the adventure WITHOUT the need of a rule book if one isn't close at hand. All you would really need beyond the book are some characters, dice, and some friends!\nWhen Arcana Creations started out, in partnership with Brave Halfling Publishing, we released three modules for Castles & Crusades and two of those were subsequently released for Swords & Wizardry in electronic format. These were The Secret of Ronan Skerry, The Ruins of Ramat, and A Trick on the Tain. When they were first released, they were well received but the release was small and limited.\nThese three modules have been updated and, in some cases, overhauled for the new Ballista line. In addition to these three, we are releasing two new, never-before-published, adventures to round up our selection of five adventures. These are Mystery at Morfurt and Hide in Plain Sight.\nThe great news about the production of the modules is that the majority of the work is already done! The first three modules are finished and ready to go. The last two modules have already had extensive editing work done on them and are in various stages of layout. Here are print samples of the first three modules:\nWith your help, we can add the final two modules to the line and get all of these out into the hands of gamers and into wider distribution!\nFor all the modules being produced, we offer both PDF and physical printed books. The format chosen for these are 6x9 inches and the finalized page count for the first three are 20 pages each. Page count for the last two haven't been finalized yet but they will not fall below 20 pages. In fact, it is probable that Hide in Plain Sight will exceed this page count.\nThe 6x9 size format was chosen for a few reasons. In terms of the digital format, it is usable on 7\" tablets though optimal on an 8\" tablet for reasons of portability. The physical format makes it smaller than a conventional book which, along with the softcover nature of the module, makes it light and easier to ship. In fact, all five modules will be shipped in a small box (to better protect the books), and the combined size and weight of the package makes shipping to elsewhere in Canada, the United States, or abroad reasonably affordable. After the exchange rate, it will cost less than $10 USD to ship to anywhere in the continental United States as an example. Prices are similar when shipping to Europe or Australia though it will admittedly take several weeks to reach their intended destination.\nEach print module comes with free PDF version of it as well and each module has a MSRP of CA $12.50 each (which works out to no more than about $10 USD). They are printed locally in Montreal, Canada in Pacesetter Silk 80 lbs paper.\nTHE SECRET OF RONAN SKERRY\nThe Secret of Ronan Skerry was written by Michael Davis and takes place on an island. It is an adventure which is largely overland and geared towards a party of lower level characters. In it, the party is called upon to investigate the disappearance of a group of monks who man the lighthouse on the other side of the island.\nTHE RUINS OF RAMAT\nThe Ruins of Ramat was written by John Adams and this version (based on the original C&C version) was expanded. It now offers additional and optional content in greater depth than the scenario's original concept of a group of adventurers out to help a little girl to rescue her pet and explore a local dungeon. While this version of the scenario can be run as originally intended, making it great to play with your kids, the added content adds more depth and throws a twist making it worthwhile to explore further. It is primarily a low-level dungeon crawl.\nA TRICK ON THE TAIN\nA Trick on the Tain was written by Keith Hackwood and is primarily a local-area overland scenario. The adventure takes place over a broader region and can firmly be classified as a low-level wilderness adventure taking place in a tundra environment. There are enough ideas in the pages of the module giving plenty of room for a creative GM to flesh out and expand if they wish leading to a larger campaign in the region.\nMYSTERY AT MORFURT\n Mystery at Morfurt was written by Todd Pote and deals with the children of the village of Morfurt that have suddenly gone missing. Fearing a great evil is responsible, the Earl of the region dispatches a party of adventurers to investigate. It is written as a low-level scenario with a mixture of overland and cave/dungeon exploration.\nHIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT\nHide in Plain Sight was written by Bill DeFranza and starts with a party of adventurers hired to rescue an Earl's kidnapped daughter but they soon realize that all may not be as they appear. It is written as a low-level scenario and is primarily dungeon-based.\nA NOTE ON THE SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S PLEDGE LEVEL\nWe recently found a limited amount of old stock that was remaining from the Castles & Crusades version of The Secret of Ronan Skerry and A Trick on the Tain. This is a limited reward option and once these are gone, they will not be reprinted. If you are a C&C collector or fan, this might be one of your last opportunities to add these to your collection.\nUpon funding... all backers (CA $6 or higher) will receive an additional adventure becoming the sixth title in the Ballista Adventures line. The format of this additional adventure will match the format available in your pledge level. Title to be revealed later.\nUpon reaching 74 Backers... Each backer will receive a PDF copy of the Ballista Rules Companion (BETA). This reward will be delivered regardless of the success or failure of this project.\nNo significant stretch goals have been announced at the start of the campaign but that doesn't mean there aren't a couple surprises in store once we surpass our funding goal! There are things we have planned however, any stretch goals that may happen will be offered as digital options only. The choice is, in part, to keep the shipping costs on any physical rewards unchanged. If a physical version of a stretch goal is possible, an option to have this as a purchased add-on will be made available in addition to the free digital version.\nIn addition to the Ballista modules we have here, we are offering the three current titles published through our Arcana Elements imprint. Simply add the cost of the item to the existing pledge level. For example, if you pledged at the $48 level and wanted to add a copy of Mother of Mortals to your pledge, you would add $20 to the $48 for a total of $68 plus the shipping for your region. Add-Ons will be specified to us once the campaign is over and surveys go out.\nMother of Mortals ... CA $20\nStar Rover ... CA $16\nQuebec's Distinct Paganism ... CA $30\nAdditional Print Ballista Module ... CA $10\nAdditional Digital Ballista Module ... CA $5\nPlease note that, depending on stock levels and shipping destination, any the books could be shipped separately from the Ballista modules. If they do ship separately, they are likely to ship earlier than the rest of the rewards in this campaign.\nIn the Fairy Forest illustration \u00a9AtelierSommerland - Can Stock Photo Inc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the material written and the majority of the editing complete, we do not foresee any issues in fulfillment nor do we expect any. Electronic copies will be distributed online via Driverthru RPG (RPGNow) and the modules are produced locally at a reputable printer we've worked with before for other projects. The physical copies will be mailed out from Montreal, Canada.\n\nWe've done the necessary research regarding shipping and printing to know that there will be no cost overruns. With regards to shipping, while we managed to keep costs at reasonable levels, the time it will take to deliver packages will take longer if you are located overseas. Shipping can either be inexpensive or fast; it can't be both. For those who would like to expedite their shipping, this can be arranged at a higher cost. Please contact us through through Kickstarter to make arrangements.\n\nThe time for fulfillment, given where we are at in the production of these modules, is generous to anticipate any issues we couldn't otherwise foresee. The expectation is this will happen earlier than stated in order to complete this within the specified time frame. In the event that this campaign is more successful than anticipated, there will still be enough leeway to complete fulfillment on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 3 or more", "title": "Tip Jar", "descp": "Want to support Arcana Creations and the new Ballista line but not interested in any of the current offerings?

Thank you all for backing this collector's set and helping us create a new, contained boxed set for Castles & Crusades! Thank you all! Be sure to check out Backerkit to adjust your pledge levels and add rewards.\nClassic Castles & Crusades. A Role Playing Game.\nCastles & Crusades is a rules light fantasy RPG, powered by a simple mechanic called the Siege Engine. First published in 2004, the game quickly became a staple in the RPG market, leading the way and influencing a whole generation of RPGs. The Castles & Crusades Players Handbook, the cornerstone of the game, is on its 7th printing and headed toward an 8th. The line itself consists of a host of source books, monster books, setting books, and adventures. (For a brief overview of how to play, see the bottom of this page).\nToday, more than ever, people are enjoying the pure joy of role-playing games. New players by the scores, and older players who are rediscovering the fun of role-playing games.\nWe want to introduce them, and you, to Castles & Crusades. To do that we want to make an affordable, fun to use, and fun to have entry point into the game.\nIf this project funds we\u2019ll produce Classic Castles & Crusades as an affordable introduction to the genre and the game, bringing you the true spirit of Role Playing, in a simple, fast-playing and fun attribute-check-based rules system. \n In this Kickstarter we are offering up THREE special collector's products for fans of the game. These three products are as follows: \n C&C Classic Basic Boxed Set: This digest-sized boxed set is an \"old school\" presentation of the game, in a white box just like the original D&D rules, with saddle-stitched booklets containing a complete, but streamlined version of the game, with four character classes, four races, and magic to take your game all the way to level 10. Plus, a complete introductory adventure module! This box will be different than the Advanced and it will not be exclusive to the Kickstarter, it will eventually land in retail shops.\n C&C Classic Advanced Boxed Set: A True Collector's set, this limited, signed and numbered set will include everything from the Basic set, plus two additional books of character classes, equipment, monsters and gods; a full set of dice; character sheets; a pencil and more. This box will be different than the Basic box, sporting  a wood grain cover similar to the original OD&D box. It will be available in this Kickstarter and any left over from the very limited print run will be put in our store.\n C&C Complete Digest Rulebooks: These are the complete rulebooks for our seven core books: the Player's Handbook, Monsters & Treasure, Castle Keeper's Guide, Codex of Aihrde, Player's Guide to Aihrde, Adventurer's Backpack, and Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde. Each is the complete rulebook, exactly as you'd see it in full-size hardcover, but shrunk to digest size, softcover and printed in black and white. You can build your own set or buy all 7. \nHere's more information about each individual product, in detail. \nPRODUCT ONE: Classic Castles & Crusades Basic Box Set\nEach book in the set is 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched (stapled) with b/w covers and interior. Each book below includes streamlined extracts from the full, complete version of the game. Much of the flavor text will be removed for space reasons, and options will be limited, but it will still present a complete game that you can campaign with for years. Each book will be laid out in a fashion that best fits its size. The box will be a standard white box and eventually it will be available in retail stores.\n Classes & Races: a book that teaches you how to create a character and advance that character to 10th level\n Eldritch Enchantments: a book of magic rules and spells through the 5th level\n Monsters & Treasure: a book filled with monsters and treasure\n Adventures in the Wilderness and Underworld: a book on how the game plays and the famed Siege Engine\n An Adventure: a new, if presently unnamed adventure.\nThe below picture is of the C&C Black Box we did a few years ago. The Basic Box will look similar to it, final cover and image to be determined. The books as well.\nPRODUCT TWO: Classic Castles & Crusades Advanced Box Set\nEach book in the set is 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched (stapled) with b/w covers and interior. Each book below includes streamlined extracts from the full, complete version of the game. Much of the flavor text will be removed for space reasons, and options will be limited, but it will still present a complete game that you can campaign with for years. Each book will be laid out in a fashion that best fits its size. The box will sport a wood-grain print cover that pays homage to the original D&D box set. It will be available in this Kickstarter only, aside from any unsold from the limited print run, which will eventually be available on our store.\n Characters & Magic: a book that teaches you how to create a character and advance that character to 10th level\n Eldritch Enchantments: a book of magic rules and spells through the 5th level\n Monsters & Treasure: a book filled with monsters and treasure\n Adventures in the Wilderness and Underworld: a book on how the game plays and the famed Siege Engine\n An Adventure: a new, if presently unnamed adventure.\n Adventurers Backpack: excerpts from the recently released ABP, some classes, backpacks and other material\n Of Gods & Monsters of Aihrde: A second look at the gods of Aihrde.*\nCharacter Reference Sheets\nDice\nPencil\n*This book will contain different material than that which appeared in the original Black Box.\nThe below picture is the wood grain look that we will strive to replicate.\nPRODUCT THREE: Castles & Crusades Complete Digest Rulebooks\nBUT that\u2019s not all! We want to pay homage to the full and complete game. And what better way to do that than to release digest sized complete rulebooks for the game! In the pledges to the right you\u2019ll see digest versions of each of the core C&C books as well as the Setting material and books written by Stephen Chenault (CEO and lead author at Troll Lord Games\u2026. Jason Vey might dispute the lead author title).\nEach of the digest books is a shrunk down version of the hardcover copy of the latest printing (the CKG will sport the new cover). They are printed in black and white. Each set will be cut and trimmed to match a perfect set for your book shelf.\nWe\u2019d love to redo each of these books with special layouts for digest form, but that is two steps from impossible. If we took this approach, each of the books would require three times the pages, which would make the larger books like the Castle Keeper Guide unwieldy and weak in the spine. \nSo do keep in mind that these highly collectable books are shrunk down versions of our wonderful game. They are the same books, same page counts, same layout, etc. They are just smaller. On the left you'll see the regular Players Handbook, on the right the digest size Players Handbook.\nThe titles in the set include:\nCastles & Crusades Players Handbook (7th Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Monsters & Treasure (5th Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Castle Keepers Guide (3rd Printing Cover)\nCastles & Crusades Adventures Backpack (1st Printing)\nCodex of Aihrde (2nd Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Players Guide to Aihrde (1st Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde (2nd Printing)\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nWe are offering several pledge levels.

There are six main attributes: strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, charisma and constitution. There are standard classes like wizard, fighter, rogue, etc. and races like human, elf, dwarvf, gnome and halfling.\nWhen designing your character, you roll 3d6 six times for your attributes (this is one method) and assign the totals to each of the six attributes however you desire. You then assign each attribute a primary or secondary status. Humans have three and demi-humans 2. These attributes are the cornerstone of the Seige Engine. You will use them to solve any problem or overcome any challenge except for combat. To do so the Castle Keeper will ask you to roll an attribute check. You will roll a d20, add your level and you attribute bonus to the number rolled and tell the CK the total. THAT number determines whether you succeed or fail. Primary attributes have a base chance to succeed of 12, secondary attributes a base chance to succeed of 18. The CK will adjust that with a level of difficulty, or challenge level, and you must beat that number. \nExample: You want to swim a river. The CK asks you to make dexterity check. Dexterity is a prime, you are 3rd level and have a +1 due to attribute bonus. You roll a 14+level+attribute bonus. You inform the CK that you rolled an 18 prime. Because it\u2019s a prime, she knows the base is 12. She has assigned a challenge level of 4 to it. Meaning you need 12+4 for a total of 16. You made it. HAD dexterity been a secondary ability you would have failed, as the base chance to succeed is 18+4=22. You would have missed by several points.\nThat\u2019s the Siege Engine in a nut shell. Its very versatile, easy to use and adapts to ANY style of play. The true hidden joy of the SE is the CK controls what attribute you roll. Swimming a river? That can be ANY attribute the CK desires: dexterity, intelligence, strength etc. \nThe mechanic is designed to tailor to YOUR game.\nPlay it. You\u2019ll love it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt's always difficult to create collector's material. Items meant to be displayed, not used. Determining whether enough people are interested or not is no easy matter. Kickstarter offers the perfect vehicle for that.\n\nHowever, creating digest books is always a challenge.

Featuring high-quality art from the book.\nNote from the CEO\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\" So, what does this mean to you? Well first, you will note that our books cost a little more than others. That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use. We feel strongly that book production quality is king. After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way). It costs us a lot of money to do this, and our margins are somewhat lower than they could be as a result. Frog God Games stands behind our product (and sometimes on top of it when we need a ladder), and believe that the improved quality and durability of our work is well worth it.\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward!\nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through Backerkit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment.\nWhen the Backerkit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during Backerkit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nNOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive, expect to pay between $50-80 to ship your reward. This cost is based on the ACTUAL SHIPPING COST plus $5 and is calculated in Backerkit.\nBuilding the City of Brass\nClick the image to watch!\nIt has become traditional for Matt Finch to make a model of some part of our bigger adventures while the Kickstarter is live, and then make a video in which you see the model from miniature's eye level, walking through the adventure and seeing it through the eyes of the adventurers. Matt, Zach, and Jim are making one of the city's Black Magic Bazaars as the model for this Kickstarter. Keep track of their progress as the Kickstarter rolls forward. Here is a link to the first video, with special guest star Casey Christofferson, the author of the book! There will be lots of \"secret\" information about the city coming out in these videos, as well as tips for painting minis and terrain and how to make good scenery for city adventures! Don't forget to subscribe to Matt's channel if you want to get notifications of each video's release.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (19!)

Its wildly popular supplement, the Advanced Edition Companion, adds all of the \"advanced\" first edition options for Labyrinth Lord, all while keeping compatibility with the B/X basic fantasy game.\nFor the first time, Labyrinth Lord and the Advanced Edition Companion will be seamlessly combined into one volume! Fans have been asking for this for several years, and it is my pleasure to make it happen! All of the basic and advanced options, magic items, and monsters will be brought together under one cover for easy reference.\nHere are some facts about the combined book:\nThis is not a new game.\nThis is simply a combined book.\nYou will still be able to separate \"basic\" from \"advanced\" game options.\nMuch interior art will carry over from the original books, but new interior art will be featured in addition.\nThis combined book does not replace the current separate books. Those books will remain in print.\nCover Options and Realms of Crawling Chaos\nThere are 4 cover options available to backers.

The printing and shipping expense comes later when you order your print products. The PDF eBook will be delivered by download link.\n\nWHEN YOU PLEDGE\nSelect your reward. If you would like to add one or more copies of the limited hard cover edition of Realms of Crawling Chaos, add $25 to your pledge per copy.\n\nIf you would like to buy more than 4 copies of rule books (any combination of covers), select the Rule book x 4 option, and add $25 to your pledge per additional book.\nStretch Goals\nPeople familiar with my crowd funding projects know that I like to keep them simple. It is easy to over commit and cause unforeseen difficulties in fulfillment. However, I have two reasonable stretch goals in mind as the project launches.\nFunding Level\n\n$8,000 - A solo adventure will be added to the rule book!\n$12,000 - Three full-color landscape art panels!

Enter the world of Harvesters, where badgers, rabbits, squirrels, and otters launch into adventures of epic wonder. Here, the smallest of creatures take on the roles of the greatest heroes: Knights, Druids, Clerics, Rogues, Wizards, and Fighters. Together, they tackle the greatest of exploits, from rescuing the princess to finding lost treasure. You'll find no humans here, only animals. They live their daily lives and do work just like humans do in your world. You may find a rabbit as a local constable, or a squirrel as a baker or a mouse as a black smith.\nArt by Jim Holloway!\nChose from one of five animals to play: rabbits/hares, squirrels, badgers, otters, and mice. Each can be a fighter, wizard, rogue or more!\nHarvesters is a game for all ages. It uses the time honored Siege Engine, an insanely easy to learn game system that focuses on story over mechanics. It generally takes only 15 minutes to pick the how's and why's of a Siege Engine RPG.  \nIf you are familiar with any of our other games (Castles & Crusades, Amazing Adventures, Victorious) you'll be able to pick it up and play it immediately. You can even bring your characters over from one world to the next, and play that star-finding and slightly funny and a little obnoxious racoon in your own game!\nMore on the Animals!\nYou can choose from the following classes: fighter, ranger, rogue, cleric, knight, wizard and druid. In its current edition you can play 1 of 5 animals (More have been added to the game, see stretch rewards below). They are: Badger, Rabbit, Squirrel, Mouse or Otter. Each comes with their own special abilities. VERY Briefly they are:\nBadger: Along with your CLASS abilities, the badger has twilight vision, digging, enmity toward wolverines, primal fury and special languages.\nRabbit: Along with your CLASS abilities, the rabbit has twilight vision, burst of speed, unarmed combat, camouflage, and special languages.\nSquirrel: Along with your CLASS abilities, the squirrel has climbing, fall, camouflage, special languages and is highly skilled with the bow and sling.\nMouse: Along with your CLASS abilities, the mouse has twilight vision, move silently, enmity toward rats and special langauges.\nOtter: Along with your CLASS abilities, the otter has swimming, twilight vision, underwater weapons and special languages.\nHarvesters is a role playing game specifically designed for family play. Using the wildly popular and easy to use Castles & Crusades Siege Engine, players choose any one of the listed animals to play, in any of the classes provided. Designed for children ages 6 and up, Harvesters is the perfect game to bring everyone together. Children delight in taking on the roles of their favorite animals and parents find the role of Castle Keeper easy and fun!  \nWHAT YOUR PLEDGE EARNS YOU\nWe have only two pledges: a digital version or the full boxed set!

It is the heart of a country that includes The Quacking Woods, Black Midge Swamp, Linden Forest and so much more. Here you can wander the wilderness in search of adventure, glory, fame or gold! It all takes place on the western banks of the lake.\nWheat Hollow: The starter adventure begins when we learn that old Farmer Thistledown's farm has been burgled by an unknown beast that haunts the environs of Wheat Hollow. Plunge into the wilderness to face down the villains who bring terror to the good creatures of Wheat Hollow.  \nLost Fang's Gold: Over the last many seasons, the Southern Road has been plagued by the Long Fang rat gang - they have been hijacking goods and stealing every little bit of gold that has passed their way. The surrounding communities have been trying to track them down without any luck. All the clues lead to the Linden Forest, but nobody is overly eager to step foot in it \u2013 beside the Long Fang gang, there\u2019s been tales of nasty critters and the ghost of a long lost wizard. Anyone who is stalwart enough to enter the woods will be richly rewarded - for to find the hideout and all the gold that has been taken will make that person wealthy indeed.\nBlack Tim's Prize: Pandin and his crew sailed north, carrying a map that charted the treasures of Tamias the mad fox squirrel of legend. But the map was not Pandin's, it belonged to a pug-nosed pirate named Black Tim. And Black Tim is none too happy.

Only the most gifted students received instruction within its walls.\nIn time, HighFell was deserted and fell into ruin. Its towers, battlements, citadels, and catacombs became home to all manner of wandering monsters. Adventurers and dungeon explorers began making the dangerous trek up the mountain in search of arcane lore and magical treasures.\nIn recent months a strange green light was seen emanating from the ruins at midnight. The light slowly intensified until a great explosion rocked the Dwimmerhorn. HighFell pulled away from the mountain and now slowly drifts - and occasionally phases in and out of place - over the Great Steppe of The Northern Reaches.\nAre you brave (or foolish) enough to explore the ruins of HighFell - The Drifting Dungeon?\nWHAT IS HIGHFELL?\nThis Kickstarter campaign is designed to support the creation of a new megadungeon adventure called HighFell: The Drifting Dungeon.\nHighFell is designed for Labyrinth Lord but can be played with any Old School Role-Playing Game (or their clones) from the 70s and 80s such as B/X, First or Second edition, OSRIC, or Swords and Wizardry. This scenario can also be played with the DCC RPG with conversions.\nThis new megadungeon adventure is designed to support a medieval fantasy campaign lasting months and years. HighFell will support low-level to high-level play.\nI estimate the final draft to be between 180-250 pages and approximately 500-600 encounter areas. If you are familiar with Barrowmaze Complete, that project was 259 pages in a two-column format (cover to cover). Forbidden Caverns, my follow-up project, was 293 pages, PDF poster maps will be done in both black and Old School blue.\nHighFell opens with a gazetteer that outlines the region in which the adventure takes place. This includes a cultural history as well as the detailing of several small villages that can provide a base of operations for an extended campaign. Like the mounds in Barrowmaze, or the caves in Forbidden Caverns, HighFell also provides some low hanging fruit above-ground to get (wise) players started. The dungeon proper will be leveled in a traditional style, albeit in a floating dungeon context with twists and surprizes. This approach merges my own particular vision with inspiration drawn from modules like The Village of Hommlet, Dragons of Desolation, and The Ghost Tower of Inverness.\nRemember prices are in Canadian Dollars so there's AWESOME SAVINGS for all my peeps in the United States and abroad. If you are unfamiliar, the 2017 average conversion for the year was $1.00 USD = 71 cents CAD. (citation: bankofcanada.ca).\nHere are some past layout samples from Barrowmaze Complete with the cover by ex-TSR artist Erol Otus. The cover and page samples represent the style you can expect with HighFell: The Drifting Dungeon\nCover and Layout Samples\nWHO AM I?\nMy name is Dr. Greg Gillespie. I am an Associate Professor of Popular Culture at a university in Ontario, Canada. I regularly teach a senior undergraduate course entitled The History and Culture of Role-Playing Games (for realz). I am also the author/designer of two very popular Old School megadungeons called Barrowmaze Complete and The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia. You can read widely about Barrowmaze on the internet or on rpgnow.com. Through my professional expertise, I know how to create, manage, and deliver outstanding game projects on time.\nART AND THE OLD SCHOOL\nIn my opinion, crafting an OSR dungeon is about much more than creating an adventure. It is about celebrating the origins of the hobby, the classic fantasy gaming experience, and understanding that dungeon crawling isn't supposed to be about long exhausting combats but rather an equal mix of exploration, combat, and role-play. These values are very important to me and find expression in my design and aesthetics. Just like Barrowmaze and Forbidden Caverns, HighFell will place a premium on amazing art. I will get the band back together including the talents of Cory Hamel, Stefan Poag, Peter Pagano, Trevor Hammond, Stephen Thompson, and others.\nSimilar to past projects for Labyringth Lord Rules, every monster in the monster section will have its own illustration. In the past I have worked with former TSR artists Erol Otus, Jim Holloway, and Tim Truman. I hope to work with these and other TSR illustrators again on this project for a colour cover and also interior art. Erol has already agreed to illustrate the cover for HighFell. We will ensure the colors and aesthetic chosen compliment Barrrowmaze and The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia (so they will all look super swank on your shelf).\nIn terms of mapping, those of you will a close eye will notice my published dungeons are slowly filling in a certain old school wilderness board game map that serves as the basis of my Northern Reaches homegame (we affectionately call it...Greghawk lol). HighFell will continue this tradition as a tip of the cap to Gygax's original homegame.\nCory Hamel and Peter Pagano have created some fantastic preliminary illustrations to give you an idea of the aesthetic we have in mind for a few of the monsters. There's more to come!\nTHROW-INs and ADD-ONS\nLike my other projects HighFell will be detailed, provide depth of engagement, have old school charm, and be super fun for your gaming group. There is no list of stuff to add persay, rather the more funding the campaign receives the more I can invest into and develop the final product. I have an excellent reputation across the interwebs for value-added projects. If you are familiar with Barrowmaze Complete or Forbidden Caverns of Archaia, you already know what to expect.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always potential challenges to any large project.

The number one request, by far, was Fireball Island. After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome!

See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due.

We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

Once enabled, the app plays a soundtrack that randomly and periodically plays three different sounds. If a sound plays while it's your turn, you suffer the corresponding penalty.

We've taken all of those lessons to heart in producing Spider Springs, and I think this is going to be a must-have expansion for die-hard FI fans.

Gamers of all ages!  \nGoing down?\nFrog God Games is proud to present Rappan Athuk, THE DUNGEON OF GRAVES! The Granddaddy of all Megadungeons is back for Fifth Edition! \nMock-up hardcover with actual cover design.\nCharacters will test their mettle against puzzles, tricks, and traps a-plenty; test their grit and steel against monsters and foes lurking around every corner; and at the end of it all awaits the Big Daddy himself, Orcus. These are truly adventures worth winning. \n\u2014 \u201cI once killed a man, just to watch him die\u201d \u2013 a Man in Black \n\u2014 \u201cHold my goblet\u201d \u2013 Orcus\nInterior mockup with actual pages from Rappan Athuk for Fifth Edition.\nRappan Athuk is back for Fifth Edition. Not just back though, it is reloaded with all kinds of new extras including:\nAll new, full color artwork\nThree new levels of the Dungeon itself  \nThree new Wilderness locations, including a three-level castle\n A new three-level satellite dungeon\n A sea-cave of terrible shark-men! A Kickstarter exclusive level released from the Vault of Tsathogga! \nUpdated color maps, available as separate PSD files for online play, are included for all levels\nScores of NPCs and Monsters, dozens of Magic Items and Spells, and the legendary Dung Monster await you! \nArt comparison between 2012 and new edition.\n\nWeighing in at over 500 pages, Rappan Athuk for Fifth Edition is an instant classic in the Mega-Dungeon genre, featuring 100+ keyed and color mapped areas with over 56 dungeon levels, several satellite dungeons (almost 20 additional levels!), the village of Zelkor's Ferry, 22 wilderness areas (ways to die before you ever reach the dungeon) and seemingly countless groups of bandits and monsters that prey on those fortunate enough to escape the halls and caves of Rappan Athuk with treasure in hand!\nWith decades of playtesting and use in campaigns across the globe, the Dungeon of Graves can be a foundation of any campaign or eviscerated into pieces and blended into any campaign!\nMap comparison between the two editions.\nOnce upon a time, there was an idea\u2014an idea formulated by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in 1974 and published in a little paperback book called Underworld Adventures. The idea was simple: it is a lot of fun to go into a dungeon and kill evil monsters. Why is the dungeon there? No one knows. Why do the monsters usually fight rather than talk? We aren\u2019t really sure. Why are there 16 trolls in a cave with a jug of alchemy? No one cares. What do all the monsters eat? We don\u2019t know that either (although \u201cadventurer\u201d probably tops the list). And we don\u2019t have to know these things. This isn\u2019t an ecology experiment, it\u2019s a dungeon\u2014the quintessential setting for pure swords and sorcery adventuring.  \nThis adventure pays homage to that original idea. True, there are opportunities for role playing, but most of this module is dedicated to \u201croll playing.\u201d Hopefully, while exploring the halls of Rappan Athuk, you will recall the thrill of discovery, the terror in your heart when you fought your first skeleton, the joy of rolling your first natural 20, and the despair you felt when that 1 came up for your poison save. This module, Rappan Athuk\u2014The Dungeon of Graves, is nothing more and nothing less than a good, old\u2013fashioned, First Edition dungeon crawl updated for the 5th Edition Roleplaying Game. Very difficult, it should strike fear into the hearts of the most stalwart adventurers. It offers an abundance of traps, tricks, and monsters. We hope that you find this module as fun and exciting as those thousands of players who have ventured into (and not as often out of) the endless caverns and mazes of Rappan Athuk\u2014The Dungeon of Graves. Rappan Athuk is a difficult dungeon. Even the upper dungeon levels should not be attempted by a party of less than six mid-level characters.\nOnly truly veteran players should attempt this dungeon with lower level characters. In light of this, we added the satellite dungeons, including Bill's very first work (from 1977), Tunnels of Terror! This 9-area dungeon was used as the introduction to his campaign and led his players to Rappan Athuk through play. \nRappan Athuk for Fifth Edition has a number of pledge levels to choose from, but be aware that the main pledge levels to get yourself a copy of Rappan Athuk are the $45 for the PDF and $95 level for the hardcover book plus PDF.\nThe pledge levels for this project are:\n$5 Farmers & Shopkeepers -- Show your support and get all the free digital stretch goals that are unlocked PLUS get the opportunity to purchase add-ons in Backerkit! \n$15 Rappan Athuk Upgraded! --Get the PDF file of the new levels of Rappan Athuk that are not contained in the 2012 hardcover release for either Swords and Wizardry OR Pathfinder!

This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\" So, what does this mean to you? Well first, you will note that our books cost a little more than others. That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use. \nWe feel strongly that book production quality is king. After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way). \nIt costs us a lot of money to do this, and our margins are somewhat lower than they could be as a result. Frog God Games stands behind our product (and sometimes on top of it when we need a ladder), and believe that the improved quality and durability of our work is well worth it.\nIf you are a technology person but still find real tabletops to be the sine qua non of role-playing games then, thanks to Fat Dragon Games, we have exactly what you need!\nThese guys are the first name in nerd 3D print files!\nIf you have have been to either NTRPG Con 2017 or GameHole Con 2017 you may have seen the set-up.

No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward!  \nPDF Reward Distribution\n We will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through Backerkit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment.  \nWhen the Backerkit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system.

Even though we had Joe Dever\u2019s detailed descriptions from his books, his elaborate sketches and detailed input, it took a lot of time to get them finalized. Much thanks to the attention to detail by Francesco Mattioli and his beautiful penmanship. The style, the architecture, the flavor of each city is unique and carried through in his beautiful hand drawn maps, inspired by an old medieval map of Bologna.\nWe decided early on to make the maps justice by printing them in poster size. Holmgard is the most detailed map, and thus the largest of the ten. Some, like The Kai Monastery is considerably smaller. However, they all came with the same challenge. How do you keep them as gorgeous as they deserve when packed? Our solution was the specially made map tube. That allows us to roll up the maps instead of folding them, which makes them all so much more beautiful and easy to hang on a wall.\nThe Sommerlund City Maps contains the following 10 maps in full color \u2013 and with the most gorgeous illustrations on their back:\nHolmgard\nToran\nTyso\nAnskaven\nMoytura\nRuanon\nSilvershore\nSommerlund with Detailed Information\nThe Kai Monastery\nThe Sommer Isles\nHolmgard (90 x 66 cm)\nHolmgard was one of the first major settlements established in Sommerlund and became its capital during the reign of King Braern I (MS 3445-3472). In ancient Sommlending, the word Holmgard means \u2018Strong of Heart and Mind\u2019. Holmgard was built with the blood, sweat, and tears of its people as countless battles were fought to secure the lands against marauding bandits from the Wildlands and incursions by raiders from the Darklands. King Braern I chose a perfect location for the Sommlending capital. It had a natural protective harbour, fertile arable farmland, a temperate climate and a reliable source of fresh water. In MS 5000, Holmgard is the seat of power for the King of Sommerlund, King Myranar III. There are two river gates and five grand gates in the encircling city wall. The gates permit easy road access into the capital from all four compass points, but they can be locked down and made totally secure during times of war. The two rivers that enter the city are wide enough to be navigated with ease.\nAnskaven (70 x 50 cm)\nThe City of Anskaven prides itself on being the oldest settlement in Sommerlund. In MS 3434, it was here that the Sommlending made landfall after their Great Voyage across the Northern Void from their ancient homeland islands of Tay Solobo. In MS 5000, Anskaven has the most expansive docks and quayside facilities of any Sommlending city, boasting three dry docks and several shipbuilding and refitting yards. It is home to the Northern Fleet, has a large fishing fleet and processes the cargoes of merchant ships.\nToran (70 x 50 cm)\nThe City of Toran is undeniably beautiful, a marvel of Sommlending architecture and design, a perfect combination of elegance and strength. The foundations of its curtain wall were laid in MS 3448 and completed in MS 3455. It is located on the northern coast of Sommerlund, on the east side of the Toran Sound, at the point where the River Tor flows out into the Kaltesee. It is dominated by a vertigo-inducing tower that serves as the seat of power for the Guildmaster of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star.\nTyso (70 x 50 cm)\nTyso is a flourishing city port situated on the eastern seaboard of Sommerlund, north-east of Holmgard and south-west of Anskaven. Two major overland routes connect it to these cities, and road traffic of all kinds passes regularly along them. Tyso has a thriving fishing industry and benefits greatly from the production of grain and arable food crops in the fertile plains due west, north and south of its coastal location. Tyso has long been a vital base of operations to protect the Holmgulf from attack by sea.\nMoytura (50 x 35 cm)\nThe principal town of the Southland Marches, of significant strategic and economic value to the Crown. The strong stone wall was constructed following the Drakkarim occupation and the Battle of the Pass of Moytura in MS 3799. Moytura is situated on the East Border Turnpike and benefits from the natural protection afforded it by the Wildlands Range to the east, and the Southlund Hills to the north and west. It is within sight of the permanent encampment of the Army of the South.\nRuanon (50 x 35 cm)\nThe principal town and trading centre of the Baronial Province of Ruanon. Originally, it was sited close to the Baron\u2019s Castle. In MS 4552, following the discovery of gold in the Maaken Mines, a mass exodus occurred. Nearly all of the inhabitants of the old town moved east and settled near to the mines. An underground river was discovered and a new town sprang up and rapidly expanded, fuelled by the migration of prospectors and entrepreneurs looking to make their fortune in the mines.\nSilvershore (35 x 50 cm)\nThe first Sommlending settlement on the Kirlunidin Isles. The early settlers subsisted on fishing, sheep-farming and agriculture. The discovery of mineral resources prompted fierce rivalry and led to outbreaks of violence, until a lasting peace was achieved in MS 3470. Silvershore grew steadily over the following centuries. A small fleet was created, made up entirely of caravels. The protective wall has proved its worth, assisting the townsfolk to defend their home from pirate raiders and attempts at conquest by the Vassagonian Empire.\nSommerlund (50 x 70 cm)\nThis is more than just a map over Sommerlund. It also contains a multitude of detailed information about the nation. In the frame, you will find mini maps containing historical maps of Sommerlund down the ages, information on the Kai Protectorate, flags and emblems showing the political hierarchy of the Kirlundin Isles, Southlund Marches, Barony of Ruanon, The Baronial Confederation of Toran, Barony of Anskaven, County of Tyso and finally a Political Map of Magnamund.\nKai Monastery (50 x 70 cm)\nA detailed map over the Kai Monastery, where all young Kai selected get a chance to enhance their gifts and train under the supervision of their teachers. This is the very first location you get to know during Flight from the Dark, and it is the home of the Kai when you play the multi player game of Lone Wolf.\nSommer Isles (50 x 35 cm)\nA map of Tay Solobo, the ancient homeland of the Sommlending that undertook the Great Voyage across the Northern Void. Here you will get a chance to see all of the isles the sommlending stem from, and even get some translations of their language.\n\u00c5skf\u00e5geln is the Swedish publisher of Lone Wolf (Ensamma Vargen in Swedish), so we will not only make this gorgeous map collection available in English. It will be printed in Swedish as well, for all who so wishes. The translations can take a few extra weeks, but we have the best team possible on the project. Choose the Reward Level of the language you want.\nAlla ni som \u00e4lskar Ensamma Vargen och hellre vill ha era kartor p\u00e5 svenska ist\u00e4llet kan sj\u00e4lvfallet f\u00e5 det. Vi kommer att g\u00f6ra v\u00e5rt b\u00e4sta f\u00f6r att f\u00e5 ut de \u00f6versatta kartorna s\u00e5 fort som m\u00f6jligt, men det finns en risk att det tar n\u00e5gra veckor extra f\u00f6r Francesco att l\u00e4gga in alla \u00f6vers\u00e4ttningar i sina kartor.

We only got four different Reward Levels to choose from. Here you can see what is included in each of them.\nWhen your Reward includes one or maps in print, you will get the same maps in PDF as well. If you only select the map of Holmgard, you will get Holmgard in PDF. If you select The Sommerlund Cities, you will get those seven maps in PDF. Finally, if you select the Complete Collection, you will get every map included in PDF as well.\nThank you so much for backing this Kickstarter Campaign. Francesco Mattioli\u2019s maps are gorgeous artwork, made by a skilled cartographer paying attention to details. The extra value stems from Joe Dever\u2019s dedication to Lone Wolf and the world of Magnamund, where all fans of Joe Dever\u2019s epic Lone Wolf saga will recognize the iconic places we present here. We were fortunate to work with Joe on this map project, and the result is in our mind stunning.\nYou get out gratitude for being part of making this beautiful map project take the last step from a wild dream to full color poster size maps in print.\nWe will send you the largest map of this entire campaign. Holmgard is the capital of Sommerlund, and the biggest and most detailed map of them all. It is also well known to all who played the very first book in the epic saga of Lone Wolf.\nThis collection consists of the 7 city maps included in this project, delivered in a special map tube printed for this product. All of the cities have their own style and flare, and the architecture will vary some between them, due to everything from local resources to tactical position, fires, etc. The maps are all printed on separate posters, but the sizes vary. Holmgard is 90 x 66 cm, Toran, Tyso and Askaven are all 70 x 50 cm, while Moytura, Ruanon and Silvershore are 50 x 35 cm.\nThis Kickstarter special Reward Level includes all of the ten maps, delivered in a special map tube printed for this product. Holmgard is 90 x 66 cm, while 5 of the other maps are 70 x 50 and the last 4 are 50 x 35 cm. All of these maps are delivered in a map tube specially made for this project, printed with a unique cover made for The Sommerlund City Maps Collection.\nThe better this campaign goes, the more good stuff we want to send your way. Since this is primarily a campaign to show some of the beautiful art developed for Lone Wolf and Magnamund, the Stretch Goals will come in 3 major types:\n1. Additional maps from Francesco Mattioli \u2013 these are typically smaller maps \u2013 A4, previously made for the Swedish Lone Wolf Roleplaying game. Will be sent to you with the maps\n2. Artwork by Lukas Thelin \u2013 typically printed in A4, still in the same movie poster quality as the maps of Sommerlund Cities. Will be sent to you with the maps.\n3. Commitment to develop new maps for the future. These will not be included in your reward, but you will have something to look forward to.\nAfter receiving some questions on how to go ahead and order more copies of the maps, we have decided to go ahead and make the following add ons available. If you have any other particular thing you would like to see, feel free to contact us and we will see what we can do.\nAdd the total amount for extra maps to your Pledge. After the campaign you will be able to tell us exactly what you want (which maps and language) in survey we send out to you.\nHolmgard Map \u2013 150 SEK\nSommerlund Map \u2013 125 SEK\nKai Monastery \u2013 125 SEK\nSommerlund Cities (7 maps + the special map tube) \u2013 500 SEK\nComplete Collection (10 maps + the special map tube) \u2013 750 SEK\nIf you decide to up your pledge from the Holmgard map to more, please increase your pledge amount with 50 SEK for the additional shipping cost.

We have been active in Swedish roleplaying games since the dawn of time, and involved in a multitude of successful games and magazines over the years, mostly in Swedish. 2018 is the year \u00c5skf\u00e5geln has marked for Creative Fireworks \u2013 the year to launch all of those great gaming titles that have been brewing for a long while. The Sommerlund City Maps are one part of the Creative Fireworks.\nFrancesco Mattioli\nFrancesco Mattioli is a cartographer and illustration artist best known for his work on Lone Wolf and various board games over the years. He is also the lead cartographer for \u00c5skf\u00e5geln\u2019s product line Freeway Warrior \u2013 the four choose your own adventure books by Joe Dever, as well as an upcoming roleplaying game in that post apocalypse setting.\nJoe Dever\nThe acclaimed author and game designer Joe Dever had a lot of gaming titles under his belt, but he is best known for the epic saga of Lone Wolf in choose your own adventure kind of play. The Sommerlund City Maps are all from that wondrous setting Joe Dever created, based on his texts, ideas, sketches and not least detailed discussions as Francesco made the map drawings. Joe Dever will not be around to see these maps in print, but we know for certain that he loved the result and was looking forward to them. Now both Joe Dever and his creations belong to the ages.\nVincent Lazzari\nWhen we at \u00c5skf\u00e5geln started our collaboration with Joe Dever back in 2013, he described Vincent as a real life Indiana Jones. That is a both cool and apt description for a man that has the responsibility to uphold the integrity of all things Lone Wolf. Every detail is fact checked, in order to be consistent with all descriptions from official Lone Wolf material from all platforms. We are fortunate to have Vincent aboard as part of our Lone Wolf team.\nOlle Sahlin\nOlle is one of the true icons of the Swedish Gaming Scene. He worked as an editor at \u00c4ventyrsspel, the company that made roleplaying games as hit in Sweden as Dungeons & Dragons made them in the rest of the world. Before Olle took on the full time gig of editing all of their prestigious titles, Lone Wolf included, he was tagged for the translation of the choose your own adventure books for Lone Wolf that Joe Dever conquered the world with back then. Now Olle has gone full circle, translating Lone Wolf for \u00c5skf\u00e5geln. But rest assured, almost any high profile Swedish gaming project is bound to have Olle somewhere in the credits. He is one of Sweden\u2019s best and most beloved translators, LARP photographers and so much more.\nLukas Thelin\nEven though The Sommerlund City Maps at its core is all about the maps Francesco Mattioli creates for Lone Wolf, we would be amiss not to mention Lukas Thelin. Lukas is an integral part of \u00c5skf\u00e5geln and has been our in house lead illustration artist for many years now. He has made so many stunning illustrations for Lone Wolf over the years that we might just include a few of them as stretch goals or add ons during this campaign.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project the risks are primarily time related. The good news is that the maps are already drawn and the English editions are ready for print, and we have a good idea of how long it will take, from the printer to your home. The Swedish editions will take a few weeks longer, since they require attention to detail when Francesco makes the changes in the text layers. \n\nWe are aware that add ons and stretch goals are possible time sinks, so we will make sure not to add anything that will require a lot of additional extra work at this stage. Since we do not want to slow the delivery down in any way, you will instead be facing possible add ons in the form of additional maps or artwork, already made and thus just as ready for print. Or, if this campaign goes really well, our commitment to stay focused on producing more gorgeous city maps for other parts of Magnamund in the future. If we do, those stretch goals will not affect what you receive for backing us this time around, but it will give you something to look forward to!\n\nThis project is basically printer ready. We are so close to print that we are even prepared to jump the gun if we are off to a flying start. It would be spectacular to give all who come to the GothCon gaming convention in Gothenburg, Sweden, the chance to get their maps signed by Francesco Mattioli. He is our Guest of Honor at the convention.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge SEK 10 or more", "title": "Support", "descp": "You want to support the maps being done.

For some reason it is not the hour long one.  You can view that HERE.\nRundown #14: THANK YOU ALL for your support! Each of you has made this a far better project than we ever hoped and shown once again that Castles & Crusades is the go to RPG! This turned into a fantastic success! Now to get to work! Lots of hard, wonderful work. Thank you again!\nBONUS: This past Saturday we did some warehouse/mailroom cleaning and we have a few hundred Classic Monsters left. Everyone who pledges $75 or more, receives one in your package!\nCastles & Crusades has enjoyed 14 years of continuous publication. In that time, you\u2019ve seen a mountain of books, adventures and supplements roll across your table. Of them all, two stand out as essential (four if you are a die- hard fan): The Players Handbook and Monsters & Treasure. We recently reprinted the Players Handbook (seventh printing) and now, Monsters & Treasure is up for its fifth printing.\nThis time we would like to do something a little different, but to do that, we are going to need your help.\nIn our 14 years together, Castles & Crusades has created a mountain of monsters, and a smaller mountain of treasure: the majority of which lie in published works outside Monsters & Treasure. This makes playing the game a little more challenging, and sometimes, just a little aggravating. CKs (GMs) have to struggle with a veritable mountain of books to track down and find the monster they seek. Some have entered the digital age, using these books on a tablet, or phone or on the TLG Portal and are able to access them a little quicker, but for many the hunt has become time consuming and distracting. Too many RPG books makes for difficult play.\nTime to Tighten Up the Game!\nOur goal is to tighten things up just a little and make one massive reference book for you to use at your table. To do that, we need to round up all the monsters from the extensive C&C library and bring them into one book. This is what we have in mind: Monsters & Treasure, Classic Monsters, Mystical Companions, published adventures like Shadows of a Halfling Hall (looking at you, Bag-o-Bones!), Amazing Adventures Manual of Monsters, Codex Celtarum, Codex Germania, Codex Nordica, Codex Classicum, Codex Slavorum, Haunted Highlands and all the other manifold publications where monsters creep and crawl, fly and charge from the pages and put them into one monstrous Full Color book.\n But Wait? Aren\u2019t you Missing Some books?\nWhat about the Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde? This book will remain its own publication. Though the monsters in it are designed for everyday use, it is tied to the massive Aihrde world setting (Codex of Aihrde and the Players Guide to Aihrde). These need to remain in a book with ease of access for those who brave to adventure in the Lands of Ursal.\nWhat about Tome of the Unclean? This book will also remain its own stand-alone product. We prefer to keep the filth of hell and unhinged chaos of the Abyss in their own realm, to be pulled out when your table slides into the madness of those insane worlds.\nSo why do we need your help? Aren\u2019t you going to reprint the Monsters & Treasure anyway?\nYes. There will be a fifth printing, no matter what. However, we don\u2019t want to simply reprint the book. We want to make it better.\nThis is where you come in. This is going to be a massive task. Right now, Monsters & Treasure is a color book, and needs to remain one. However, all those monsters that we want to include in it are black and white, we need them to be given the full color treatment. This means lots of work for several artists. Monsters that are duplicates or near duplicates will have to be reconciled. This is a lot of work for content editors. Everything will need to be laid out again. This is lots of work for graphics guys! And we want to include more art, some of these pictures need replaced, others need art!\nAll this added content will increase the Monsters & Treasure, 5th printing to a whopping 350 pages, at least.\nIts going to be a herculean task. And to bring it to pass, we are going to need your help!\nTo that end we are calling for a muster of Knights, Gamers, Enthusiasts, Grognards, Trolls and all the great hosts from all across the community to join us, pledge and help us make your game even better!\nWhat Rewards Your Pledge Reaps!\nPledge $19 and Receive\nMonsters & Treasure, 5th Printing, 350 pages (est.), Full Color.

Well, not entirely, as you\u2019re still in the good old days! Brought to you by Castles & Crusades, the first RPG that worked to capture the essence of play that Mr. Gygax and crew managed to do back in the 1980s! Well, we are following in his footsteps again with the C&C Monsters & Treasure Compendium/Binder. This 3\u201d binder will reflect the same quality that all TLG products do, and be manufactured of stout board, with 2\u201d slant d mounts that will hold up to 480 sheets of paper! Its going to be a keeper!\n A Note on the Special Collector's Books\nThese are highly crafted books, with dual embossed foil stamps, raised hubs on the spine, page marker, \"onion\" type page insert, with your names stamped on the front cover. Some of you may have picked up the Players Handbook in the PH7 Kickstarter, for a little less than we are asking here, but as you know from that Kickstarter we ended up upgrading from a different style of book.\nYou can see more about what this book will look like here in this video. You can purchase them here (there are only a few left).\n  We know diving in and supporting the 5th printing of any book\u2026even one that is going to be double its normal size\u2026is a tough decision and a heavy commitment. So, we want to make this worth your while. If you pledge now, and help us spread the word, as soon as we exceed out target goal, we\u2019ll include the following items!\n$10,000: Monsters & Treasure: Achieved!

A digital copy for $45.00 backer level, print and digital for $75+ backer levels.\n $500: Encounter Challenge: 17 Encounters Achieved! For every $500 we raise from this point going forward (starting at $20,000), we will take one monster from the Monsters & Treasure and design and write an encounter for it. We'll compile these into a PDF and release a digital version to everyone at the $19 level and above. If there are enough of them, we'll print it and ship it with your book for those who pledge $45 and above! Each encounter will be 1-2 pages long, include lead-up to, events surrounding, the monster and its peculiar habits, treasure and experience point value.\nBonus Book: Achieved! This past weekend we cleaned out the warehouse and mail room (way overdue) and have found that we have a few hundred Classic Monsters book left. As this book is being absorbed by Monsters & Treasure, we will discontinue it. So everyone who pledges $75 and above receives a free copy of Classic Monsters. It is hardback, black and white and will be on a first come, first serve basis, while supplies last. IF you have already pledges at 75 and above, you are already getting one!\n$22,000: Monster List Supplement: Achieved!

If you are, the quick down and dirty is this: Castles & Crusades is an easy to learn, fast paced, table top role playing game that allows you to play one of 13 classes and any one of these races; dwarf, human, elf, halfling, half elf or half orc. It's stream-lined attribute check system (the SIEGE Engine) is the driving mechanic that allows your character to try almost anything they want to try with a simple role of a d20! It's fun for all ages, requires almost no set up and playable by anyone, almost anywhere (we wouldn\u2019t recommend playing on a surf board for instance).\nIf you want to know more follow this link: Castles & Crusades!\nYou can also join the Society and the Knights of the Crusade by following this link: SOCIETY.\nYou can also download the quick start rules that we released at ReaperCon last year.

(Pledge manager will be available for backers.)\nWe at Black Scrolls Games are working on our products because they make our work easier as a Game Master, and game sessions are more enjoyable with them. We\u2019ve forged all of our experience and knowledge we collected as Game Masters and 3D artists in the past years into these tiles and we hope you will enjoy them at least as much as we enjoyed working on them. If you still have questions, please read the FAQs or write to us in the comment section, we will try to reply you as soon as we can.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nAlthough we funded Black Scrolls Games, our own company, a year ago, we have eight years of experience in the tabletop game business. We know that making a set takes time and releasing a new product is very risky for a small business like us. With the help of Kickstarter, it will be easier for us to manage our work and our other processes because we will see how many customers are interested in our gaming tiles and how many pieces we have to produce exactly. Also, with the help of the comment sections, we will know what you need.\n\nShipping \nIf you select a reward level that contains printed physical tiles, too, then there will be a shipping fee on the tiles. Although the best option would be a free shipping, unfortunately, these tiles are not lightweight things. We use the printing and shipping service of OneBookShelf (we worked with them many times before), that is why we can keep our price low and provide you the best quality in the meantime. \nBecause the tiles will be printed in the U.S., the fee will be the lowest for U.S. and Canadian customers, and a little bit higher for everyone else. If you select a higher reward level and/or more add-ons then we will ship the sets together and shipping fee will be lower per set (compared to separate shipping). \nWe have wider space to manage our revenue with the digital releases, so we can offer free shipping to the U.S. and even Canadian customers (and lowered shipping to everyone else) at higher reward levels!\n  We hope that with your help we can make those products you deserve as a Game Master.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe already released 25 larger and smaller products as Black Scrolls Games since we started our company one and a half year ago and more than 100 products working with other publishers in the past eight years. We managed long projects, too, (some of them were 2 years long) and learned how to deliver on time and how to develop a product from scratch. Our experience of publishing and releasing products will help us to bring these products to you after this Kickstarter campaign. \nFrom the other side, we are working with proven printing and shipping service together which guarantee that there will not be any problem with the fulfillment process. \nMany of the elements of this project are already tested and designed and because of this, we don't see any reason for delay. If anything comes up we will let you know and tell you how we will handle and solve it. \nWe would like to tell you while this is our first self-run Kickstarter project here, it is not the first we helped to design and manage, so this process is not unfamiliar to us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THE WATCHER", "descp": "Welcome aboard!\nSelect this reward level if you would like to support this campaign.

You have made the book far more than we ever had hoped! Trollzah!\nWHAT IS TOME OF THE UNCLEAN?\nTome of the Unclean is a monster source book for Castle & Crusades that includes a host of evil creatures. Divided up along the traditional lines of demons and devils, the Tome includes all your favorites and more. From the Demogorgon to Asmodeus and all the cohorts of hell and the abyss. Also included are a host of devils and demons from the world of Aihrde.\nAll with the amazing art of Jason Walton and Peter Bradley.\nSpecs: Right now the book stands at 112 pages, with about another 10 pages of monsters forthcoming and will eventually retail, in hardcover format, for $29.99.\nPURPOSE OF THE KICKSTARTER\nRight now, we intend to print this book in house as a softcover book. However, we would love to see this book join the rest of our books in the C&C line as a full hardcover book and expand aspects of the book we never intended, turning it from a simple monster book into something much more (see below).\nWHERE WE ARE TODAY\nThe book is largely written and much of the art is finished. We have only a dozen or so monsters to add. Creatures like the Lemure, the Solicitor and others. These will all be added to Tome regardless. One a day for each day of the Kickstarter (weekends might get muddled).\nWHAT WE WANT TO ADD\nSteve took up work on the Tome about mid-stride, while he was re-writing the Codex of Aihrde. What unfolded in the Codex opened up new vistas for him while thinking about the Tome. It occurred to him that the Twin Planes need to be more approachable, to allow players to dig into them and CKs to run them like never before. With that in mind, he's penned notes on just how to do that:\nThe Twin Planes both need to be expanded, with appropriate descriptions and the role of demons and devils that dwell there. We would like to expand on the roles, armies, designs and fortifications of the major devils and demons of both planes.\nJust surviving in the Twin Planes is never easy. How does one find food, water, or shelter? What are the mundane physical aspects of the Twin Planes.\nThe Flora of the Twin Planes, with a discussion on druids.\nClimate and Environs.\nTraveling.\nHow encounters might unfold and what it's like to adventure there. How to bring the chaos, madness, and suffering of hell to the game table.To include effects on the abyssal chaos.\nIt was suggested to him by multiple people, including Mark Sandy and Torsten Olafi, that the book needs a random demon generator, allowing for the chaos of the Abyss.\nWith another great suggestion, Torsten Olafi suggested expanding on the role of demons/devils in the campaign, what are their motivations, how to integrate these highly intelligent creatures into the game.\nPlayable Map of hell.\nABOUT THE TOME OF THE UNCLEAN\nTome of the Unclean has been available in a digital format for some time, or at least sections of it. The book originally penned by Kim Hartsfield and was released in serial digital format. Stephen Chenault (C&C PhB, CKG, all things Aihrde) took over the writing last year, adding a host of demons and devils, some traditional, others of his own creation (echoes of his dreaded campaigns in Aufstrag). He is presently going over the Tome revising monsters (making them a little more powerful), adding content and reorganizing some of the entries.\nMINIATURES\nThis is the prototype of a series of downloadable miniatures designed for your 3D printer, that we are working on. They are based on monsters from Tome of the Unclean. It has a ways to go, but we will get there. This Kickstarter is the perfect place to showcase it and the other nefarious beasts of the Twin Planes! It is available in the $59 and $125 pledge levels.\nLEATHER VERSION\nWe've altered our process from the previous leather versions. We are now included embossing, stamped, marker and more. Our first and recently shipped turned out beautiful. Tome of the Unclean will receive a similar treatment. The $125 level only.\nSUBSCRIBERS AND OBS BACKERS\nCheck your email. Check your email.

You\u2019ve heard about the plan to provide game specifics (\u2018crunch\u2019) for 10 game systems. But what IS the Setting really? What\u2019s there now, and what\u2019s happening soon? Good question. It\u2019s complicated. For the long version click HERE; summary below.\nHistory: This continent is the original home of all demi-humans, who know how to get along with each other and with nature. Humans arrived, tried to conquer the place, but were forced to compromise because they didn\u2019t have an edge. Their realm, Empyrea, has evolved for 3 centuries. Their kings followed a three-prong strategy of cooperation: Minimize technology, promote magic (obeying the gods), Work with nature and the planet for long-term stability and health, and Support knowledge, the arts, and quality of life; avoid misuse of wealth and power.\nPlace: Empyrea is a rectangle. The left side is a coast with sea monsters. Mountains north, with giants. East is blocked, impassible terrain. Deepwood south, with creatures, then tribes, then evil armies -- and they\u2019re planning to visit soon.\nBelow is the primitive digital map that has been available to online players since 1992. Darlene is now rendering it in her unique style, Anna is transforming that into 3D imagery, and Alyssa is detailing cities and towns. Guest authors are detailing locations... Inns, ships, shops, and more.\nOnline campaign map 1992-present\nPeople: The dwur claim the land below, but most dislike sunlight, so noniz handle their surface business. The olve claim the woodlands, and many hobniz are in the gourmet trade near towns. Other \u2018niz (brownies and sprites and many more) are about, as are the Others, various odd monstrous races and variations.\nAction: Upcoming issues of the realm will emerge as time passes. The call to arms will sound, and the fate of the realm will be decided \u2013 perhaps by your characters! Will you run and hide, or are you a real Hero?\nHow To Play\n\nStart: Either your characters grew up here, or they popped in from another place. We\u2019ll provide guidelines for both, and three kits for suggested local character backgrounds (urban, farm, borderlands). In a starting adventure the characters meet and head out seeking fame and fortune.\nYour Stuff: You bring your characters, your game system, your style. Magic, monsters, gods? Use whatever you like. Empyrea will be the backdrop to your stories, just some new names at first. More is there when you\u2019re ready for it.  \nYou seem to be a serious hobby gamer. Consider this a useful tool, a 'second home'. This is a complicated fantasy campaign world, and we can only describe a small part of it in advance. So if you have questions, please post them on any of several sites available. We\u2019re still building that part of things, so bear with us, and help us grow!  \nQueen Nuana and King John IV\n  With the Quick Start Guides (presenting character backgrounds from city, farm, and wilderness life) and starter Adventures, you\u2019ll be playing immediately and learning fast.

As you begin to step onto the trail, you hear a guttural and deep laughing sound followed by a scream.\nAnd thus with such simple beginnings, the characters find themselves embroiled with deific wars which have raged since the fall of the Dragon.\nAn adventure designed for 3-5 player characters between levels 4 and 6.\nWhat is Beneath the Black Moon?

At which point do the pawns control the board or fall, as sacrifice, to protect bishops, knights, kings and queens. Navigating the miasma of Bergholt\u2019s avaricious and power hungry denizens is a precarious balancing over pits of fire and brimstone. Tread carefully for every friend is an enemy and every enemy a friend.\nYour Game, Your World, Inzae, Aihrde\nDavis has created the world of Inzae. This is where all of his adventures take place. Much of that material was released in the first Kickstarter and the primer is below, you can download it for free. Beneath the Black Moon takes place in the city of Bergholt. BUT if you want to play Beneath the Black Moon in your home brew world or even in the world of Aihrde, all you'll need is a city to move the adventure to...but it should be a pretty violent city.\nThe series so far:\nDeath in the Treklant\nBy Shadow of Night\nBeneath the Black Moon\nAbout the Inzae Castle Keepers Screens: These screens are made with our signature board, and consist of 2 two-panels screens.

Forefront is the home of the Agleburstin Konzern. A wooden sign has been hammered upon the lintel above the door. Upon this are painted a shovel and pick, crossed and poised over a talus mound. A row of windows stretches up above the door, all shuttered, as if several one-eye beasts sat atop one another and shut their eyes to the world.\nMinfrit de Balgusser had been expecting someone to answer his request.

Taken completely by surprise, the town\u2019s soldiery scrambled to action, manning the walls, calling the citizens to arms and setting their defenses in order. The desperate actions of these brave soldiers prevented the city from collapsing immediately and the walls and gates were held. But before the sun set, the flaming kettles of oil descended upon the city like a fiery rain. Panic ensued!\nThe characters are caught in a hellish inferno!

Magic and the supernatural laid waste to the creations of humankind, with unearthly beings seeking to take our world for their own. Around every corner hid a new terror to devour the helpless and prey upon the weak. Humanity nearly ceased to exist.\nHeroes rose from the ashes of the old world. Some used magic. Others had advanced technology (sometimes alien in nature), while some unleashed the power of the mind, and still, others wielded dark forces. A mighty kingdom, greater than any other, rose to stem the tide and crush the monstrosities: the Coalition States (CS). Under their banner, humanity labored and fought to stamp out the Rifts-born menaces and carve out a chunk of North America for humans. A domain free from the grip of magic, the supernatural, and the inhuman. They built a towering fortress-city near the ruins of old Chicago, to wall out the magical and monstrous, and called it Chi-Town.\nAll around the mighty edifice grew a massive slum of cobbled together hovels and decrepit shacks, as those seeking the protection of the Coalition States (CS) flocked to the new empire, only to find that the Coalition\u2019s doors were closed to nonhumans and magic users, and unable to accommodate the human multitudes seeking protection. But even here in the lawless slums, life is better than in the savage wilderness all around. So in the \u2018Burbs they wait, with hopes and dreams of entry into the great city.\nAs happens all too often in history, the Coalition States (CS), the self-proclaimed saviors of humanity, armed with high ideals and good intentions, soon turn into a tyrant regime armed with advanced robotics and technology. The Coalition now alternates between exploiting the residents of the \u2018Burbs and persecuting them.\nWith their legions of faceless Dead Boys, armies of killer Skelebots, and packs of terrifying Dog Boys, the Coalition rules the \u2018Burbs with an iron fist. Coalition purges flush out and slaughter D-Bees, magic users and other \u201cenemies\u201d of the Coalition States. They may even raze to the ground entire sections of the slums. Such is Coalition justice.\nWho would dare to stand up against such a power?\nYou!\nIn the Rifts\u00ae Board Game, you and your fellow heroes strive to outwit, outmaneuver, and take down the Coalition forces persecuting one of the \u2018Burbs. You must prevail against overwhelming odds to defeat the campaign of tyranny being run by the CS Mission Director.\nRifts\u00ae the Board Game comes with 20 finely detailed 32mm miniatures depicting the Heroes of Lazlo and Coalition Forces of Dead Boy and Dog Boy squads. Included are all the character cards, tokens and dice required to play, and a unique board game approach featuring a 24 by 30 inch double-sided combat map with a 1 inch grid instead of the traditional, hard game board, allowing you to play on any commercially available map!\nThere are also unique, set-on objective buildings and additional cardboard set-on terrain pieces, and variable maps to provide players an endless array of possible setups. Rogue Heroes Publishing is passionate about games, so we like to offer unique and layered gaming experiences that provide you with options and leave you wanting to play again and again.\nThe Rifts\u00ae Board Game offers three distinct modes of play:\n1. Campaign Mode: 1-5 players take on the roles of the Heroes of Lazlo, a group of valiant champions who defend the innocent and struggle to break the Coalition\u2019s stranglehold on the \u2018Burbs. And one, single player acts as the CS Mission Director, who strives to keep the peace in the violent, lawless slums and take down troublemakers like your heroes.\n2. Skirmish Mode: Two players in pitched competition against each other\u2019s rival squad. Pit the Heroes of Lazlo against the Coalition Army, or a squad of heroes against heroes, or CS forces against CS forces to see which commander is the superior leader.\n3. Head to Head Mode: Two players do away with the board and miniatures to compete in a vicious, face to face card game to see who comes out victorious. A fun, fast, abstract card game that is easy to grasp and takes only 15-20 minutes. Can be played almost anywhere.\nHeroes, can you defeat the forces of the Coalition States?\nCoalition patriots, can you stamp out all resistance in the \u2018Burbs?\nPlay the Rifts\u00ae Board Game and find out!\nHere is the first of the gameplay videos we will be posting to this Kickstarter. A quick overview of the game's core mechanic\n  Rifts\u00ae fans take note:\nIf you have enjoyed playing Rifts\u00ae at any time in your life, you will love the Rifts\u00ae Board Game. Not only do the detailed miniatures feature many of your favorite, iconic characters in dynamic action poses, but the rules, artwork, and method of play truly capture the look and feel of the Rifts\u00ae role-playing game. When you are done with a game, you will feel like you just played the Rifts\u00ae RPG, and in about 90 minutes! Fun to play. A must for collectors and fans of the RPG, and anyone who enjoys an immersive, board game experience.\nThe Rifts\u00ae Origin Story\nRifts\u00ae is a popular pen and paper role-playing game that exploded onto the scene in 1990. It's multi-genre blend of science fiction, fantasy and horror set in an alien, post-apocalyptic, future Earth made it an instant hit. An overnight sensation, the initial press run of 10,000 copies sold out in three weeks. The Rifts\u00ae RPG has since become known to millions of gamers, spawned more than 90 RPG titles, and has been optioned by Walt Disney Pictures for development into a live action movie by Jerry Bruckheimer Films.\nNow, for the first time ever, Rifts\u00ae is being made into a miniatures board game. Brought to life by game designer Carmen Bellaire, long-time Rifts\u00ae fan, and his top sculptors from around the world.\nThis game is endorsed 100% by Palladium Books and Rifts\u00ae creator Kevin Siembieda. \u201cI cannot think of anyone better or more qualified than Carmen to bring Rifts\u00ae to life as a miniatures board game. I have loved everything I have seen from Rogue Heroes. This game is amazing and I hope Rifts\u00ae fans support and spread the word about this labor of love. The Rifts\u00ae Board Game is everything I could have hoped it would be. Best of luck to Carmen and his crew.\u201d \u2013 Kevin Siembieda\n  Based on my experience and research, we will be charging shipping after the conclusion of the Kickstarter based on the actual costs incurred to ship the rewards. We will collect your shipping information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is done to accommodate each of our backers and tailor the shipping cost to each individual backer, as shipping is rarely one size fits all.\nDon\u2019t get caught by surprise later \u2013 look up your region now and add the estimated shipping cost to your pledge! That way, the extra funds will show up in the pledge manager and can be applied to shipping once we know the exact amount it will cost to ship your rewards.\nWhenever we can, we will ship your rewards at our own cost to international hubs who will ship your orders from there. For example, we will ship to our hub in the UK who then ships to our EU backers.\nBelow is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4 kg dimensional weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on the weight and size of your package, and variables such as unlocked stretch goals and more items than just the game and a few Add-Ons.\nUSA: $12-$15 to most States. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 (to most cities)\nUNITED KINGDOM and most of the EU: $15-$30\nEASTERN EUROPE (Poland, Bosnia, Croatia, etc.): $40-$60\nGREECE & TURKEY: $70\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nBRAZIL: $75-$95\nLATIN AMERICA and MOST OTHER COUNTRIES: $50-$80\n*SORRY, WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely mean increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally due to the size of each package.\nPlease note that while we will do our best to get your Kickstarter rewards to you in a very timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before everyone else, or before the product makes it into distribution in your own country, or before it is made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We expect the majority of backers will receive their rewards before the general release, but we cannot guarantee that to 100% of our backers. There may be some who do not. It could take longer for some packages to arrive at one location than another. We hope that the stretch goals, exclusives, and rewards you can get during the Kickstarter help to make up for any such possible delivery issues. If this is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project. Wait until the items are available at retail. We appreciate your support and thank you for your understanding.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges, click HERE.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat makes us different?\n\nWith all Kickstarters come some risks and challenges. While this is the first Kickstarter for Rogue Heroes, I have been an avid backer on Kickstarter since the beginning, either as Rogue Heroes or under my own name, and have seen both the successes and failures in the process. I have also done lengthy research into other Kickstarters as well in an attempt to minimize your risks. The primary areas of risk are:\n\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Our hope is to deliver far sooner than this, but we want a good margin for error in the process. We have taken as many steps as possible to mitigate any potential delays before they happen. Having a large portion of the game assets completed before we launched the campaign (much of which we previewed on our Facebook page), with the rest in development, will allow us to move to manufacturing in a timely fashion. And having the manufacturing and shipping organized, and the costs well in hand, should keep unexpected surprises from cropping up during the process. Please note that due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different parts of the world may receive their rewards sooner or later than others. I hope you understand.\n\nWe have gone to great lengths to ensure reliable manufacturing options, and we set what we believe is a realistic timeline. We at Rogue Heroes believe in sticking to deadlines, and have an even greater belief in transparency. As such, we will ensure our backers are informed about our progress and any challenges we may face every step along the way.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe are happy to refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, you are committed to backing the Rifts\u00ae Board Game. Please remember, you are backing a project, not buying a product. We are a start-up company, so once we have a successful Kickstarter with your help, those funds are committed to paying artists, sculptors, manufacturers, etc., and we will no longer be able to offer refunds.\n\nThis Kickstarter project is being funded in USD, and any refunds will also be paid in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter project, you acknowledge and agree that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change, and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active. We do not anticipate this to be the case, but we reserve that right.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that Rogue Heroes has fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our sole discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us at a later date and we are able to confirm your pledge even though the 8 week window has expired. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and shipping, which can lead to delays, so we need your cooperation and prompt response in confirming your pledge. We do not intend to delay this project, so if your pledge confirmation arrives to us too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nWhen you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your pledge rewards as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for said shipment, and that you are responsible for any and all import duties or any other duties and fees that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring that the address you provide is deliverable by normal methods. Please note we are not able to ship to P.O. boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project. Wait for it to be released to retail outlets.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHTS AND TRADEMARKS\n\n\u00a9 2017 Palladium Books, Inc. All rights reserved, worldwide.

You\u2019ve probably played several of them, if not a veritable host of them. You\u2019ve hacked your way through the simple, and you\u2019ve trudged your way through the complex. They all offer a little something, it's why you keep playing.\nAs you know, all FRPGs are driven by some mechanic. Some are highly intricate, others very simple. You use them to establish the game you want to play. From fast paced to high tactical combat rules to opposed checks on interactions with NPCs. It\u2019s all part of the gaming landscape you\u2019ve helped create.\nI\u2019m the same as you. I\u2019ve tried a host of games and a host of rule sets. My game of choice was always AD&D\u2026I played it even after we released Castles & Crusades. I only stopped my AD&D game when the designers (both regular players at my table) revolted and said no more AD&D until I at least tried C&C once. I reluctantly agreed.\nI\u2019ve never gone back.\n*The above photo was taken at All Things Fun in West Berlin, New Jersey, a fantastic store! Check it out if you are in the area.\nIt\u2019s Your Game! Take it!\nYou\u2019ll find with C&C that the game is easy to play, but more importantly is its versatility. You can take your house rules and drop them right on top of the C&C mechanic (the Siege Engine) and keep on playing. You are in control. Take the advantage/disadvantage system from 5E and use it with C&C. There\u2019s nothing stopping you.\nWhat\u2019s even better, because the whole game is driven by attribute checks that have only loose guidelines, the game master chooses what attribute check the player rolls. If they want the wizard to swim better, make the character roll an intelligence check to swim the river. It\u2019s your game. Take it.\nHow does the Siege Engine Work?\nYou are already familiar with Castles & Crusades.\nYou\u2019ll find the same classes, races, attributes and many of the same monsters as in most other games.\nTo succeed at any action, you need to make an attribute check (unless the CK deems it doesn\u2019t need one)\nThere are two types of attributes: Primary & Secondary\nPrimary attributes have a base chance to succeed of 12 on a d20. Secondary have a base chance to succeed of 18. The CK adds a challenge level based on hit dice and other circumstance. The character adds their attribute bonus and level to their roll.\nYou are playing C&C.\nIt's fast, versatile and open. Allowing you to make it as complex or as simple as you desire.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nIt\u2019s easy to use for the whole community. This cuts out you having to set up accounts on the TLG website. Reserve your copy today with one easy step.\nENJOY PETER BRADLEY'S ART? Check out his coloring book! On Kickstarter NOW!\nCollector's Cloth Edition\nWe are going to print a collector's edition, signed and numbered on onion skin inside the book. Produced with a Skivertex Vellin Cloth Cover, with Embossed titling. Also has an embossed silk screen depicting art from many editions on the cover, a ribbon marker and your name stamped on the front cover!\nAbout the Alternate Cover\nWe are going to give Jason Walton a shout and to do a new, alternate cover for us. He's the guy who brought you this cover:\n What is Castles & Crusades? \nCastles & Crusades is one of the longest running Table Top RPGs on the market today. Castles & Crusades is a fantasy role playing game where players create characters based on the very simple easy to follow rules of the C&C Players Handbook and conduct adventures run by a game master, the Castle Keeper. It's fun, easy, and offers countless hours of entertainment from role playing to magic wielding and sword swinging...all from the comfort and safety of your dining room table! Learn more HERE!\nA Little Background\nThirteen years ago, in 2004-2005, we launched what was then a ground-breaking fantasy RPG. Going against a decade of game design, that saw fantasy RPGs develop ever more intricate rules systems, we decided to turn the horse around. Desiring a simple, fast-paced game we developed an attribute check system (first called the EGG system, but later renamed to the SIEGE Engine) that was just that. Everything non-combat related was solved by attribute checks, frequently chosen by the Castle Keeper (GM). What followed was an insanely easy game, that one could learn to play in a matter of minutes. It allowed for rapid play, particularly in combat situations, but more importantly by releasing the constraints of rules it opened up the table to the imagination of all concerned. Now, anything was possible.\nSix printings later\u2026not including the starter sets, White Box, Flip Books and countless digital copies sold\u2026Castles & Crusades is going stronger than ever.\nWe\u2019ve sold out of the 6th printing and moving on to the 7th printing.\nThis book will go to print in the next few weeks, but we are here offering it to the Kickstarter community for as low a price as we can manage. This allows our old guard to pick it up if they desire, and new people to buy in if they\u2019ve always wanted to or are just hearing about us. It\u2019s our way of thanking the gaming community all for these years of support!\nWHAT\u2019S CHANGED?  \nThat is the inevitable question that many long-time fans are going to ask. Almost nothing. We\u2019ve corrected a few typos, put some class lists in alphabetical order and moved a little text. But beyond that this book will be the same book as the 6th printing. The cover itself is part of a larger 4-panel piece that includes the Castle Keepers Guide, Monsters & Treasure and Adventurers Backpack, so changing it is not in the cards.\nHowever, to mark this momentous occasion we are offering an all Cloth Edition of the book.

Please Note: We try to keep shipping costs at a minimum. While this is mainly a book oriented Kickstarter, any add-ons or extra books or merchandise (if any is offered) may cause the shipping price to rise, especially if the order is international (out of the US). Please contact productsupport@trolllord.com if you have any questions about shipping before you pledge.\nTrack the Players Handbook on Kicktraq!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLarge books such as this one are hard to print and bind and we have to choose our printers with care.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges we face is creating such a large book and maintaining the quality of the printing and binding. In order to do this, we must find a printer with the knowledge and capabilities to execute a book of this size and have it look polished and professional, something we take great pride in. This will cost more than the usual printing so Kickstarter becomes essential in raising enough capital to give this book the quality it demands and deserves.\n\nWe are confident that with a successful Kickstarter we can bring this product to the world not only as a great resource, but also as a great looking book.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Show Support", "descp": "Show your support for bare-knuckles role playing!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "PH with Standard Cover", "descp": "A print and digital copy of the Players Handbook, 7th printing, with the standard cover (the one on there now). *Shipping charged at end of Kickstarter if applicable.

Like their predecessors, the highly acclaimed Dunes of Desolation and Fields of Blood, Mountains of Madness and Marshes of Malice are black and white, 225+ page supplements that build upon real world details and their gaming applications to provide all of the essentials and extras to run campaigns set in one of these remarkable biomes.\nThese huge Tomes are all well-researched and use real-world information tailored to meet fantasy roleplaying rules that create a feel of \"really being there\" in each terrain type. For example, we engaged a professional mountain guide, Nate Paul, to work with us on Mountains--so the travel and skill rules were in part developed by a real-life mountaineer!\nThe two new books include:\nMountains of Madness\nMountains of Madness naturally focuses its attention on mountains, the mighty, stone behemoths that soar into the heavens. In particular, it details the Stoneheart Mountains, renowned as the spine of the Lost Lands Campaign Setting and the backdrop for other legendary adventures including The Slumbering Tsar Saga and Sword of Air, all from Frog God Games. \nMarshes of Malice\nMarshes of Malice examines the semi-aquatic world that straddles the open seas and the wholly terrestrial with special emphasis on previously unexplored or underdeveloped regions in the Lost Lands Campaign Setting. Both supplements introduce new natural and manmade hazards, innovative feats, equipment, alchemical substances, magic items, spells and archetypes that can aid or hinder brave mountaineers aspiring to conquer the majestic peaks and intrepid adventurers endeavoring to tame the feral wetlands. Wondrous illustrations accompany the frightful, new denizens that call these lands home. \nWhat you get inside\nMountains of Madness features an expansive prologue that describes the rustic town of Miners\u2019 Refuge along with four interconnected adventures that take characters from 3rd to 9th levels and flesh out the Stoneheart Mountains region with extensive details about the fabled Dwarven strongholds of Erod Flan and Tyr Whin. Although designed as an adventure path, the quartet can be run independently as well. \nMarshes of Malice, on the other hand, include three completely autonomous adventures that take the characters on terrifying journeys into the depths of the bleakest swamps and the bottomless chasm of the darkest souls. These horrific tales occur in the dreaded Dyrgalas Fens, which appeared in the Quests of Doom adventure \"Death in Dyrgalas\", the Dragonmarsh Lowlands, which is touched upon in Rappan Athuk and the introduction of the previously unexplored Wytch\u2019s Bog. Despite the fact that the adventures take place in locales that appear in the Lost Lands Campaign Setting, the extensive scientific and game mechanics regarding these two environments can be applied to all mountainous and wetlands campaigns regardless of their setting. Likewise, with a few minor adjustments, the adventures can be effectively run anywhere.  \nWith the release of these two sourcebooks for Pathfinder, GMs and players alike can incorporate a wealth of knowledge and groundbreaking ideas to breathe fresh imagination and insight into any excursion to the summits of the highest peaks and the bowels of the dreariest swamps. All it takes is one courageous first step. \nSo pledge to today help Frog God Games provide your players some unsafe spaces!        \nADDED BONUS\nAt funding all backers get a the PDF that started it all, Glades of Death!\n\nA Druid's Revenge Can your PCs make it through the forest on the way to their final destination? Will they be ensnarled in the mystery of dreaded ghoul wolves, or become entangled in a battle between druids and insects that is slowly destroying a small logging village in their way? Are your PCs strong enough to enter the Canyons of Arcuri? Perhaps, they are even bold enough to enter the private, forested demiplane of the mad druid Niavark.  \nRead the Leaves Make PCs fear the forest! Glades of Death\u2122 contains new spells, new feats, and a new look at skills and how to use them in the wilderness. Guidelines for the rapid creation of new fantasy forests are also provided along with new monsters and four generic forest-based adventures designed to help bring a campaign out of the dungeon and into the wilderness.  \nGetting Your Rewards\nPDF Reward Distribution  \nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your pdf; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via email to backers. Our process is what gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment.  \nShipping for Physical Products \nThe shipping is collected in Backerkit. When our backerkit site for the project is ready you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards and checkout through their system. It is during this checkout that shipping cost is calculated and charged. \nAdd Ons\nOther books from the Perilous Vistas seemed appropriate, so we decided to discount the existing ones!\nFields of Blood-$25 hardcover and PDF, $10 PDF only add-on.\nThe endless fields of waving grains and scrub brush\u2014many see them as featureless wastes, places to be crossed in a journey with little to catch the eye or divert the attention, but these vast seas of grass play home to many terrible beasts, deadly challenges, and amazing tales all hiding just beneath the thin veneer of featureless expanses. Fields of Blood takes a close look at these lands often taken for granted as realms of excitement and mystery and injects them with new life.\nWith cultural elements and traditions taken from the American Great Plains, the African Savannah, and the Mongolian Steppes, Fields of Blood provides new rules for plains environments, hazards, travel, skills and feats, equipment, monsters, deities, spells, and archetypes. In addition, Fields of Blood includes three ready-to-play adventures for introducing your players into the endless expanse of the grassy sea with \u201cFeast of Fury\u201d, \u201cRed Wedding\u201d, and \u201cMadness Grows\u201d.\nFields of Blood provides rules and options for any plains campaign. While its adventures can easily be set in any plains campaign, they are, however, official Lost Lands setting adventures intended for characters of levels 1\u20137+. They include plains terrain, dungeon, and village encounters and are written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.\nDunes of Desolation-$25 hardcover and PDF, $10 PDF only-add-on.\nIn a land where the sun relentlessly bakes its sandy surface, water is king. In the desert, the life-sustaining fluid is more valuable than the most precious metals, desirable gems and mightiest weapons. Most adventurers believe that the scarcity of water makes the desert an\ninhospitable place devoid of life, riches and challenges.\nThe incessant glare of a distant, roiling inferno, the intolerable heat of day, the monotonous expanses of sand and the fierce winds are enough to break the will of any man or beast, but natives and experienced adventurers know that the dunes conceal many secrets and treasures. Scratch a few feet beneath the surface and the wondrous ruins of lost cities miraculously come to life. Some of these settlements succumbed to the natural forces of the desert, while vengeful deities, demons or spirits condemned others to an eternity beneath the dunes.\nMarvelous oases abounding with life and mystery also dot the forbidding landscape. Those fortunate enough to discover these refuges are delighted to find fresh water, but danger often lurks amid the lush vegetation or beneath the surface of the water. Those intrepid souls hardy enough to brave the elements and explore the wonders of this harsh terrain are well-rewarded for their efforts.\nDead Man's Chest \n($40K stretch goal for hardcovers to be unlocked)-$28 Softcover/$10 PDF unless we hit the hardcover stretch goal!  \nNo place offers more adventure than the ocean. No dungeon is as deep, no jungle as full of exotic and dangerous life. Most folk spend their entire lives on dry ground, unaware that entire civilizations thrive beneath the waves, sometimes far more ancient and steeped in mystery than any on the world's upper surface. Though player characters (PCs) have long grown familiar with the air-breathing world above, seldom do they venture into the depths, and when they do, they discover wonders they never dreamed existed. The ocean offers a venue for adventure that is at once alien and appealing. Strange things exist down there, as perilous as they are compelling. Dead Man's Chest lays bare the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it. Within these pages are detailed rules for ship movement, as well as guidelines for underwater exploration, and three complete maritime adventures. At last there is a comprehensive source for sailing and the sea-packed with over 100 new magic items, monsters, feats, prestige classes, and spells.\nRazor Coast Party Pack Plus Dead Man's Chest!\nThe Razor Coast Party Pack (includes the softcover Pathfinder Dead Man's Chest) - $120\nIncludes the following-\nRazor Coast Hardcover Book  \n4 copies of the Freebooters Guide to the Razor Coast  \nHeart of the Razor Hardback Book\nPLUS Softcover Dead Man's Chest (this is Kickstarter exclusive and does not come with the party pack at the web store for the same price)\nFire as She Bears  \n$9 Hardcover, $5 PDF Add-on\nBuilding on the winning entries of a contest to create new rules, authors Lou Agresta and John Ling, with contributions from James MacKenzie, wrote a book to empower players and GMs to fight cinematic \u201cMaster and Commander\u201d style ship battles in Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry that stay true to the spirit of history and Age of Sail realities. This complete 96 page subsystem of ship-to-ship combat, includes over 35 new magic items for characters and ships, new feats, new uses for familiar skills, new weapons and equipment, new spells, and best of all? Roll up and equip an Age of Sail warship just like you\u2019d design a new character \u2013 in as little as 30 minutes.\nStoneheart Valley $13 Hardcover/$10 PDF\nFrom Bill Webb and Clark Peterson's home campaign comes the old-school setting of The Lost Lands: Stoneheart Valley. For over a decade, fans of Necromancer Games and Frog God Games have been asking to see the world behind the adventures. And at long last, here is where it all began, in the Stoneheart Valley near the town of Fairhill. This mini-campaign was originally presented to the fans of Necromancer Games in three separate modules: \"The Wizard's Amulet\", \"The Crucible of Freya\", and \"The Tomb of Abysthor\". Frog God Games has taken the full series from the 3E version plus supplemental material previously available only online, and converted it all to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game system.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous Kickstarter programs in the past, including projects involving printed cards.

I started with the 1982-1994 carded figures (which can be viewed on the Yearbook page) and then moved into documenting the vehicle boxes, catalogs and offers, books, newsletters, puzzles, posters and more. All are accessible via the print and licensed tabs at 3DJoes.\nOnce the art is photographed and scanned, we digitally restore these files by removing creases, tears, price tags, hand writing and the like to create as clean an image as possible.\nDigital Art Restoration\nEnter 3DJoes posters.\nBefore long, I had collected and documented enough carded figures to start making posters. Back in 2014 I ran a kickstarter and funded printing of 3 new posters! These posters are still for sale, and proceeds help cover the $1,750 a year it costs to run 3DJoes. You can pick these up for $10 each through this kickstarter!\nEnter Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe, Volumes 1 \u2013 3!\nI fielded countless requests for a G.I.Joe art book since the first carded figure poster debuted. Most often people tell me they love the posters but they are running out of wall space. So, over the last two years I ran three kickstarters to print Accufoil Softcovers of Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 1 (1982-1983), Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 2 (1984-1985), and Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 3 (1986-1987)!\nCollecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volumes 1\u20133 (1982-1987) with Accufoil covers\n We delivered all three volumes on time as promised, thanks in large part to some fantastic print vendors and my local Triangle Joes who pitched in and helped me with fulfillment.\nTriangle Joes to the rescue!\nNow it\u2019s time for Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe, Volume 4!\nFlash forward a few months and thanks to Chad Hucal, we are ready to go to press with Volume 4! Volume 1 featured 62 unique pieces of art, Volume 2 featured 95, and Volume 3 featured 126. Volume 4 is bigger than ever, featuring 147 unique pieces of art! You can preview the entire book here. \nThe cover will once again be card stock with an AccuFoil print, and the 80# pages will be saddle stitched, so the two page 11x16\u201d spreads can lay flat and art will not be lost to the gutter! You\u2019ll be glad to know the price hasn\u2019t changed, we\u2019re holding the line at $35 for the Accufoil Softcover.\nCollecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 4 (1988\u20131989) is ready to print!\n  The 3DJoes poster series continues!\nNow that all of the 1988-1989 artwork has been restored, it is time to continue the 3DJoes poster series! We will produce two new 24\u201dx36\u201d posters, one featuring the figures and another featuring the vehicles.\n1988-1989 Vehicles and 1988-1989 Figures\nHow about some pristine Catalog Art posters too?! \nThese two posters are very special. They feature the 1986 and 1987 catalog art like you\u2019ve never seen them before! We were able to secure two original Kodak Ecktachromes of the original catalog paintings. These are basically two super high resolution transparencies used back in the analog 80s to deliver high resolution artwork. We\u2019ve scanned these Ecktachromes and restored the scans to remove dust and any other unintended artifacts. The resulting posters will be a centerpiece of your collection.\nCatalog Art from 1986 and 1987!\n  STRETCH GOAL! Blast-off with a life-sized Defiant!\n Blast-off with a life-sized Defiant offset lithograph print! \nMany of you have asked for a life-sized Defiant box art print, so that's what we are going for next! The life-size Defiant print will measure 28.5\u201dx47\u201d just like the original box art. It will cost $4,558 to print. Add in 25% for shipping and 10% for Kickstarter fees and we'll need to raise another $6,276.25 to get there. Oversized lithographs are terribly expensive, but we are happy to try to make this happen. If you want to see this poster come to life, add $30 to your poster pledge and tell all of your like-minded friends about this project. Thanks and Yo JOE! \nPROJECT EXPENSES:\n$7,605 Volume 4 (offset interiors, foil cover, bagged, 650 copies) + 1/4 shipping + 10% Kickstarter fees = $10,456.88\n$5,792 Four 24\u201dx36\u201d posters (1000 of each) + 1/4 shipping + 10% Kickstarter fees = $7,964\nGOAL: $18,420.88 \n$4,558 Life Size 28.5\u201dx47\u201d Defiant (1000 prints) + 1/4 shipping + 10% Kickstarter fees = $6,276.25\nSTRECH GOAL: $24,688.13\n*Surprise* Your reward for scrolling to the end is the stretch goal spoiler! I'm setting the goal for this Kickstarter at $18,420, and have offered rewards featuring the first goal's deliverables. If we approach the third goal, all poster backers will be allowed to add a life sized Defiant poster to their order for just $30!  \nPlease have a look at the rewards, back this project today, and tell your friends to jump in too.\nThanks and Yo Joe!\nCarson", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges \nI have already successfully produced the Volume 1 book and six 24\u201dx36\u201d offset posters with two very reliable local vendors. I do not foresee any issues with getting all three of these new posters and books produced quickly and to the highest quality.\n\nTo see the progress of a previous poster, have a look at this album: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/3DJoes/photos/?tab=album&album_id=569139369809294\n\nA note about quality: these posters, like the six previously produced, will be professional grade. You will not be disappointed! Check out the specs below and my eBay feedback.\n\nPaper details: All 3DJoes posters are printed on 65 lb. sterling premium gloss paper stock. According to my printer, 65 pound paper is the thickest you can use and still roll them without creasing or damaging. It wont easily crease, pinch, or wrinkle. These posters are definitely frame worthy, but the paper is thick enough that if you just want to tack them up, that will work too.\n\nPrinting details: We use a four color printing process (CMYK), not digital. Four color prints are much higher quality than digital laser prints. To see behind the scenes at the printer, check out my \"3DJoes of the 80s\" album on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pg/3DJoes/photos/?tab=album&album_id=488035281253037\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "\"1988-1989 POSTERS\" (vehicles+figures)", "descp": "The 3DJoes poster series continues!

However, one night the situation changes when a storm wrecks a vessel near the island, with a human infant being the only survivor.\nIn this child the Shianti see a chance to help the people of Magnamund without breaking their vow to Ishir, and they raise the boy in the arts of magic, giving him the name Grey Star: the star as the symbol of hope, and grey for the white-grey streak the boy has in his dark hair.\nOnce his training is complete, Grey Star is sent out to retrieve the Moonstone, an ancient Shianti artefact, from the Daziarn, for only with its power can Shasarak be defeated.\nSOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 1) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\nThe first book of the series details Grey Stars travel to the Shadakine Empire and his desperate attempt to find a guide to lead him to the Shadow Gate.\n\nNow, more than 30 years later, this first gamebook is back with this deluxe, enlarged, hardback Collector's edition by Megara Entertainment we hope to fund on Kickstarter.\nAs the original pocket-sized interior 1985 illustrations by Paul Bonner could not be retrieved from the original publisher or from Paul himself, we decided at Megara Entertainment (with Joe Dever's blessing) to contact the mythical (and original) Lone Wolf artist Gary Chalk to re-illustrate the whole gamebook at a higher resolution (the Collector's Edition being larger).\nTo our pleasure, he agreed to re-illustrate entirely the book with all-new  interior drawings and a brand new cover for this Collector's Edition.\nThe result is truly amazing.

We have added a special bonus gamebook adventure at the end of this Collector's Edition, written by Scriptarium and approved/revised by Joe Dever & Ian Page.\nSo, to sum up, our deluxe gamebook will have the following features:\nLarge book size (same than for our other gamebooks previously published on our webstore or on Kickstarter) : 17 cm x 24.4 cm\nHardcover 105 gsm interior paper\nBrand new black-and-white interior illustrations by Gary Chalk, including fillers\nBrand new cover by Gary Chalk\nA brand-new bonus adventure.\nAll the up-to-date revisions of the gamebook text by Joe Dever, Ian Page and his team of experts, included in this ultimate edition.\nThank you for your support!\nYours,\nMika\u00ebl Louys\nGeneral Manager & Founder, Megara Entertainment\nSOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 280) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  SOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 18) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  SOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 350) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 61) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 119) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 220) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 259) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  SOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 161) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 200) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMegara Entertainment has a solid experience of publishing Collector's hardback gamebooks, with already many released gamebooks and more soon.

Leather copy of the book\nWhat is the Adventurers Backpack?\nThe Castles & Crusades Adventurers Backpack represents the largest expansion of the Castles & Crusades RPG since its inception with what is essentially a second Players Handbook and a deck of Equipment Cards.\nThe Castle Keepers Guide delivered a voluminous amount of gaming material to the CK. The Codex of Aihrde and Players Guide to Aihrde brought the world of Aihrde to life in amazing detail for all players.\nBut now The Adventurers Backpack is presented to the player with content to match -- if not exceed -- that of the original Players Handbook.\nNew classes include:  archer, avatar, oathsworn, magic user, thief, urban ranger, primal druid, milesian bard and more!\nNew spells, for all classes whether in the ABP or the PH, based on an old twist. Equipment revisited. Other notes and observations all designed, we hope, to speed up your game. With the main game book come the Equipment Cards, all designed to speed things up and make game play all that easier.\nFunding Goals: This project has already funded and will appear as a 150+ page full color hardback book. If we hit $26,000 then we'll expand the Equipment Deck by 2 Joker Cards, these will be signed and personalized with boons and discounts on them (Kickstarter backers only). $59.00+. \nNever  Played C&C?

Trollzah!\nMore on the Adventurers Backpack\nThe Adventurers Backpack first appeared in the C&C Black Box on the 40th anniversary of Dungeons and Dragons. In it we presented some new spells, and some new classes. This was only a teaser for future endeavors.\nThe future has arrived. Stephen Chenault finalized the content for the ABP September, 2016 and enlisted Peter Bradley to begin working on the art. What the book holds, and promises, is both a massive expansion of player-based content (classes, spells and more) as well as a new look at equipment and with this new look comes a new tool: the equipment cards.\nWhat is in the Adventurers Backpack?\nBack in the day, we played AD&D like there was no tomorrow, often 2-3 times a week. When the AD&D Unearthed Arcana came out, it gave our game a rush of adrenaline. The new content\u2026classes, spells, equipment, etc\u2026offered just what we needed, just when we needed it. That is the goal of the Adventurers Backpack. Castles & Crusades has been out for 12 years, and as good as it is, it could use a jolt of adrenaline.\nThe Adventures Backpack will include the following\n13 new classes\nNew Non-derivative spells\nA new approach on counter spells and canceling spells\n34 different backpacks offerings an easier and faster way to equip\nA fresh easier to use approach to Unarmed Combat\nMagic Items for classes who have few to choose from\nA look at the Archetype\nThe End Game, why old characters never die\nA note on the spells. The spells presented in the ABP will be non-derivative spells (all new, not based on others) and many will follow the level-growth concept that drives the SIEGE Engine. In other words, there will be far more spells that spell-casters can use at lower levels, but that grow in power as the caster grows in power.This gives the spell-caster far spells to use when they begin, making play much more enjoyable.\nWhat are the Equipment Cards?\nDuring the creation process equipping a character can be a time-consuming task. To speed the process up, the ABP will include 34 different backpack options that include basic and expert dungeon backpacks, basic and expert overland backpacks and class related backpacks. Each backpack comes equipped with what your character needs to plunge into a world of adventure.\nFor ease of access, we\u2019ll supply a deck of cards (34 right now) with all the backpacks and their contents set before you. All you need to do is buy weapons and armor, and a backpack and your character is equipped and ready to go! There will be multiple of some cards, allowing for repetition between players.\nPLEDGE LEVELS AND REWARDS\nPledge Levels\n$1: Join the fun.\n$20: PDF of the Adventurers Backpack\n$40: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack\n$59: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack, your name in book, Deck of Equipment cards, Dice Pouch\n$150: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack, your name in book, Deck of Equipment cards, Dice Pouch, Backpack, lapel pin, t-shirt, water bottle, digest version of the book\n$200: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack, your name in book, Deck of Equipment cards, Dice Pouch, Backpack, lapel pin, t-shirt, water bottle, digest version of the book, Leather copy of the book\nPledge at $59.00 and above and receive this dice pouch:\nPledge $150 and above and receive this back pack and the contents within:\n   STRETCH REWARDS\nSTRETCH REWARDS EXPLAINED!\n$11,000 Print ABP: Achieved!

This will cost more than the usual printing so Kickstarter becomes essential in raising enough capital to give this book the quality it demands and deserves.\n\nWe are confident that with a successful Kickstarter we can bring this product to the world not only as a great resource, but also as a great looking book.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Novice", "descp": "Build your own package!
