[{"backer": "JustinChung.com", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "From TactiCouture\u00ae, The World's First Utilitarian Fashion Line, we present...\n The Ballistic Scarf\u2122 \n- Warm | Lightweight | Super Tough -\nThe most durable covert scarf ever. Specially woven, the Ballistic Scarf\u2122 feels like soft jersey knit yet with an insanely high tensile breaking point.\nThis incredibly beautiful scarf is for the always on-the-go, active person. This isn't for your average, couch-sitter.  Secret Service Agent? Weekend warrior? Skier? The Ballistic Scarf\u2122 will blend right in while increasing your level of protection and readiness.\n Breathable: Shields from the sun, dust storms, or filter out pollution/smog.\n Wrap-up tight; instant warm and protection from drafty airports, chilly airplanes, or cold restaurants.\n Fashionable: Slimming, tactical black color goes with any outfit.\n Innovative: The tactical multitool of scarves.\n Perfect gift: For EDC, motorcyclists, hunters, hikers, soldiers, travelers, and tactical gear junkies.\n Light-weight: Only 4-5oz.\n Super High Quality: No odor, no molting.\nThis is the ultimate EDC tactical scarf. \nBeautifully stitched & hemmed.\n The Ballistic Scarf\u2122 from TactiCouture\u00ae\n Urban design: Designed with urban-chic fashion in mind, male or female, the Ballistic Scarf\u2122 is designed for the minimalist, on-the-go warrior. \n All styles, high-class or casual: Whether you're an urban operator battling the city office or exploring the arid jungles of Nicaragua (literally field-tested in Nicaragua), survivalists say \"You need a piece of quality, dependable cloth in your survival kit.\" \n Hidden protection: Blend in with style without compromising your readiness.\n Slimming: Tactical black shade absorbs low-light for that night out on the town. \n Toughest Scarf on the Planet: The Ballistic Scarf\u2122 is incredibly strong--far tougher than traditional cotton or wool scarves. While a knife will eventually get through any material (depending on aggressiveness of course), we designed something that will buy you some time and protection... even if it means another 2 seconds to escape. \nTesting the breaking point\n Comfortable: surprisingly soft material is woven to maintain elasticity to adapt to movements. \n Ultra-strong material: We've put this stuff through tons of stress tests.\n Minimalist: no dangling tassels to get caught. Fully hemmed with reinforced stitching. Oder resistant. Does not shrink.\n Dimensions: 63x15 inches (160 x 38 cm)\n Weight: 4-5oz. \n Weave: Medium. \n Stitching: Reinforced, zig-zag (so it stretches). The hemming uses the same fiber thread.\nWe have something: We have committed over 2 straight years of research and testing to find the perfect fabric that combines both tough qualities without anyone ever knowing it. \nTougher than your conventional scarf\nCompared side-by-side, The Ballistic Scarf\u2122 always outlasts the competition.  \nCut-testing a Top Selling (Amazon.com) Marino Wool Scarf\nCut-testing The Ballistic Scarf\u2122\ufe0f - *Exact same pair of scissors\n From the makers of the Tacticlip, Multi-tool hair clip.

We thank you!\nWe are here to serve and deliver epic, one-of-a-kind designs on-time with superior Kickstarter backer service. \nSummiting Mt Rainier with the Ballistic Scarf\u2122 Version 1.8 - This version proved to be too heavy and thick for daily use, but holy smokes was it warm.\nWarm, lightweight, minimalist.\nAfter over 2 years of development, we are pleased to give our dear fans first access to our Ballistic Scarf\u2122. This Kickstarter is our final push to production, and we'd love nothing more than for you to join us again. It is always an honor and thank you! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMANUFACTURING UNKNOWNS: As with our previous campaign, we factor as much manufacturer error in as possible. We have tested (and re-tested) the Tactical production process to ensure delivery on time at the high quality standards you expect. That said there is always a risk in the manufacturing world; in times past we have rolled with the punches as we experience a sudden change in raw material pricing, customs delays, and lost shipments. And we still delivered on-time.\n\nOUR ANSWER: We have baked in failsafes and anticipate error--as long as the outcome is increased quality. Our goal is to deliver early and above what we promised. That said, we thank you for being gracious when the inevitable curveball happens.

Unsupported tests however are a different story, if you bundle the test fabric ( let's say two or three layers) as it would sit on your neck, it became quite difficult to cut with force let alone with jabs and slashes, also dulled an aus8 shaving sharp knife to a mediocre edge with visible minimal rolls, last but definitely not least, fire resistance is REALLY good, stood very well against a butane jet lighter, from point blank, for a solid 15 seconds before even giving a sign of reaction after that the singed area was very small and the burn really slow.

Deep Purple is a folding UV sanitizer which cleans a full 360\u00b0, giving your devices an all-over clean anywhere, anytime.\nDisclaimer: This product does NOT claim to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent any illness or condition. \nChemical-free cleaning\nTraditional methods of keeping your personal belongings clean can be inconvenient, wasteful, and harmful to the environment. Deep Purple\u2122  provides an effective, safe, and chemical-free method of cleaning anywhere, anytime.\nClean your things\nOften the most touched belongings are also the dirtiest. Deep Purple\u2122  is designed to clean daily essentials and is portable enough to go anywhere.\nIf it's not Deep Purple\u2122 clean, it's not clean.\nOther UV sanitizers only clean the topside of your device, which means you still need to touch it when flipping it over to clean the other side. Moshi\u2019s Deep Purple\u2122 UV Sanitizer offers 360-degree cleaning. The transparent LumiClear\u2122  platform elevates your device and features an ultra-reflective Teflon base to ensure every surface is sanitized. \nPLAY\n\nFolds flat. Goes anywhere\nDeep Purple\u2122 UV Sanitizer features an ultra-thin form factor that folds up neatly and slides into a bag, backpack, or suitcase so you can take it with you anywhere. \nThe power of portability\nUsing the included USB cable, Deep Purple can be powered by a wall adapter, car charger, or portable battery to give you ultimate cleaning freedom in coffee shops, parks, hotels, and everywhere in between.\nIf it fits, clean it\nWe touch a lot of gadgets, accessories, and personal items throughout the day. Deep Purple\u2122  fits a range of different-sized items and give them a thorough, all-over clean in minutes. \nWhere can I use it?\nThanks to its portable design, you can take Deep Purple\u2122 with you to use almost anywhere including the office, restaurants, parks, airports, airplanes, train stations, workshops, and road trips. \nDeep Purple uses ultra-violet type-C light, which targets the DNA of microbes on the cellular level and negates their ability to reproduce.\n\nWith traditional UV sanitizers, there's no way to really know if sanitization was truly effective, giving you no choice but to believe their claim. Deep Purple's UV indicator contains UV-reactive paint which changes color with exposure to UV-C rays, providing visible proof that the interior has been exposed to a sufficient quantity of UV light.\nDeep Purple uses LEDs which emit UV type-C (UV-C) rays with short wavelengths. \nUV-C rays clean from every angle\nThe UV rays are emitted from LED lights inside Deep Purple, which are reflected around the interior for all-over coverage.\nUV-C rays deactivate DNA\nUV light works by disrupting the structure of microbial cells, making them unable to reproduce or multiply.\nMany other UV sanitizing solutions (such as non-enclosed UV wands) may expose the user to UV-C rays. Deep Purple\u2122  employs dual safety mechanisms to ensure no UV leakage. \nMany UV sanitizers use UV-C lamps because they are cheaper. Deep Purple utilizes UV-C LED technology which is superior in both quality and performance.\nDisclaimer: This product does NOT claim to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent an illness or condition.   \nDeep Purple\u2122 connects to any portable battery for hassle-free sanitization absolutely anywhere, anytime. We recommend using Deep Purple with Moshi's IonSlim 5K, which at only 8.5 mm thick, is one of the slimmest portable batteries available on the market. \n\nFrom phones to watches, keys and jewelry, Deep Purple can clean all kinds of personal items. Anything which is shared between multiple people, such as remote controls, gaming controllers, pens, cutlery, earphones....clean them all with Deep Purple\u2122. Take it with you to the coffee shop to clean utensils before you eat, or to work to clean your mouse, glasses, ID card, or laser pointer.\n\nMoshi's 10-year Global Warranty underscores our commitment to quality and encourages consumers to purchase products that are built to last. \nOver the span of several months, the engineers and designers at Moshi took the idea of Deep Purple\u2122 UV Sanitizer from conception to reality.

The new and improved edition introduces exclusive and innovative features: Polygiene\u2122 Treatment, an empowered replaceable filter with Anti-fog design, and an NFC Chip-connected app to monitor the Silver Mask 2 lifespan.\n\nSilver Mask 2 provides four different levels of protection: Polygiene\u2122 Treatment, a Silver embedded Layer, empowered replaceable Filter, and a hydro-repellent treatment. Check out all four levels of protection in-depth!\n\n\nThe outer cover has been treated with Polygiene\u2122 Treatment, the latest in textile treatment technology.\nThe Polygiene\u2122 Treatment resists up to 100 wash cycles.\n\nThe iconic Silver Layer (Ag) is now embedded in the inside of the outer cover. Silver works around the clock to keep the breathing environment healthy and neutralize bad odors.\nIt also allows moisture to easily evaporate and you can wash your cover whenever you want without compromising the silver function.\nThe built-in replaceable filter is composed of four different layers, each with a specific protective action.\nOur empowered filters are the only ones on the market produced in Europe with premium materials that provide an extended lifespan (6-8 week average duration).\nFor any details about filtering and protective action, please comment or send a message to support@banale.com. \n\nWith Silver Mask 2 you protect others too, thanks to a hydro-repellent treatment applied to the outer cover. This special treatment impedes any outgoing droplets coming out from the ventilation valve.\nThe valve is a very important feature in a face mask because it increases internal ventilation, reduces moisture and augments comfort. \nProtection matters but it\u2019s nothing without comfort. Designing face masks since 2015, we know how important it is to supply our customers with something they can wear naturally and easily.\nThanks to the maximum comfort, the more you wear it, the safer you\u2019ll be.\nA removable foam buffer provides advanced comfort, adhering to any face shape. The unique design ensures an airtight seal that supports maximum filtering efficiency and enables a unique anti-fog defense system. \nTo ensure optimal operation of the anti-fog design, the filter must be properly adjusted to adhere to the face.\nIn addition, we design a reflective band* that maximizes safety, especially for bikers. \n *reflective band provided separately and mounted manually.\nWith its patented lace system, Silver Mask 2 offers versatility, maximizing personalized wear while rendering a stylish and convenient wear for active and inactive use. \nThe lacing system allows for four different types of wear, ensuring maximum comfort suited for every type of wear, including with glasses and helmets.\nWith Silver Mask 2 one size fits all: pull the laces until the mask automatically adapts to any face. It will also fit with all different kinds of sunglasses and helmets.\nSilver Mask 2 is the ultimate evolution of a design intended to get you comfortably covered in every aspect of your daily routine.\nIts high standard of protection and comfort enables you to wear it while commuting, shopping, working and moving around in public spaces.\nSilver Mask 2 is equipped with an advanced built-in NFC chip that enables tracking of the filter lifespan. Tap your mask to your smartphone by bringing the phone closer to the chip and beep: now the mask is connected!\nThe waterproof chip is seamlessly integrated into the mask, protecting it from unwarranted damages and frequent washings, maximizing hygiene and safety.\nWith the Banale web app you'll always be connected with your mask and can constantry monitor your filter lifespan. And refill filters are just one click away. \nThe refill filters of Silver Mask 2 will always be available on BANALE.COM and the Banale web app, and are eligible for global shipment.\nFor 5 years we are committed to delivering refills and the spare parts to customers anywhere they need.\nAnd with the new BANALE web app, ordering refill filters is easier, faster and more convenient.\nAlong with the Banale web app and Silver Mask 2, we are launching the Recycling Program, a new exclusive service by Banale.\nBanale will collect the exhausted filters of your Silver Mask 2. Use the Banale web app to buy new filters and upon the delivery we\u2019ll collect exhausted filters and recycle them correctly through our industrial partner BLS.\nThis new program is aimed to ensure the sustainability of your Silver Mask 2 and reduce the impact of replaceable filters on the environment.   \n\nThe washable cover can be hand or machine washed up to 60\u00b0, leaving you with a fresh and clean feeling.\nIt is recommended to let it dry in the open air and to avoid using an automatic dryer.\nSilver Mask 2 comes equipped with a case, allowing safe storage of your mask and prolonging the filter lifespan during inactive use. \nSilver Mask 2 is state of the art in terms of protection. Get the most premium face mask on the market. Silver Mask 2 is the best in terms of comfort protection for you and those around you.\n\n\nAt this moment yo can preorder your favorite reward at a special price. Hurry up!

At Banale we gladly provide this customization service on request. \nChoose the \"Team pledge\" to have Silver Mask 2 customized.\nThe five-year journey until the arrival of Silver Mask 2 enabled us to challenge the design world, creating innovative solutions to maximize safety, hygiene and style.\nA special thanks to all our passionate customers around the world that continue to support our research and development by sharing their feedback and amazing ideas, empowering us to continue our mission of providing everyday products that solve everyday problems. \n\nSilver Mask 2 is the result of years of designing lasting products made from quality material. With more than five years of mask design experience, we know how much the little details matter on an everyday basis. With evolutionary design and innovation behind Silver Mask 2, it offers an everyday solution to your everyday routine.\n\nGiven the materials we have chosen, with Silver Mask 2 you'll never worry about your voice. We optimized sound engineering to allow for effortless breathability and clear sound while speaking, unlike traditional face masks.\nSilver Mask 2 is entirely designed and manufactured in Italy.\nThanks to our 5-year partnership with BLS Group, a 40-year-old top global player in the respiratory system market, we've been able to constantly improve the technological assets and develop the design features of Silver Mask 2. \nEnvironmental and reusable product design is part of our DNA. That\u2019s why we create quality products that not only last, but that offer a design you won\u2019t get tired of. \nWith Silver Mask 2 you can look and feel good, simultaneously doing your part to minimize excess waste created by disposable masks. The environmentally friendly and replaceable filter combo offers a design that lasts for all your daily needs.\n\n\nSilver Mask 2 and its multi-layer filter technology is tested at the BLS GROUP laboratory, one of the world\u2019s most advanced filter laboratories. \nTo access the lab test report, please comment or send a message to support@banale.com. \n\npeople around the world\n\n\n\n\n\n BANALE is an Italian word that means common, ordinary, not original.\nWe chose this word as a brand name in 2015 because it represented the opposite of the products that we wanted to design.\nUnique and useful accessories that help you make it through daily commuting and long traveling more easily and safely.\nAt BANALE, we design creative accessories for urban nomads and frequent travelers, with a unique focus on the design and engineering of our Masks. \nOur team is made of different people with a common view: make the ordinary extraordinary with everyday objects.\nFor any further information about the product and the campaign, please contact us at support@banale.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are an experienced team with product development, and we know exactly how much time and effort this process takes.

Although our blankets get rave reviews from our customers, we weren't satisfied. We wanted to do better.\nWe totally reimagined how a weighted blanket looks, feels and is made. \nTo preorder Nuzzie Knit at a steep discount to our future retail price, click Back This Project, or read on.  \n\nWhat's Wrong with Traditional Weighted Blankets?\nNot familiar with weighted blankets? We explain their benefits and the science behind them later on, but want to start with what we did to make Nuzzie Knit better than other weighted blankets.\n\nTraditional weighted blankets are:\nFilled with glass beads which can shift around and even leak (no one likes cleaning thousands of glass beads out of their bed)\nNot very breathable, trapping in excess body heat (sweaty nights, gross)\nNot machine washable or machine dryable (what century is this?)\nNot very stylish \nWe set out to fix all these problems, and more...\nNo More Pesky Glass Beads\nNuzzie Knit ditches the glass beads for our patent pending high density fabric filling, DuraFill\u2122. By using fabric to add weight to the blanket instead of beads, Nuzzie Knit is more comfortable and durable.\n\nSay Goodbye to Sleepless, Sweaty Nights\nOur open knit design allows air to circulate, for better temperature regulation\u2014you'll stay cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter\nEasy Cleaning\nTraditional weighted blankets need to be hand washed to prevent them from fraying, ripping and leaking. Nuzzie Knit's beadless design and durable fabrics allows you to just throw it in the washer or dryer\u2014worry free.\nBenefits of Weighted Blankets\nSay goodbye to tossing, turning and counting sheep. Nuzzie Knit will help you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer and wake up feeling refreshed.\nLike other weighted blankets, Nuzzie Knit applies gentle weight to pressure points around your body making you feel instantly calm, grounded and stress-free...just like a swaddled baby. (It\u2019s the same science!)\n Can a Weighted Blanket Help You? \nOn a scale of 1 to 10, how well did you sleep last night?\nWe hope it\u2019s a 10...but if you\u2019re anything like the average adult, you\u2019re not getting enough sleep. Restful and restorative sleep is crucial for your body to operate at peak performance throughout the day. In fact, the CDC declared sleep disorders a \u201cpublic health epidemic\u201d\nThat\u2019s right, a public health epidemic. Getting enough sleep is a big deal.\n\u2192 The good news: Weighted blankets have been scientifically shown to improve your sleep quality. The gentle weight targets pressure points around your body, in a process called DPS or \"Deep Pressure Stimulation\". DPS activates the central nervous system, modulating its hormone production in beneficial ways. Specifically, it boosts serotonin (happy hormone) and melatonin (sleepiness), while reducing cortisol (stress).\nHappy + Sleepy - Stress, completely natural and drug free! Now that's amazing.\n\u2192 The great news: The Nuzzie Knit can be of value to anyone in the following groups:\nAnyone looking to improve their sleep quality \nPeople who have trouble falling asleep \nRemote workers who want to focus and destress during their work day\nAdults and children with ADHD, anxiety, autism, restless leg syndrome, insomnia, and PTSD \n Product Details\nSpecs\nThe Nuzzie Knit is 80\" long and 60\" wide (the surface area of a queen bed) and comes in 2 weight choices (15lbs and 20lbs). Please see the FAQ for a discussion on choosing the best weight. The fabric material is made of our proprietary patent pending DuraFill\u2122 which is a high density fiber that is long-lasting and ultra durable. \nCare Instructions\nMachine wash and dry.\nColors\nWe know, we know... we all love colors! The more the merrier and that's why we have 3 to choose from! You will be able to choose your color after the campaign is complete. We will be sending out a survey to all our backers which will allow you to choose your color.\nWe're No Newbies\nWith over three years of experience designing and making weighted blankets, we're confident that we can deliver.

So if you want two queen 15 lbs blankets, you'd add a $180 bonus to your pledge for a total price of $360.\n\nA Message From the Founders\nNuzzie was born out of our own frustration with sleep. Like many of you, we suffered from insomnia and felt the negative effects during our waking hours. We tried every natural remedy out there, but nothing worked...until we tried sleeping with a weighted blanket.\n\nAfter personally experiencing their therapeutic benefits, we were hooked and even launched our own blanket in 2017. Since then, we\u2019ve become obsessed with customer feedback, researching materials and improving our product. It\u2019s about time weighted blankets got a major design upgrade.\n\nThat\u2019s where Nuzzie Knit comes in. We know it\u2019s going to be a hit. We just need your help to help us get there. Thank you in advance for your backing, you won't regret it!\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns, Nuzzie already has a mass production ready prototype as well as established relationships with manufacturers and shipping providers. \n\nWe've been in the weighted blanket business for over 3 years and confident that we will deliver to all of our pledges.\n\nThe only tangible risk is that our production schedule may be behind our estimates. In this unlikely case, we will communicate with you as things develop so you know exactly when you can expect your blanket.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur patent pending DuraFill fabric is one of the most durable fabrics out there and will be able to endure many wash cycles. The Nuzzie Knit also has no glass beads which means no leaking blankets which is the #1 reason that traditional weighted blankets are thrown out.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nThe factory we choose will be in compliance with Standard 100 by OEKO-TEX which means there will be no harmful chemicals used in the production of the blanket.\nSomething else\nWe pledge to donate 1% of sales to the National Institute of Mental Health. Many consumers buy weighted blankets because of the negative effects of anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD. By donating profits to the NIMH we hope to reduce the demand for weighted blankets, thus contributing to the \"Reduce\" aspect of \"Reduce, Re-use, Recycle\".", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 140 or more", "title": "Nuzzie Knit 8lbs Child Size - Early Bird", "descp": "Back this reward and you\u2019ll receive one Child Size Nuzzie Knit (8lb - 41\"x60\") for $140, 25% off of the retail price ($185 USD).

Have peace of mind at your fingertips!\nyasss\nPhones may look clean but they're not. We strongly believe most people, like us, care about personal hygiene but not enough to clean their phones multiple times a day. That\u2019s why we created Killacase\u2122.\n\nThere are over 1,000,000 germs on most phones which is 10x more than a public toilet seat. [1]\nThe idea came to us during the early stages of the recent outbreak. We realized that frantically washing our hands was pointless if we're going to use our dirty phones right after.\nThe only solutions were to continuously clean your phone with disposable wipes or UV sanitizers, which are high maintenance, wasteful, and temporary. So we created a low maintenance, reusable, and permanent solution.\n\nWe infused Killacase\u2122 with silver because of silver's natural antimicrobial properties. It's one of mother nature\u2019s most effective sanitizers.\nSelf-sanitizes in 1 Hour\nKillacase\u2122 keeps your phone clean even when you're using it. Unlike other products, our case and screen protector fully sanitizes itself within an hour.\nHow Does it Work?\nWhen silver oxidizes, smaller silver ions are released. Then the following happens...\nin other words...\n\nImagine germs as moths and silver as a lit-up bug zapper. Moths get attracted to the light and get zapped on contact. Now imagine a bunch of bug zappers teamed up, working around the clock.\nTesting: We tested our prototypes with dozens of controlled Petri dish tests and at a microbiology lab, passing ISO 22196:2011 standards. \nThe test is a specific method that evaluates the antibacterial activity of antibacterial-treated plastics and other non-porous surfaces and is the highest antimicrobial lab test standard. \nWe are proud to say our lab tests have shown almost 100% efficacy within the first hour.\nWhy We Created Killacase\u2122\n9/10 people use their phone in the bathroom\nWe spend over 5 hours on our phone everyday\nWe use our phone in the dirtiest places\n\n\nPhone Case Features\nPLAY\n\n Ultra-Slim Profile \n\nDrop Protection  \nKillacase\u2122 absorbs up to 9 feet drops. We tested it at the most extreme heights and received SGS certification. With a raised screen and camera bezels coupled with Shockgrip corners, say goodbye to cracked screens and broken cameras.\n\nEnhanced Acoustics \nStandard cases let sound waves flow downwards instead of towards you. We've changed that by redirecting the waves. It\u2019s a small change but noticeable. Enjoy that extra bass!\nIntroducing KillaScreen\n KillaScreen is made with rock-solid tempered glass. Just like our phone case, it's infused with silver to keep your screen clean.\nAccording to Shape, phone screens may contribute to breakouts. [2]\nTogether they are your one-stop-shop for\n 360\u00b0, 24/7 protection for your phone. \n\n Development & Story \nThe \u201cAHA\u201d moment was easy, but developing a product wasn't so much. We started researching antimicrobial properties and found that silver is a very stable element. After multiple iterations, we're confident that our final prototype has all the protective and aesthetic features of the perfect clear case.\nThe final challenge is to raise funds on Kickstarter and gather enough pre-orders so we can start production.\nPrototype Sketches\nPrototype CAD Sketch\nPrototype 3D Rendering\n\nLogo Poll Results:\nThank you to everyone that participated! \nThe winner is...\n\nRewards\nShipping\n Timeline \n\n The Team \nFounded by three siblings\nSpecial thanks to Syek, Su Ping, Sam, Tina, Sarny, Nicola, Won, Alex, Ana, Vanessa, Glara, Clarissa, Aaron, Jack, Tommy, Maxi, Jessica, Helen, Angela, Won, Dawson, Minsung, Anna, Jennie, Vincent and many more\nThere\u2019s no way we could\u2019ve achieved what we have if it wasn\u2019t for these people.

Krysta Crawford, I've been drawing and writing stories for over 15 years for friends and family. I have decided to finally self publish my first comic book and my first Kickstarter! This kickstarter is also part of the make 100 campaign in support of small creative endevours and therefore this run will be limited to only 100 backers; 50 regular covers and 40 metallic covers and 10 limited edition gold covers. This first edition will never be reprinted with this cover again. This will be a 20 page fully colored book in standard comic size. \nWhat is Wolf and I?\n\"Wolf and I\" is the first installment of a comic written and illustrated by Krysta Crawford, detailing the story of a college student named Violet and her best friend who can communicate with ghosts in the compelling tale of how Vi's life turns upside down after her grandparents unexpected truth leading to a close encounter with a mystifying stranger, and the concealed origin of her parents history. \nSneak Peek Preface:\n[I'd never realized how bizarre my life was until my last year of college or how my childhood memories would be the key to keeping me alive. It never bothered me that my best friend not only saw but was dating a ghost. It was something you just got used to when you had known each other since elementary school and your imaginary friends weren't so imaginary. The fact that I never knew my father because he left before I was born and my mother died in a car accident when I was six leaving me to be raised by my grandparents was just part of life. I could read people's emotions like an open book, but everyone has some sort of gift right? Then the nightmares started to get worse and random strangers kept staring at me everywhere I went. That was just the beginning....]\nInterior two page spread\nSo, why kickstarter?...\nAs a new artist, I chose Kickstarter to be the funding platform to take the big step into the world of authorship and raise funding for the initial printing and launch of my first-ever self-published comic book! If you back this project you are helping me take a dream into a reality and be able to cover the initial costs of printing, shipping, and getting my first book into local comic shops and libraries. \nThat's cool... but where is the money going?\nI'm a visual learner so here is a pie chart of all that financial stuffiness... \nShipping and Handling! \nAll tiers will come with the comics packaged in a bag and board and shipped in a Gemini comic shipping mailer for protection.\nI've backed...so now what?\nThis is the exciting part! You've helped an indie artist launch her first comic book! This project has 30 days to fund and if it does (fingers crossed, tell your friends!) we are expecting to finish wrapping up the final pages and submit the files to printing for review in March 2020.

Mike even made a contribution, so our backers are already in elite company!

The gorgeous cinematography, the powerful acting performances, the thrilling music, and the full immersion of the theatrical experience.  \nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nAccompanying the movie are the novel, the graphic novel, and the soundtrack.\nEach one, the film, the novel versions (ebooks, paperback, audiobook), and the graphic novel are their own, unique, independent experiences. \nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\n They all portray the same, complete story, so it\u2019s not necessary to read the novel or the graphic novel to also enjoy the film. Any one of them will suffice.\nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nRather, the unique nature of each medium demands for the story to be told in different ways so that each work of art can reach its full potential, as the tool box that a graphic novelist, a novelist, and a filmmaker use are different.\nAs a result, enjoying all three will deepen your experience of Dangerous to Know, as you gain access to back story that is necessary to build tension in a novel, but that would be too cumbersome to include in a film. You\u2019ll know a character's thoughts from the graphic novel, as accessing a character\u2019s inner monologue is a common conceit in the world of comic book storytelling, but it\u2019s far less common in film. \nA sample page from the Dangerous to Know graphic novel, offered as one of our Rewards Packages\nExplore our Rewards Page, discover the many other products on offer, including more of David Simpson's novels, personalized copies of his books, your name in the credits of the film or the acknowledgements of one of his novels, getting a character in the DTK sequel named after you, or one of our producer or Executive Producer packages...\nIt's a Rewards Paradise. \nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nDangerous to Know is a fully completed (post-production included) psychological thriller feature film. Now, with the movie made, we just have one last dragon to slay, but we can\u2019t slay this one without you. We need your help to get the movie to you, which means we need your help to fund the film\u2019s distribution.\nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\n We\u2019re on Kickstarter to raise funds to get the film rated for distribution and to cover the cost of festival entrance fees.\nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nWe want to get Dangerous to Know to you, because we believe, once you see it in a theatre, you\u2019ll love it as much as we do.\nDTK breaks the rules.  \nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nIt\u2019s a psychological thriller, it\u2019s neo-noir, it has a femme fatale who doubles as the anti-hero, it has reversals throughout to keep your attention glued to the screen...It knows you\u2019re programmed to think the movie is going one way, and uses that knowledge to make sure the unfolding plot is unpredictable. \nDangerous to Know Movie Poster\nIt\u2019s not like anything we\u2019ve ever seen, and we can\u2019t wait to share the truly unique film-watching experience with you. \nDangerous to Know shares elements with films like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (either version), Inglorious Basterds, Joker, Gone Girl, I Saw The Devil, NightCrawler, Drive, and more...it\u2019s an eclectic list, we know, but there simply isn\u2019t a one-for-one comparison between another film and DTK.\nThe above films share some traits, like their intelligent, yet accessible plots\u2014they are psychological, dark, yet beautiful and thrilling...DTK is those things too.\nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nDangerous to Know uses a psychological effect known as the Zeigarnik Effect\u2014simply put, it\u2019s a psychological effect that resets your attention span by giving you a new mystery for your mind to puzzle over\u2014each time one mystery is resolved, it\u2019s replaced by something new, and likely something you couldn\u2019t have predicted\u2014you\u2019ll find yourself feeling like you\u2019re watching a completely new movie by the midway point. Binge-watching is the result of the same effect, but we\u2019ve never seen it done within a single movie...we think you\u2019re going to love the feeling.\nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nWe can\u2019t tell you. We can tell you the synopsis we\u2019ve been showing to the media, but if we told you the larger story, we\u2019d spoil the Zeigarnik Effect for you, and that would be a terrible shame. \nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nHere is something we can tell you: If you watch our nearly 4 minute trailer, you\u2019ll barely see a frame from half of the movie\u2019s runtime...the best, most thrilling, most visually stunning stuff in the movie can\u2019t go into the trailer, which is a challenge when marketing DTK, but there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to spoil the fun for the person we made it for: You!  \nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nAt any rate, here\u2019s the synopsis we give to the media:\n\"Bridget is dangerous...she\u2019s manipulative...Bridget definitely isn\u2019t a hero...and she certainly isn\u2019t stable...but is she a murderer? Or is it all in her mind? \nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nGet ready for a twisting\u2014and twisted\u2014tale that will bend your mind and keep you guessing until the last frame. From award-winning, global bestseller, David Simpson, Dangerous to Know is the first part in the first psychological thriller film-trilogy tailored for intelligent adults, but thrilling enough to be accessible to a wide, mature audience.\nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nDangerous to Know stars Bridget Graham (Pixels, Hemlock Grove, Manhattan Undying) and is written and directed by global bestselling author, David Simpson, and is based upon his novel, Dangerous to Know.\"\nFilm Still From Dangerous to Know (2020)\nStay super Involved!\nWe need your help to spread the word!

And yet we have found designers rarely place pockets in women's clothing. Why?  Gowns, dresses, yoga pants, athletic shorts,  leggings, and scrub pants... no pockets = no knife. And yet the pocket knife is the most used every-day-carry (EDC) tool. \nWe are equipping the unpredictable lifestyle with an always-on-hand pocket knife... stored inside a stunning necklace pendant.  \n INTRODUCING THE KNIFELACE\u00ae\n                           100% original design | Trademarked\nA knife designed to be accessible, we have crafted the most beautiful knife-necklace  ever. The Knifelace\u00ae is a minimalist, hammered pendant that securely holds a small pocket knife.\nMagnets keep the knife in place. A firm tug downward pulls the knife out of the pendent.  \nPLAY\n\nStays safely & securely in place, yet can be deployed with just one, firm tug.\n Necklace: The knife is held in place with strong magnets.\n   Fast & Easy Access: Arms full? No problem. Your knife can be accessed with one hand.\n   Beautiful & Chic: Our necklace is inspired by top-rated necklace designs.\n   Minimalist: Clean and simple; this pendant is designed to go with any outfit.\n   High Quality: Our nickel-plated pendant has a brilliant, high-end shine.\n   Effective: 1\" inch hawkbill knife blade is made from 8CR13MoV stainless steel.\n   Resilient: Extensively field tested, the knife is designed to last.\n  Having a knife on-hand is invaluable for cutting through packing tape or opening up a blister pack. While you won't be spear fishing with the Knifelace\u00ae, our goal is to equip the strong-minded woman to be more adaptable, prepared, and ready for the unexpected.   \n Blade style: Hawkbill / Raptor Claw\n Blade material: 3CR13 stainless steel\n Blade back: Textured, anti-slip grip\n Pendant material: White silver color made from polished Nickel plated Zinc Alloy\n Pendant texture: Hammered geometric\n Eyelet: Rotated 90\u00b0 allowing the pendant to lay flat\n Chain material: Stainless steel, pre-threaded / installed\n Chain length: 24 inches length, total. 20 + 4\" inches / 61 + 10 CM. Extra slimming style achieved with lengthening of chain.\n Magnet strength: 0.65lbs / 10.4oz pull pressure\n Pendant weight: Just 1.2 oz (or 34g)\n Chain clasp: Lobster clasp\n Packaging: Origami-style gift presentation envelope\n Fast deployment, Sharp Knife Pendant Necklace\n  \"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\"\n- Leonardo da Vinci\nTop rated: We drew inspiration from the highest rated pendants on the market, combining the best elements into one, clean-looking piece of art.\nGeometric elements: The clean, simple lines match any outfit. There is nothing gaudy about the Knifelace\u00ae. The minimalist design compliments formal and informal wear\u2014whether you're wearing an evening gown or yoga tights.\nTextured surface: The concave dimples create a uniquely tactile surface. The hammered finish is inspired by top rated pendants. \nAdjustable 20-24\" slimming chain: The chain is longer than conventional chains (24 inches / 61 cm), which naturally draws the body lengthwise. \nMulti-purpose: Be prepared and confident in who you are with a minimalist necklace for a minimalist lifestyle.  \n \"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\"\n- Steve Jobs, Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc. \nThe perfect gift: Remember the rarest moments with a piece of jewelry that is just as unique.  \nWe're fans of simplicity: We've heard from our fans who supported our last two successful Kickstarters: \"Love the simplicity of your Kickstarters.\"  That's why we're still committed to free shipping, world-wide, and not bogging down our fans with $1 Tweets, t-shirts, or stickers. We assume you're here for our life-changing designs, so we focus 100% on refining and providing just that. \n This is our 3rd successful Kickstarter. We're pretty darn excited.  \nThe final conceptual, straight from our production headquarters. Beautiful, isn't it?\n700% STRETCH GOAL REACHED!\nEvery Knifelace\u00ae is automatically upgraded to having a mini-pendant on the end of the chain. It compliments the upper back and back of the neck beautifully, especially when your hair is done up. \nBeautiful little mini dog tag pendant included on the back of every Knifelace\u00ae.\nBehind the scenes: Tacticouture is a crew, a team, and a family. Through a wide network of incredibly creative friends and field testers, we are dedicated to fusing fashion with practicality. Below is a photo of us volunteering in Northern Nicaragua just a couple months ago. We were serving some local missionaries through our nonprofit film studio of Knok. We were also field-testing a ballistic scarf design (perhaps to be on Kickstarter if the prototypes continue as planned). We lives just south of Seattle, WA, up towards Mt Rainier--a mountain which Beau climbs annually.  Our family loves trail running, martial arts, and fluffy cats. Our entire family loves God, helping people, and going out to sushi. \nOur original Kickstarter\u2014the Tacticlip\u2014is now a best seller on Amazon. It's actually was sold out for several months due to the high demand. And it's all thanks to you guys, our fans. What makes us different is our Kickstarters have a tremendous amount of research put into our projects, all done before hand. We've found anticipation sets us, and our fans, up for success. We put integrity before any profit. THANK YOU for entrusting us with your support. We couldn\u2019t improve the world without your support and backing. Thank you! \nPartners and support: TactiCouture\u2122, Beau LLC, Chevassus Studios, Tacticlip\u00ae\n The Knifelace\u00ae stays securely in place, behind held by strong magnets. \n\n\n\n\n Field-tested: The Knifelace\u00ae is a 90% reality. Production kinks are worked out... we're ready for our first movers and the final push to the finish line.\n   One-of-a-kind: Our exclusive knife design is unlike anything your friends have ever seen. We've heard it already: \"I love your pendent.\" \"Thanks, it's a knife.\" \"Wait what?\"\n   Practice what we preach: We use the very products we produce, *nearly everyday (*some days we fly through TSA, and naturally we comply with safety requirements)\n   Commitment to quality: When faced with a decision to cut a tiny bit of cost or deliver a higher quality product, we go with the latter. We want quality products, and we assume everyone else wants the same thing.\n   Fans first: Ask any of our previous backers and you'll find we put our fans first. We serve our backers before we serve ourselves.\n   Gorgeous gifts: Be that brilliant person who's ahead of birthdays, Christmas, and your anniversary. We love to set gift-givers up for success.\n   Free shipping: Worldwide. All levels. Yes, you read that right.\n   Be the first: We are early adopters at heart; we get a rush out of being the first to experience a proven design. \nPerfect gift - We have designed beautiful origami style packaging to accompany a beautifully designed necklace\nBudget note: Kickstarter's project budget feature is new, and it doesn't take into account previously raised capital from previous Kickstarters (e.g. the Tacticlip black and camouflage versions). This Kickstarter is the final push towards raising all we can to produce Knifelaces\u00ae. Join us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMANUFACTURING: As with our previous campaign, we factor as much manufacturer error in as possible. We have tested (and re-tested) our necklace production process to ensure delivery on time at the high quality standards you expect. That said there is always a gamble in the manufacturing world. We thank all of our amazing fans for backing our previous Kickstarters. We hope this tool brings you much joy and use. \n\nHEALTH: This is a tool. Use with caution. There are magnets on this necklace. If you are adversely affected by magnets (e.g. Pacemaker), please consult a health professional prior to using. Use at your own risk. There are small parts; keep out of reach of children. Choking, cutting, and strangulation hazard. This tool is sharp and can break or the blade can be dislodged. This tool is not intended for self defense, 'survival,' or strenuous use. Tacticouture, Tacticlip, Beau LLC, Beau Chevassus, the creators and/or fans of this project bear no liability or responsibility due to the use or misuse of this tool. By backing this project, you assume full responsibility of the use and/or misuse of this tool. Be an adult, know your local laws and comply accordingly. \n\nTIMELINE: We are pleased to have a history of very successful Kickstarters, however we have found there are always curveballs when it comes to new designs. We do our best to project realistic timelines and be 100% transparent with our backers (just look at our past Kickstarters). However timelines often have to be adjusted. If so, we will communicate when and why. Still we build in failsafes and extra time so we can \"under promise and over deliver.\" Our goal is to delight our amazing fans, and your support and easy-going understanding means the world as we peer into the crystal ball and predict the future. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: We are human. While we do our best, we can fail. This is reality. (*pause for existential crises*) However rest assured we put you and God first... not ourselves. (see Mark 12:30-31) Feel free to check out our past Kickstarters to see how we place others first.

A great gift for aspiring guitar players and a best friend to songwriters, the poster comes in a range of formats that look great on any wall.\nScales\nNever forget your scales again...or learn them if you never knew them! 4 of the most common scales (Major, Natural Minor, Major Blues & Minor Blues) clearly illustrated for ease of reading and memorisation.\nChords\nPlay me an F# minor chord. No? Me neither. 5 of the most common chords (Major, Minor, Major 7, Minor 7 & Dominant 7) in all key signatures, clearly annotated so you\u2019ll never be stumped again.\nTheory\nDiagrams and tables that help you familiarise yourself with a guitar, form chords, write chord progressions, identify relative keys and learn the relationship between different key signatures. All handy references to help you create music.\nDesign\nThe poster was meticulously designed with beginners in mind, so that anyone can pick up a guitar and start playing. Even if you\u2019ve never picked up a guitar before, the combination of illustrations and descriptions will guide you through. Not to mention we think it looks great on a wall!\nPrint\nOur posters are printed in the UK and the USA, using FSC compliant paper and environmentally friendly inks. The result is a beautiful quality print that you\u2019ll be proud to hang on your wall.\nFormats\nThe poster is available in a range of formats to suit different budgets and applications. We\u2019ve got you (and your wall) covered.\nDigital\n       Downloadable, printable PDF version of the poster. Sent out immediately after the campaign is over.\nFolded (FREE SHIPPING)\n       A1 size poster. Printed on 170gsm gloss paper. Folded down to A4 for easy shipping. Comes with FREE Shipping Worldwide & FREE Digital Version.\nRolled\n       A1 size poster. Printed on 250gsm gloss paper. Comes rolled in a cardboard tube. This means there are no creases in your poster, but shipping costs extra. Comes with a FREE Digital Version.\nFunding & Rewards\nFunding\nWe've developed the product, designed the brand, built the website and produced the video. Now, all we need is the money to fund our first print-run, so we can get The Really Useful Guitar Poster off the ground and into the hands of those who want it.\nRewards\nWe are offering \u2018Digital\u2019, \u2018Folded\u2019, \u2018Rolled\u2019 and \u2018Bundled\u2019 versions of the poster as rewards.\nDownload links to the Digital version of the poster will be sent out as soon as you have given us your email address (by filling in your Backer Survey).\nAssuming you complete your Backer Survey in time, we will ship your physical poster within 2 weeks of the campaign ending.\nConclusion\nThis poster was designed out of a genuine need to bring several learning resources together onto one easily-accessible format. We are really happy with the result and genuinely believe it will help many people learn to play and compose music more easily. We love that thought, we love this poster and we love our business. We hope you do too. \nPackaging\nDepending on which version of the poster you buy, it will be shipped in different packaging.\nFolded - These A1 posters are folded down to A4 size (the same size as a sheet of office paper) and placed inside a mailing envelope. This means the overall package is very small and light, and therefore much cheaper to ship than the \u2018Rolled\u2019 version (which is how we can offer FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE).\nRolled - This version is the same size as the Folded version (A1), but it comes rolled rather than folded (meaning they arrive with you crease-free). They are shipped inside an A1-sized cardboard mailing-tube, which means they are more expensive to ship than the \u2018Folded\u2019 version (which is why we charge extra for shipping).\nCarriers & Transit Times\nAll versions (apart from \u2018Folded\u2019 posters shipping to the UK) are sent via tracked and signed services, meaning you'll receive a tracking number for your order once it has been dispatched, and you'll be required to sign for the package once it reaches you.\nUK\nFolded\n       Service: Royal Mail 1st Class\n       Average transit time: 1-2 working days\nRolled\n       Service: Royal Mail Special Delivery\n       Average transit time: 1-2 working days\nEurope\nFolded\n       Service: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\n       Average transit time: 7-10 working days\nRolled\n       Service: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\n       Average transit time: 7-10 working days\nUnited States & Canada\nFolded\n       Service: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\n       Average transit time: 7-10 working days\nRolled\n       Service: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\n       Average transit time: 7-10 working days\nRest of the World (ROW)\nFolded\n       Service: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\n       Average transit time: 10-12 working days\nRolled\n       Service: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\n       Average transit time: 10-12 working days\nCost\nUK\nFolded - FREE\n       Rolled - \u00a38\nEurope\nFolded - FREE\n       Rolled - \u00a311\nUnited States & Canada\nFolded - FREE\n       Rolled - \u00a315\nRest of the World (ROW)\nFolded - FREE\n       Rolled - \u00a315", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've developed the product, designed the brand, built the website and produced the video.

I've spent much of my life traveling the world to collect rare and fascinating objects. Over the years, and with the help of so many wonderful people, I've assembled an incredible collection which I am sharing with the world through a project called Mini Museum!\nExamining a Burmese amber sample after hours in the markets of T\u00e9ngch\u014dng, China\nThe Mini Museum is a personal collection of curiosities where every item is authentic, iconic, and labeled. It's carefully designed to take you on a journey of learning and exploration.\nMini Museum Age of Dinosaurs - Small (13-Specimens) and Large (32-Specimens)\nEncased in the highest quality Lucite acrylic, the Mini Museum will last for generations. It is a truly awesome collection that makes a wonderful gift for the person who has just about everything, or for someone special you want to inspire.  \nFour Unique Collections for Tens of Thousands of Backers Around the World! \u2764\ufe0f\nSince our first Kickstarter project back in 2014, we've shared this journey across space and time with tens of thousands of people all over the world through four unique collections.\nThis time we've come back to share our first subject-focused collection: Mini Museum Age of Dinosaurs! \nMini Museum Age of Dinosaurs - Large (32-Specimens)\nAge of Dinosaurs is a breathtaking collection paced across one hundred and eighty-five million years! There are 35 specimens in Age of Dinosaurs, making it our largest collection since the First Edition!\nBeginning with the near extinction of all life on Earth, we\u2019ll witness the struggle to rebound even as the surface of the planet tears itself apart.\nAdorned with feathers and scales, species will radiate and blossom in unparalleled variety, and by tooth and claw... life will find a way.\nYou will hold the largest creatures to ever walk the Earth and the most powerful predators of all time. Then, when we\u2019ve reached the end, we'll watch as life once more succumbs to a fiery cataclysm!\nSpecimens from Age of Dinosaurs - More Details Below!\nBelow you'll find a chart of all the specimens in the collection and the versions in which they appear:  \nAge of Dinosaurs Specimen List\nAs with past Editions, the Large and the Small will arrive in a handsome Display Box, protected by a Custom Microfiber Pouch. \nPackaging Elements from the Age of Dinosaurs Display Box\nEach Mini Museum also comes with a Certificate of Authenticity and a 160-page, hardbound book we call the Companion Guide. The Companion Guide is a starting point for learning more about the specimens in the collection, details about our process, and additional references so that you can continue exploring on your own!\nRaptor Storytime with the Companion Guide! (Raptor Cameo Credit: Atrociraptor marshalli from David Silva's Beasts of the Mesozoic Collection)\nGiving back to our backers who make each edition of the Mini Museum possible!\nDuring this campaign, we're offering the opportunity to back all three versions of Age of Dinosaurs (Large, Small, and Touch) with special pricing for every tier!\nSince we're talking about dinosaurs it seemed really appropriate to name the tiers after the three geological periods of the Mesozoic:\n Triassic  (Early Bird I):\nLarge $259\nTouch $259\nSmall $99\nJurassic  (Early Bird II):\nLarge $269\nTouch $269\nSmall $109\nCretaceous (Early Bird III):\nLarge $279\nTouch $279\nSmall $119\nAfter the campaign, the prices will return to our standard $299 for the Large and the Touch, and the Small will be $129. \nMini Museum Age of Dinosaurs - Small (13-Specimens)\nOnce more, we are offering $10 worldwide shipping, so no matter where you are, shipping will cost just $10 for your Kickstarter reward!\nPlease Note: Shipping prices only apply to your Kickstarter rewards. Any add-ons purchased after the campaign will have standard shipping rates applied in line with past campaigns.\nImportant Information for Backers Outside the United States: As with past projects, the shipping price for your Kickstarter reward only includes the cost of shipping and insurance. The price does not include sales tax/VAT or any duties/customs fees that may apply.\nIndividual numbers will be exclusive to the Kickstarter version of the Touch and Large.\nEach Mini Museum is unique, but this time around we're going to make the Large and Touch a bit more special for our Kickstarter backers by limiting the laser-etched, individually numbered Large and hand-numbered Touch Mini Museums to backers of the campaign.\nAfter we finish the batches for our Kickstarter backers, all future Large and Touch Mini Museums will have \"LIMITED EDITION\" printed inside just as we do with the Small.\nMini Museum Age of Dinosaurs - Large (32-Specimens)\nThe Kickstarter version of the Touch will feature ALL 35 specimens in the Age of Dinosaurs Collection.\nThe Touch is a special version of the Mini Museum where all of the specimens are accessible for careful study.  When building the Age of Dinosaurs Touch, we noticed that we could fill all of the slots this time around so that's exactly what we decided to do!\nAll 35 Specimens from Age of Dinosaurs in the Touch!\nKickstarter Backers of the Touch will receive all 35 specimens from the Age of Dinosaurs collection in addition to receiving an individually numbered Certificate of Authenticity. After the campaign, the Touch will feature the same 32 specimens as the Large and will not have an individual number.\nDid you know we send Mini Museums and other items to schools around the world? We do and you can help!\nWe also have a new t-shirt design to support our Educational Donation Program!\nGet a sweet dinosaur t-shirt and help us send Mini Museums to kids around the world!\nThe shirt design features a custom illustration with specimens from the Age of Dinosaurs collection on a black t-shirt.

The chief catalyst of this extinction event is a series of massive volcanic eruptions known as the Siberian Traps. Over the course of 1,000,000 years, these flood basalt eruptions covered over 7 million square kilometers (2,700,000 square miles). [READ MORE]\nTETHYS OCEAN - HIMALAYAN SHALIGRAM\n\"The folded and crumpled deposits of this ocean stand forth to heaven in Tibet, Himalaya, and the Alps.\" ~ Eduard Suess, Austrian Geologist, \"Are Great Ocean Depths Permanent\" (1893)\nAt the beginning of the Mesozoic Era, the Tethys Ocean was bound by the great Panthalassa Ocean within the cradle of the supercontinent Pangaea. During the Jurassic Period, the shifting continents compressed the Tethys to form an equatorial seaway stretching from today's Caribbean Islands to what is now the Himalayas. [READ MORE]\nTHE BREAKUP OF PANGAEA - c. 200,000,000 YEARS OLD\n\"Our planet is a restless home.\" ~ Sean C. Solomon, Chair NASA Solid Earth Science Working Group\nPangaea existed as a single landmass for approximately 160,000,000 years. The breakup came after a series of powerful rifting events, in which strong pulses of magma forced continental plates apart at the seams, creating new crust and opening up the basin in which the Atlantic Ocean eventually took shape. [READ MORE]\nGONDWANA - ARAUCARIA TREE\n\"Imagine an observer approaching our planet from outer space, and pushing aside the belts of clouds which obscure our atmosphere to simply gaze for a whole day on the surface as it rotates beneath them... The features beyond all others most likely to arrest their attention would be the wedge-like outlines of the continents as they narrow away to the South. This is indeed the most striking character present on the map of our world, and it has been so ever since the chief features of our planet have become known to us.\" ~ Edward Suess, Austrian Geologist and the first to advance the theory of the Gondwana supercontinent in \"The Face of the Earth\" (1885)\nGondwana comprised the southern portion of Pangaea. As Pangaea began to break apart, so too did Gondwana, with the present-day continents of Africa, South America, India, Antarctica, and Australia slowly moving in different directions. [READ MORE]\nLAURASIA -  AMMOLITE GEM\n\"Three times during their reign of more than 300 million years, ammonites experimented with the most bizarre and startling shell shapes.\" ~ Wolfgang Grulke, author of \"Heteromorph: The Rarest Fossil Ammonites\"\nLaurasia, like its southern counterpart Gondwana, was part of Pangaea until driven apart by the rifting of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. This event also created the basin for today's Northern Atlantic Ocean. [READ MORE]\nDINOSAUR EGG - HYPSELOSAURUS\n\"I would go to museums and say can I open your dinosaur egg? Can I just drop them on the floor and look inside? And they'd say no.\" ~ Jack Horner, Paleontologist\nWhen thinking about deep time, we often find ourselves caught up in the nearly unfathomable expanses of millennia stretched end to end. Yet, here in this humble eggshell, we have a single moment captured for all eternity\u2026 the birth of an individual dinosaur. [READ MORE]\nDINOSAUR FOOTPRINT - GRALLATOR\n\"So strikingly did these tracks resemble those of birds, that they were familiarly spoken of as the tracks of 'poultry,' or of 'Noah's Raven.'\" ~ Edward Hitchock, \"Ichnology of New England\" (1858)\nImagine for a moment that you are standing along a muddy flat shoreline, looking out towards the horizon. The half-light of dawn is just within reach. You are alone here on this shore, but not for long. You hear the soft, wet sounds of feet slapping in the mud. The pace is steady but unhurried. You look through the shadows and there on two legs is a dinosaur! [READ MORE]\nDINOSAUR SKIN - HADROSAUR\n\"Most of what is known about dinosaur skin comes from several exceptionally preserved hadrosaurid fossils.\" ~ Matt Davis, Department of Geology and Geophysics, Yale University\nWhen we think of dinosaur fossils we usually imagine bones and teeth, but fossilized skin and scale impressions have also been discovered, as well as the imprints of feathers. [READ MORE]\nDINOSAUR FOOD - CYCAD\n\"Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are.\" ~ Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, M\u00e9ditations de Gastronomie Transcendante (1826)\nThe palm-like figure of the Cycad is familiar to fans of classic, paleoart paintings. The extensive presence of these gymnosperms in the fossil record presents a complex picture of this long-lived family of seed-bearing plants and their relationship with the largest creatures to ever walk the Earth. [READ MORE]\nDINOSAUR DUNG - COPROLITE\n\"The Mesozoic trend to sauropod gigantism led to the evolution of immense microbial vats unequalled in modern land animals.\" ~ David M.Wilkinson, University of Lincoln\nScientifically speaking, coprolites are fossilized poop. Over millions of years, minerals, such as chalcedony and quartz, replaced the original organic material. This process creates a rich, colorful matrix which allows us to study the diet and lifestyle of long-extinct creatures. [READ MORE]\n\nPLESIOSAUR - PADDLE\n\"Like a sea serpent run through a turtle.\" ~ William Buckland, Oxford University Geology Lectures, 1832\nPlesiosaurs were incredibly successful creatures. Featuring a long, snake-like neck and a stout body equipped with slender paddles, Plesiosaurs are one of the most readily identifiable of all ancient marine reptiles. [READ MORE]\nPLIOSAUR - BONE\n\"Pliosaurs were generalist predators at the top of the food chain, able to prey on reptiles and fishes up to half their own length.\" ~ Dr. Davide Foffa, Vertebrate Paleontologist\nPliosaurs had short necks and large heads with powerful jaws. With some species reaching lengths of 10m (30ft) or more, these apex predators dominated the oceans of their day, hunting a variety of prey including fellow marine reptiles. [READ MORE]\n\nICHTHYOSAUR - VERTEBRA\n\"I by no means consider it wholly a fish, when compared to other fishes, but rather view it in a similar light to those animals met with in New South Wales.\" ~ Sir Everard Home, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (June 23, 1814)\nIchthyosaurs were marine reptiles with streamlined bodies. They were air-breathing creatures with two nostrils situated far back on the top of the head, similar in shape to a modern porpoise. Ichthyosaurs likely fed on fish using their numerous sharp teeth and enormous eyes to locate prey in deep water. [READ MORE]\nMOSASAUR - TOOTH\n\"The Mosasaur used surprise and the thrust of his muscular tail to outrun his prey with a short burst of speed.\" ~ Michael J. Everhart, Oceans of Kansas\nMosasaurs were among the last of the great Mesozoic marine reptile lines. Their skulls were flexible and their jaws double-hinged. While this arrangement allowed a Mosasaur to swallow prey whole, the alignment of a Mosasaur's teeth with \"bony crypts\" to protect emerging teeth also suggests Mosasaurs likely crushed bones and shells as frequently as they tore into flesh. [READ MORE]\nBRACHIOSAURUS - FEMUR\n\"This then was the giraffe among dinosaurs...\" ~ Elmer Riggs (1903)\nBest known for their powerful silhouette, Brachiosaurus roamed western North America during the Late Jurassic. Their long necks reached upwards of 9m (30ft), sloping sharply towards muscular shoulders. [READ MORE]\nDIPLODOCUS - ANKLE\n\"It is pleasing to think that the first residents of Earth to exceed the sound barrier were not humans, but rather diplodocus sauropods.\" ~ Nathan Myhrvold \"Supersonic sauropods? Tail dynamics in the diplodocids.\"\nWith a whip-like tail, Diplodocus was one of the longest dinosaurs, stretching  33m (110ft) from head to tail. Balancing 10-16 metric tons across such a long frame required strong legs with semi-fixed ankles and toes. [READ MORE]\nCRETACEOUS AMBER - WITH INSECT (L) and ROUGH (S) \n\"A window to a unique, highly diverse Mesozoic microbiota worthy of intense exploration.\" ~ Dr. David A. Grimaldi, Curator, \"Fossiliferous Cretaceous Amber from Myanmar (Burma): Its Rediscovery, Biotic Diversity, and Paleontological Significance\"\nAge of Dinosaurs contains two different amber specimens from the Late Cretaceous Period. The Large features a small, polished bead of amber from the Hukawng Valley of Northern Myanmar (Burma) which also includes a small arthropod (insect, arachnid, etc). The Small version contains a fragment of rough amber from the ancient coastal deposits of the Black Creek Formation (North Carolina, USA). [READ MORE]\nATLASAURUS - BONE\n\"The description of new genera and new species of dinosaurs discovered recently in North Africa completely changed the vision we had.\" ~ Dr. Philippe Taquet, \"The Dinosaurs of Maghreb: the History of their Discovery\"\nDiscovered high in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, Atlasaurus was a specialized sauropod genus from the mid-Jurassic. Estimated at about 50ft (15m) long and weighing 15 tons, this sauropod had extremely long limbs paired with a relatively short neck. [READ MORE]\nAPATOSAURUS - BONE \n\"I saw eight of the tail bones in exact position. It was a beautiful sight.\" ~ Earl Douglass (August 17, 1909)\nApatosaurus is one of the best-known of all sauropods. In the public mind, this popularity is due to early confusion that led to the skulls of other sauropods being mounted on their skeletons under the name of Brontosaurus. [READ MORE]\nIGUANODON - BONE \n\"There was a period when the earth was peopled by oviparous quadrupeds of a most appalling magnitude.\" ~ Dr. Gideon Mantell, \"The Geological Age of Reptiles\" (1831)\nIguanodons were prolific herbivores spanning the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous Periods. These dinosaurs had a horny beak whose superficial resemblance resulted in their name (\"iguana tooth\"). [READ MORE]\nSTEGOSAURUS - PLATE\n\"A five-ton ballet dancer with an armor-plated tutu of flipping bony triangles and a swinging war club.\" ~ Robert T. Bakker, The Dinosaur Heresies\nThe plates and spikes of Stegosaurus are called osteoderms, bony deposits that form in the skin rather than growing as extensions of the skeleton. Lacking an anchor to the skeleton, some scientists believe that Stegosaurus's plates would provide limited mechanical protection. [READ MORE]\nTRICERATOPS -  BROW HORN\n\"The horns also had a real role in physical combat.\" ~ Andrew A. Farke, Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology \"Evidence of Combat in Triceratops\"\nTriceratops measured 29ft (9m) long and 10ft (3m) tall, with the head comprising nearly one-third the overall length. Studies of the incidence of lesions in the cranium and frill suggest that the Triceratops used its horns in combat and the frill was an adaptation for protection. [READ MORE]\nANKYLOSAURUS - ARMOR\n\"The armor are bones that form within the skin, just like crocodiles.\" ~ Ken Carpenter, Director USU Eastern Prehistoric Museum\nCovered in rows of bony plates and wielding a powerful clubbed tail, the Ankylosaurs are one of the most distinctive and successful of all dinosaur families. Various species of this sturdy dinosaur can be found on every continent on earth. [READ MORE]\n\nPACHYCEPHALOSAURUS -  DOME\n\"The domes could withstand considerable impact force at certain closing speeds.\" ~ Eric Snively and Andrew Cox \"Structural mechanics of pachycephalosaur crania permitted head-butting behavior.\"\nInstantly recognizable by their massive frontoparietal domes, Pachycephalosaurs were a group of bipedal dinosaurs that roamed the Late Cretaceous Period. [READ MORE]\nHADROSAUR - BONE\n\"Hadrosaurs grew rapidly, and quantifying their growth is key to understanding life-history interactions between predators and prey during the Late Cretaceous.\" ~ Lisa Noelle Cooper, \"Relative growth rates of predator and prey dinosaurs reflect effects of predation.\"\nHadrosaurs were a large family of ornithischian dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period. Related to Iguanodons, they are known primarily for their \"duck-bills\" which are in fact elongated rostral bone structures which give the appearance of a beak. [READ MORE]\nPTEROSAUR - WING BONE\n\"One of these strange animals, whose appearance would be frightful did they occur alive at the present day, may have been of the size of a thrush.\" ~ Georges Cuvier Th\u00e9orie de la terre (1821)\nSpanning more than 160 million years across the fossil record, Pterosaurs were a diverse group of flying reptiles that dominated the skies of the Mesozoic Era. [READ MORE]\nALLOSAURUS - VERTEBRA \n\"This genus may be distinguished from any known Dinosaurs by the vertebrae, which are peculiarly modified to ensure lightness.\" ~ Othniel Charles Marsh (1877)\nAllosaurus was one of the most dominant predators of the Late Jurassic Period. This large theropod is known for its powerful, three-fingered forelimbs, wide gape, and iconic \"hornlets\" over the eyes. [READ MORE]\nSPINOSAURUS - SPINE  (L) and TOOTH (S) \n\"Spinosaurus appears to have been poorly adapted to bipedal terrestrial locomotion.\" ~ Dr. Nizar Ibrahim, \"Semiaquatic Adaptations in a Giant Predatory Dinosaur.\"\nTopping out at just over 59ft long (18m), Spinosaurus is one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs ever discovered. Age of Dinosaurs contains two different Spinosaurus specimens. The Large features a fragment of a Spinosaurus vertebra which includes the neural spines. The Small includes a fragment of a Spinosaurus tooth. [READ MORE]\nRAPTOR - DROMAEOSAURID BONE\n\"You bred raptors?\" ~ Dr. Alan Grant, Jurassic Park\nKnown popularly as \"raptors,\" dromaeosaurids were a diverse family of feathered theropod dinosaurs. Like birds, dromaeosaurids had a global distribution and varied widely in size, from smaller than a modern-day chicken to large, powerful predators measuring more than 18ft (6m) in length from tooth-to-tail. [READ MORE]\nTYRANNOSAURUS REX - TOOTH (L) and VERTEBRA (S)\n\"We need to start thinking of dinosaurs as not just brutes and not just monsters, and not just things with sharp teeth and sharp claws, but as really active, intelligent, energetic animals.\" ~ Dr. Steve Brusatte (2018)\nMeasuring 40ft (12m) in length and weighing upwards of 14 tons, Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the largest and most powerful terrestrial predators in history. Age of Dinosaurs contains two different T. rex specimens. The Large features a fragment of a T. rex tooth, and the Small version contains a fragment of a T. rex vertebra. [READ MORE]\nDEATH OF THE DINOSAURS - DECCAN TRAPS and K-PG BOUNDARY\n\"The species extinctions prior to the generally assumed impact event implied by the Ir anomaly, and the long recovery period of the ecosystem thereafter cannot be explained by a single impact, but suggest that multiple causes may be responsible such as climatic changes, volcanism, a sea level drop, production of warm saline bottom water and the chemical consequences associated with increased salinity.\" ~ Dr. Gerta Keller, Princeton University (1988)\n\"Impact of a large earth-crossing asteroid would inject about 60 times the object's mass into the atmosphere as pulverized rock; a fraction of this dust would stay in the stratosphere for several years and be distributed worldwide. The resulting darkness would suppress photosynthesis, and the expected biological consequences match quite closely the extinctions observed in the paleontological record.\" ~ Dr. Luis Alvarez and Dr. Walter Alvarez (1980)\nThe large-scale geological event known as the End-Cretaceous Mass Extinction had a profound influence on life on our planet. Three-quarters of all life perished in a geological instant, including all non-avian dinosaur species.\nWe mark the end of the Mesozoic Era with the physical evidence behind the two leading theories for the death of the dinosaurs: the flood basalts of the Indian Subcontinent known as the Deccan Traps and the K-Pg Boundary from the Chicxulub Asteroid Impact.

Providing instant coolness and ultimate comfort.  \nSilver has been used by NASA, US Special Forces, and Olympic athletes to create germ free textiles. Bamboo charcoal\u2019s activated carbon absorb toxins, prevents mould growth and purifies air by absorbing harmful gasses.\nAir Cells increase comfort and breathability that is linked to sweating and snoring during sleeping. The combination of the textiles wick moisture away twice as fast as cotton, reducing the humidity in your bed by up to 50%. \nThe problem with traditional pillows is that they require porous materials to create a soft comfortable feel. In as little as 7 days, millions of colony forming units of bacteria can grow inside this permeable space where mold and other pathogens can thrive. This leads to allergies, skin irritation and many illnesses. \nAlpha's bamboo charcoal infused memory foam allows the pillow to mould into the shape of your head and neck, supporting the sensitive pressure areas to help you relax and help with insomnia. \nImpinged nerves can trigger migraines, ensuring that your spine is alined correctly in its natural position it will minimize nerve irritation. It will also help to relieve muscle tension around the neck area. \nAlpha allows your spine to be alined and it elevates your upper body, unblocking the airways and opening nasal passages so you can breathe easier. Alpha's Dimensions: 60 x 40 x 12 cm.\nSilver binds to essential cell components like DNA to neutralize their harmful effect.

We do this by making clothing that is not only good for you but for the world too. Our clothes are designed to eliminate odour, thereby requiring you to wash them less often, leading to less wasted water, energy and wear on your clothes.\nBorn out the frustration that our clothes would never be the way we wanted, we set out to disrupt an outdated industry which is focused on planned obsolescence, the practice of intentionally and artificially limiting the useful life of a product for the purpose of driving more sales, something we're completely against.\nWe\u2019re dedicated to crafting high-quality timeless products designed to last (and, hence, reduce waste). Our products are made from some of the best materials and are intentionally designed to last for years.\nComments on the SilverSocks\nSome people who've written about us\n\n\nHow it works\nThe Cotton is intertwined with threads of our patented Silver fibers that weave in and out to ensure full coverage.\nWhen any part of the Silver touches a bacterial cell, it breaks down its cell wall until the bacteria is no longer able to function, effectively rendering it inactive and unable to produce the pungent smell that comes when it feeds on your sweat.\nMethod of Application\nOur patented Silver fibers are made from a specialist design allowing them to be woven directly into the fabric. During manufacture, the Cotton fibers are intertwined with our patented Silver fibers to ensure each and every surface is covered. \nComfort, Hygiene and Versatility\nThe three pillars of everything we make are underscored by comfort, hygiene and versatility. We believe that every single thing you wear should be the best version that exists. \nOur main focus above all is comfort, because who's going to wear something that doesn't feel great? We try our hardest to give your clothes that extra cosy feel. You can see everything we use in our garments below.\nHygiene is the second of our pillars which is a huge part of our culture as many clothes get smelly very easily and need washing after every single wear which ultimately leads to degradation. Our garments don't smell for up to seven days, so you can pack light on that weekend away and come back wearing the clothes you went in (so you've got plenty of space for presents).\nLast but by no means the least, versatility. We believe everything you buy should withstand everything you do, so whether you're at work, at the gym or even on a hike, all our clothing is made to withstand any environment so you won't need any athletic or smart versions of your clothes to take up more room in your wardrobe. \n\n\nOrigins of Cotton\nGrown from a soft, fluffy boll that's cultivated all over the world -  and even on the far side of the moon, - cotton is by far one of the oldest and most widespread materials around.\nUsually planted in the spring, it is a perennial that lives on year after year and keeps growing. With evidence of use in the old world before 5000 BC, it sits firmly near the top of the most resilient fabrics around.\nWhat Does It Do?\nCotton is super lightweight and durable and as a result, is one of the best base materials there is. The soft-to-the-touch quality ensures comfort and cosiness with every wear.\nWith its roots in the neolithic period, cotton is a reliable, weather-proof insulator that's perfect at any moment and for every occasion.\nThe comfortable yet flexible stretch makes cotton the perfect fabric to use in all garments, along with its hypoallergenic properties that make it a flawless favourite.\nWith the prominently high tensile strength of the twill weave, it's able to withstand multiple washes without a problem.\nSustainable Farming\nWe only source our cotton from organic crops which haven't been adulterated by genetic modification. This gives an experience as similar to the original cotton that we strive to implement. By cutting out the use of pesticides and other chemicals, we can ensure all our garments are held to a higher standard and free from allergens. \n\nFor our first major product launch, we chose Kickstarter as the community is both intrigued by new inventions and incredibly useful as a sounding board to help us understand if our ideas would work out.\nWe were picked up by many outlets in the wake of our launch that by the end of it all we had shipped over 10,000+ pairs of our SilverSocks No-Show across all our platforms. This gave us the green light that we were doing something that was in very high demand and we knew we couldn't stop there.\nWith our first product hitting shelves and our team working tirelessly to keep up with orders on our site, we were being asked by thousands of customers if we'd be able to make our socks in a longer crew version that they were more used to. \nEven with the demand, we had to spend countless months perfecting every single aspect so as to ensure we'd release only the best version before launch day. Again, we were picked up by outlets across the globe and the SilverSocks Crew flew past its goal overnight. By the end of it all, we had shipped over 15,000+ pairs on all our platforms. \nRight now, at this moment in time, we've sold over 50,000+ pairs to over 160+ countries across the world which is something we wouldn't ever have imagined.\nIt's all thanks to you, our supporters. \nThank you. \nQ: Does the SilverUnderwear only come in Cotton and these colours? \nA: If the campaign does well, we\u2019ll add more colours and/or materials if there is demand.\n\nQ: How much does shipping cost to my country? \nA: We offer Free Tracked Shipping across the world, wherever you are.\n\nQ: How do I choose my colour, size, style (mens/womens) and provide my shipping address?\nA: The BackerKit surveys will be sent out 14-16 days after the campaign ends.\n        You'll receive them to your Kickstarter email - everything you need to give us will be provided in there.\n\nQ: How do I track my package? \nA: You will be emailed a link three days before it goes into the carrier's system which will let you track your package every step of the way.\n\nQ: Is there any warranty? \nA: All our products come with a one year warranty, free of charge.\n            This is in addition to your statutory consumer rights.\n\nI have another question you haven't answered here \nThere are a bunch of ways to contact us to enquire or even make your thoughts known -

With a no-tie lace design, you can easily slip the shoe on or off \u2014 no time wasted.\nA discrete YKK zipper closure system located on the side of the shoe provides function and style. We blend our modified slip-on system with modern materials to maintain a stylish boot silhouette.\nWe believe that feeling amazing starts with where you stand. The sneaker-boots are lighter than most, which makes activities easier and less strenuous on your feet. The boot shell consists of 4-way stretch fabric for an extra comfortable fit.\nAn optimal contoured cushioning design evenly distributes the weight of your body, relieving the pressure and shock of each step. A sculpted insole provides support on the arch and heel for all-day comfort. Your feet won\u2019t ache after a long day, bringing you a new level of comfort.\nThe sneaker-boots are engineered with highly durable materials such as military-grade Cordura and Japanese armor. \nThe toe boxes of the shoes have TPR mudguard protection, the tips of the recycled plastic cords are dipped in rubber to prevent fraying ends, and the soles feature a unique water flushing pattern with a sawtooth profile to provide excellent grip in all types of weather.\nThe sneaker-boots are 100% waterproof and snowproof. \nNot only is the entire shoe welded TPR for weather protection, but it also keeps water out with a waterproof YKK zipper. The weatherproof material also has insulating layer keeping your toes warm from the cold and snow.\nOur footwear is man-made with ethical manufacturing procedures. We strive to limit our carbon footprint to help preserve the environment. \nWe use materials like recycled plastic and 100% natural, biodegradable rubber to create our shoes. We are also vegan-friendly \u2014 we do not use animal by-products. \nPeople love shoes. The average American owns about 19 pairs of shoes at one time. You might have hiking shoes, running shoes, rain boots, casual sneakers, snow boots and desert boots. Imagine buying a single pair that could work in all of these occasions. \nFor those who value quality over quantity, combining your favorite, essential pairs of shoes into one sensible, attractive pair would be a dream. We made it our goal to present the eco-friendly, exceptionally crafted, affordable shoe option. Our company promises this to you, in addition to comfort, longevity and versatility. \nWe can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make SKYE Sneaker-Boots a reality. \nWe know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, but if you like SKYE Sneaker-Boots, please help us spread the word on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and anywhere else you can think of! \nWe\u2019re only happy if you\u2019re super-comfy and look great. We\u2019ll be sure to exchange your shoes as long as they have not been worn outside, still have the tags attached, and are accompanied by the original receipt within 30 days of receiving the shoes. \nOnce our shoes are available for retail (a few months after backers receive the early-birds), you\u2019ll need to purchase your correct size from us at retail, and we\u2019ll refund the difference.

As a company we're committed to reducing food waste, so all of our packaging is 100% compostable in municipal and industrial composting facilities according to ASTM D6400 specifications. \nCheck out Eka and Justin packaging some bars by hand:\nIs this a \"white chocolate\"?\nAnswer: NO! Technically speaking, white chocolate is supposed to have dairy in it, so this bar doesn't meet the definition of white chocolate. Additionally, since we created this bar from \"cocoa butter to bar\" we're able adjust the ratios of all the ingredients, which is why we're able to use the same amount of sweetener that a dark chocolate bar typically has. The bold, lightly bitter turmeric root balances the sweetness and makes this bar truly unique amongst other chocolate bars in the world. \nI have an allergy to ________, can I eat your chocolate?\nOur facility processes tree nuts, and this bar contains coconut. Our craft chocolate micro factory is free from all other major allergens like wheat/gluten, soy, and dairy. \nIs your chocolate organic?\nYES - this bar will be 100% certified organic!\nIs your chocolate fair trade?\nYES - as a company we typically buy cacao and other ingredients decoupled from commodity market rates, which means farmers can depend on a steady, higher-than-market rate level of compensation for the ingredients we purchase from them. We're big believers in fair & transparent trade for everything we do! Check out the blog on our website at www.endorfinfoods.com/slowchocolate if you'd like to learn more.\nTell me about your single origin cocoa butter!\nThe cocoa butter we'll be using to make this bar is pressed from single origin, regeneratively grown cacao from Ecuador, from a farmer group we've been purchasing from for several years. We're the first chocolate company in the world to have paid higher levels of compensation for regeneratively grown cacao, and to commit to sourcing 100% regeneratively grown cacao for all the bars we produce, whether its this new Golden Mylk bar or any of the other bars in our lineup of all-stars and award-winners.\nI've heard that golden milk needs to be consumed warm and/or with black pepper to be absorbed, how does this bar achieve maximum bioavailability?\nTo release the full bioavailability of the healthy compounds in turmeric, it needs to be heated in the presence of lipids (fats) for a period of time, and consumed with a small amount of black pepper. By virtue of the chocolate making process, the turmeric is exposed to hot molten cocoa butter for 12+ hours before we add just a touch of black pepper essential oil during the tempering process, to achieve the perfect balance of flavor and function. We've done all the work for you to have a perfectly portable, edible version of golden milk any time of day. \nDo you have your own website outside of Kickstarter?\nYes! Check it out at www.endorfinfoods.com - we've been in business for over 5 years!\nWhat's the shelf-life for your chocolate bars? \nA little over a year from the date we make them.\nCan you send me information on purchasing these bars wholesale for my boutique, grocery store, etc?\nYes! These bars will be available to current and future retail partners around the United States. Please send an email to orders@endorfinfoods.com if you're interested in our wholesale program.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenges we could see from this project is getting serious demand, which would just mean we'd need some extra time to make and ship all the bars for backers of this Kickstarter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Early Bird Special - 5 Chocolate Bars", "descp": "Be one of the first in the world to try Golden Mylk chocolate!

Technically speaking, white chocolate is supposed to have dairy in it, so this bar doesn't meet the definition of white chocolate. Additionally, since we created this bar from \"cocoa butter to bar\" we're able adjust the ratios of all the ingredients, which is why we're able to use the same amount of sweetener that a dark chocolate bar typically has. The bold, lightly bitter turmeric root balances the sweetness and makes this bar truly unique amongst other chocolate bars in the world. \nI have an allergy to ________, can I eat your chocolate?\nOur facility processes tree nuts, and this bar contains coconut. Our craft chocolate micro factory is free from all other major allergens like wheat/gluten, soy, dairy. \nIs your chocolate organic?\nYES - this bar will be 100% certified organic!\nIs your chocolate fair trade?\nYES - as a company we typically buy cacao and other ingredients decoupled from commodity market rates, which means farmers can depend on a steady, higher-than-market rate level of compensation for the ingredients we purchase from them. We're big believers in transparent trade for everything we do!\nTell me about your single origin cocoa butter!\nThe cocoa butter we'll be using to make this bar is pressed from single origin, regeneratively grown cacao from Ecuador, from a farmer group we've been purchasing from for several years. We're the first chocolate company in the world to have paid higher levels of compensation for regeneratively grown cacao, and to commit to sourcing 100% regeneratively grown cacao for all the bars we produce, whether its this new Golden Mylk bar or any of the other bars in our lineup of all-starts and award-winners.\nI've heard that golden milk needs to be consumed warm and/or with black pepper to be absorbed, how does this bar achieve maximum bioavailability?\nTo release the full bioavailability of the healthy compounds in turmeric, it needs to be heated in the presence of lipids (fats) for a period of time, and consumed with a small amount of black pepper. By virtue of the chocolate making process, the turmeric is exposed to hot molten cocoa butter for 12+ hours before we add just a touch of black pepper essential oil during the tempering process, to achieve the perfect balance of flavor and function. We've done all the work for you to have a perfectly portable, edible version of golden milk any time of day. \nCan you send me information on purchasing these bars wholesale for my boutique, grocery store, etc?\nYes! These bars will be available to current and future retail partners around the United States.

The main compartment of the backpack can be separated from the rest of the bag - perfect for clothes, camera equipment etc. The rest of the bag is loaded with pockets and organiser areas to stash your stuff.\nFeeling in a messenger mood? Bringing a backpack? The commuter easily switches between three different modes - backpack, laptop and messenger bag - perfect for any occasion. \nWhere do you ship from? \nAll of our goods are manufactured in China and will be shipped directly from Hong Kong. \n Do you charge for shipping? \nWe charge a small amount for shipping. The cost varies from country-to-country. You can see the price during the checkout process. \n Will I be charged Tax in the EU? \nCustomers in certain countries in the EU (France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain) will NOT have to pay tax on arrival. We will pre-pay all customs taxes, duties and admin fees meaning no sudden surprises during delivery! Customers in other EU countries may have to pay tax but we will do our best to minimise these. Please note that other than the countries listed above, we are not able to pay these taxes on your behalf. \nWill I be charged Tax elsewhere?\nTaxes vary from country to country and due to the global nature of Kickstarter, it's impossible for us to make arrangements for every single country. However, we have done our best to minimise any taxes and import fees for you by either shipping from local hubs or pre-paying the taxes on individual shipments. Backers in France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain do not have to worry about additional taxes and fees, as we have paid these in advance.\nBackers in the following countries should also not have to pay any additional fees: the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. Based on our experience, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines should generally be fine but larger pledges (e.g. the multi-pack) may incur additional import fees. Backers in other EU countries may have to pay VAT or other import duties. Backers in Mexico, Brazil, India and Russia should be aware that the import process can be quite tricky and you may need to provide us with your tax information prior to shipping. \nHow long will shipping take? \nShipping will take between 3-7 days for most countries. We'll update all backers several days before our shipping commences and will notify you as soon as your product is on its way. Will my products be trackable? Yes! All orders will be fully trackable. We'll send tracking numbers out to you via email 2-3 days after your order has been shipped.\nCan I get a refund if I don't like my product? \nUnlike most Kickstarter campaigns, our backers are able to claim a refund if they change their minds. Please be aware that the Kickstarter fees are not refundable and the return shipping fee will be borne by the backer. \n Is there a warranty on the bags? \nYes! All products come with a one year warranty. The warranties cover all manufacturing defects. More information can be found on our website. \nHow do I contact your support team? \nPlease send an email to support@code10bags.com \n OTHER QUERIES If you have queries or concerns about Kickstarter and backing a campaign on Kickstarter, please visit the Kickstarter FAQs here. \n Who are Code10? \nCode 10 was founded by Chris + Charlie, two product designers from Switzerland and the UK. We met whilst working in Hong Kong a city where your working life and the outdoors blend together. We both love to travel, surf and spend our time adventuring, which is how we ended up deciding to make perfect adventure bags!\n Why Theftproof? \n Although Hong Kong is generally a safe place, it\u2019s still a big city and there\u2019s always the risk of pick-pocketing and petty theft. We therefore designed the pockets on the bag so that we could keep our valuables in an easy-to-reach position, but also completely out of reach of criminals.\nWhy Waterproof? \nWith regular \"Code 10\" typhoons, Hong Kong can be a very rainy place - like many tropical places, it can go from sunshine to rain in a matter of seconds. Over the last few years we therefore found ourselves using waterproof bags a lot, especially if we knew we would be taking our laptops to a client meeting in the morning, then heading off to a beach or a hiking trail in the afternoon.\n     ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge HK$ 389 or more", "title": "Early Bird - SLING", "descp": "1* SLING Theftproof Bag\nEarly Bird special", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["32 backers", "Limited (18 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 459 or more", "title": "Kickstarter Discount - SLING", "descp": "1* SLING Theftproof Bag", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 699 or more", "title": "Super Early Bird - COMMUTER", "descp": "1* COMMUTER Theftproof Bag\nSuper Early Bird special", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["47 backers", "Limited (3 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 769 or more", "title": "Multipack - 2 x SLING", "descp": "2* SLING Theftproof Bag", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 769 or more", "title": "Early Bird - COMMUTER", "descp": "1* COMMUTER Theftproof Bag\nEarly Bird special", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (19 left of 25)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 899 or more", "title": "Kickstarter Discount - COMMUTER", "descp": "1* COMMUTER Theftproof Bag", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 1,089 or more", "title": "Early Bird - COMBO", "descp": "1* COMMUTER Theftproof Bag\n1* SLING Theftproof Bag\nEarly Bird special", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["30 backers", "Limited (20 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 1,299 or more", "title": "Kickstarter Discount - COMBO", "descp": "1* COMMUTER Theftproof Bag\n1* SLING Theftproof Bag", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 1,499 or more", "title": "Multipack - 2 x COMMUTER", "descp": "2* COMMUTER Theftproof Bag", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 3,099 or more", "title": "Multipack - 10 x SLING", "descp": "10* SLING Theftproof Bag", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 6,999 or more", "title": "Multipack - 10 x COMMUTER", "descp": "10* COMMUTER Theftproof Bag", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 299 or more", "title": "Super Early Bird - SLING", "descp": "1* SLING Theftproof Bag\nSuper Early Bird special", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "50 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 899 or more", "title": "Super Early Bird - COMBO", "descp": "1* COMMUTER Theftproof Bag\n1* SLING Theftproof Bag\nSuper Early Bird special", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "50 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Shipping update", "update_content": "Hey everyone,  \nWe hope you're all having a great start into the New Year!

I agree with @Luis Trindade, especially on no. 2, based on the images I saw on the website, the back part of the bag is the same material as the front, I mean no breathable mesh to prevent sweat. Because that's one of the issues I noticed in my backpacks (in general), tropical weather here causes excessive sweat on the back which leaves a dark mark on my shirt when taking off the bag; which ruins my outfit especially when there are formal meetings with the clients. But based on my experience, having the back part a breathable mesh doesn't mean it'll prevent the sweating, most of the time it makes things worst; because behind the mesh is always a thick foam that promises comfort at the back where in reality, it increases the body temperature at the back, and increases the sweating as well. But if the breathable mesh / anti sweat is not possible at this campaign, it\u2019s completely fine. I think on your next project you can make a backpack that is really breathable on the back. Like with a thin exoskeleton mesh type at the back, that will prevent a direct contact of the backpack\u2019s back to the body of person wearing the bag, which will allow a real air flow. For now, I think @Luis Trindade's suggestion no 5 would do, so that I won't ruin my extra shirt \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23.

If you know the scale of your melody, these 7 chords in the corresponding set give you an instant starting point. Move between chords in a set, and move between sets themselves, to create unique chord progressions for your music simply and effectively.\n\n\n\nNow this process is even easier with The Really Useful Chord Progression Poster!\n\nThe poster displays all 24 Major and Minor chord sets on one easy-to-read poster, giving you everything you need to create interesting chord progressions and jam away to your heart's content. It\u2019s fully illustrated, so you don\u2019t have to be able to read traditional musical notation to use it. But even if you can, it\u2019s a lot more immediate and easy to use. It\u2019s just the right size to fit on your wall in front of your piano or keyboard. And they ship anywhere in the world, making it the perfect gift for yourself or someone you love.\n\n\n\nFormats\nThe poster is available in a range of formats to suit different budgets and applications. We\u2019ve got you (and your wall) covered.\n\nDigital Version - Downloadable, printable PDF version of the poster. This will be sent out immediately after the campaign is over.\n\nFolded \u2013 A1 Size. Printed on 170gsm gloss paper. Folded down to A4 which means it is much cheaper to ship. Comes with a FREE Digital copy of the poster as soon as the campaign is over.\n\nRolled - A1 Size. Printed on 250gsm gloss paper. Comes rolled in a cardboard tube. This means there are no creases in the poster, but it does cost more to ship. Comes with a FREE Digital copy of the poster as soon as the campaign is over.\n\n\n\nFunding & Rewards\n\nFunding\n\nWe've developed the product, designed the brand, built the website and shot the video.

This means with a bit of luck, your poster will be with you by Christmas!\n\nConclusion\n\nThis poster was designed out of a genuine need to bring certain learning resources together onto 1 easily-accessible format. We are really happy with the end product, and genuinely believe it will help many people learn to play and compose music far more easily. We love that thought, we love this product and we love this business. We hope you do too.\n\n\nPackaging\n\nDepending on which version of the poster you buy, it will be shipped in different packaging.\n\nFolded \u2013 These A1 posters are folded down to A4 size (the same size as a sheet of office paper) and placed inside a mailing envelope. This means the overall package is very small and light, therefore it is much cheaper to ship than any of the other options.\n\nRolled \u2013 This version is the same size as the Folded version (A1), but they come rolled rather than folded (meaning they arrive with you crease-free). They are shipped inside an A1-sized cardboard mailing-tube, which means they are more expensive to ship than the Standard version.\n\nCarriers & Transit Times\n\nAll versions (apart from Folded posters shipping to the UK) are sent via tracked and signed services, meaning you'll receive a tracking number for your order once it has been dispatched, and you'll be required to sign for the package once it reaches you.\n\nUK\nFolded\nService: Royal Mail 1st Class Average transit time: 1-2 working days\nRolled\nService: Royal Mail Special Delivery Average transit time: 1-2 working days\n\nEurope\nFolded\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed Average transit time: 7-10 working days\nRolled\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed Average transit time: 7-10 working days\n\nUnited States & Canada\nFolded\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed Average transit time: 7-10 working days\nRolled\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed Average transit time: 7-10 working days\n\nRest of the World (ROW)\nFolded\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed Average transit time: 10-12 working days\nRolled\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed Average transit time: 10-12 working days\n\nCost\n\nUK\nFolded - \u00a33\nRolled - \u00a38\n\nEurope\nFolded - \u00a39\nRolled - \u00a311\n\nUnited States & Canada\nFolded - \u00a310\nRolled - \u00a315\n\nRest of the World (ROW)\nFolded - \u00a310\nRolled - \u00a315\n\n-", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've developed the product, designed the brand, built the website and shot the video.

Make more time. \nHave more fun. Save some cats.\nWe all have too much to do in a day. And there are no less than one gazillion productivity tools to help you do everything on your list. And it\u2019s not just YOUR list, is it? It\u2019s the list from work. The list from school. The list from life! And then there\u2019s laundry or dishes or just buying toilet paper and putting it on the dang roll.\nYou know who doesn\u2019t worry about stuff? Kittens. And yet, look at them go. Little productive members of feline society, such as it is. Kittens get the same 24 hours you do, I do and every  king, emperor and president has ever gotten since the dawn of time.\nThe trick to getting stuff done is managing those 24 hours. We've gamified your productivity AND added adorable cats.\nThe cards in Kitten Things Done are designed to help you make yourself accountable, in a tangible and fun way -- and to DO all the things you have to do each day. It\u2019s flexible enough to use it with other productivity systems, like Reminders on your iPhone, or a web-based, collaborative online project management system. Really! Think of it as a meta-tool. \nHow It Works\nBuild your deck using the cards included. There\u2019s a good sampling of the \u201cstuff\u201d most people who work in offices have to do: Meetings, planning, projects, checking email, and so on (full list below). Each card is a 30-minute increment, so you build a daily deck of 16 cards for your 8-hour day, then another 16 for when you get home, and we\u2019ve thrown in an 8-hour \u201csleep\u201d card because we\u2019re optimistic you can get fully rested.\nAs you go through your day, you\u2019ll \u201cplay\u201d each card, and set a timer for each item. As you work through the cards, you\u2019ll see the discard pile add up, meaning you\u2019ve been very productive! If you don\u2019t get to something or want to put it off, just toss it in the discard pile or move it to tomorrow\u2019s deck.\nBefore you go to bed, check what you did that day by looking at your discarded cards on one side of the wallet (or whatever system you have for keeping track -- it could be your back pocket, we\u2019re flexible!).\nNow, before you go to sleep, build your next day with the cards in the deck and whatever you pushed off to tomorrow. Your day can\u2019t total more than 24 hours! But it CAN total less, especially if you\u2019re on vacation\u2026\nWhen you wake up, as you do stuff, just move the card that matches what you\u2019re doing to the discard side and voila! You\u2019re keeping track! You\u2019re getting stuff done!\nNow, the idea here is you can use KSD cards as you see fit. They could be something you go to when you\u2019re like, \u201cwhat do I do next?\u201d Or, you could use them as you check things off a list, moving through your deck to account for all the big and small things you accomplished that day. There are cards that allow for flex time, or time spent chatting with co-workers, and so on. Plus, if you suffer from decision fatigue, just pull one randomly and let fate decide your next task! \nDesigned For Real-World Use\nPersonally, I developed these while working a 50+hours a week gig in tech news. I worked at home, and it can be hard to stay on task. So I started using the Pomodoro technique, which makes you focus on a task for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break. That\u2019s essentially the system! But Pomodoros are just blocks of time. I had generally similar things to do every day, but not always. Some days I\u2019d have a two-hour meeting, and others I\u2019d need two hours to just write. I hated juggling projects, so I needed a kicker to remind me to jump into project mode. All of this was coming from a very unstructured life, but one I had to keep on track every day. I merged the notion of blocks of time based on stuff that had to get done (projects, checking email, writing, etc.) with Pomodoros, and originally called it Pommes. \nBut kittens are more fun. Plus, I now have two kittens, KitCat and Jiji, and they are as opposite as night and day. I had planned to write a book on how kittens get stuff done without really trying, but I like games, so here we are. And there's sort of a game included... those numbers on the cards actually account for the energy you \"gain\" while doing things. Some are energizing, some are depleting. If we get go over our funding level, we'll explain how that works in more detail with a special treat.\nBuy now and save\nThe Psychology\nBuild your deck as you\u2019d like to spend your time through the day. Put the LAST thing you want to do that day FACE UP (meaning the kitten doing the thing is facing up on the table), then keep adding stuff face up. Ideally, Evening Ritual is that first card (on the bottom), and Morning Ritual is at the top. \nAs you go through the day, take the card off the top, and move it over (and turn it over for maximum satisfaction). If your day gets thrown off whack -- maybe a fender bender, maybe a forgotten lunch at home -- you can just move the cards around! Nothing wrong with that.\nAt the end of the day, you can easily see what you missed in your plans, and tomorrow you can course-correct. \nThis gives you the brain rush of checking off a to do list (which you can still do!), and something tangible so you're not checking your phone or computer and getting distracted all the time. \nSupport Saving Cats and Artists!\nA portion of the proceeds will go to cat rescue groups. My hope is we can keep making decks, with different artists and themes, plus booster packs, to fit everyone's needs over time. Both of my cats are rescue cats and I believe it's important to help control their population AND find them happy homes! A portion of the print sales will also go to the artists who contribute. \nWe have the printers ready, we have the designs done, and we have the rescue groups picked out for this crowdfunding round. Now all we need is you!\nDesigned for work AND play!\nQuestions? Just ask!\nThank you for helping make this dream come true!\nKeep an eye on the website: kittenstuffdone.com as we\u2019ll announce booster packs and tips on working with the cards! We'll also have a full list of all the artists and where you can find their work outside of the KSD project.\nList of Cards in Base Deck\nHere's the list of 50 base cards included in what is essentially a starter pack, which seems to fit most of our daily workloads.\nInstruction Card\nOne special 8-hour \"sleep\" card (the only card that isn't 30m)\nTwo blank cards you can write on in permanent marker for whatever extras you need\nOne \"Flex Time\" which you can just leave face up all day to account for all those times when stuff happens outside your control (Bob just keeps popping into your office, doesn't he?)\nOne Exercise card, because that's really the minimum, right?\nTwo Meditation cards, which is wishful thinking but oh so nice\nTwo Driving cards, as the average commute in the U.S. should be around 30 minutes (don't worry, we'll have booster packs, or you can use a blank or wild card)\nTwo \"Wild\" cards, to account for even more random stuff, or use more flexibly than the blanks you write on\nOne Napping card, which is always nice\nTwo Project Work cards, to account for those work projects\nThree Cooking cards, because homemade meals are really best for you\nTwo Shopping cards, which you hopefully won't use every day\nOne Set Goals! card, to account for those life goals and work goals you need to think about\nOne Focus Time which can be used for anything, really, as long as you commit to focusing on it exclusively for 30 minutes\nOne Staring Into Space card, because sometimes we need to stare out a window and consider if we should have bought a boat\nTwo Lunch cards\nTwo Dinner cards\nOne Breakfast card\nOne Hobby Time card, because everyone should have a hobby!\nTwo Email cards, because you shouldn't spend too much time in there\nOne Medical Appointment card\nOne Shower/Bath card\nOne Planning card, which could include all sorts of planning, like parties if your name happens to be Angela (that's an Office joke)\nOne Phone card, in case you still use those\nOne Journaling card. If Marcus Aurelius could find the time, so can you!\nOne Social Media card, because you should limit this!\nTwo Reading cards, which could be books, or more email (egad!), or even internet articles\nTwo Entertainment cards, which is how we relax\nOne Snack Time card\nOne generic Work card, in case you just needed to be reminded\nOne Stretch/Yoga to get your day off to a good start or need a reminder to wind down\nTwo Social IRL cards in case you're needing some face time with friends\nOne Meetings card (yeah, that's wishful thinking, but the ideal meeting should only be 30 minutes!)\nOne card for Chores\nOne Morning Ritual card for brushing your teeth and, uh, other things\nOne Evening Ritual card for... again, brushing your teeth and such\nOf course, you're not going to use ALL of these every day -- but we think it's most of the stuff you're likely to do!\nNext Steps\nWith over 20 years of media experience, this isn't my first rodeo. This project has been years in the making, and what you're seeing is the culmination of a lot of refinement and rework. Our supplier is reliable, and there's about a dozen spreadsheets to guide us. We're going to do our very best to ship everything in time for the holidays!\nOf course, the artists are the real heroes here. From locals to well-known illustrators, you can find the full list of artists and their contributions on the Kitten Stuff Done website. \nPlus, we've got a lot of future plans! Braille decks, decks with dragons and other fantasy creatures, lots more booster packs and perhaps even some surprises... Later this year we'll launch forums so people can share success stories and trade ideas and tips. This is the beginning of a long journey, we hope!\nStretch Goals\nHere are some stretch goals if we EXCEED our funding goal:\nAt $10,000 = We'll make the cards using an air linen-finish, plus orders of 2 decks will get a free wallet. And everyone who orders at least ONE deck gets a sticker!\nAt $15,000 = Enamel Pins unlocked! Buy for just an extra $6 on your order, free stickers for everyone! \nAt $20,000 = Plastic Cards unlocked! A 52-card deck deluxe edition PLASTIC cards for $20 (over 20% off)\nAt $30,000 = Art of Kittens Book Unlocked (Available for $45) a picture book of all the artwork (Spring 2019)\nAt $45,000 = Artist-specific coffee mugs! ($20 each) & everyone gets a poster!\nReference the artist and what the cat is doing to order a print", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCards could be subject to tariffs, there could be snafus with printing, and shipping is always a risk factor.

Packed with cutting-edge features -- NEVERQUIT Elevated Merino are the socks that your feet deserve.\nCombining technical materials that combat harsh outdoor conditions, from rustic environments to urban cityscapes.\nWhether your life calls for keeping up with a fast-paced urban lifestyle, or challenging you against the elements of the wilderness, these merino wool socks have got you covered.

When we first perfected our pharma-grade zinc oxide fibers and HexaShock advanced cushioning technology, we headed straight onto Kickstarter with our NEVERQUIT everyday socks. Our production came to fruition with huge success. Learning from our first campaign and listening to our customers, we came back with better ergonomic designs to support your feet and reduce stress on your sole. Our team is now more than prepared to deliver good quality and value, given our hindsight of success! Take the word of some happy customers with happy feet:\nWe hope to keep expanding our work, but regardless of where we end up we could not have done it without the support of an incredible network of customers, suppliers, and friends. A healthy organization creates value that extends far beyond money and into all points of its operation. In short, profit should never be the reason a company exists; PEOPLE are the essential factor.

We\u2019ve been touring North America demoing our jeans at events across the country all while innovating our proprietary technical performance denim making them better than ever!\nWhat started as a stylish climbing pant has quickly evolved into a pant that is perfect for virtually any activity. Introducing Boulder Denim 2.0: stretchier, softer, more water repellent, more durable, and now more affordable than ever!\n...with our limited early bird deals! Early birds run out? You can still save through Kickstarter. Select styles even ship out 3 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends with other styles shipping before Christmas.\nOur athletic fit is designed to have a slim tailored look for men with muscular legs without being skin tight. Most athletic builds have to size up their waist to fit their bigger legs and butt. With our athletic fit, you no longer have to size up the waist.\n Our men\u2019s slim fit is designed to have a slim tailored look for men with a more slender frame. They\u2019re a medium-low rise that fits slim body types perfectly.\nOur men\u2019s jogger-chino hybrid is a cross between our slim and athletic fit that converts from a chino to a jogger with a simple low-profile cinch.\n Our women\u2019s high-rise skinny fit flatters most body types. Our unique contoured waistband sits lower in the front and higher in the back eliminating gapping and preventing the front from digging in when seated.\nOur women\u2019s mid-rise straight leg flatters most body types from curvy to a straighter frame. Slim fitting from the knees up with more room below the knees. Our unique contoured waistband sits lower in the front and higher in the back eliminating gapping and preventing the front from digging in when seated.\nOur jeans are perfect for travel and the outdoors so we wanted to design a puffy jacket that would be the perfect companion to our denim. Our water-resistant hooded puffy jackets have a tailored slim look for both men and women. They are water resistant and feature a waterproof reverse-coil zipper. Our jackets are made with DuPont\u2019s environmental and vegan-friendly Sorona filling that keeps you warm without harming any animals. The jacket also easily rolls into a pouch converting the jacket into a comfortable travel pillow which is perfect for travel, camping or taking a quick nap at work.\n                                    Taz and Brad met 14 years ago as busboys at their local Spaghetti Factory in Vancouver, Canada. They had a \u201cdid we just become best friends\u201d moment after they spent an entire shift discussing business ideas and ways to make the big bucks as 15 year olds. Fast forward 14 years with a couple of successful and failed businesses under their belt, they feel they have finally hit the jackpot with Boulder Denim which allows them to pursue their passion for climbing while building a brand that fits perfectly into their lifestyle. For the past year, Taz and Brad have been touring North America sponsoring climbing festivals and getting the jeans on as many people as possible at climbing gyms across the continent. At the same time, they've been working directly with their manufacturer to make everyone's favourite denim even better and more affordable than ever.\nVideography: Jeff Frieberg of Sora Digital \nPhotography: Levi Harrell, Jeff Fierberg, Mark Scherle, Bradley Spence \nLocation Sets: Bacchus in New Paltz, Central Rock Gym in Warwick \nProps: Peak Design\u2019s Everyday Backpack 30L, Future Motion\u2019s Onewheel XR\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 2nd Kickstarter. Our first time around, we ran into many unforeseen obstacles since we were so fresh to the apparel business. (It took us 6 months just to get custom buttons and rivets from YKK). We learned from our mistakes and are much better prepared this time around.\n\nSome of our styles and colors are already in production and ready to ship as soon as the Kickstarter ends but in order to get you more styles and colors, we need your help to hit our minimum orders. To get you your jeans quicker, we\u2019ll send a survey out to our backers mid-campaign to get a feel for what the popular colors and styles will be so we can order the fabric as soon as possible to get a jump-start on production.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: Sometimes we can run into tiny delays which can delay production from as little as 2 weeks to as much as 2 months. We feel we're much better prepared this time around and feel delays, if any, will be minimal.\n\nThere is a small chance that if we don't get enough backers choosing a certain color or style, that we won't go into production with that particular color or style.

We combined luxurious merino wool with pure silver on the inside to give you extraordinary next-to-skin comfort and the very best anti-odor performance. A nylon exterior provides structure and adds durability, all while keeping the weight of the product less than 120 grams (in a medium size). This is our lightest t-shirt yet: perfect for traveling, and equally great for daily wear in a wide range of temperatures.\nRe-Engineering A Flagship  \nThis product is an evolution of the founding design of the SilverAir T-Shirt, the first product we launched on Kickstarter almost 5 years ago. At the time, our goal was to develop the best athletic t-shirt in the world and we think we delivered just that. Then, we saw you using the t-shirt for traveling light and even as daily uniforms, so the products that followed were geared towards everyday performance. With this new generation, we bring to you a t-shirt engineered with our most advanced and versatile fabric yet, and one that is simply a joy to wear day and night.\nProduct Details\nFor every new product, we custom develop the fabric from scratch. For this t-shirt, we created a double sided fabric with merino wool on the inside for its ability to regulate temperature, manage moisture, and resist odor. We use premium grade 17.5 micron fibers which are ultra fine and feel incredibly soft against the skin.\nWhile merino wool is bacteriostatic and offers a first layer of protection against odor, we add pure silver (in the form of metallic yarns) which we find to be the most effective solution for neutralizing odor causing bacteria. The production of our SilverAir yarn begins at the molecular level where the metallic formulation is precisely controlled and is free of nickel and other heavy metals. Unlike chemical and nano treatments, our silver is permanently knit into the fabric and will never wash away. When you turn the product inside-out, you can actually see the silver throughout.\nTo complete the fabric, we plait the exterior with nylon for a durable finish and a beautiful hand feel. The strength of the nylon perfectly complements the lightweight merino. We use an open knit structure that is airy and breathable to create an extremely light but sturdy t-shirt that weighs less than 120 grams (in a medium size).\nYou'll love wearing it by itself in warm weather, and it makes a fantastic base layer during the winter. Best of all, it is highly packable and lets you travel light without the burden of heavy luggage. You can comfortably fit two t-shirts, two pairs of socks, and two underwear in a small packing cube that will fit any bag.\nWe wanted to appeal to a wide range of style, in a variety of conditions. As with all our products, the main focus is always on the material and construction. The body of the t-shirt is seamless, so it is void of any stitching. It has a pure uninterrupted form with mesh knit in the underarms and two clean jacquard lines down the back. The sleeves are stitched to the body using flat-lock seams to prevent chafing, and follows a raglan construction to enable better mobility of the arms while sitting cleanly over the shoulders.\nWith each new iteration, we continuously strive to simplify and improve a product based on your demands. We believe the SilverAir Merino T-Shirt is the epitome of everything we have learned so far. We can't wait for you to try it!  \nImage Gallery\nStyles & Colors\nT-SHIRT - Available in short sleeve crew neck, short sleeve v-neck, and long sleeve crew neck.\n*Long sleeve t-shirts have a $10 surcharge.\n*Carbon Black color has visible silver lines on the exterior (see 00:27 in Kickstarter video).\nUNDERWEAR - Available in boxer-brief with or without fly.\nSOCKS - Available in ankle or crew length.\n*Crew socks have a $3 surcharge.\nMeasurement Guide \nThe products we are offering in this campaign are going to be available in following sizes:\n*XXL size T-Shirt will be available in short sleeve and long sleeve crew neck and covers chest size 48\"\nAbout Us \nWe want to simplify your life with thoughtfully designed gear. We believe that the clothing you wear everyday should not only be comfortable and good looking, but also functional in every aspect.\nWe design each product from scratch with materials and components tailored specifically towards it, and with an eye on details. Although we started with functional sportswear, our products have evolved to be core basics that you'll want to wear daily and travel the world in.\nThe brand was born on Kickstarter and we continue to release major products here. Amongst all the other benefits, it most importantly allows us to connect directly with our customers and have meaningful discussions around a new product that we created for you.\nImportant Details About The Campaign\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter campaign, and we are humbled by the support that you've shown us over the years. We try to offer great deals here and you're also the first to receive new products. The money you pledge towards our campaign goes directly into the development and production of our products. We hope you understand that this campaign is not a store front. If you want more flexibility in trying our products, we recommend purchasing them from yathletics.com at retail value.\nREFUNDS \nWe generally do not issue refunds for Kickstarter pledges. If for some reason you want to back out of your pledge after the campaign ends, you may request a refund but we reserve the right to issue or deny it. If we do issue a refund, we will deduct 10% from the total pledge to cover the payment processor and Kickstarter fees associated with it.\nEXCHANGES \nIf the product(s) you receive do not fit, you may exchange them for a different size, except for socks and underwear. T-Shirts must be new and need to be in their original packaging with hang tags attached. Socks and underwear come in individually sealed packets and cannot be exchanged once opened. We recommend trying one pair before opening the remaining ones so you can exchange sealed socks and underwear for a different size.\nTo learn more about how to exchange products, please visit https://www.yathletics.com/pages/ksreturns\nINTERNATIONAL BACKERS\nAll international shipments are subject to duties, taxes and clearing fees which you are responsible for paying. Most countries will assess duties/taxes on your package and in certain countries the carrier will pre-pay the duties and taxes and bill you later. If you refuse delivery, your package will be abandoned. Once abandoned, we can\u2019t ship another package to you or issue a refund.\nPartners\nWe'd like to give a shout out to our marketing partner, Jellop, who helps us reach new backers. If you're running a crowdfunding campaign, we highly recommend working with them.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter project. We\u2019ve delivered some of the highest quality products to our backers in the past and this one\u2019s not going to be any different. The only risk we can think of is the projected timeline of the delivery of rewards. Since this is a brand new development, there may be unforeseen challenges in production. If any issues come up, the delivery of your reward will be delayed.\n\nThat said, we\u2019re pretty straight forward when it comes to communication and have built a reputation of being transparent with our backers. We'll make two promises:\n\n1. We will deliver the highest quality product to each and every single backer. We take extreme pride in making some of the best products in the world.\n\n2.

Could you survive? Maybe. But could you, acting alone and stranded at any point period in Earth's history, reinvent our modern world from scratch? Probably not.\nNot unless you took this book and bandana back in time with you, that is.\nLook how pretty!\nOver the course of the past few years, I've collected all the science, engineering, mathematics, art, music, philosophy, facts, and figures you'd need for even the most clueless time traveler to build a civilization from the ground up, and I've put it all into this book / extremely fashionable accessory. Your new world will be one in which humanity matured quickly and efficiently, instead of doing what we did (which, to be specific, was spending 200,000 years stumbling around without language, thinking disease was caused by weird smells, and living completely oblivious to the fact that tying a rock to a string would unlock navigating the entire world). It's a deeply researched guide and ridiculously funny history of the key technologies and innovations that made each stage of human civilization possible (from writing and farming to buttons and birth control), and it will make you smarter, more competent, and completely prepared to thrive \u2013 at any point in history.\nAnd if you don't have room for a whole book in your temporal carry-on, you can still carry the highlights with your new attractively-designed and information-dense time travel bandana - enough to create a technological civilization from first principles. It's chock full of civilization-building information that's great to keep around in your back pocket...or wrapped around the top of your head. \nAnd if you want some beautiful art to show off the time periods you'll visit... keep reading for the postcard stretch goal. :)\nTell me about this book.\nHappy to! It measures 6x9, and it's a really attractive hardcover, and inside are 464 pages of text and pictures, illustrated by the amazing Lucy Bellwood. The premise of the book is just like in the video above: in the future time travel is being practiced routinely, and this is a guide meant for the passengers in those time machines - in this case the FC3000\u2122 - to consult should anything go wrong. It's a time machine repair guide, but then it turns out time machines are the most complicated machines humans have ever made, and there's no user serviceable parts inside, and it's actually easier to explain how to rebuild civilization from scratch in any period of Earth's history! So that's what this book does, promising that instead of going back to the future... you can now bring the future back to you.\nHere's the table of contents, showing off the sort of things you can find in this book!\nThis is a non-fiction work of popular science wrapped in a delightful fictional candy coating.\nAll the information in the book is real, and despite the fact that time travel isn't real (YET?? SO FAR AS WE KNOW??), it is a sincere, honest, funny, and deeply-researched attempt to prepare you for the eventuality of being stranded in the past.\nThe time-travel conceit keeps things light, and lets me work in lots of jokes so that the book isn't a dry list of facts and figures: instead it's as exciting - and funny - as a really good time travel novel. Imagine if the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was real, but focused entirely on time travel - it might look something like this. The book begins with a flowchart that lets you determine what period in history you're stranded in, all the way back to the Big Bang. In the middle, the book does things like explain how to forge iron while also reinventing art and philosophy. By the end, you are actually for-real prepared to rebuild civilization, all on your own.\nHere's what some people are saying about advance copies I gave them!\n\"A dazzling piece of work that's also genuinely hilarious.\" - Elan Mastai: All Our Wrong Todays\n\"Such a cool book. It's essential reading for anyone who needs to duplicate an industrial civilization quickly\" - Randall Munroe: xkcd, What If?\n\"Technically, we are all time travelers and we are all trapped. So, even if you happen to be scanning this blurb in what you perceive to be a 'normal' timeline, I heartily recommend you read this book cover to cover.\" - Zach Weinersmith: Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, Soonish\n\"A witty pop science guide intended for those demanding times when one needs to create a civilization from scratch... a fun, thoughtful, and thoroughly accessible reference for curious readers, students, and world-builders, as well as wayward time travelers.\" - Publisher's Weekly (starred review!)\n\"Packed with cool, fun, and useful stuff... a friendly and thought-provoking reference, just the thing for the bright kid in the family, to say nothing of the neighborhood time traveler.\" - Kirkus Reviews\nOkay, now tell me about this bandana!\nThe book is inspired by a shirt I designed back in 2012 - after finishing the shirt, I still hadn't scratched that itch, and began to wonder if you really could condense all of civilization down to 450 or so pages. So I started researching. And once I'd written the book, I thought, wouldn't it be nice to take this full circle and bring this back to textiles with a Temporal Survival Bandana? The bandana itself is 22 inches square has more information than the shirt did - including instructions on how to use the bandana itself to invent other technologies like the water filter, the bandage, and the sexy adult handcuff! And if you do ever find yourself stranded in the past, it will be the single most valuable - and most dangerous - piece of fabric in human history.\nYou can get one exclusively with this Kickstarter!\nThat shape in the middle is the template for building a unit cube - whose weight, when filled with water, will be the basis of the measurements you need to build the other technologies explained on the bandana, up to and including telescopes, microscopes, smelters, electrical generators, and penicillin. At the top there's instructions for testing if unknown foods are safe to eat - a useful thing to know if you're stranded before the invention of domestication. Those pictures you see in the at the bottom are ways to transform the rotational motion of a water wheel into more useful motions, like the up-down motion of a hammer or the back-and-forth motion of a saw. Seems pretty straightforward, but it still took humans thousands of years to figure this stuff out!!\nOr rather, it DID take us that long, until you and your brilliant bandana showed up in the past.\nWhy are the bandana and book together?\nWell, here's the thing. This book is already being printed, and it'll be available in bookstores on September 18th... but these days most book orders happen online. That's great, but it would be MORE great if you could support independent booksellers! That's where this Kickstarter comes in: all the books ordered through this Kickstarter will be funneled through indie bookstores.\nBy buying the book through this Kickstarter, you not only get the exact same book you'd get from a giant online bookstore, but you also get it signed by the author (that's me!), PLUS you get the time traveler's bandana, PLUS the stretch goals we unlock (see below) - all for the same price you'd pay at retail. It'll be shipped direct to your door on the release day, and you'll get to feel good about supporting cool indie bookstores like:\nThe Strand in NY\nBookPeople in Texas\nWatermark Books & Cafe in Kansas\nTattered Cover Book Store in Denver\nJoseph-Beth Booksellers in Ohio\nVroman's Bookstore in California\nThe Beguiling in Toronto, Canada\nIt's thanks to these amazing booksellers that we can offer the book at a price low enough to give you all these exclusive goodies on top!\nCan we use stretch goals to make this Kickstarter even more awesome?\nWell heck, why not! Here's what I've got planned: every threshold we unlock will result in a new update, in which I (RYAN) will get stranded, Carmen Sandiego / Where's Waldo style, in a different period in time. While I'm there I'll source a postcard showing off that time, and everyone who backs will get one of each. These are actual postcards, suitable to send in the mail to your pals and say \"wish you were here\", only instead of promoting boring old places in the present, they're encouraging temporal tourism at various highlights in Earth's past. They'll be drawn by a variety of super awesome artists!

They're going to be AWESOME.\nSo now with you're not just getting the signed book and bandana: you're also getting temporal tourism postcards, and as the Kickstarter continues, more and more cards will get added to that pack.\nWhat tiers do we have?\nWe've kept it pretty simple: there's a tier to get the postcards ($10), a tier to get the postcards and bandana ($20), and a really attractive tier that gets you the postcards, the bandana, and a SIGNED copy of the book all for $27 - the same price an unsigned book alone costs in a store! After that there's some tiers for those who want more than one book (you can get two or three), and finally a single-edition $1000 tier in which I hand-build you a time travel survival kit - which includes the book, bandana, and postcards too, of course.\nEach tier has a US and Canadian edition - besides the countries they're shipping to, they're otherwise identical.  That's right, Canadians: by teaming up with The Beguiling, we've managed to keep shipping costs identical!  Plus, the books will ship out of Toronto, so you don't need to worry about any customs costs at the border.  THIS WAS A LOT OF WORK BUT IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME. <3\nNOTE: the last time I did a Kickstarter with signed books was for To Be or Not To Be, and there I ended up signing 15,000 books in five days, during which I accidentally broke the world record for most books signed in a single day in the process. I have only gotten better at signing my own name since then.\nThis sounds great, but who are you and what else have you done?\nHi, I'm Ryan North! You may know me as the author of Dinosaur Comics, or The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl for Marvel Comics, or from my illustrated choosable-path adventure books like William Shakespeare Punches A Friggin' Shark and/or To Be or Not To Be - both of which were launched here on Kickstarter (and To Be or Not To Be became the most-funded publishing project ever on Kickstarter at the time!) I've also done writing for Bungie and once got stuck in a hole with my dog. You can read more about me here to assure yourself that I'm not one of those fly-by-night science writers!\nI want to ship outside the US and Canada - can I back this Kickstarter?\nUnfortunately we can't ship these books everywhere - the numbers simply don't work out (and also there's weird legal issues, since book rights are different in different countries). If you're outside the US and Canada, you may want to wait until the book comes out for real in your region - translated versions will shortly be available in:\nRussia\nPoland\nChina\nKorea\n...and MORE??\nAnd if you're in the UK - great news: the book is already available for pre-order there! \nThank you! <3\nI'm really excited to soon be able to share this book with you - it's the longest book project I've ever worked on! - and I really think it's the best, too. Hopefully what I've said in this Kickstarter intrigues you! Drop me a line if you've got any questions, and if you choose to back this campaign, thank you! I really think you'll have a good... time.\n(sorry about the pun, no regrets)\n(Oh also!

The bandana design is ready to go, and we've got a printer who can turn an order around in 15 days, which gives us plenty of time to get them - and the books - shipped to Make That Thing, who I've partnered with to help fulfill this project. I'll visit their warehouse to sign all the books for you, we'll put them in envelopes, and then we'll ship them off your homes. \n\nAll books are being shipped to a single warehouse, which will make things simpler. I've run two successfully completed Kickstarters in the past, and I feel really confident about this one, since unlike the others, the book is already being printed! That's how come we can ship so quickly after the campaign closes.\n\nThe main risk is unexpected shipping delays causing the book to arrive in some places after its release date on the 18th of September, but we're going to do all in our power to prevent that: we want you to read this book as soon as possible!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "USA: Just postcards", "descp": "You'll get a pack of all the temporal postcards we unlock, advertising different periods in time, each featuring art from a new artist: the better the campaign goes, the more there will be in the pack!

With this campaign, our goal is to raise enough money to make a 10 minute proof-of-concept short film.\nShould we raise more, our goal will be adjusted to multiple short films. Should we raise significantly more than our goal, we will make the entire feature. These stretch goals will be revealed as each funding milestone is passed.\nWe are confident in our ability to meet this goal as we have already made a feature length action film, THE DANGER ELEMENT (currently in distribution), on a very tiny budget. You can see the trailer for THE DANGER ELEMENT below. \nIn JITNI: BOOK OF LIES we meet a modern day knight from an order founded in the wake of the second crusade who is pulled from his isolation beneath an ancient monastery to rescue a friend. He is soon drawn reluctantly into a quest to stop an ancient secret society with plans to free an imprisoned demon.\nJITNI: \"Book of Lies\" Concept Art\nOur film group, WESTHAVENBROOK, formed in 2001 when John Soares, Justin Spurlock and Ben Beames began experimenting in cinema together. We made hundreds of short films, several of which won awards, before collaborating on the making of Doug TenNapel's SOCKBABY series, a no-budget martial art/comedy web series that gained a global cult following on the internet before the days of YouTube. It was the first time anyone in the group got a taste of what the internet could do for underground cinema. We went on to make THE DANGER ELEMENT, John's first feature length action adventure film. It was released on YouTube in short segments in order to build a loyal following which eventually allowed for a third of the film's overall budget to be crowdfunded. Today, THE DANGER ELEMENT can be found on Amazon and its distribution rights have been sold in several countries.\nJITNI: \"Book of Lies\" Concept Art\nThese underground productions have been incredibly challenging for WESTHAVENBROOK, but have also allowed for personal connections and experiences among the expanding group of artists working under its banner that cannot be duplicated anywhere else. \n\nJohn's personal goal has always been honest expression in art. On top of having made films for nearly 15 years, he has worked in the Hollywood studio system for 4 years as an editor, but has always felt that the kinds of films he wants to make are not necessarily the kinds of films Hollywood makes. THE DANGER ELEMENT proved to him that this is not enough to stop him from telling these stories. His dream is to be able to continue making these films through the direct support of his audience and to offer a uniquely personal product that  they might not find anywhere else. \nConcept art for \"Book of Lies\" by Art Director Cassie Meder\nTHE CREW\nSince the completion of his first feature length film, John Soares has lent his skills to projects for NBC Universal, Dreamworks Animation, Titmouse Inc., Amazon and Netflix. and his work has been distributed in international markets. Although much of his time between his previous project and the current endeavor has been spent working on mainstream media projects, John has never ceased in developing scripts for multiple projects born from his own unique vision. Of the many screenplays John has written since 2012, the project you are here to support is among the works he's proudest of.\nCassie Meder; Art Director, Production Manager, Actress\n Cassie Meder joined Westahavenbrook in 2010 in her acting debut in THE DANGER ELEMENT. She has since established a career in fine art, showcasing her traditional and digital works internationally; while forming a small business selling her images to collectors worldwide. Cassie has returned to the fold of Westhavenbrook to oversee art direction and production design, as well as to revisit a character previously featured in John's first feature film; THE DANGER ELEMENT... in a way you probably wouldn't expect. \nTed Smith; Prop builder\nTed Smith began working with Westhavenbrook in 2011 creating iconic costumes and objects for use in THE DANGER ELEMENT, all while working for a prominent prop house in Hollywood. Ted has worked on some of the biggest movies in history including THE FIFTH ELEMENT, TITANIC, STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS and many others and has produced and directed his own film, GUARDIAN OF THE REALM. In the midst of all this, Ted still took the time to work on our independent low budget production because he believed in the vision of Westhavenbrook. Ted has since taken the reigns of his own career and creativity, forming a business building costumes and props for independent artists in his own studio on his own terms, as well as building his own streaming and YouTube brand; THE EVIL TED CHANNEL. This independent force will be returning to the team to create key props to support our story, as well as to continue being one of our greatest cheerleaders. \nDoug Jones; Actor\nShould his incredibly busy schedule permit, Doug Jones has expressed interest in joining us to revisit and reinvent his character from John's previous works, but don't get too ahead of yourself guessing in what way! We have something very unique in store for the likes of the world's favorite monster-man. \n\nDoug Jones has had an incredibly successful and busy year having started filming on the second season of STAR TREK: DISCOVERY as well as having starred in the 2018 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, THE SHAPE OF WATER.\nGlen Gabriel; Composer\nSwedish composer Glen Gabriel has been working closely with John since the stone age of social media communications... that's right. MySpace. Since meeting John and later composing the beautiful, dynamic original score for THE DANGER ELEMENT, Glen has since created music for a James Cameron production and has played an integral role in the development of this project as well as Westhavenbrook's potential for moving projects to international locations...\nWe look forward to having you on our next big adventure!

In fact, 4 Billion people travel on airplane every year. Whether it\u2019s a business trip, a long-planned family trip, or a weekend getaway, most of us needs to pack.  \nPacking is a boring, time-consuming task. We all have better things to do than planning what to bring and folding everything carefully into a small bag only to be unpacked again.\nBring PAQ with you the next time you pack!\nAdded to the inconvenience is the concern that our stuff will not get there safely. Many of us have been there. Whether it\u2019s a broken sunglasses or a spilled shampoo bottle, it can spoil the whole trip and makes us regret not putting more care into packing.     \nDid you know that 20 million luggage are lost every year? No one knows how many more are mistreated. We\u2019ve all heard horror stories of how our bags are thrown around, dragged and shoved into cargo. Imagine what all that would do to the stuff inside.\nWe roll, we fold, we bundle We pick the smallest bag possible so that the bag is a tight fit and won\u2019t have empty space inside for things to tumble into a big mess.  \nWe take precautions. placing each item into the bag with space maximization in mind. We use packing cubes and vacuum packs, wrapping anything breakable with shirts and pajamas, zip-locking all the bottles, cover our shoes with plastic bags to protect our cloths from dirt and shoeprints, etc.  \nFolding, zipping, compressing, wrapping and zip-locking is not the sexiest thing to do. Plus it takes up valuable vacation time.\nSome take 2 hours just to pack. My girlfriend did and we missed our flight. (A lot actually happened that day)\nSome just grab everything they need and shove it all into the bag. I did, and it costs me my good camera lens.\nThe Game Changer  \nWouldn\u2019t it be better if we can choose any bag we want, fill it up with everything we need, and never have to worry? No spill, no broken glass, no wrinkled cloths. PaQ lets you do exactly that, and more\u2026.\nPAQ Protects your stuff!\nPack Faster, Protect stuff from damage, Arrival notification.

So, when you get to your hotel room, your stuff will also get there in one piece.\nHow about the return trip? When our bags are so filled with souvenirs and crumpled clothes? No worries! PaQ can be folded to as small as a rolled T-shirt to save space.  \nBecause no one wants to be that person with too many layers of cloths.\n PaQ can be used on all sorts of bags.

Well there are two main reasons:  \n1. Lithium batteries loses their charge over time and are completely drained within 3-6 months. In a time when there are dozens of things we have to recharge every night (Smartphone, smartwatches, power-bank, tablets, camera battery, another power-bank, another camera battery, a laptop, headphone, portable speaker, etc. We simply do not have enough electrical socket! PaQ can last over 2 years without needing a new battery, even if you use it every week! \n2. Lithium batteries are banned from check-in baggage. This regulation is relatively new but is starting to become international standard. The reason being that Lithium batteries (especially low-quality ones) can burst into flame. Alkaline battery, being safer, is allowed on all flights.\nRewards\nEnjoy up to 40% discount for Single PAQ and 50% discount for Double PAQ!\n PAQ x chipolo\nWith PAQ x chipolo add-on, you\u2019ll be able to track the location of your luggage and be notified when your luggage is in range.

More like 30 minutes! It gets everywhere you don't want it to. AND it dries out when you don't want it to!\nAnd if it really is so SUPER...then why do you also need epoxies for gap filling, sealants for cracks and leaks, and glue for specific materials?\n Introducing TOTAL GLUE - the only glue you need!\nPLAY\n\nTotal Glue is a specially-formulated glue designed to cure instantly when exposed to blue light. Simply apply the glue, shine the included light on the glue, and in 5 seconds it will fully cure! \nALL-IN-ONE\nTotal Glue combines the strength of super glue, gap filling properties of epoxy, and light-curing speed of acrylic resin together to make the ULTIMATE glue...without all of the negative experiences associated with those adhesives!\nSUPER GLUE VS TOTAL GLUE\nPLAY\n\nTotal Glue completely cures in 5 SECONDS when hit with the included blue light. Super Glue needs AT LEAST 1 minute to set...and then 24 hours for a full cure!\nEPOXY VS TOTAL GLUE\nPLAY\n\nTotal Glue is your gap filling choice over epoxy - NO mixing required, NO mess, and it cures in seconds instead of minutes!\nOTHER LIGHT-CURING ADHESIVES VS TOTAL GLUE\nPLAY\n\nYou may have seen other adhesives on the market that cure with light. One big difference is that Total Glue bonds objects together with or without the light, while the other acrylic adhesives CANNOT bond without the light.\n  Total Glue's unique light-curing properties enable it to perform hundreds of different types of repairs.\nBOND, FILL, SEAL, & REBUILD\nBONDS WITH AND WITHOUT LIGHT\nTotal Glue bonds in 5 seconds when exposed to the blue light, making repairs and projects happen faster than ever! Unlike other light-curing glues on the market, Total Glue ALSO bonds objects without the light - it just takes about a minute to cure. \nFILLS GAPS LIKE EPOXY\nBecause Total Glue cures with light, it can fill gaps like an epoxy, but without the annoying mixing process, and the inevitable messes! Just alternate between applying Total Glue and curing with light to build up layers until your hole or gap is filled!\nSEALS CRACKS AND LEAKS\nUse Total Glue to seal off cracks in tile, counters, pipes, and more! You can also insulate exposed wires on computer and phone cords, saving you from the costly replacements. \nREBUILD/CREATE OBJECTS\nRebuild structures like handles and key fobs with Total Repair, or create new objects like a bolt for a screw!\nWORKS ON ALL MATERIALS\nWOOD\nMETAL\nPLASTIC\nGLASS\nCERAMIC\nHIGH STRENGTH BOND\nTotal Glue not only cures very fast, but it cures very STRONG. Watch us lift a bowling ball with Total Glue below!\nPLAY\n\nSANDABLE & PAINTABLE\nTotal Glue can be sanded down and painted. No ugly repairs or projects here!\nCRAFT LIKE A PRO\nTotal Glue is the perfect tool for crafters and creators.\nIts precision application tips allow for delicate projects to be accomplished without the mess, and the resin cures clear leaving no residue! \nThe blue light cures the glue when you need it to, and where you want it to, helping you get more projects done faster. \nBecause the glue cures with and without the light, you don't need to keep switching out different adhesives for different projects!\nSO MUCH MORE!\nWe can't even begin to cover all of the amazing things you can accomplish with Total Glue. Here are a few more examples:\n3-D PRINTING\nCIRCUITRY\n SHOE REPAIR\nPLAY\n\n5g of Glue \u2013 Specially formulated glue can be cured by blue light or pressure   \nPlastic Casing +Squeeze Applicator \u2013 Protective casing for easy application and storage   \nBlue Light \u2013 Removable blue light LED and applicator to cure glue in seconds; batteries included  \nApplicator Tip + Precision Tip: Total Glue comes with applicator tip for clean and easy application. A separate precision tip is also included for very small and precise repairs.\nCap \u2013 Keeps the glue from drying out  \n We learned about light-curing adhesives from the dentist office, and were blown away by the properties that make them so useful to dentists! So we set out to use this technology to make a glue to end all glues!\nIt took over 2 years for us to find the perfect adhesive that met all of our requirements:   \nCures in 5 seconds by light application \nAlso cures under pressure where no light can get in\nMaintains the same strength level as super glue \nWorks on all surfaces \nWeak scent \nWe tried the following types of adhesives: \n 1. Cyanoacrylate: This is the type of adhesive found in regular super glues. However, we couldn\u2019t find one that cured under light.\n2. Acrylic-based adhesives: Acrylic adhesives can be cured by UV light (you\u2019ll see these in a lot of \u201cAs Seen on TV\u201d products), but the bonding capabilities are poor, and such adhesives can\u2019t cure under pressure without the light. \nFinally we discovered a specially-formulated methoxyethyl cyanoacrylate, that could both bond under pressure and cure instantly under blue light! It also met our other requirements, making us confident enough to bring this product to you!\nTotal Glue Sampler - $10\nTotal Glue Starter Kit - $30 ($25 for EarlyBird!)\nTotal Glue Family Pack - $55\nTotal Glue Pro Kit - $85\nTotal Glue Ultimate Value Kit - $230\n HOW TO PLEDGE?\n1.

Drawing inspiration from animal camouflage, cubism, futurism, and vorticism, the artists used geometric patterns and colors to create avant-garde-like paint jobs, helping the Allies stay one step ahead of enemy technology. \nLeft: USS Siboney leaving New York Harbor in May 1918. Right: The Women's Reserve Corps of NY demonstrate dazzle in Union Square.\nThis summer, multidisciplinary artist Tauba Auerbach is unveiling New York\u2019s own 21st-century dazzle ship. Starting in July, Fireboat John J. Harvey will be painted with a visually-arresting design in vibrant red and contrasting white - the fireboat\u2019s original colors, but with a dazzling twist.\nAuerbach\u2019s design incorporates the actual movement and behavior of water. The pattern was created through the intricate process of marbling paper, floating inks on a fluid bath and dragging combs through them before transferring ink to paper. Covering every vertical and horizontal surface of the vessel (she\u2019s even designed special flags!), the work is the visualization of the physics of \u201cfluid dynamics.\u201d \nExperiencing the artwork will be FREE to the public, and will be viewable from land 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Continuing in the John J. Harvey's 18-year tradition, the public will also be invited to board and tour the boat and its immersive design on weekends while it's docked, and free boat trips around New York Harbor will be offered on weekends from July 14 to September 23!  \nFlow Separation promises to surprise and fascinate New Yorkers and visitors from around the globe as it floats along the Hudson and East Rivers, docking at Brooklyn Bridge Park and Hudson River Park\u2019s Pier 25 and Pier 66a.\nWith your partnership, we can make it even more accessible to the public, offering additional opportunities to experience NYC through the eyes of one of our city\u2019s great contemporary artists!\nA Benevolent Vessel\nThe exhibition also enables us to partner with a treasured NYC vessel: John J. Harvey. It launched as a fireboat in 1931 and served New York Harbor until it was retired in 1994 and saved by a group of enthusiasts. The boat became a national treasure on September 11, 2001 when the crew pumped water for 80 hours and evacuated people from Lower Manhattan (this story even inspired a book by Maira Kalman: Fireboat: The Heroic Adventures of the John J. Harvey).  \nTo realize Auerbach\u2019s new commission, the exterior surface of John J. Harvey is being restored, stripping it of its decades-worth of chipped paint and rust, and recoated with layers of fresh paint. Following the exhibition, the fireboat will be repainted in its original, historic configuration, and continue offering free public trips as it has since 2000.\nIn-process photos of the boat in dry dock and being primed\nThe work is co-commissioned by Public Art Fund and 14-18 NOW, the United Kingdom\u2019s award-winning public arts program commemorating the centenary of World War I. Since 2014, 14-18 NOW has commissioned hundred of new works, including the presentation of four Dazzle Ships in the U.K.     \nAuerbach\u2019s dazzled vessel is the first U.S.-based ship and the final vessel in the series before the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I on November 11, 2018.\n\"Dazzle came about as a desperate response to catastrophe. I'll be happy if this project sparks joy in people \u2014 if we can salvage anything positive from the wreckage of that bloody, wasteful nightmare \u2014 but it should prompt us to think about what humanity was coping with and doing to itself at the time.\" - Tauba Auerbach\nContemporary Dazzle Ships: Sir Peter Blake, \u201cEverybody Razzle Dazzle\u201d, 2015. Photo: Mark McNulty; Ciara Phillips, \u201cEvery Woman\u201d, 2016 Photo: Ross Attenburgh\nAbout the Artist \nTauba Auerbach is a painter, sculptor, photographer, and publisher whose work investigates systems of logic \u2014 mathematical, linguistic, aesthetic, and spatial. A former sign painter, Auerbach frequently explores and adapts painting traditions and techniques, as well as elements of typography and calligraphy, to form abstract compositions. Auerbach has a keen understanding of how form can alter perception, a key factor in the original \u2018dazzle\u2019 patterns.  \nFor Flow Separation, Auerbach expands on her extensive research of ornamental wave patterns and her newer experimentation with fluid dynamics. Auerbach is intrigued by ornamental shapes and has observed and catalogued these designs, found not only in pre-historic paintings, architecture, and textiles, but in snapshots of dynamic motion in the form of rivers, and on the skeletons of coral. Her dazzle design will continue this investigation and will draw inspiration from the rhythmic designs found in the wake patterns.\nTauba Auerbach; Shadow Weave - Fret Wave, 2015. Woven canvas on wooden stretcher, 60 x 45 inches; Grain - Mandelbrot Quartet (Ventrella Variation), Tough H2O, 2017. Acrylic on canvas / Wooden stretcher, 60 x 45 inches.\n\"Since every boat has a wake, there's an interesting geometry to the way the fluid moves behind it, and through it, and alongside of it. I wanted to dig into that.\"\nAbout Public Art Fund \nAs the leader in its field, Public Art Fund brings dynamic contemporary art to a broad audience in New York City and beyond by mounting ambitious free exhibitions of international scope and impact that offer the public powerful experiences with art and the urban environment. Since 1977, Public Art Fund has distinguished itself as a pioneering organization that sets the standard for public art programs across the country, realizing over 450 projects that are as unique and memorable as New York City itself.\nLeft to Right: Olafur Eliasson: The New York City Waterfalls; Ai Weiwei: Good Fences Make Good Neighbors; Louise Bourgeois: Maman and Spiders; Jeppe Hein: Please Touch the Art\nAbout 14-18 NOW\n14-18 NOW is a program of extraordinary arts experiences connecting people with the First World War, as part of the U.K.\u2019s official centenary commemorations. Since 2014 it has commissioned over 200 contemporary artists across all art forms from 35 countries, including William Kentridge, Jeremy Deller, Rachel Whiteread, Akram Khan, Jason Moran, and film directors Danny Boyle and Peter Jackson.  \nThe contemporary Dazzle Ship series, co-commissioned with Liverpool Biennial and supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies, has seen Dazzle Ships in London (Tobias Rehberger), Liverpool (Carlos Cruz-Diez and Sir Peter Blake) and Edinburgh (Ciara Phillips) engaging over 13 million people to date.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nKickstarter is a unique way for us to reach a broad audience of supporters locally, nationally, and internationally \u2014 which helps us build excitement for the project while simultaneously helping ensure its successful realization by providing crucial funds.

These can create delays and extra costs. That\u2019s why, from the very beginning \u2018til the end, we tested and tested MUWI with users to eliminate as many risks as possible. And, in the end, we came to the result: that MUWI works perfectly, allowing us to take all the video footage that you\u2019ve seen. \n\nWe\u2019ve worked really hard and are still pushing harder and harder. Our purpose is not only delivering MUWI on time to our Kickstarter backers, but to deliver it better than you see.

By having a lanyard in the pocket when you retrieve things you could be sure you won't lose them.

The Pocket Clip and improved modular stacking system gives you a whole new array of carry options for Keyport Modules in addition to attaching them to the Keyport Pivot and Keyport Slide 3.0. The Keyport system is the most advanced EDC solution available because of its one-of-a-kind modularity, its broad range of customization choices, and its wide variety of carry options.\nAnywhere Tools are part of a system designed upon the principals of  convenience, utility, and style. Our goal is to transform your everyday carry from a bulky, oddly shaped, noisy assemblage of things you always haul around with you to a fully customized set of tools and tech that accompany you on all of your adventures without getting in the way.\nModular - Take only the items you want with you. No need to schlep a bulky, jingly jangly, pocket full of keys and other oddly shaped personal items alongside a fixed tool with several implements you will rarely, if ever, use.\nStackable - Several of the modules are stackable (we call them mid-modules) meaning you can carry more than one together on a single pocket clip. Both the MOCA II and the NEBA Knife Modules are mid-modules which allows other modules to be stacked on top of them. Mid-modules are easily identified by their machined aluminum scales with the three square holes. The Pocket Flare Mini-Flashlight and WeeLINK Cable Charger are outer modules, which means that they can stack on top of a mid-module but cannot be stacked upon as they form the top or outer most layer.\nEasily stack Modules w/our no-fastener system - Anywhere Pocket Clip + NEBA Knife + WeeLINK Cable Charger Module = Custom Wearable Multi-Tool\nQuick and Easy On / Off - Modules are easily added or removed from the Pocket Clip, Pivot or Slide with our RuSH Module Removal Tool or a heavy-duty paperclip, pen, or other device with a simple point.\nRemoving modules is a snap with the RuSH Module Removal Tool\nWide Range of Uses - There are so many ways to carry Anywhere Tools... on a pocket clip, on multiple pocket clips, dangling from a carabiner, on a keychain, on a backpack, on a purse, with a Keyport Pivot, or with a Keyport Slide 3.0.\nStylish - Anywhere Tools provide a cleaner, more personalized, minimalist approach to your everyday carry.\nKeyport Compatible - All of the modules in this campaign are compatible with both the Keyport Slide 3.0 (sold separately) and the Keyport Pivot (available as an add-on for 25% OFF). Equal parts modular key organizer + custom multi-tool + exclusive lost & found recovery service all-in-one, Keyport devices complete the ultimate fully customizable everyday carry system.\nAnywhere Tech and Tool Modules are also compatible with the Keyport Slide 3.0 (sold separately) & Keyport Pivot (available as an add-on for 25% OFF)\nThink of it as a sophisticated alternative to Batman's utility belt... minus the extra 10 pounds, the shiny yellow belt, and the need to wear tights to pull off that whole look.\nAnywhere Tech Tools are an efficient and much better looking alternative to Batman's utility belt\nIntegrated Your Valuable Feedback\nLike our previous Kickstarter campaigns, we have integrated a great deal of your feedback from our initial set of tools along with feedback on other products in the marketplace to make our latest products stronger, more versatile, and more useful.\nAnywhere Pocket Clip\u2122\nConstructed of one piece hardened spring steel, the Anywhere Pocket Clip uses the same cutting-edge modular attachment feature as the Keyport Pivot and Slide 3.0.  The unique no-fastener design allows you to attach and detach modules in a literal snap. It can also be used as a money clip. All modules that fit the Pivot and Slide 3.0 are compatible with the Pocket Clip.\nMOCA\u2122 II Module\nDesigned especially with Slide owners in mind, the MOCA II (11-In-1) is an update on our MOCA 10-In-1 Multi-Tool. We have updated the design to feature a unique stowage latch, a 180 degree stop, and refined the tip to include both a Phillips and a flathead screwdriver, along with an improved cord cutter that slices through boxes, cords, and nearly anything else with ease. The MOCA II is a mid-module, so you can stack other modules or Side Plates on top of the scale for extra comfort and personalization.\nTools included: Bottle Opener \u2022 Flathead Screwdriver \u2022 Phillips Head Screwdriver \u2022 Cord Cutter \u2022 Box Opener \u2022 Scoring Tool \u2022 Hex Bit Driver \u2022 1/4 inch Wrench \u2022 5/16 inch Wrench \u2022 3/8 inch Wrench \u2022 1 inch Ruler + 1 cm Ruler\nNEBA Knife\u2122 Module\nNamed in honor of our fallen team member, Nebiyu Detti, this high quality edc pocketknife carries on his name and spirit. Whenever anyone needed a little help, Neb was always there with his signature slogan, \"I got you.\" The NEBA Knife continues in this tradition with a stylish, beefier pocketknife that will serve you well in a pinch. The slip-joint knife features a 2\" clip point blade and an improved spring mechanism with a half stop and thumb jibbing for extra grip. With the Pocket Clip attached it is very comfortable to hold with no unpleasant hot spots. The NEBA Knife is also a mid-module, so you can stack other modules or Side Plates on top of it.\nPocket Flare\u2122 Module\nAn upgrade from our base mini-flashlight unit, the Pocket Flare is over two times brighter (27 lumens vs. 12 lumens max output) and features lamp mode, a lantern-style light around the entire base of the module to cast a wider light than that of the front beam. We also replaced the slider button with a push button. The Pocket Flare is rechargeable via USB micro, displaying red during charge mode and green when fully charged.\nWeeLINK\u2122 Charger Cable Module\nEveryone these days appears to be carrying multiple charger cables stuffed in their backpack, purse, or even pocket. Yet, as the old saying goes, it feels like there is never one around when you need it most. Enter the WeeLink Charger Cable Module. Available in USB to Micro USB, USB to Lightning, and USB to USB-C, WeeLINK charger cables are easily accessible to keep all of your most important devices powered up.\nAvailable charging connector options for all kinds of phones, tablets, and other rechargeable tech.\nParaPull\nAlongside the Anywhere Pocket Clip, we designed two products that work in concert to complement the system.\nThe ParaPull is a short paracord zipper pull style lanyard that makes it easy to pull your Pocket Clip out when you need to get a handle on it.  The ParaPull works equally well connecting loose items to either a Pivot or a Slide.\nRuSH Multi-Purpose Tool\nRemove / Screw / Hang - The RuSH Multi-Purpose Tool makes removing modules, particularly stacked modules, a piece of cake. The RuSH Tool doubles as a suspension clip and features a bottle opener and flathead screwdriver to tighten / loosen the Pivot screw. In addition, the RuSH Tool can be stowed in a Pivot without having to disassemble it.\nWhile we are launching a large number of products, we want to give you as much choice as we can without complicating things and compromising fulfillment schedules. Based upon your feedback from our last Kickstarter, we have added discounts to ALL reward levels, so even late-comers to the party get a break for their support.  Obviously, the sooner you pledge, the bigger the discount, and the sooner we hit our goal, the sooner we can let our manufacturing partners know to get started and the more stretch goals we can unlock!\nSPECIAL NOTE - It came to our attention that we are missing 2 Pocket Flare Mini-Flashlight Modules in the EDC Essentials 2X Reward Description.  Our mistake.  That reward does come with 2 Pocket Flares, and we will make certain that anyone who pledges that Reward will receive them.\nTo keep it simple there is one major rule that accompanies the above rewards and add-on menu.\nRule #1 and Only (as of right now...)\nPricing for Add-Ons to ANY and ALL reward levels comes from the Add-On Menu. To say it another way, early bird pricing DOES NOT apply to add-ons. To calculate your Add-On pricing, simply add the total dollar amount of the add-ons you would like from the Add-On Menu and add it to your existing reward level. This is how we will reconcile all pricing in BackerKit.\nFor example, if I choose the Starter Kit Reward Level and want to add a Charger Cable Module (regardless of when I do so in the campaign), I will add the Charger Cable Module price found in the Add-On Menu @ $16, which represents a 11% discount off of the projected MSRP of $17.99, to the existing reward pledge of $18 for a total of $34 before shipping.\nStretch Goals\nStretch Goal #1 @ $65,000 - Spectrum and Black Pocket Clips - UNLOCKED\nAlongside Gun Grey, we have added two color options to the Anywhere Pocket Clip - Black and Spectrum.\nStretch Goal #2 @ $100,000 - Select Side Plates @ $3 (50% OFF MSRP) - UNLOCKED\nThose of you who are familiar with our universal access devices, the Keyport Pivot and Keyport Slide 3.0, may be familiar with Side Plates. Side Plates can sit on top on a mid-module like an outer module and show off your personal style. So for Stretch Goal #2 @ $100K, we are offering six side plate options at just $3 per unit (50% OFF MSRP):\nDigital Camo\nWoodland Camo\nCarbon Fiber\nRainbow\nBlack on Black\nBlack on White\nSee Side Plate image under Stretch Goal #3.5.\nThese side plates are not available anywhere else, and you will be the first to receive them.\nStretch Goal #3 @ $125,000 - FREE Select Side Plate! - UNLOCKED\nWe will give you each a FREE side plate (your choice of one of the six above) if... scratch that... WHEN we hit Stretch Goal #3 at $125,000.\n\nStretch Goal #3.5 - Additional Side Plates - UNLOCKED\nAs a thank you for your continued support and enthusiasm, we have added four additional side plate options based upon your input (Stars & Stripes, Zebra Wood, Kickstarter Green/Blue/Teal?, and #TeamOrange). Here is the final list of 10 Side Plates from which you may choose a FREE one.\nIn addition to your FREE Side Plate, these will also be available in BackerKit for only $3 each (50% OFF MSRP).\n\nStretch Goal #4 @ $150,000\nIf we hit $150K, we will offer 3 additional ParaPull colors (Gun Grey, Army Green, and Red) alongside Black.\n\nAs we have done for both campaigns before, we are going to use BackerKit to administrate the fulfillment process after the campaign. Once we migrate to BackerKit, we will send you out a survey that will help us to review and break down your pledge into the specific rewards you ordered along with their associated costs.\nBackerKit will also allow the opportunity for additional purchases, but please keep in mind that Kickstarter will offer the best reduced price options.\nSPECIAL NOTE - Super Early Bird rewards list an estimated delivery of September, which is incorrect and could not be changed once it was noticed since those rewards were live.  We expect Super Early Bird rewards to ship at the same time as all other rewards and estimate delivery to be in October.\nTentative Schedule\nApril 18 - Launch Kickstarter\nApril & May - Integrate consumer feedback, finalize design for manufacturing, finalize quotes (4 weeks)\nMay 18 - Complete Kickstarter campaign\nMay 20 thru 31 - Place tooling and production p.o.\u2019s\nJune & July - Complete production tooling, first shots (8 weeks)\nAugust - Initiate pilot runs of each product, initial beta testing, assuming production tweaks are minor, move ahead with production runs (4 weeks)\nSeptember - Production runs (6 weeks)\nOctober - Final QC, package, and ship to backers (2 weeks)\nOctober 31 - Complete fulfillment to all backers\nBecause of the large number of independent items in production at the same time (6), we will fulfill each order as soon as all of those products for that particular order have been received, tested, and packaged.\nUnless we encounter an unforeseen issue which delays one or more products more than four weeks from the estimated end of the campaign, we will not be splitting shipments.\nHelp Us Spread the Word!\nHelp us spread the word by clicking on icons (Facebook, Twitter, email, link shortener) underneath the Back this project button (circled in red) at the top right of the page.\nJoin our VIP Email List\nAt Keyport, we think of our supporters as extended members of our team, and we want to hear from you.\nPlease make sure to sign up for our VIP email list which includes giveaways, discounts, and access to limited edition runs.\nFollow Us on Social Media\nWe like you...

In our last Kickstarter campaign alone, we launched a half dozen new products at once.\n\nMANUFACTURING\nWe have worked together with our primary manufacturer, who is overseeing the production of all of these products, for nearly two years now. Together we have developed over a dozen products with tens of thousands of units in the field.\n\nIn an effort to speed up the time to delivery, we anticipate initiating tooling early in the campaign instead of waiting until our project has been funded and the funds have been received.\n\nCOMMUNICATION\nMost importantly, we know the unparalleled value of consistent and transparent communication with you\u2026 our most ardent supporters. We have enough experience to know that there are ups and downs with every project, and we will keep you posted on our progress so that you are with us every step of the way on this adventure... and ask anyone who backed our last project, our updates always entertain as well as inform :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Honorary Keyporter", "descp": "Subscription to our VIP email newsletter where you will get:\n\u2022 Latest Keyport news\n\u2022 Giveaways\n\u2022 Exclusive discounts\n\u2022 Early access to new product launches and limited edition runs\nApproximately one email every three weeks", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 23 or more", "title": "Starter Kit", "descp": "10% OFF estimated MSRP\nUse the Add-On Menu pricing (in Project Description) for additional items.\nINCLUDES:\nAnywhere Pocket Clip\nMOCA II Multi-Tool Mid-Module\nRuSH Multi-Purpose Tool\nParaPull Paracord Zipper Pull", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["66 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 37 or more", "title": "Pocket Plus", "descp": "10% OFF estimated MSRP\nUse the Add-On Menu pricing (in Project Description) for additional items.\nINCLUDES:\nAnywhere Pocket Clip\nMOCA II Multi-Tool Mid-Module\nNEBA Knife Mid-Module\nRuSH Multi-Purpose Tool\nParaPull Paracord Zipper Pull", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["112 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 58 or more", "title": "EDC Essentials", "descp": "10% OFF estimated MSRP\nUse the Add-On Menu pricing (in Project Description) for additional items.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Anywhere Pocket Clip\nMOCA II Multi-Tool Mid-Module\nNEBA Knife Mid-Module\nPocket Flare Mini-Flashlight Outer Module\nRuSH Multi-Purpose Tool\n2\u00d7 ParaPull Paracord Zipper Pull", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["117 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 74 or more", "title": "Anywhere Anytime", "descp": "10% OFF estimated MSRP\nChoice of USB to Micro USB / USB to Lighting / USB to USB-C will be made in the BackerKit survey.\nUse the Add-On Menu pricing (in Project Description) for additional items.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Anywhere Pocket Clip\nMOCA II Multi-Tool Mid-Module\nNEBA Knife Mid-Module\nPocket Flare Mini-Flashlight Outer Module\nWeeLink Charger Cable Outer Module\nRuSH Multi-Purpose Tool\n2\u00d7 ParaPull Paracord Zipper Pull", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["181 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "EDC Essentials 2X", "descp": "Get an additional 5% OFF when buying 2 -

The modules are a bit tough to take apart once they're together, especially when removing a stacked mid module, where you have to insert the pin at an angle - at one point I thought I had managed to get my tools stuck in the configuration I'd put them in! With some practice, and the rush tool, it's not too bad though. A bigger complaint is that the pocket clip cannot attach to the keyport itself, or to the side of a mid module that would face out after being attached to the keyport, so the clip is completely useless for the keyport - it's only usable when configuring the tools in a package with each other and no keyport. Since I had been carrying my keys in a Quietcarry Shorty, which has a pocket clip, this is a pretty big inconvenience for me. I had hoped to be able to clip my keyport to my pocket in a similar way. The backspring on the knife module is not very powerful, and the knife easily leaves the open position. I may end up removing the knife from my daily keyport package since this makes it of limited usefulness, and I always carry an EDC knife anyway. The MOCA module doesn't lock at all, yet to be seen how this affects the performance. The light module doesn't seem incredibly bright, but I haven't done a real test yet. The keyport itself works great of course, it's far easier to add keys and adjust tension than with my shorty. I'm still interested in upgrading to a slide later, though I'll be rethinking my module configuration based on how these work out.

A great gift for Piano players and a best friend to Music Producers, the poster comes in a range of sizes, formats and colours that look great on any wall.\n\u2191 Scales \nNever forget your scales again...or learn them if you never knew them! 4 of the most common scales (major, natural minor, melodic minor & harmonic minor) in all key signatures, including the left and right-hand fingerings. Clearly illustrated for ease of reading and memorisation.\n\u2191 Chords\nPlay me an F# augmented chord. No? Me neither. 5 of the most common chords (major, minor, augmented, diminished & dominant seventh) in all key signatures, including all inversions of the chord. Clearly highlighted so you\u2019ll never be stumped again.\n\u2191 Theory\nDiagrams and charts that help you read sheet music, write chords to a song, learn common musical notations and tempo ranges, identify relative keys, and learn the relationship between different key signatures. All handy references to help you create music.\n\u2191 Design\nThe poster has been meticulously designed to make it easier to read and learn from. And we think it looks great on a wall too!\n\u2191 Formats\nThe poster is available in a range of sizes, formats and colours to suit different tastes and applications. We\u2019ve got you (and your wall) covered.\nStandard \u2013 A1 Size. Printed on 170gsm gloss paper. Folded down to A4 which means it is much cheaper to ship. That's how we can offer FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE on this version.\nRolled - A1 Size. Printed on 250gsm gloss paper. Comes rolled in a cardboard tube. This means there are no creases in the poster, but it does cost more to ship.\nDeluxe (Planned as a stretch goal) - A1 Size. Printed on 250gsm Arcoprint uncoated paper. Features silver foil debossing to logo. Comes rolled in a cardboard tube.\nSpecial Edition (Planned as a stretch goal) - A1 Size. Printed on 270gsm Nexus Black uncoated paper. Features Spot UV and is printed in 4 different metallic inks. Comes rolled in a cardboard tube.\nClassroom (Planned as a stretch goal) \u2013 A0 Size. Printed on 250gsm gloss paper. Fully laminated. Comes rolled in a cardboard tube.\n\u2191 Funding & Rewards\nFunding\nWe've developed the product, designed the brand, built the website and shot the video. Now, all we need is the money to fund our first print-run, so we can get The Really Useful Piano Poster off the ground and into the hands of those whom it will benefit.\nRewards\nWe have a simple reward structure, with something for everyone.\n1. Our \u2018thank you\u2019 reward which is for anyone who wants to donate \u00a31 or more to our campaign. The proceeds will fund the production of a special video, focusing on the technical processes involved in making our posters. The video will be shot using a Phantom Flex 4K ultra-high-speed camera, allowing us to capture ultra-slow-motion, ultra-high-definition footage of the different processes involved in all their technical glory.\n2. We are offering our \u2018Standard\u2019 and \u2018Rolled\u2019 versions of the poster as rewards, with a limited amount available at early-bird pricing.\n3. If we exceed our campaign goal in good time and in a manner that suggests adequate demand, we also have 3 further rewards planned, offering our \u2018Deluxe\u2019, \u2018Special Edition\u2019 and \u2018Classroom\u2019 versions.\nWe are aiming to ship all rewards in June 2018. The final poster may be subject to improvement changes.\nConclusion\nThis poster was designed out of a genuine need to bring certain learning resources together onto 1 easily-accessible format. We are really happy with the end product, and genuinely believe it will help many people learn to play and compose music far more easily. We love that thought, we love this product and we love this business. We hope you do too.\n\u2191 Shipping\nPackaging\nDepending on which version of the poster you buy, it will be shipped in different packaging.\nStandard \u2013 These A1 posters are folded down to A4 size (the same size as a sheet of office paper) and placed inside a plastic A4 mailing bag. This means the overall package is very small and light, therefore it is much cheaper to ship than any of the other options. That's how we can offer FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE on this version.\nRolled, Deluxe & Special Edition \u2013 These versions are the same size as the Standard version (A1), but they come rolled rather than folded (meaning they arrive with you crease-free). They are shipped inside an A1-sized cardboard mailing-tube, which means they are more expensive to ship than the Standard version.\nClassroom \u2013 This version is twice the size of all the other versions, so it is shipped inside an A0-sized cardboard mailing-tube. This means it is the most expensive poster to ship.\nCarriers & Transit Times\nAll Standard posters are sent via 1st Class unregistered mail, which means they do not come with tracking numbers or insurance. We do this so that there is a low-cost option for people who want to buy the poster around the world.\nAll other versions (Rolled, Deluxe, Special Edition & Classroom) are sent via tracked and signed services, meaning you'll receive a tracking number for your order once it has been dispatched, and you'll be required to sign for the package once it reaches you.\nUK\nStandard\nService: Royal Mail 1st Class\nAverage transit time: 1-2 working days\nRolled, Deluxe, Special Edition, Classroom\nService: Royal Mail Special Delivery (Guaranteed by 1pm)\nAverage transit time: 1 working day\nEurope\nStandard\nService: Royal Mail International Standard (Europe)\nAverage transit time: 7-10 working days\nRolled, Deluxe, Special Edition, Classroom\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed (Europe)\nAverage transit time: 7-10 working days\nUnited States & Canada\nStandard\nService: Royal Mail International Standard (World Zone 1)\nAverage transit time: 7-10 working days\nRolled, Deluxe, Special Edition, Classroom\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed (World Zone 1)\nAverage transit time: 7-10 working days\nRest of the World (ROW)\nStandard\nService: Royal Mail International Standard (World Zone 2)\nAverage transit time: 10-12 working days\nRolled, Deluxe, Special Edition, Classroom\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed (World Zone 2)\nAverage transit time: 10-12 working days\nCost\nUK\nStandard - FREE\nRolled, Deluxe & Special Edition - \u00a310\nClassroom - \u00a3TBC\nEurope\nStandard - FREE\nRolled, Deluxe & Special Edition - \u00a315\nClassroom - \u00a3TBC\nUnited States & Canada\nStandard - FREE\nRolled, Deluxe & Special Edition - \u00a315\nClassroom - \u00a3TBC\nRest of the World (ROW)\nStandard - FREE\nRolled, Deluxe & Special Edition - \u00a315\nClassroom - \u00a3TBC", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've developed the product, designed the brand, built the website and shot the video.

The Evolution Pant has been meticulously designed and crafted from the yarn level up to perform, look great, and feel great in every scenario no matter the weather or occasion.\nCOLORS:\nThanks to your overwhelming support we\u2019ve quickly reached our stretch goals, and will now be able to offer The Evolution Pant in THREE classic colors: Charcoal, Kahki, and Navy. \nYou will select colors at the end of the campaign. Note- Colors may vary slightly in production.\n    Water Resistant\nTo create the most versatile pants ever, we had to start from the yarn. We searched for years to find the ideal fabric with the soft feel and look of a cotton fabric, the durability and toughness of a nylon, stretch, and stain resistance. We finally found the ideal partner to create this fabric at a fully vertically integrated, sustainable, Bluesign approved mill in Sweden.\nThe key to the Evolution Pant is the nylon Supplex\u00ae fabric. Nylon is an incredibly durable fiber used in many products from rock climbing harnesses to parachutes. Supplex\u00ae takes the durability of nylon to the next level. The uncommonly strong fibers are air-texturized to make them incredibly soft. Supplex\u00ae takes hundreds of these extremely fine, air-texturized nylon fibers and spins them into thick durable yarns. The added fibers cause the yarns themselves to be stronger, but also more dynamic. The resulting fabric is abrasion resistant, ultra-durable, with the soft hand feel of cotton, and the perfect drape and stretch.\n                                                                                                                            Available in:\nColor: Charcoal, Navy, and Kahki\nSizes: 28-40 \nInseam: Short 30inches, Regular 32 in extendable to 34 in, Long 36 in extendable to 38 in.\n                   REWARDS:\n   ADD-ONS:\nGOALS:\nSTRETCH GOALS REACHED! \nThanks to your overwhelming support we\u2019ve quickly reached our stretch goal of $300,000, and will now be able to offer The Evolution Pant in THREE classic colors: Charcoal, Navy, and Kahki. We will also offer the pants in THREE inseam lengths: Short, Regular and Long. See details under Fit and Care. \nThanks for helping make The Evolution Pant a reality! \nYou will select colors at the end of the campaign.

See details below.\nTHE EVOLUTION PANT SHORT\nSHORT only has 1 inseam length\n THE EVOLUTION PANT REGULAR\nREGULAR has and extendable inseam from 32-34\n THE EVOLUTION PANT LONG\nLONG has an extendable inseam from 36-38\n  Model: 5'10' 160 lbs, size 32\nCARE:\nDue to our pieces having a Durable Water Repellent application, they will absorb less odor and staining. Thus, they can and should be washed less frequently.\nCARE: Wash with like colors with mild detergent cold. Tumble dry low or lay flat. Do not use fabric softener during wash as this may damage the water repellency. Do NOT bleach. Do NOT dry clean.\nA BETTER PROCESS: \nWhy Bluesign? The Bluesign\u00ae system regulates and reduces environmental impact through the entire textile supply chain from yarn to the finished product. The system reviews the use of chemistry, energy usage, water and air emissions, worker safety and consumer safety. By developing guidelines and monitoring the implementation of the bluesign\u00ae system, Bluesign Technologies is encouraging the textile industry to increase their efforts in sustainability and reduce their environmental impact across the entire textile supply chain.\nHandmade in the USA\nUSA Factory\nUSA Factory\nWestern Rise was founded on a desire to make multi-functional clothing that looks amazing and performs even better. We were overwhelmed by the amount of stuff in the world and wanted to simplify our lives and focus on the things that actually matter. Stylish, versatile, performance clothing allows you to do more with less meaning you can ditch the big suitcase, travel light, do more and see more.\nIt took a lot of people to bring this project to you, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited!\nWe truly believe that it is not only our responsibility, it\u2019s our obligation to protect the world we are part of and enjoy. Because of this we are 1% For The Planet Members and donate 1% of our revenue (gross revenue, not profit) to a group of certified nonprofits.\n Please note that per Kickstarter guidelines, we cannot use this crowdfunding project to raise funds for charity. We will certainly support our beneficiary organizations outside of Kickstarter, and celebrate this commitment with our backer community.\nWe can't say it enough. Thank you for supporting believing in us. We can't wait to get these new pants in your hands. \n                                                            In honor of our third birthday as a company, we are launching into a new category, the next generation of apparel.

True world time watches traditionally cost upwards of $5,000 to $20,000, however we devised a new kind of solution. Using a clever dual-layer rotating disc system, we are able to reverse engineer the first quartz hybrid world timer using a Swiss GMT movement.\nThis isn\u2019t our first rodeo. The World Traveller will be our fourth watch collection to be created by Kickstarter. Our quality, transparency, & pricing is second to none - we offer full warranties & communicate our production process from beginning to end.\nElliot Havok watches have been featured in these outlets\nWe\u2019re using the best materials and components we can find to build an excessively quality watch- Italian Natural Calf Leather, Swiss Movement, and 316L Stainless Steel Case with Oyster Bezel.\nFLUTED BEZEL\nThe case is to be sandblasted first, to have all the edges softened, but also brushed on the fluted oyster bezel, to offer a distinct surface. A fluted bezel, such as on a Rolex, practically doubles the available flat polished surface area on the bezel. Allowing not only a greater surface for light refraction, but also the ability to reflect light from different angles at the same time.\nFeaturing Single Layer Superluminova C3\nFor the past 5 years we have chose to work with an established watch manufacturing group known for rigorous quality control. We have a great relationship with our manufacturing partners. We've thoroughly toured their facility multiple times and they are completely aligned with our goals. In 2017, they revamped all their facilities with the latest manufacturing equipment and processes.\nWith multiple stages in the manufacture and quality check process, we are confident in their ability to deliver a quality product. We were impressed with their sophisticated manufacture process including different rooms for assembly, air pressure checkpoints, water pressure stations, 48-hour timekeeping accuracy test, and (of course) a drop test.

It \u201conly\u201d took 1 year, but we finally cracked how to engineer t-shirts that will make it easier than ever to look your best.\n\nThe outside repels liquids and semi-liquids, while the inside wicks away moisture. Sweat stains are not visible and you stay dry even in the most humid climates.\n\nEngineered to make life easier - without compromising on style and comfort. \n\nWe use a unique combination of 3 of the most innovative textile technologies - something which has never been done before in a 100% cotton product.\nOn the outside our t-shirts are hydrophobic. This means that they repel liquids and semi-liquids. Even serious spills like red wine or beetroot juice can easily be rinsed off with water.\nWe added natural silver particles to the yarn, which kills the odour-causing bacteria in your sweat.\nThe inside absorbs and wicks away moisture, automatically spreading your sweat across a larger surface and towards the exterior of the cotton, making it easy to evaporate through the fabric. Moisture wicking also makes the fabric breathable and fast-drying.\n\nVisible sweat stains become a thing of the past - even in a grey t-shirt.\nOur mill in Portugal only uses 100% soft long-staple 180 g/m2 cotton with a high tear resistance.\nOur t-shirt is the perfect marriage between style and performance. Together with our designer we used data from 67.000 men to design the perfect fit. Our grading ensures the basic fit matches 85% of European male bodies\nWe specialize in premium basics made for an action-packed life. They work wonders when you bike to work or go on a long-haul flight. However bear in mind that we make fashion products, not sportswear.\n  Our dress socks are antibacterial and odour-free, thanks to the 12% Frescura silver we have added to the fibers. The silver kills 99.9% of bacteria, which means your feet (and socks) stay fresh all day and even longer.\nOur story began one year ago on this platform, when we launched the odour and stain repellent white dress shirt.\n\nWe got 1000% funded and immediately quit our jobs, so we could turn LABFRESH into a real business.\n\nWithout Kickstarter we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\n\nLaunching new products is scary. It requires a lot of resources to get new technologies out of the lab and into a real supply chain.\n\nThat is why we would like to see if the Kickstarter community is interested in our new invention before we go into full-scale production.\n\nOur mission hasn\u2019t changed. We want to fight fast fashion and over-consumption by creating products engineered to last a lifetime. True sustainability is when you can wear your clothing for years instead of buying new stuff all the time.\nLotte Vink & Kasper Brandi Petersen\nHow to measure A and B 1) Lay your favorite t-shirt on a flat surface 2) Start measuring on the seam 1cm below armpit (A) or 1/2-way your waist height (B)3) Measure the distance to the exact same spot on the other side4a) Exact match? Great!\n4b) Not an exact match? Not to worry. A deviation up to 3cm should still fit, as the shirt will be stretched out.\n\nC and E should be the leading measurements when deciding what size to choose.\nNo harsh chemicals. Yes, we use chemicals. But we don\u2019t dip our fabric in big tubs of chemicals. Instead of traditional coatings we press a paste directly into the fibers, so that the surface remains unaffected. OEKO-TEX certified and in accordance with the REACH, which is the strictest standard for use of chemicals in textiles in the world. It\u2019s so safe so our scientists literally use their mouths during the development process.\nWe work with some of the best mills and factories in Portugal - one of the most respected manufacturing hubs in Europe. All treatments are sourced within the EU.\n                                              Unlimited cancellation. You are able to cancel your order at any point of time and get a full refund.\n90 days size guarantee. If your size is wrong we send you a new shirt in the right size free of charge (we do not provide free return labels).\nFree and easy shipping across the EU, US & Canada. Shipping costs to other parts of the world is only \u20ac15.\nThis campaign has been promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped over 5,000 creators make their projects a reality.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLABFRESH is fashion, not sportswear. You might be able to run a marathon in it without smelling, but that is not what our products are intended for. \n\nWith regards to stains we have been able to wash off any liquids and semi-liquids with water. However if you rub a substance into the fabric with force or if a very oily sauce comes in contact with the fabric, it will eventually make a slightly visible stain. You'll have to put it in the washer at 30 degrees to get the stain off. \n\nProduction delays and unforeseen obstacles are always a risk. This is however not our first rodeo and we know our factory and mill well. We are very happy with the 35 perfect prototypes we had so far, and we are confident they will be punctual.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac35 or more", "title": "1 LABFRESH T-SHIRT", "descp": "Kickstarter Special -
