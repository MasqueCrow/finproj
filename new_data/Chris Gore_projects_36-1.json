ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE DECADE! A POWER PUNCH OF GUTS AND GLAMOUR! HOTTEST FEMALE ACTION HERO - EVER!\nThat was critics worldwide reviewing our 2015 internationally released film CRAWL or DIE!

Nicole - tell  them why we are here...\nNICOLE ALONSO: Okay -  let me and Oak push our rescue dog  'BABY GIRL\" and rescue cat 'WEDNESDAY\" off our laps. There. Right - Oklahoma and I live in our film studio where filmed CRAWL or DIE.\nOKLAHOMA WARD: That studio resides In a little town outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Our studio is actually a large pole barn. Yes - we live in a barn.  What do we do beside exist on this planet ... well, we make movies. It's not a hobby. We both take it seriously and are passionate about it. We make movies that are in 5.1 - scored - color corrected - QC passed per Industry standards... legit - finished projects down to the artwork and trailers. Proof - CRAWL or DIE - Hollywood bought and sold.\nNICOLE ALONSO: CRAWL or DIE was given worldwide distribution. The movie can be found in movie theaters and stores across the US, the UK, Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Russia, etc. The CRAWL or DIE experience was incredible!\nOKLAHOMA WARD: it hit international in 2015 and just three weeks ago - it was dubbed - horribly dubbed ... hilariously dubbed -  in Russian.THREE weeks ago lol. Show them Nikki...\nNICOLE ALONSO: You got to see this lol - here...\nPLAY\n\nOKLAHOMA WARD:  Are we bragging - nah. We live in a GARAGE lol. Ya' know what though - Nicole, I - and all involved in CRAWL or DIE are damn proud of our hard work and passion. Our fans made the whole multi-year journey just the absolute BEST!\nNICOLE ALONSO ...CHEERS! *He's laughing at me lol*\nOKLAHOMA WARD: Tell them why we are here...\nNICOLE ALONSO Right! Well... below is the official statements... \n\n\nHey, fans and friends, new and old.\nWelcome to the #TANKarmy and to our Kickstarter campaign! For those of you that are new here, we are Indie director, Oklahoma Ward, and actress and singer, Nicole Alonso. You may remember us from our first feature-length movie, Crawl or Die.\nIn 2015, after a lot of blood, sweat and tears we released our very first film, CRAWL or DIE, under the banner of our own production company, Backyard Films. We were so excited that, upon release, our film was given worldwide distribution. CRAWL or DIE could be found in movie theaters and stores across the US, the UK, Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Russia, etc. This was incredible news! Unfortunately, what this also meant was that the majority of profits went to our distributors, who raked in a lot of money, while we \u2013 in three-plus years total \u2013 made less than five figures.\n\nMake no mistake - we are not griping. We are ECSTATIC with the amount of fans that we gained from the movie. But we also learned every inch of the business and this time we are approaching distribution from an experienced point of view.\n\nAfter its initial release, we were approached by multiple larger film studios offering us budgets beyond our wildest dreams to sign with them. However, we knew that in doing so, we would have to compromise the vision of the character of TANK that we \u2013 and you \u2013 had for her/our films.  That was just something we weren't willing to do. We were told that without their money, we'd never be able to make anything better than what we had already done. And that was when we realized we had made the right choice because a company that doesn't believe in us, isn't one we want to be associated with.\n\nAnd so, with heart, and grit, and you by our sides, we came to the realization that what we lacked in funds, we made up for in love and loyalty. You guys, our fans \u2013 our loyal #TANKarmy \u2013 have been worth more to us than any amount of money. We've read every message, and email, and letter you've sent us, and through all of that, one thing became abundantly clear to Oklahoma and myself. You wanted more TANK. You needed a sequel. You demanded a sequel. And so - sequel(s) you shall have!\nFor over a year now, we have been filming the follow-ups to CRAWL or DIE that you have all been dreaming of. It's bigger and better than ever. Larger sets, different locations, and an even bigger cast. We can't share many details right now, but we can say that TANK IS BACK! And she is back with a vengeance. And this time, she will come face-to-face with the Alien in a battle you'll have to see! We have a team of over 40 incredible and devoted people, including waiters, hair stylists, factory workers, blue collar workers, etc. \u2013 all working for free \u2013 who, along with Oklahoma and myself, and the rest of our cast, have been hard at work, right here in the Midwest, creating a project that we are all super proud of and cannot wait to show you.\n\nAnd here's where you come in. Because our vision for this sequel is so much bigger than CRAWL or DIE, and because we didn't make much profit from our first film, we've run into a budgeting snag. We made the decision to film in 4K, which meant we needed five hard drives just to store the footage. The last hard drive we had to buy basically wiped out our budget for the theme song I plan to record, as well as the score, and some of the post-production costs. So we are turning to you, the fans \u2013 our #TANKarmy \u2013 to help us ensure we give you a film that not only we, but you as well, can be proud of.\nWe are so proud to have our brand new cast members that have joined us also! \nDan Langley, Lorie Northrup Crabtree, Matt Crabtree, Larry Huitt, Tana Greenlee, Rim Adel Basma, Lara Barauna, Sean Stark, Jeremy Sellers, Allison Harper, Martin Kamm, Nathaniel Davis, Donny Griffin, Brittany Bruton, David Zeliff Jason Sunday, Avalon Howard, Willam Langley, Hannity Feamster, Haven Bruton, Donna Ledford, Carissa McGee, Tyler Bolton, Jean Langley, Landon Frank and Myretta Ballou!\nWe don't expect - nor would we accept a - gift of money. Instead - we felt grand offering merchandise for money! I and Oklahoma are proud to offer the perks below for your help! Check them out! \n\nTHE REWARDS:\nWe have awesome custom rewards for this campaign! Check them out below or see the descriptions to the right for further details.\nWe vow to make this a fun experience for you and us! For backers only - we will be updating special challenges with special gifts in the backers only section. We will also be sharing exclusive content in the backers only section multiple times during the week. \n\nAlso as a quick reminder - Kickstarter is an ALL or NOTHING platform. If we do not meet our goal by the end of the campaign - you will not be charged and we won't get any of the money.\n\nPlease remember - we have been involved with 2 campaigns that were successful. We have already filmed the movie - we are in Post Production so please don't feel that your donation is going towards a project or towards people that may never start their project. \n\nNo matter what - even if you can't donate - sharing, telling your friends - all of it - is why we are here. We will be live constantly - most probably daily - and feel free to reach out, talk, ask questions and send me candy corn, lol. Oak hates candy corn which means more for me. Much love! \n\nNicole & Oklahoma \n...TANK out.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project brings it's unique challenges and this one is no exception. We knew when we started this project it was going to be a HUGE mountain to climb. Filming a series is quadruple the amount of work to filming a one off film. Each episode is like a whole movie in and of itself. We learned quickly on set and adapted well to this heightened workload and have been loving the challenge. \n\nPrincipal photography is just about wrapped up and we have moved at record speed getting all the footage shot. It took us just over year to film and now we are excited to head into the post production phase and meet all of the challenges it has to bring head on!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Nicole Alonso\n3 created \u00b7 5 backed\nActor.

Your skills will be tested across four scenarios, or Books, that each feature unique rules, allies, abilities, and epic boss battles! You'll have a limited amount of resources and turns to complete each of these four Books, and if Batman's Grit, Sanity, or Health ever drops to zero, it's game over\u2026\nBeyond staying alive in the short term, the world's greatest detective also has to plan for the long term: The \"Doomsday Clock\" persists across all four Books, as does the constantly evolving and always chaotic Gotham City. If the Doomsday Clock ever strikes midnight or Gotham becomes too overrun with Riots, it\u2019s all over (hang up your cape and cowl... or try again!).\nEach Book lasts four rounds and, in that time, you'll have to acquire enough Clues to track down the Boss's location, and then dispense justice by defeating them in order to progress to the next Book.\nGameplay each round is split into two halves. In the first half, you strategically pick your favorite Fight and Detective cards, which grant you unique abilities to prepare for future battles and for navigating Gotham. But think twice, because each of the cards you don't select has a unique Event that becomes part of the Event deck, which triggers each turn to keep you on your toes! In the second half of each round, Batman and his allies (such as Robin) will take to the streets of Gotham. Combine Ally Actions with Batman for some awesome combos!\nAfter each round, you'll be able to DRAW directly on the board to create a new pathway between locations in Gotham. Make your way towards locations with possible leads; you may hit dead ends, DESTROY locations, or find Clues. Find enough Clues, and you'll learn the location of the Boss. Take down the Boss in order to complete the Book!\nWith a variable setup and a nearly endless combination of Fight, Detective, and Event cards, each playthrough of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns - The Game will throw a unique combination of resources and challenges at you!\n           \n \nFor the uninitiated, The Dark Knight Returns is likely the most beloved Batman story ever told. Writer/artist Frank Miller\u2019s four-issue series from 1986 was a watershed moment in comics, as it brought a dark and cinematic feel to the medium. Every Batman story since then owes something to it.\nLet\u2019s set the scene: In Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Gotham City is controlled by a brutal street gang called the Mutants and, since it\u2019s the 1980s, the US and USSR appear to be on a collision course for mutual nuclear destruction. Also, being a superhero is illegal and Superman is now an agent for the government. It\u2019s pretty dystopian, to say the least.\nAs for Bruce Wayne, he is 55 years old, way past his prime. And he\u2019s been retired for years, ever since the Joker murdered Jason Todd, the last Robin. Spurred by the Mutants\u2019 crimes and a reminder about the murder of his parents, he returns to his crime-fighting ways, but with a new edge. This time, he\u2019s not holding anything back, using every bit of his smarts and battered body to take on the Mutant Leader, old archenemies the Joker and Two-Face, and even Superman, his one-time good friend. With Carrie Kelley, the new Robin, at his side, the Dark Knight takes another stand for justice and the soul of the city (and world) that he has defended for so long.\n  Please note: Due to COVID-19, most shippers have added surcharges to their rates.

He hit skid row, but was starting to make a comeback when he was kidnapped by a bizarre troupe of scoundrels calling themselves the Vaude-Villains.

Thank you to everyone who's backed us so far! Any extra money is going towards helping us to secure additional high-profile interviews and license some \"wishlist\" music we otherwise couldn't afford. So we're introducing our first stretch goal to encourage anyone who's tempted to back us, or even increase their pledge.\nStretch Goal #1: \u00a317,500 - Receive a seasonal postcard\nIf we raise \u00a317,500 before the campaign ends, we will produce a series of seasonal postcards featuring some familiar faces from the film, and will be delivering one to each backer on every tier (\u00a310 or higher).\n August 30th - Tiers Update! \nWe've just passed the \u00a310,000 mark and are over two-thirds funded. Thank you to everyone who has backed us! To show our appreciation, we're updating the rewards tiers, as well as adding a new tier. \nAll tiers (\u00a310 or higher) will receive an exclusive desktop background. If you pledged Farmhand (\u00a325) or higher, you're getting a high-resolution download of our poster. If you pledged Cattle Farmer (\u00a3200) or higher, you'll now received a print of our poster signed by the director, Oscar Harding.\nWe've also introduced a new tier - Colour Schemer (\u00a3125 or higher) - which offers both T-Shirts (S-XXL) and upgrades your \"Thank You\" credit in the film to \"Special Thanks\".\nIf you've pledged Poultry Farmer (\u00a375) or higher and have already made use of our backer referral scheme (refer 3 new backers and get upgraded to the tier above yours), don't worry - you'll still be upgraded to Cattle Farmer and skip the new tier.\nWe\u2019ve Got Something To Show You\u2026\nMy Grandfather, who lived in the rural English county of Somerset, passed away a decade ago. Amongst his possessions was a videotape from one of his neighbours, a farmer called Charles Carson. I could never have anticipated the kind of journey that Charles and his tape would take me on. \nCharles\u2019 feature-length home movie, \u201cLife On The Farm\u201d, can best be described as \u201cMonty Python meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d.\nSelf-shooting, editing and scoring everything manually, Charles\u2019 home movies are hilarious, imaginative and completely unique. If you\u2019re looking for skeletons riding lawnmowers; cow births from multiple angles; a rendition of Scotland The Brave performed on pieces of tractor machinery; or a close-up look at a placenta, you\u2019ll love \u201cLife On The Farm\u201d.\nA screenshot from one of Charles' home movies\nThe video goes to places that some might consider to be pretty dark. There\u2019s a real argument to be made that Charles was an early pioneer of the Selfie and the Death Positivity Movement. He\u2019s a remarkable, undiscovered outsider artist and it\u2019s time his story was told.\nDesperate to learn more about the man and his movies, I\u2019ve embarked on a years-long journey that\u2019s been full of twists and turns. I\u2019ve discovered that Charles has appeared on TV multiple times with his inventions and his award-winning photography, from Tomorrow\u2019s World to You\u2019ve Been Framed!, and it turns out that we\u2019re not the only people who fell in love with his work\u2026\nA Life On The Farm is an exploration and celebration of Charles Carson and his movies, which present a moving and laugh-out-loud document of a time and place in danger of being lost to history.\nThe Team\nOscar Harding, director of the documentary\nThere\u2019s me - Oscar Harding. As well as directing the documentary, I feature prominently in it, guiding you through the story. I\u2019ve worked in various capacities - including research, distribution and marketing - for documentaries and independent films in the UK, Ireland and the USA that have been nominated for BAFTAs, a BIFA and an Academy Award.\nEdward Lomas, Dominik Platen and Hannah Christensen\nAlso producing are Edward Lomas and Dominik Platen, my partners at Sonderbar Pictures. Edward is an experienced director and DP and has shot a variety of shorts, documentaries, music videos and commercials. His latest short \u2018Benefits\u2019 was produced as part of Channel 4\u2019s Random Acts and screened at Curzon Cinemas nationwide. Dominik has experience as a director, writer and producer on various short films and documentaries and most recently was a finalist in the prestigious 2019 The Pitch Film Fund. He has also earned a number of credits as VFX artist and 2D supervisor on blockbusters including The Lion King, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and the upcoming Morbius.\nIn addition to some brilliant crew across the UK and USA - including our incredibly talented editor Hannah Christensen - our documentary has attracted the interest and support of Joe Pickett and Nick Prueher of The Found Footage Festival, who have not only invested in the project but have also come onboard as Executive Producers. \nJoe Pickett and Nick Prueher (Found Footage Festival), Executive Producers\nBetween us, we have enough experience across documentary filmmaking and various international film industries that Charles\u2019 story is in safe hands. We\u2019ve worked hard to ensure the documentary is every bit as engaging and entertaining as the home movies it\u2019s investigating.\nWhat We\u2019ve Done So Far\nWe\u2019ve filmed almost all of our interviews, and our rough cut of the film is shaping up very nicely. We have discovered more about the story of Charles and his home movies by interviewing family members and people in his village who knew him best, as well as those who have become huge fans of his work. We feature everyone from a vicar and a psychologist, to a journalist for The Guardian and farmers in their 80s. In addition to Joe and Nick, we have also interviewed the wonderful guys at Everything Is Terrible!, who also count themselves as fans of Charles\u2019 work.    \nEverything Is Terrible! have conducted an interview for the documentary\nWe have a hell of a story to tell, but we need to finish principal photography, complete post-production to the highest possible standard, and launch a marketing and festival campaign that ensures we can reach as many people as possible.\nWhat We Need\nA breakdown of how money will be spent if we reach our goal\nThere are still a few loose threads to Charles\u2019 story that we need to wrap up, including his time lecturing at an agricultural college, and one or two high-profile interviewees we\u2019re not able to announce just yet across multiple countries.\nBut most of the money will be going towards finishing post-production, including:\nEditing\nSound Design\nSound Mixing\nColor Grading\nMusic Licensing\nSourcing and Clearing Archive Footage\nLegal Fees - Copyright, etc.\nOnce the film is complete, we have a festival strategy ready, and any support from backers will help cover the costs of submissions and travel to the festivals, so we can answer whatever burning questions audiences have about Charles\u2019 story and the making of the film... whenever we're able to get back to attending festivals in-person!\nNot to forget, of course, Kickstarter\u2019s fees for hosting this campaign and the production & shipping of our rather wonderful rewards... \nWhat We\u2019re Offering\nA Life On The Farm has been a personal passion project years in the making. Every single cent (or penny, depending on where you\u2019re backing us from) is seriously appreciated. But gratitude is not enough - we\u2019ve got some great perks in return for whatever you can give to support this film, including your name in the credits. Charles made his movies for as many people as possible to enjoy, and we think it\u2019s rather fitting to have you all associated with his work.\nWe're giving away T-shirts - from an environmentally and socially responsible vendor who produces sweatshop-free goods from recycled waste materials, with methods that use up the 7 times less water than most manufacturers- as well as digital and physical copies of the film, and for those who happen to still have a VCR stashed away somewhere, copies on VHS. \nOur beautiful poster artwork by Somerset artist Ellie Powell\nFor those who are able to contribute more, we\u2019re able to offer some exclusive rewards.

We also reward users for watching the content creators that they love by giving them points that they can redeem for gift cards, content creator merch, or to donate to their favorite creators.\nRewarding Users on the Platform\nThe biggest draw for users is the fact that users get rewarded for watching the content creators that they love. Here is how it works: Users watch the content, they get points for watching the content based on the number of ads that play, and the user can redeem those points for content creator merch, for gift cards, or they can just donate them to their favorite content creators. \nUsers getting points for watch creator's content does 3 things.\n1.  Users will want to watch content more because they are getting rewarded for watching the content that they love when they normally wouldn't anywhere else.\n2. Users have a reason to watch here instead of on other platforms because if they love a creator's content then why not get rewarded to watch it?\n3. It helps content creators get their user base to the platform that would normally not switch over to watch because it incentivizes them to do so. \nAdvertiser Friendly Content\nThe most popular content platform has several major issues that has content creators fearing yellow buttons raining from the skies and the first one is Advertiser Friendly Content. On Pocketvid we don't demonetize content. Either it is allowed on the platform or it isn't. So in other words all content can be monetized!! Basically, the rule of thumb is: Is it allowed on the most popular content platform? Then it can be monetized on Pocketvid.  Creators will have the option to demonetize their own content or donate the proceeds of a video to charity if they so choose based on the content of that video.\nCopyright and False Claims\nCopyright on video platforms can be a nightmare because you can work hard on a video for hours just to get the video taken down or the video monetized for a different company. Well worry not my content creator friends!!! We have got you covered. We care about content creators on the platform and we want to work with you and the company so that you always get paid for the video that you post. You adding a single 3 second piece of music, you showing a clip of a TV show to criticize it or review it, or someone claiming that something is their content when their content is not even present; these practices need to end and we want the platform to do something about it. These are ways we want to try to fix the problem with copyright:\nWe will review all claims as they come in to verify if it is a false claim or not. \nIf it is a false claim we will let you know that a claim was submitted but disregarded as it was not valid.\nIf it is a valid claim then we will let you know what is wrong within the video and let you know how to revise the video to make it fair use. If the video still is determined to be violating fair use and you submit an updated version of the video we will then review the revised video to verify what change you made or you can ask for a second review of the video if you feel that the video does not violate fair use. \nIf no change was made to the video then you can take down the video, request partial monetization, or you can file a counter notification if you think we are still incorrect and the should be monetized fully. In that case the filer of the case will have to take legal action to proceed.\nIf a change was made to the video but it was not what was needed then we will ask for another revision until it is fixed, you decide to request partial monetization, or you decide to remove the video\nPartial monetization of a video will be available in certain circumstances that we can work with the filer of the claim to get money for all parties\nWhen a video is claimed monetization does not stop at any point. All of the money becomes held and will be released after the claim in resolved.\nIf you have any questions on copyright send us a message and we will get back to you  and potentially add the info to this list.\n Platform Features\nJust about any feature that you have seen on other platforms will be on this platform. The features on the platform that make us distinct from other platforms are as follows: \nContent Creator Merch as rewards\nCollapse-able merch bar below creator's videos that will direct users to the creator's merch store or allow the user to use their rewards for the purchase.\nThe ability to fully customize the look, feel, style, and structure of your channels or account.\nRewards for watching videos with ads\nPlaylists with additional functionality like inverting the order of the list of the videos and subscribing to playlists\nYou will be able to subscribe to playlists, channels, and the creators who made those channels. Some channels can have more than one creator linked to it because they could be a team.\nEach channel will have some sort of community tab that can be renamed to whatever they want their community to be called. \nGot an idea for any other features that don't exist on other platform? Let us know at james@pocketvid.tv or contact us here on kickstarter.\nLive Streaming\nWith a platform like this it only makes sense to have live streaming added into the platform. We want to use what we have to change the game in live streaming for creators to give them the tools that they could use to succeed. Here is what we want to add:\nWe will integrate stream labs into the platform so that when a user donates to you we will not take a cut of that revenue. \nThere will be a commercial break feature that will play an ad in the middle of your stream when you select it. Users will get rewarded for watching the ads and can use them to give back to the creators!\nThe video generated from a live stream can create problems when it comes to copyright laws and fair use. We will set up a system (hopefully just by integrating stream labs) that will record the live stream with all of the different pieces of the video being integrated. This means when you go live and the stream is recorded we will record the notifications, you, the game you are playing, and anything else you want to have as an input separately so you can stream without fear and only parts of a section of the recorded video will be removed if necessary. \nPaid subscriptions will exist on channels that will allow users to chose the number of tiers they want to have, the cost of these tiers, and the number of emotes that are available to the users for those tiers or special content for those users. We will allow creators to have up to 75 emotes for their users and potentially even more as time goes on.\nUsers will be able to use their points to subscribe to a channel with the paid subscriptions allowing them to use their points to support their favorite creators in even more ways.\nBacker Rewards\nFor $1 or more you will get your name on the Pocketvid wall of fame which will have all of the names of the backers on it starting from the most donated to the least donated.\nYou can get an Exclusive Pocketvid T-shirts for $20 or more in these styles:\nYou can get these Exclusive Pocketvid Hoodies for $35 or more in these styles:\nYou can get 1 Exclusive Pocketvid T-Shirt 1 Exclusive Pocketvid Hoodie for $55 or more.\nFor $500 or more you will become a part of the pocketvid beta to help improve the platform before the release and get 1 shirt and 1 hoodie.\nLastly, for $1000 or more you will get a permanent coveted spot in the beta testers group that will test all upcoming features on the platform, be part of the beta, get the shirt, and the hoodie. \nWhere will the funds go?\nWe have several goals with this money. With the $40,000 we will be able to:\nFinish the creation of the platform and all current features by hiring a larger team.\nPay for the legal fees we still need to pay for in regards to the DMCA and hire our attorney for the platform. \nStart our beta and start our outreach to content creators that we would love to have on the platform.\nFill our rewards store with the gift cards needed to supply the rewards to our users\nRelease the app/website in the United States to all users and to approved creators worldwide\nPurchase server space enough to run the application and website.\nSadly all things that have to do with live streaming and launching worldwide will have to be stretch goals. This is because we wanted to at least get the minimum amount of costs out of the way that would make the platform releasable as soon as possible. \nStretch Goals\n$50,000 - We will start working on an international release. This will take much time as lots will have to go into making this platform be able to compete worldwide.\n$85,000 - We will make the effort to add in live streaming. Live streaming has the same aspect with ads that you will get points for them. The creator will be able to use a commercial break button to run an ad to all viewers and they will be able to donate points to the creators they are watching. We will also try to integrate stream labs into the platform for donations.\n$150,000 - We will work on hiring tons of staff so that we have people always on hand to fix your issues like reviewing videos and answering questions.\n$300,000 - We will create our own AI system that will work hand in hand with reviewers to get rid of content on the platform that violates the Terms of Service and that is not considered Fair Use. We will also use this to review content on the platform that has copyrighted material to determine if the content is fair use or not and designate the content as fair use.\n$700,000 - We will invest more into the international release in some high traffic markets. These markets are TBD but will most likely be countries such as the Philippines, India, South Korea, and some countries in the EU.\n$1,000,000 - We will have some money for servers that we can use to manage traffic ourselves. We will need to acquire a housing unit and the internet to do it.\n$2,000,000 - We will have all that we need made up for the world wide release to prepare the app and website with all of their different versions for the rest of the world. We will do a very slow release after we have gotten enough revenue to support the addition of the other countries. A slow release means we will open in selective countries as we have the means to do so.\n$5,000,000 - We will be world wide all of the features we need for the app and site will be added. \n$8,000,000 - We will make a few server farms in the United States to become competitive with the other Video Platforms in the world. \n$20,000,000 - We will be able to create all of the server farms needed to build the entire company including hiring staff based on what our needs are. This will make us have real competition with the other large video platforms.\nRemember that the stretch goals above are influenced by the fact that people will be using the platform and we will have revenue coming in. Depending on the number of users on the platform we will also be getting more ad companies on the platform and having our own advertisers that directly advertise with us that will pull in more revenue to fulfill all of these goals. \nTechnical Stuff\nHow do ads work with paying the users?\nWe use rewarded video to cover the cost of rewarding the users. The breakdown of the pay from all of the ads will be 50-25-25, 50% of all ad revenue goes to the user rewards and the other 25% and 25% goes to the company and the content creator respectively. This can still change but this is the basic idea of how it would work. If it does change it will only be for the benefit for the users and creators to make them all make more.\nHow are you building the platform?\nWe are building the platform in flutter. It is new and does come with its challenges but it is easier to build in because once you have built an android app then it is easy to convert to being an IOS app.\nHave any other technical questions? Send us a message and we will answer it here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many problems we will have when we start up that prevent us from just allowing just anyone and everyone to be able to just upload their content and international users from joining the platform. These include: \n\n1. The amount of server space and size of server infrastructure that allows us to accommodate all \n people all over uploading content.\n\n2. The laws of every nation of the world are different and for a content platform that makes things challenging because we want to make sure that we are abiding by the laws of every nation and have a tailored experience for each of those users.\n\n3. The rewards will be different for each nation because the gift cards will need to be different for every nation and have to be tailored for those users.\n\nThese issues have caused us to decide that we will have to have a slow release if we only reach our basic funding goal. With our stretch goals we will be able to move closer and closer to allowing all people to upload and allowing all users to join the platform.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nEnergy efficiency is important with any tech company.

Kevin Thomas here, the founder of GravGrip\u2122.  GravGrip\u2122 is a hydraulic camera stabilizer for your cell phone and action camera.  GravGrip\u2122 is waterproof, battery free, affordable, and ultra compact!  \nGravGrip's first prototype was hand made over 5 years ago!  I have dedicated the last 3 years to developing and prototyping GravGrip's design in my spare time.  What started as a side project in college is now a product I'm ready to share with the world.  \nTo make this happen we need your help!  Back GravGrip\u2122 today so we can start production!  Our manufacturing partners are ready, we will signal the green light as soon as our funding goal is accomplished.  GravGrip's design is production ready, so no need for long prototyping delays!  \nWe are offering GravGrip\u2122 at a price you can't beat!  Get excited to explore your world with hydraulic camera stabilization!\n\nGravGrip\u2122 includes an Action Camera and Cell Phone adapter.\nMount your Cell Phone or Action Camera to GravGrip\u2122 with the included adapters. Lock your camera into position by rotating the blue knob.\n2 POSITIONS: Mount your camera in the \"ROLL\" position to keep a stable horizon or in the \"TILT\" position to easily capture those epic ultra low and high angle shots. Lock into position by rotating the blue knob.\nRotate weight set upwards to decrease gimbal speed or downwards to increase gimbal speed. Fine tune GravGrip\u2122 to your liking. Twist the weights together to lock into position!\nGravGrip's balance correction system is adjusted using hand force. Some camera's have an offset center of Gravity (hint hint: GoPro), easily level the horizon with a quick change in position. This system will NOT budge while in use!\nOur custom extension pole is no joke! This pole has an unmatched premium feel to it. You will not be disappointed in our combo deal.\nEnjoy a small sample of the work dedicated to GravGrip\u2122 over the past few years. I can truthfully say blood, sweat, and tears were put into GravGrip's development.\nWhy would I purchase GravGrip\u2122 if my camera has amazing internal image stabilization?\nWe get asked this a lot! And the answer is easy.  GravGrip\u2122 is a great tool for videographers to not only increased stabilization in their videos, but to capture those hard to reach angles that would otherwise be impossible.  I have a GoPro Hero 8 Black and GravGrip\u2122 in the tilt position is a game changer!  Transition with ease from ultra low to up high angles.  It's easy, and everyone will wonder how you did it!\nGravGrip\u2122 + Image Stabilization = Next Level Footage\nWhy doesn't GravGrip\u2122 automatically come with a pole?\nGravGrip\u2122 can be mounted to any GoPro compatible mount and we know a lot of our customers will already have these items.  This ensures we can provide you the lowest price possible!  Don't have a pole?  You're in luck, we have a combo deal that includes a GravGrip\u2122 custom designed extension pole or a 5\" hand grip.  We strive to provide premium products, and our extension pole is just that.\nIs GravGrip\u2122 waterproof?\nYES!  GravGrip's design is composed of zero electronics, all components are either stainless steel, aluminum or a durable plastic (glass filled nylon).  Please note:  GravGrip\u2122 is not functional under water, but feel free to take GravGrip\u2122 out in the rain for some epic shots without a worry!  If you get GravGrip\u2122 wet with salt water we do recommend a cleaning with fresh water.  \nWill GravGrip\u2122 work with plus sized phones?\nYES!  GravGrip\u2122 has been successfully tested with many plus sized phones (iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 11 Max, Galaxy S20, etc.).\nCan GravGrip support added weight?  (ex: Phone Case, Phone Lens)\nYES!  No need to take your case off while using GravGrip\u2122 (unlike many electronic gimbals).  We have tested several cheap iPhone 11 lens with success (for weight testing purposes).  We do expect cell phones equipped with higher end lens to work without problems, just know there is no guaranteed.\nCan GravGrip\u2122 work on a chest or helmet mount?\nGravGrip\u2122 can mount to any GoPro\u00ae compatible mount, but we do not recommend mounting to your chest or helmet mount.  In some situations GravGrip\u2122 will work on these mounts, but GravGrip\u2122 is best paired with a pole.  The stabilization between your arm movement and GravGrip\u2122 can produce amazing results. \nCan I use GravGrip\u2122 in cold temperatures?\nYes, we have tested GravGrip\u2122 at roughly -5 C for extended periods of time with no issue.  At colder temperatures, changes in GravGrip's hydraulic stabilization system may occur.  GravGrip's hydraulic fluid will stiffen and rotation speed will decrease.  You can counter this with adjusting the off set weight, but more testing needs to happen before confirmation. The good thing is you can disengage GravGrip's hydraulic system by removing the lid. In the roll position you can get a great balance without the use of hydraulics.  In this case, temperature will not play a roll in performance!  Hydraulics is a must in the \"Tilt\" position!\nNOTE:  If GravGrip\u2122 is kept indoors before use, it will take time for temperature to affect its operation.  Users will likely notice no change in performance.  If stored outside in low temperatures GravGrip\u2122 will see noticeable changes to performance. \nWill GravGrip's weights loosen and fall off?\nGravGrip's 2 counterweights are very secure when tightened against each other. Throughout all GravGrip\u2122 testing we have completed, not once have they loosened! They take a good bit of force to break apart, but are still easily adjusted by hand.\nWhy wouldn't I buy GravGrip\u2122?\nWe really don't know?!  Affordable, Waterproof, Ultra Compact, No Batteries?\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\n\n\nReturn policy.

You can control the turn signals on Lumos Ultra by simply raising your arm.\nKeep the sun and rain out of your eyes while you ride with an optional attachable visor.\nLumos Ultra will also come with an option to add MIPS. This is an extra safety feature that is built into the helmet to add protection against rotational motion transferred to the brain. Rotational motion affects the brain and increase the risk for minor and severe brain injuries.\nPLAY\n\n\nChips On Board (COB) is a method of LED packaging which has a number of advantages over more conventional technologies. It allows for a more compact footprint whilst delivering a higher intensity of light meaning you\u2019ll be seen from further away. It is also what gives the lights a more uniform look. We like to think of it as Currently Our Best LED technology.\nIt\u2019s our most vented helmet yet. We\u2019ve been listening to customer feedback and have paid very close attention to the way Ultra directs air through its internal venting system. We\u2019ve created 3 enormous exhausts in the rear to ensure hot air gets pushed out helping to keep the rider cool whether on a commute or on a training session.\nWe\u2019ve already done the initial crash tests on our beta units and they pass with plenty of safety margin to spare. We\u2019re confident that Ultra will be one of the safest helmets on road even without the lights on. \nWhen you ride, you must be prepared to ride in any weather. That's why Ultra is built to IPX6 standards, to withstand the elements and keep you riding bright, come rain or shine.\nWe've worked really hard to improve the weight of our smart helmets. By using more efficient manufacturing methods, we were able to use less material without compromising the high level of protection that our helmets provide. Our very first helmet weighed in at 490 grams, Ultra is estimated to have a final weight of 370 grams. Now that's a big win (or loss).\nThere are multiple benefits to wearing lights high up on the head. Firstly, it makes it possible to be seen more clearly by motorists on the road. You're less likely to encounter a situation where your lights are being blocked by parked cars or other things on the road. Secondly, by illuminating your head, it's much easier for motorists to see where you're looking and thus know approach more carefully.\nFor Kickstarter, we've decided to go crazy with colors. The beauty of pre-launching Ultra is that we get to lock down the exact quantities of colors and sizes so that we can optimise production, and therefore create more variants and ensure you find the perfect one.\nThe colors you see here are likely going to be limited to just Kickstarter. After the campaign ends, many of the colors here will NOT make it to retail. So if you see a color you like, now may be the only time to get it.\nWe will be gathering feedback throughout the campaign on what colors our backers would like to see. We have a few ideas already, such as metallic colors, country colors and possibly even 2-tone colors that change with different viewing angles. Stay tuned :D\nUltra is the helmet for everyone, from kids to even bigger kids. It is available in the sizes S, M-L and XL, and they are all equipped with a click-dial fit system to ensure that Ultra sits firmly yet comfortably on your head.\nSmall (S): 51- 55 cm\nMedium to Large (M-L): 54- 61 cm\nExtra Large (XL): 61- 65 cm\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nDespite starting with a design brief of creating the successor to the wildly popular Kickstart helmet, but at half the cost, the design of Ultra has been a labour of love. We could\u2019ve just taken the simpler approach of cutting costs from the Kickstart helmet, but we wanted to create a helmet that takes all of our learnings from building smart wearables and push the limits of helmet design to completely new heights. We\u2019ve agonized over all the small details refining them to the point where they\u2019d feel more at home on a $200+ helmet.\nJust a few of the things we\u2019ve considered include a design that\u2019s not too overstated, yet exudes style. We\u2019ve taken an even more focused user-centric approach to consider useful extras such as the sun visor and overall weight, as well as taking a keen interest in venting to help keep the head cool on more demanding rides. We\u2019re super stoked about how the design has progressed over Ultra\u2019s development cycle, and know that our customers will appreciate the attention to detail once they get the product in their hands.\nFrom sketches, to CAD, to 3D printed models and design validation beta prototypes, we are now in the final stages of the design process. We are collecting tons of valuable feedback and are working on refinements to release the perfect product. With each new version, we get closer to the ultimate helmet for cycling.\nPLAY\n\nWe've completed our beta testing phase. These are some of the pictures and feedback we've gotten from our beta testers. \nBetter styling, amazing air flow and a shockingly lower price. Lumos Ultra really deserves the name, and frankly should be selling like hot cakes. The Lumos Ultra shows how the brand has matured from its Kickstarter roots into an established and innovative company. \u2014 James Gill, Nuneaton UK\nHonestly having lights on your helmet is life changing.. The thing I like best is that if I have any doubt about whether a driver has seen me, I can look at them or their rear view mirror and know the light will flash right at them. \u2014 Caterina Buizza, London, UK\nNot only will you will be investing in your safety, but you will also be getting a premium helmet. Ultra is light and breathable. It\u2019s innovative, giving you THAT thing that other helmets are missing. I love how it looks awesome and really feels great. \u2014 Francisco Garcia, New York\nFor anyone that was on the fence with the previous products due to price, hopefully this new version makes the decision much easier. Just as effective as the previous versions in terms of safety (see and be seen), but with a sleek new design and more accessible price point? What\u2019s not to like\u2026.! \u2014 John Yu, San Francisco\nThis is by far the best helmet if you want great protective gear, slick looks -and- lights. With the lights on your head they are above car roofs so they can always be seen. The cool look, the ventilation and the lightweight, non-bothering fit makes this my A+ choice for my 100 k per day commute as well as for ride my race bike or going on trails with my kids. \u2014 Henrik Becker, Germany\nI love the concept of the Lumos helmet. I\u2019m pretty sure my previous Lumos helmet saved my life before. The Ultra feels like a totally normal helmet. The price is reasonable for any helmet and it looks like a helmet I would buy even if it didn\u2019t have lights. Throw in the lights and it\u2019s totally a no-brainer! Everyone should have one! \u2014 David Rolfe, San Francisco\nIt\u2019s obvious that Lumos Ultra was built on love and experience.\nI have been following Lumos products since the first helmet came out on Kickstarter, and I believe the Ultra is the best one yet. It looks really cool, is super comfortable to wear, and feels very light on my head. As a surgeon, I have to go to the hospital at odd hours, lots of midnights and early mornings.. Since I\u2019ve had the Ultra helmet, I am more confident in cycling to work. The bright lights and turn signals makes me feel more visible on the road, and visible is safe! In broad daylight, the smooth design and good-looking colors turns a lot of heads! \u2014 Petra Wahjoepramono, Indonesia\nAre you are looking for a helmet that gives you the best protection both day and night? Look no further! Lumos Ultra is lightweight, high quality, durable and has the most awesome front and tail lights customization that other similar helmets only can only dream of. \u2014 Stijn Buyse, Belgium\nThis is the Tesla of bike helmets. Style functionality, safety features and comfort. It\u2019s unlike any helmet I have seen on the road. This is the future of bike helmets. \u2014 Grant Leslie, Australia\nNote: \nThis timeline is for the first batch of Lumos Ultra with and without MIPS, size M-L.  \nWe estimate that sizes S and XL will be shipped out starting from Jan 2021. This is because the factory has a limited production capacity per month in order to control a high level of quality. Therefore we will be focusing on getting the more popular M-L sizes out first. \nAs this is an estimate, timelines may get pushed up or pushed back but we will give our 100% to make sure that things are completed on, or even ahead of schedule. \nAt the end of the campaign, we will send you a Backerkit survey via email.\nFrom there, you will be able to choose your: Color, MIPS-add on, size, visor and other add-ons we might release throughout the campaign.\nColor\nThe beauty of choosing your colors at the end of the campaign, is that you will be able to choose from all the new colors that we release at each stage of the campaign.\nNote: Many of the colors we are making for the Kickstarter will NOT be available for retail. If you see a color combination you really like, now might be the ONLY time to get it. \nMIPS\nIf you have already purchased the Lumos Ultra MIPS reward, you will not need to add MIPS in the survey. It will be assigned to you automatically.\nHowever, if you have bought the standard Lumos Ultra, you will still be able to purchase the MIPS add-on for the difference in price between the rewards.\nSize\nWe will be launching Ultra in small (S), medium to large (M-L) and extra large sizes (XL) so that anyone from kids to adults can have an Ultra. You will be able to choose the size you want through the Backerkit survey we send you at the end of the campaign.\nVisor\nYou will also be able to add on the attachable visor if you decide that you need one for your daily ride. The visor will retail for $25, but for this campaign, we are launching it at only $14.95.\nOther add-ons\nWe are currently working on some Lumos merchandise, ranging from other cycling gear to everyday wear items. Once we lock down the designs and start building prototypes, we will share them with you! You will also be able to buy these add-ons through the Backerkit survey.\nShipping, Taxes (and VAT) will be calculated and paid for towards the end of the campaign, before we ship the helmets out to you. During these uncertain times, shipping costs have gone up significantly, however, we do believe that the prices will go down as the situation gets better globally.\nHence, we do not think charging shipping right now, upon pledging is at the interest of our supporters as the prices today might be more expensive than that in a few months time.\nHere are our estimates of what shipping would be. \n* Prices do not include taxes and VAT. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country.\n ** Note that these prices are dependent on the situation and may increase or decrease by a few dollars in the months to come.\n\"I don't see my country as a shipping option\" : If you do not see your country as a shipping option, it means that we currently do not offer shipping to that country. However, do send us an email if you are from a country that is not shown above, we'd love to know about it. If enough of you request for it such that it makes sense logistically to ship to that country, we will add it as an option later. \n\n\n\n\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike most Kickstarter campaigns, Lumos actually has a working, mass production ready early prototype of the product (Lumos Ultra). We believe in making the best product possible and we will be making some big improvements to the design and functionality of the helmet. This means that not only will we definitely deliver the product to you, we will also deliver a product that has been perfected though all the feedback we've gotten from the early prototype we mass produced. \n\nThe Lumos team have been designing and manufacturing smart helmets for the last 5 years, and we have gotten pretty good at it. We also have very reputable and highly qualified manufacturing partners that we've been working with for the last few years.\n\nSo we feel that the risks of us not delivering a great working product as shown above, is close to zero. We are extremely confident and dedicated in delivering our products to everyone who needs one. \n\nHowever, it is important to understand that unexpected things may happen along the way, which are very hard to predict now. For example, delays in shipping can occur due to factors like viruses, travel restrictions or even, trade wars. \n\nIf any delays were to occur due to such circumstances, we will definitely consistently update all our backers with full transparency and of course, aid you with any of the doubts you have along the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe have designed Ultra to be water resistant, so that it can handle all weather conditions you bring it to. \n\nWe have also chosen the highest quality electronics in the market.

Vader\u2019s redemption, Ripley\u2019s duel with the Alien Queen, Roy Batty\u2019s \u201cTears in Rain\u201d, and many more. Moments that surprised us. Moments that moved us. Moments that left a lasting impact on our subconscious. Years later, we\u2019re still trying to recapture these transformative experiences. \nWe are making this documentary to celebrate, explore, and recontextualise these films and the influence they\u2019ve had both on ourselves and our culture. We want to go beyond the movies, to the science, technology, and art they\u2019ve inspired. This documentary will be a time capsule, capturing unheard stories and perspectives not just for us, but for future generations.\nWe want to do this project for all these reasons, and for the simplest one of all \u2013 because when the lights go down, we\u2019re all kids again.\nIn Search of Tomorrow Movie Poster by Clayton Benge\nIn Search of Tomorrow will take viewers on a year-by-year deep dive into the many awe-inspiring worlds of \u201880s Sci-Fi movies, breaking down the most iconic and eccentric films you know and love (and many you may have forgotten or missed), and examining the science, technology, and artistry behind the fiction.\nThe completed feature will be more than four hours long and feature insights and anecdotes from an extensive collection of experts and iconic talent, including filmmakers, actors, special-effects and visual effects masters, tech advisors, authors, influencers, and visionaries. Not only will they tell their own stories, but they will share opinions about their own favorite Sci-Fi movies.\nThrough our interviews with \u201880s Sci-Fi masters and subject-matter experts we want to explore a wide range of issues, including:\n Heroes and Heroines: Hear from the actors, writers, directors, and producers who brought Sci-Fi icons such as Rick Deckard, Ellen Ripley, and the Terminator to your movie screen.\n SFX Breakdowns: Learn how your favorite robot, creature, and spaceship effects were created. We\u2019ll be interviewing the artists who designed and operated the models, puppets, and animatronics that brought some of your favorite creatures and characters to life.\n Production Design & Worldbuilding: Learn about the creation of the costumes, weapons, and post-apocalyptic landscapes that set the scene for our favorite stories.\n Socio/Political Context: How \u201880s Sci-Fi reflected the socio-political context in which it was made: Tech advances, Reaganomics, Live AID, big business, and the AIDS crisis.\n Genre Mixing: Exploring how other genres - fantasy, action, horror, and comedy - are very much intertwined with the Sci-Fi genre. Where does one begin and the other end?\n Legacy: Discuss the importance of \u201880s Sci-Fi genre in a modern-day context. Why is \u201880s Sci-Fi still so relevant today?\n  Our last Kickstarter project, In Search of Darkness, successfully shipped to more than 25,000 backers and customers. This project - a four-hour-plus epic on the \u201880s horror movie genre - received critical-acclaim, was nominated for Best Documentary at the Rondo Hatton Awards, and received an incredible reception from fans.\nThis time we\u2019re going to do even better.\nWe\u2019ve already been working on In Search of Tomorrow for a year and we\u2019ve signed up some incredible names to our cast including Sean Young (Rachael in Blade Runner, Chani in Dune), Henry Thomas (Elliott in E.T.), Sam J. Jones (Flash Gordon in Flash Gordon), and Lance Guest (Alex in The Last Starfighter) - and we\u2019re adding more all the time. Check out the cast list below to see the 50 names already attached to the project.\nThese fantastic contributors have put their faith in our vision by attaching their name to our project - we hope you will do the same. Your support will go towards the cost of production, filming interviews, and post-production. This Kickstarter is an essential stage to realizing our vision and we can\u2019t do it without you - and we wouldn\u2019t want to.\nBack now to get your name in the credits and help us make the ultimate \u201880s Sci-Fi documentary.

Casting will continue throughout 2020 with filming planned to begin in the Autumn. Kickstarter backers will receive their items first and we are planning for a July 2021 release.\nOur physical rewards are manufactured and shipped from the United States. Backers will receive a tracking number and our items are sent in very study packaging (posters rolled, not folded) to ensure everything arrives with you safely.\nBecause shipping costs vary substantially depending on whether you are in the US or Rest of World, we have decided not to include shipping costs in the pledge tiers. Instead, shipping costs are as follows:\nUSA - \u00a37 (approx. $8.80)\nUK - \u00a312 (approx. $15)\nRest of World - \u00a312 (approx $15)\nWe are an independent producer of community-powered entertainment: long-form factual content that is funded, inspired, and shaped by a dedicated community of fans.

Our past experience funding, producing, and distributing documentaries, plus the year\u2019s work we\u2019ve already put in, means we are very confident of meeting our backer\u2019s expectations - however, unforeseen delays are possible.\n\nWhile many countries are in lockdown, due to COVID-19, we cannot start filming interviews with our growing cast. Our July release date does take this into account, but if the lockdown were to continue throughout the year we might experience a small delay to the shipping date. As always, we will keep backers fully updated regarding the situation and they will know well in advance if there is likely to be a delay.\n\nIf you were a backer of our previous project, you will know that we experienced delays with manufacturing and shipping for that product. This was due to mistakes we made when choosing a distribution partner, which led to us making a switch. We now have a very reliable US-based partner and do not anticipate further problems in this area.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nWe have accurately portrayed our project as it stands at this point in time, however, creative projects are subject to change and ours is no exception. By making a pledge you acknowledge that elements of the project, including but not limited to the artwork, cast, and content, is subject to change, and that the final project may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign is active.\n\nAll backers are welcome to join our community, but to do so they must conform to the community rules which govern appropriate behavior.

Some of my favorite movies, TV shows, and comics have all had genres mixing together. Army of Darkness, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sandman, Guardians of the Galaxy, and of course, Big Trouble in Little China. But I also loved it when there was more going on. Like, in Buffy, you're laughing, there's a jump scare, but then there's also a poignant moment to reflect on the nature of human emotion. Why not have everything? So I wanted to create a story that was funny, exciting and action packed. But I also wanted to create something that explored human connection, and the relationships we have with family, friends, and partners. And also how anger and violence can destroy those human connections. But it still needed to have roundhouse kicks, magic, monsters, giants and dragons. Truth. \nDuring the soft launch we were going to go all digital. Man, that went over like a palm strike to the nose. So we heard you, and we added a physical printing to the tiers! You spoke, we listened.

(BLOODY HEL cover)\nBLOODY HEL is the story of 5 mystically-powered Viking warriors, imprisoned for 1000 years by the goddess Hel, who are suddenly unleashed when their prison is destroyed by an artillery shell from World War I. \nSo they burst out, 9-feet tall, all juiced up on magic and nearly invincible, and start wreaking havoc during the first world war!\nWe see this all through the eyes of Pvt. Lars Andersen. He's a British soldier, basically just a cog in the massive war machine, waiting for his turn to die. Anderson is brought face to face with the Viking god Fenrir, who's opened up a pit of demons out in no man's land in an attempt to bring about the VIKING APOCALYPSE. \nIt's now up to Andersen to convince the 5 Viking warriors to use their new powers to stop Fenrir's plans, and to show them that ruling a world of war is just ruling a world of ash. Ultimately, BLOODY HEL is a story about power: how it can be seductive and corrupting when you have it, and how you can dig deep to find it when you don\u2019t.\n\nTHE BOOK\nBLOODY HEL is going to be a beautiful over-sized (7.5\"x11\") hardcover graphic novel written and drawn by me, Clay McCormack (Night Moves, Poser, Redline, Cafe Racer), with an exquisite color palette of blood and mud provided by rising star Russ Badgett. \nWe've already partnered with a great comics publisher called A Wave Blue World (Dead Beats, All We Ever Wanted, This Nightmare Kills Fascists) who will be putting the book out for us, and we just need YOUR HELP to get the funds to make BLOODY HEL a reality! \nWe've also got a pin up section that is going to make this book visually stunning, featuring contributions by some of comics' best artists - including a piece by Batman: White Knight artist Sean Murphy, which will also be available in our rewards section as an exclusive dust jacket cover!\nBlack and White art for Sean's pin up/dust jacket - final version will be full color!\n PIN UP ART!\nBloody Hel Pin Up by Christian DiBari\nBloody Hel Pin Up art by Corin Howell\nBloody Hel Pin Up Art - Astrior the Shield Maiden - by Tana Ford\nBloody Hel pin up art by Jorge Coelho\nValdemar pin up image by Ricardo Lopez-Ortiz\nREWARDS!\nThere's a slew of great rewards available for backers of BLOODY HEL, including the book itself in hard copy and digital formats, an MP3 Soundtrack Download, exclusive prints from myself and Sean Murphy, original art, and even your name or likeness to be featured in the book! In addition, all backers at the $5 level and higher will have their name printed in the \"Thank You\" section of the book!  \n\n\n\nWe also have a limited \"Early Bird Special\" deal that features a copy of the book with an original drawing inside for only $39 (normally $59) - this is the best value version of the book and it's first come, first serve, so when they're gone, they're gone (Early Bird Special is now gone)! \nFINALLY\nMaking comics is hard, expensive, time consuming work, but one thing I know my team and I can do is make comics. GREAT comics. The funds from this campaign will give us the ability to put our full attention toward making this book the best it can be, covering art/coloring costs, printing and shipping rewards, Kickstarter fees, and most importantly supplying us with the knowledge that there is an enthusiastic readership out there who want to read BLOODY HEL as badly as we want to make it!\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\n(Very special thanks to Jim Galdos for an amazing video.

That's why I'll be offering frequent updates, not just during the campaign, but during the creation of the work itself, to insure that you know exactly what is going on every step of the way.\n\nThe biggest challenge of a project like this is creating it, and actually getting the book into peoples hands, which is why I've partnered with A Wave Blue World.

You just coded a glitch that you can apply to any game. \nIt unleashes wild creativity during gameplay, and allows a path into coding that looks more like a party or an art class and less like homework.   \nMillions of coded Scratch projects are now available on GameBender. The founder of GameBender helped launch Scratch in 2007 at MIT. Scratch is the most popular visual \"blocks\" coding language for beginners. \nEvery game is shared by individual creators around the world, so you can play millions of games for free.\nThere is more diversity in the types of games and contributors on Scratch and Game Bender than any other game console.\nPlay platformers and puzzle games just like a normal system, but also \"indie\" style games made by people like you.\nBring yourself into the game. \nTurn any game into a full body augmented reality experience.\n In addition to games, there are also apps and DIY TV shows.\nNext, see how you can blur the line between playing and creating. \nWe dreamed of a game system that was infinitely flexible, yet as easy to use as a pair of scissors. We thought, \"What would game scissors, game glue, code spray paint, and even a medicine dropper full of game code be like? Is that even possible?\" \nGame Filters let you change a whole game at once, almost like an Instagram filter for games.\nGlitches let you be a game designer. Insert new characters, assign powers, and cast magic spells, almost like Photoshopping a game. \nInject a unicorn cannon and warp portals. Switch places with anyone. Clone objects. Apply visual filters to characters.  \nChanging the game is the new way to \"play the game.\" More than 50 glitches are included with GameBender. Here are a few more examples.\nGlitch cards guide you through the game bending process from the beginning. \nLearn how glitches work with these simple Glitch Cards. Play them as a card game. While you are playing a video game, your friend throws glitch cards down to help or hinder.\nGaming with these new creative tools shifts the addictive side of gaming onto your own awesome creativity, which leads to a feeling of power and a desire to dive deeper. \nCoding lessons often fall flat because they don't start with what's awesome, and because many children don't learn well in isolation. The GameBender approach doesn't start with \"learning to code,\" instead it immerses the children as a group in a truly engaging world, a world in which code is the currency for doing new things.\nFollow a code card to write your first snippet of code. You just created a glitch that you can apply to any game. \nLearn how code works with these simple Code Cards\nThe 25 code cards come with Code Class 101, which walks you through making your first glitches and your first games.\nCode Immersion: See the code inside everything using the code button on the controller. \nSocial Coding: Kids love sharing their creations with each other, and learning by playing, shoulder to shoulder.  \nStep into coding: Can just playing and bending games lead to coding?\nJust by playing you are already learning that games can be coded by people like you. Next you might apply a 1-click filter, or use a glitch tool, and you will see the code flying into the characters, giving you your first sense of coding intuition. Before you know it you are tweaking variables live while you play and following code cards to write your own code. You can code your first game in minutes.\nSee how our philosophy of \"Play. Bend. Code.\" comes together in a workshop:\nWe believe everyone is an inventor. Get a GameBender and let's reinvent the digital world!\nWith either reward, artists, engineers, and kids can play, bend, and code, and enter a new era of gaming by the people. Digital media belongs to us.\n\nWho made GameBender?\nBy the makers of Makey Makey \nThis is our 3rd Kickstarter (2 other successful Kickstarters)\n15,115 previous Kickstarter Backers, and hundreds of thousands of customers \nMakey Makey is plug and play with Game Bender. The world is your controller.\n\nOur Team \nWe hope GameBender lights people's creative hearts on fire.

This will be our most challenging product yet. The key risks are software integration, supply chain management, and global shipping logistics. Estimating development time for a software project of this scale is always a challenge. Our partner, Bocoup, has conducted extensive roadmapping and time estimates, however exact velocity can be difficult to predict. Supply chain presents numerous detailed risks, and although we are familiar with overseas manufacturing, GameBender has multiple suppliers. Delays could be introduced if vendors don't meet our specifications or schedule. Global shipping logistics can have setbacks due to customs, congestion, and holiday volume. While we are planning for typical delays in shipping, multiple delays could compound to impact our ability to get GameBender onto your doorstep in line with our estimate. Finally, if we were to far exceed backing expectations, scaling a level of magnitude in manufacturing could multiply the above risks as shipping and manufacturing factors can vary significantly at different production scales.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jay Silver\n3 created \u00b7 87 backed\nJay Silver is the Founder of Makey Makey/GameBender and was the first ever Maker Research Scientist at Intel.

No more saggy pants that drop due to their own weight. Travel light! \nOur pants pack small when rolled so you can carry more. Pro tip: Since our pants can go days without a wash, go on, carry those extra shoes you always wanted to wear! \nWe didn't want you to have a polka dot pant when an unexpected drizzle came around. So we made them water resistant. \nWe know spills happen, especially when you are on your 4th drink, joyously banging those glasses to cheers the viking way, thats why we made them stain resistant! Be it coffee, beer, wine, soda, cocktails, our pants allow you to walk away without a stain. You can practically walk to work in them after partying all night! \nPlease note: Our pants do not offer stain resistance against oils, ketchup, sriracha sauce or any oil-based liquids. \nAfter sitting on those long, cramped, uncomfortable flights don't you feel like stretching out, doing some Yoga maybe? Well now you can. Our dynamic stretch technology allows you to stretch your hearts out!\nStretchability varies across our pant styles. Pants in the above photo are Trouser Leggings. \nBreathe in - Breathe out .... thats what our pants do all the time. Allowing your skin to breathe while keeping you fresh like a daisy!\nOur pants offer odor control, allowing you to wear them without a wash for up to 3 days.\nBecause all our pants are Teflon treated, they will absorb less odor and stains. Thus, they can and should be washed less frequently.\nWe get it. You want more pockets, but cargos are not your thing. With thoughtfully placed pockets you can go from a hike to an elite restaurant without a change. Whats more? we made your pockets secure and deep. The zippered pockets give you a secure way to carry things that could easily slide out on a plane when you are catching some zzZZZZz. Deep pockets allow you to carry more than just keys. To give you that sophisticated look we have designed pockets that blend in with each style. Check out our Color and Details section below to get a better look!\nTravel and the sun go hand in hand and we have got you covered quite literally. BauBax pants are UPF 50+ so you can go out and enjoy the sun! That means they only allow 1/50th of those harmful rays through. (Blocking 98% of the other UV rays). Whats more? all of this comes without any use of harmful chemicals which are found in most sunscreens. So go ahead you sun flower! Beam Away!\nAlthough natural fibers like Merino Wool and Bamboo are strong, they need a little help from Polyester for structure and durability which ensures your pant stays as good as new.\nThis unique property of Bamboo is why we decided to go for Bamboo over Cotton. Bamboo viscose is 3X more absorbent than most cotton fibers, and can take in three times more water than its weight which once made into a fabric, means that it can absorb tons of moisture.\nMerino Wool on the outside helps wick away the moisture that the Bamboo has absorbed on the inside. The combined action of Bamboo Viscose and Merino Wool helps keep you dry, fresh, and comfortable.\nMother nature has given sheep the perfect clothing to keep them comfortable all year round be it summer or winter. \nWarming: Wool's natural crimped shape helps it trap air better than any other fiber. Static air is a great insulator and provides resistance against the cold. \nCooling: Wool has the ability to store moisture within the structure of the fiber. As your body warms up, the moisture stored within the fiber will begin to evaporate, cooling the air between your skin and the fabric. The warmer you get the more evaporation takes place and the larger the cooling effect\nMerino wool is super fine, yet it can cause an itch to those with sensitive skin. Hence, we smartly put Bamboo closer to your skin and Merino on the outside - to Ditch the Itch and still enjoy the rich benefits of Merino Wool. \nFor those times when you are on the road, we have got good news for you. BauBax pants are naturally quick to dry thanks to the wicking features of Bamboo Viscose and Merino Wool. \nBecause all our pants are Teflon treated, they will absorb less odor and stains. Thus, they can and should be washed less frequently.\nCARE: Wash with like colors with mild detergent cold. Tumble dry low or lay flat or line dry. Do not use fabric softener during wash as this may damage the water repellency. Do NOT bleach. Do NOT dry clean.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING - To 33 Countries:\nUnited States, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and 28 EU Countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom\nWe've got 6 warehouses worldwide that allow us to offer low-cost domestic shipping to the 33 countries listed above. Backers with a shipping address in any of these 33 countries will NOT have to pay any additional duties, sales tax, VAT, etc. We've got that covered!\n*INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING - Rest of the World:\nBackers from all other countries (apart from the 33 countries listed above) may have to pay additional import duties or other applicable taxes to the concerned authorities upon receipt of their goods - depending on the import policies of their respective countries.

If you wish to learn about the duties and taxes applicable to your shipment, you may want to check with the customs and border protection authority of your country.  \nFrom our prior experiences, we have learned that most of the countries have higher thresholds for import duties and most of our international customers should not get charged any additional fees apart.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been in the clothing business since 2015.

Gonzo\nA resonant, neglected slice of American history is told for the first time, in graphic-novel format. Featuring art by Jason \u201cGonzo\u201d Gonzalez, edited by Claire Napier, and script and lettering by me, Henry Barajas: journalist, comedian, author, native Tucsonan, and great-grandson of the story\u2019s main character, Tata Rambo, aka Ramon Jaurigue. \nLa Voz De Mayo (Page 1) by J. Gonzo\nLa Voz De M.A.Y.O. is the true story of Ramon Jaurigue, an orphan and WWII veteran who co-founded the Mexican, American, Yaqui, and Others (M.A.Y.O.) organization, which successfully lobbied the Tucson City Council to improve living and working conditions for members of the local Pascua Yaqui tribe. Largely due to Ramon\u2019s activism, both in M.A.Y.O. in and with Model Cities Program, Yaqui were successfully integrated into the expanding metropolis of Tucson: families bought property, roads and sidewalks were built, and sewage systems installed. Ramon and his colleagues even founded a night school to help adults learn English and established the region\u2019s first low-cost clinic to offer birth control.\nLa Voz De Mayo (Page 4) by J. Gonzo\nUntiring in their efforts for equal rights and opportunities, Ramon and M.A.Y.O.eventually secured official U.S. government recognition for the Pascua Yaqui tribe. Local government didn\u2019t give up their plans to bridge Tucson to the west coast and taxpayer dollars to the Old Pueblo\u2019s indigenous people without a fight. The Carter Administration was skeptical of the Yaqui\u2019s eligibility, so it took compromise from Ramon and the tribe. While trying to keep 12,000 families together, Ramon struggled with taking care of his own family life.  \nLa Voz De Mayo (Page 9) by J. Gonzo\nLa Voz De Mayo (Page 23) by J. Gonzo\nUtilizing newspaper clippings, interviews with surviving MAYO members, and Ramon\u2019s authored articles, La Voz De M.A.Y.O. dramatizes the remarkable life and achievements of my great-grandfather\u2014and in so doing, tells the story not just of a single man, but of a family, a tribe, a nation.\nIt's an honor to follow in my great-grandfather's footsteps. He was a writer in his own right by documenting what was happening in the community and trying to do something about it. I wish I could've finished this before he passed away last October. But I'm confident he was proud of my and my family's effort.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere has been a lot of time dedicated to making this first issue possible.

Tata Rambo #1"}}, {"backer": "Chris Gore", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Resource Manual \u2013 Molding & Casting\nWhat: Resource Manual - Molding and Casting is a guide to the molding and casting techniques used in model animation, Television/Film production, and studio art techniques. The guide will hold building information that is important for a production or artist from basic sculpting to advanced mold making and casting techniques. \nTypes of materials, techniques, and manufacturers covered in the book:\nTools Overview \nSculpting Basics\nMaterials (Cements and Plasters, Latex and Silicones, Plastics and Urethanes, Gelatins, Clays and Wax, Alternative & Advanced materials)\nMold Making (Press Molds, One Part Molds, Two Part Molds, Three+ Part Molds, Matrix Molds, Vertical Techniques, Fiberglass Techniques, and More!!!)\nCasting (Plastic and Urethanes, Silicones, Latex's, Gelatins, Injection Techniques, Pour Techniques, Roto-Casting, Advanced Materials & Techniques)\nManufacturers and Distributors\nThe Process from Beginning to End!\nWhy: There currently isn\u2019t a comprehensive guide to the professional methods used in the studio for molding and casting. Sure you can find books about techniques in many different languages all over the world, but none of them go in depth about the methods and procedures used in making reproductions of models, sculptures, props, masks, and statues. The internet has a lot of conflicting information and I'm constantly being asked why a specific technique didn't work for them. There's also very few modern resource manuals that touch upon the latest more advanced techniques using materials that didn't exist 10 years ago. Lets change that and build a book filled with information for both beginners and advanced professionals who require precise step by step methods to be able to achieve pro-level results without second guessing themselves. There\u2019s nothing more frustrating than making a piece of art that is forever distorted/destroyed by poor technique or permanently incased in a block of cement or urethane. Destroying all the hard work you've put into a piece is not an option and I want to take the guess work out of the equation for you. \nAnother reason for this book is to guide individuals and studios to the manufacturers and distributors that supply the industry and also who provide services. Finding a specific material or chemical can be extremely frustrating when trying to plan, budget, and build your production. Distributors and manufacturers don\u2019t often openly show how to use their products and if they do it\u2019s never in the context of your needs. This book will provide a list of manufacturers/distributors along with the products which pertain to sculpting/casting, model making, mask making, prop casting along with many other methods used in reproduction of 3 dimensional art, along with how to use these materials. Want to know how to make clear casting plastic? Or what\u2019s the difference between all those silicones and resins you see on the internet? Don\u2019t worry the information you seek is only a click away in a handy digital copy E-book that you can access from your computer at any time.\nSo why a digital version and not a print version?\nThe real answer here is cost and content. Paper based books cost a lot of money to make and the page count and content often get limited due to this fact. Also, printing high quality color images is cost prohibitive with most book makers and prevents a well rounded guide. Add to this nothing can be \u201ccomprehensive\u201d if it is limited by how much information it can hold. With the initial digital version of the book a page count will not restrict the production of the book and this will allow for assessment of a potential future print version. Also because it is digital the book can live on your computer, tablet, or phone for instant access. \n*This fundraiser is for production of Edition 01 which will also have various version updates as techniques are added to it over the year 2019. The final version is slotted for Fall 2019. \nWhen: The estimated release date for the Resource Manual (rough draft 01) is December 2018. It will be accessible for instant download. Future updates to Edition 001 will also be available throughout 2019 and the final draft will be available by Fall 2019 from the established website and will provide 24 hour access for download. \nRewards:\n-Resource Manual - The main focus of the fundraiser is to raise funds for the production of the Resource Manual. So the main reward is of course the Resource Manual \u2013 Molding & Casting, but there are a couple other rewards that you can get as well.\n-Special Thanks - Get your name in the book as a special thank you for helping make this possible.\n-Private Lessons with the Author -  There's a lot to be said about learning from experience and from those who have experience. I'm offering a rare opportunity to learn a little of what I know. You have a choice of a one or two hour private lessons. This can be done through Skype via a video conference call or if you are in the Los Angeles County California area are welcome to have the lessons at my studio in Pomona California. You can ask me advice, technique questions, and anything related to animation or stop motion. The time is yours and I'm here for you. \n-Sponsor the Book- There's a lot of building materials out there from tools and clays to molding and casting materials. As a manufacturer of materials and tools you know that a tutorial focused on your product is vital in insuring successful application by your customers. What better way to do this than by having a tutorial that uses your product?!?! Let's make magic together!\n$5000 STRETCH GOAL - SMM Magazine 2018\nIf we meet the stretch goal of $5000 then every backer $15 and up will get the 2018 digital subscription of Stop Motion Magazine!!!\nStop Motion Magazine\nAbout the Author\nJohn Ikuma is an award winning animator, VFX artist, producer, director and publisher with 20 years of experience in television and film.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt\u2019s no mystery that life has its way of getting out of hand and sometimes this requires pumping the brakes or taking a rest to recover and lick your wounds. Since there is no printing required for the release of the resource manual there is certainly little risk in publishing issues other than hospitalization or death of the author. The biggest rick here is in the content. Having years of experience building and working professionally in television and film the content creation can and will have its bumps, but by working closely with the manufacturers of the materials involved with the production of the manual it is our hope that this production will go smoothly and be released on time. If a delay does happen then a first draft preview will still be available to guarantee that there is no delay in you getting started with making some great molds and casts.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "One Page Tips Sheet", "descp": "This is literally one page from the book which is the tips sheet to better mold making.

I've had to build and plan out 4 different courses for StopMotionUniversity.com which ate a lot of time. Now after the baby and all the crazy things are somewhat getting back to normal but I will have to deal with all the legal issues with Mexico and the United States in relation to my new son and my status in Mexico. Add to all of this we will have to move in December due to our elderly landlord taking over the apartment and I also need to find a new studio location for animation, magazine, molding and casting, and everything else...

After launching two wildly successful Kickstarter travel products, we decided it's time to go all-in, with a complete set of packing accessories that radically redefines the word \"essential' \" fotoday's savvy traveler. \nOur two previous campaigns were well received, below are some of the comments:\nIt is time to do it all over again. After relentless prototyping and rigorous testing, we're proud to introduce four ingenious new products that'll have you packing like a boss in no time. We promise you've never seen anything like this before.\n#1 Kruze Toiletry Kit: A Bright Idea in Traveling Light\nGrooming kit. Dopp bag. Toiletry case. In a sea of sameness, there has been so little innovation\u2014until now. The new Taskin Kruze isn't just the most advanced toiletry kit ever. It's lightyears ahead of the competition.\nHow's this for a first: The Kruze comes with a built-in, germicidal UV-C lamp. Simply press the button and 3 seconds later, the UV-C lights up to kill 99.9% of the germs in your bag\u2014and shuts itself off after 3 mins.  \nAluminum-coated lining helps keep the inside dry and clean, and reflects the UV-C light around the interior to help zap those germs\u2014so you get a lot less gross on the go.\nPlus: The Kruze comes with 4 extra-strong suction cups so you can attach it to smooth, flat surfaces like the bathroom mirror. Now, your stuff is always within reach.\nAnd talk about smart: The Kruze's exterior is made of tough, waterproof tarpaulin. If one of the containers inside spills, the rest of your luggage stays clean and dry. No muss, and so much less fuss. \nThoughtfully-designed organizational features will fire up even the most demanding travelers.\nWith so much innovation, the Taskin Kruze sets the new standard for premium toiletry kits everywhere. \n#2: Disq Travel Duffel: For Tuck-in-Go Situations\nNeed to pack an extra bag for that trip to Milan or Milwaukee, just in case? It's a cinch with the Taskin Disq Duffel.\nThis smart, stylish duffel is made of super-tough, honeycomb nylon so it's ready for anything.\nDisq is constructed using high quality honeycomb rip-stop nylon and waterproof zippers.\nPlus: It folds down tight into an easy-pack disk that packs neatly into a pocket on one end of its carry bag.  \nBest of all: The stow pocket into which the Disq is folded/compressed into also doubles as one of two external pockets when the Disq is in use.  \nPlus, the straps in front easily attach to the handle of carry-on luggage for the ultimate in convenience.\n\n\n#3 Taskin Gadget Stash: Jumble-Free Jetting is Here\nRoad warriors rejoice: Now there's an upscale electronics bag that helps you keep all those dongles, drives, cables and connectors under control.\n\n  Our innovative cable clip can be used to set the length of cables and wires, so you can avoid a bad case of the tangles.\nAfter use, you can easily secure the clip onto a corresponding magnetic cradle to keep everything in its place.\nNo more cramming. No more chaos. Just gear up and go.\n#4 QiK Shoe Bag: Two-in-One Convenience, Just for Kicks\nMaybe it's your trusty wingtips, your favorite Chelsea's, or even those crazy trainers you got in Hong Kong. When it comes to your go-to shoes, the Taskin QiK stashes them away in the most efficient way possible.\nThe QiK comes with odor-resistant materials because dude, let's not even go there.\nAnd check this out: The bag can be separated into two halves, and each can fit up to a pair of adult shoes. Now, you can pack a pair of shoes together, or spread them around where they fit best. Your shoes will thank you\u2014and so will everyone else.\n#5 Duplex Packing Cubes : Add Our Dual-Sided Packing Cubes & Fit 40% More In The Same Space \nPLAY\n\nMiss out on our big campaign for the Kompak packing cube? Here's your chance to fix that or if you need more, can't have enough packing cubes! \nPack tight and get where you're going without having to steam or iron wrinkled clothes for a change!\nOn one side: An air-breathable compartment to keep clothes packed tight and wrinkle-free. On the other: An odor and water resistant pouch with waterproof zippers and lining, so you can keep your damp and dirties away from your dry and cleans. \nWith dual-side compression, you can pack 40% more in the same amount of space. Which means you get double thee awesome in one ultra-compression cube.\n\n\nKompak Packing System: Combo #1\n      Already have one or more Kompak Duplex Packing Cubes and don't yet need more? This is the option for you. Get all four of the new additions to the Kompak Packing System in one amazing package.\n\nKompak Packing System: Combo #2\n  Get all four new additions to the Kompak Packing System PLUS one set of Kompak Duplex Packing Cubes (one small + one large), the dual-sided packing cubes that took Kickstarter by storm.\n\nKompak Packing System + Kube Duffle: Combo #3\nUnbeatable value: Now you can get the entire Kompak Packing System + Kompak Packing Cube Set (1 small + one large) + the stylish Taskin Kube Duffel (scroll down for details). Now this is awesome!\nThe delivery date are the date we expect the rewards to ship from the factory. The date the reward will be delivered to our backers would vary depending on the shipping region.\nYep, this is the one everybody's going cray for: Modern style means upscale elegance in an I-can't-believe-it's-a-duffel duffel. If you missed out on this campaign, now here is your chance. Whether it's at the office, the airport, the gym or even the boardroom, the Taskin Kube delivers cool, confident style and functionality that'll have you turning heads wherever you go. No duffel does it better.\n Modern style meets upscale elegance \u2026 in a duffel bag? Yes and yes. \nKnow the single, narrow opening you get with other duffels? Been there, hated that. With the Kube, just pull the aluminum handle to easily access the entire compartment. The other duffels will need therapy for years.\n      This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we expect this campaign to run smoothly, there are always risks involved, such as:\n\n1.

We\u2019re using well-established shipping companies.

Backers with a shipping address in any of these 34 countries will NOT have to pay any additional fees and taxes (apart from the nominal domestic shipping fees that we charge when you make your pledge here on Kickstarter). Which means you will NOT be paying any import/customs duty, sales tax, VAT, etc. We've got everything covered.\n*INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING - Rest of the World:\nBackers from all other countries (Rest of the world) may have to pay additional import duties and other applicable taxes to the concerned authorities upon receipt of their goods, based on the import policies of their respective countries. The duties and tax rates vary from country to country and we are unable to help you determine that for your shipment. If you wish to learn about the duties and taxes applicable to your shipment, you may want to check with the customs and border protection authority of your country.\nFrom our experience, we have learned that most of the countries have higher thresholds for import duties and a majority of our international customers don't get charged any additional fees apart from the regular shipping fees on Kickstarter.\nEXCHANGE POLICY:\nIf you follow the sizing chart carefully, then the jackets shall fit you just fine. Still, if you wish to exchange your jackets for any reason, we\u2019ll happily do that but you\u2019ll have to pay for the two way shipping. Because we are offering our jackets at highly discounted prices, we won\u2019t be able to accept returns. Please make sure the items are unworn and unwashed. Also, all items must be in the condition you received them with all hangtags still attached. We accept exchanges up to 30 days of you receiving the jacket(s).\nLEAD MARKETING PARTNER:\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\nOTHER MARKETING PARTNERS:\nPR PARTNER:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe success of our Kickstarter campaign, in 2015, laid a strong foundation for our company and since then we have manufactured and shipped over 200,000 jackets to customers across 150+ countries.

And who is J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs? And why is his name always in quotes? And for nonbelievers, why has this strangely compelling parody religion, this long-running postmodern joke, caught the attention of such pop culture icons as Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), David Byrne, Robert Crumb, Richard Linklater, Alex Cox, Ken Kesey, Frank Zappa, Jonathan Demme, and Devo\u2019s Mark Mothersbaugh? And is it true that Tori Amos is also one of \"Bob\"\u2019s chosen?  \n\"Bob\" and the Church have caught the attention of many\u2013 include David Byrne, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), Tori Amos, Stephen Colbert, Robert Crumb, Mark Mothersbaugh and DEVO, Matt Groening, Margaret Moser, Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, and more.\nARE WE CONTROLLED BY SECRET FORCES? ARE ALIEN MONSTERS BRINGING A STARTLING NEW WORLD? DO PEOPLE THINK YOU\u2019RE STRANGE? DO YOU? \nThe Church of the SubGenius: The Early Years\n\u201cWe tied together every occult, superstitious fringe belief you could think of\u2026it was so much fun!\u201d\n\u2013 Ivan Stang, co-founder\nBorn into the suburban world of the 1950s, future founders of the Church of the SubGenius Reverend Ivan Stang (Douglass St. Clair Smith) and Dr. Philo Drummond (Steve Wilcox) come of age during the 1960s and 70s \u2013 a time of unprecedented social and political tumult. They experience the rise of a deafening consumer culture, the tarnishing of the \"American Dream,\" the violence of the Vietnam War abroad, and the Kennedy assassinations and conspiracies that follow. \nAs youths they revel in the delights of stable families, monster movies, Science Fiction, super-8 moviemaking, dinosaur figures, comic books, and Rock 'n' Roll. As they grow older they witness the emergence of televangelism, the Jonestown Massacre, punk culture, and Reaganomics.\nDespite both growing up in Texas, it was not until the mid 70s that Stang and Drummond meet and quickly forge a friendship over a shared love of comic books, Captain Beefheart, and UFO paperbacks. One not so particular eve in 1977, while bemoaning their lack of conventional \u201csuccess\u201d for two such intelligent, well read chaps, Stang remarks, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not exactly geniuses.\u201d To which Drummond replies, \u201cyeah, we\u2019re sub-geniuses.\u201d \nAnd in that moment the Church of the SubGenius is born. It is not long after that J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs reveals himself as the Church's iconic prophet and foremost patron of ineffable Slack. In fact, Stang and Drummond will later come to the realization that \"Bob\" has been planting evidence of his presence for them for the past twenty years!!!\nTHE SUBGENIUS DIASPORA\n\u201cThere was that moment of realizing that this thing goes further than I ever imagined.\u201d\n\u2013 Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman)\nIn late 1979 Stang and Drummond, with the help of their wives, brainstorm what would become perhaps the single most significant marketing effort made at the inception of the Church of the SubGenius \u2013 the writing, design, printing, and distribution of Pamphlet #1. The doctrine of the Church quickly spreads, and the word of \u201cBob\u201d and the teachings of JHVH-1 teach \u201ctime control\u201d as a way to wrest \u201cSlack\u201d from the \u2018Pinks\u2019 and \u2018Normals.\u2019 The Church, it seems, has struck a nerve amidst the deadening consumer culture, the evisceration of basic social services, and the worship of wealth that occurred during the Reagan/Thatcher years.\nL: An early years Devival | R: The Three Wise Guys \u2013 Ivan Stang, Dr.X and Philo Drummond \u2013 pose with a Model X Humanoid (1979)\nAs \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s pamphlet continues to travel the world, the emergent punk publishing scene and new wave comic writers seize on the humor and cultural critique of the Church's doctrine. In San Francisco it is fished out of a trashcan by cartoonist and artist Paul Mavrides, igniting a SubGenius cell that gives the movement some of its most enduring art and performances through LIES (Paul Mavrides), Dr. Howland Owl (Hal Robins), Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman), Janor Hypercleats and Pope Sternodox. \n\"Bob\" captures the zetigeist of the day. Cartoonist Robert Crumb reprints Pamphlet #1 in the first issue of his comic Weirdo. A few years later Simon and Schuster publishes The Book of the SubGenius.  Acclaimed film director and SubGenius Alex Cox channels Church mythology in Repo Man as the glowing, alien-owned Chevy Malibu soars high above Los Angeles with Otto (Emilio Estevez) and Miller (Tracy Walke) inside, their faces shining with Slack as Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) watches from below. \nDr. Howl and Puzzling Evidence conduct legendary \u201cDevivals,\u201d radio shows (More than an Hour, Less than a Show), and introduce the word of \"Bob\" to Burning Man. The Stark Fist of Removal newsletter, The Hour of Slack podcast, an MTV special, and countless cassette tapes, posters, comics, videos, websites, and Facebook groups perpetuate the word of \"Bob.\" \nBy the turn of the century, publications as powerful as TIME Magazine begin to get the SubGenius joke when \u201cBob\u201d is voted \u2018Fraud of the Century\u201d by readers of its online poll. In the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, the \u201cFree Party\u201d constituents of Brighton in Great Britain voted \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs as an M.P. to the House of Commons three times.\nToday, \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s hucksterism and the wisdom of JHVH-1 is apparent in all fifty states and a multitude of countries across the globe!\nPLAY\n\nAnother early SubGenius of Texas, David Boone (late husband of Slacking Towards Bethlehem director Sandy K. Boone), documents the rise of the SubGenius in his 1980 film, Invasion of the Aluminum People, which is lauded by Academy Award winning director Jonathan Demme. This is one of the first known recorded instances of the transmission of SLACK.\nGIVE TO THIS KICKSTARTER NOW AND ACHIEVE SALVATION \u2013 OR TRIPLE YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!\nOnly with your support can our intrepid group of award-winning filmmakers dare to make this film. By giving us your hard earned cash, we can make this dream a reality, and breach all Earthly human, political, and cultural barriers with the searing nonhuman truth of the Word of \"Bob,\" J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs, that LIVING GOD WHO WALKS THIS PLANET EARTH IN HUCKSTER'S SHOES. \nTo date, we\u2019ve travelled over 8,000 miles and interviewed 15 SubGenius in four cities, sharing the so-called \"reality\" that SubGenii are forced to share with humans. We\u2019ve only just begun to uncover many of the SubGenius\u2019 most guarded secrets. The SubGenii are finally willing to go public and tell the TRUTH. \nThis is YOUR chance to get in on the ground floor of a huge, globally important cult. You will then attract all the $$$, pleasure spacecraft, and SHEER POWER OVER OTHERS that go with high-ranking support of the Church and this documentary! \nBut most important, you can smite your enemies, achieve TIME CONTROL and attain SLACK.\nREMEMBERING SAINT MARGARET\nSince we began production on our film, a beloved avatar of the early SubGenius tribe, Margaret Moser, passed away on August 25 of this year. One of the nation\u2019s top music journalists and music scene nurturers, Reverend Reverend Doctor Doctor Archdoctor Saint Margaret Moser even had a photo of J.R. \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs on her Austin Chronicle business card. She said it helped her connect with her interview subjects, many of whom were already members of the Church themselves.\nPLAY\n\nIn her interview with us, she spoke about the pleasure, \u201cthe great release, to have all this nutty stuff in your head and find like minded people to express it with.\u201d But most notably she sang a song written by her own hand, \"Oh, Life's a Bowl of Cherries with \"Bob\" Dobbs.\" Saint Moser's life epitomized the way that membership in the Church accelerated the discovery of true friendships, experimentations, creative collisions, and rebellion through art, music, and comedy against dehumanization in any form.\nWHY THIS FILM? \nWhy not this film? Pull the wool over your own eyes and help us make a movie! The Church of the SubGenius is the underground movement that has galvanized the imaginative, the artistic, the nerdy, even the deranged \u2013 to examine the simmering dystopia in their culture, and do absolutely nothing about it... except, maybe, poke fun at it all. The Church of the SubGenius is taking over the universe. The sooner you learn about it, the better off you\u2019ll be. \nPLAY\n\nNow more than ever we feel that the story of the Church of the SubGenius needs to be told. There's a core of ideas within the SubGenius ethos \u2013 of fighting oppression with humor, community and creativity, of using absurdity as a nonviolent weapon, giving time, permission and priority to expression, creation, and zaniness with friends \u2013  that we think has great value we believe these ideas are necessary in today's world and that our film about the SubGenius is the perfect way to invoke them.\nAmongst all the spaceships, frop, pipes, eye-bludgeoning graphics, bulldada, yeti ancestors, (and yes, \u2018macho spoutings\u2019), we hope you will fund this film so you can join our merry band of pranksters on the culture-jam of the century! It\u2019s going to be a lot of fun!!!\nNo stranger to hiding in plain sight \u2013 \"Bob\" is everywhere, IF you know to look for him!\nSo please, give to our film, get our cool merch, show up at screenings, and talk to us in every way possible. We will have our third nostril open at all times.\nAnd remember, as one famous SubGenius said, \u201csince the main message is \u2018think for yourself,\u2019 the last thing you should be doing is believing all we\u2019re telling you. We make it up as we go along.\u201d\nIvan Stang hosts the 999 Club (1981)\nWHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?\nWith this funding, we can complete the remaining interviews, edit the film, animate key sequences, and all other post-production work necessary to bring this ridiculous story to the masses.\nA behind the scenes look at our film production.

Paul Mavrides is one of the originators and sustainers of the SubGenius aesthetic, and he is also a major artist whose work shows at Fine Art galleries and whose graphic design is sought after by companies like Apple. Writing about Paul for a recent show at the Steven Wolfe Fine Arts Gallery in San Francisco, art critic Mark Van Proyers said that SubGenius output is a key influence \"on much of the art production of the 1990s... and the mythomaniacal clip-art orgies that Mavrides concocted for several of the highly entertaining \u201cSubGenious\u201d books still seem to sustain a spot-on freshness\u2026.\"\nNEW REWARDS GENEROUSLY DONATED BY LOUIS BLACK, FROM HIS PERSONAL COLLECTION\nLouis Black is the co-founder of the Austin Chronicle and co-founder of the South By Southwest Music Festival and Conference (SXSW).\nANNOUNCING NEW REWARDS FROM COMIC BOOK ARTIST CULLY HAMNER.

Thank you!\nWhat's The Story?\nHappy Happy Joy Joy, The Ren & Stimpy Story will shed light on how a cartoon about a twisted chihuahua and a dim-witted cat became an animation masterpiece; influenced American television, comedy and 90's pop culture at large; rebelled against the status quo and affected the lives of those involved. The 90 minute film will feature interviews with key players and fans, never before seen footage of the show\u2019s development, archival footage and original animation.\nWhere Are We Now?\nOver the past year, Kimo and I have shot dozens of interviews with artists, writers, directors, producers, and executives who contributed to Ren & Stimpy. We've also traveled back and forth across the US and Canada, interviewing fans and major celebrities who fell in love with the series.\nThe footage has been captured in full 4k...and it's stunning. Many of those connected to the show have also opened up their personal archives, allowing us to photograph never before seen Ren & Stimpy storyboards, concept art, pencil tests and stills. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe next phase is post production. It's expensive and that's why we are asking for your help. Here are the top line costs we need to cover to complete the project:\nMusic and Music Licensing - Oscar-nominated Composer Shawn Patterson, who worked on Ren & Stimpy, is helping us out but we still need to license some of the show's music, pay the musicians and book the studio.\nOriginal Animation - One of the key components of the film will be original, animated shorts based on stories told to us by Ren & Stimpy alumni. The animation will be in the same hand-drawn style of Ren & Stimpy -- and it's a TON of work. We are hiring some of the uber-taleneted artists that have worked with John K to create these. \nMain Titles & Interstitials - We have some killer ideas on how to visually present the archival materials. Simon Clowes, who is the motion graphics genius behind the title sequences for Superman Returns, Sherlock Holmes, and Xmen: First Class is onboard. He's helping us out but we still need to pay his team.\n Sound Design / Editing / Mixing - Brian Mendelsohn, another R&S alumnus, will be doing the sound. We need to buy drives, license FX, cover studio costs and compensate Brian for some of his time.\n Legal & Licensing - Not the most exciting part of the process but really necessary given all the footage and artwork we'd like to include. Help.\nThe Rewards - Yup, all those great looking items are high quality and cost dough....some of which is going directly to the original R & S artists.\nWe have HOURS of fantastic interviews, TONS of amazing archival artwork, an AMAZING TEAM in place, and now we just need YOU! \nPlease take a look at the list of rewards and choose one (or a few if you can!) Kimo and I would really appreciate it and you will too when you see the film.\nChoosing Multiple Rewards\nHere's how to choose more than one reward: \n1- You need to make the initial pledge. You'll see a \"Back this Project\" button if you haven't pledge yet\n2- After your pledge, Press the \"Manage your pledge Button above.\"\n3 - Increase your pledge in the \"pledge amount\" box by the total monetary amount of the add ons you want to add.\n4 - After the end of the campaign, you'll receive a survey asking, \"How would you like to use the additional funds?\"\nQuestions?\nWe'd love to hear from you! Contact us here on Kickstarter, on our Facebook page at Facebook.com/renandstimpydoc or by email at renandstimpydoc@gmail.com.  \nIf we exceed our goal, we will be adding stretch rewards so please check back before the campaign ends. We will send out updates to keep you posted.\nPlease note, the exact release date of the film is still in flux and will affect when DVD's and links are sent out. Rest assured, we want to see the completed film as much as you do!\nOther Ways to Help\nWe are hugely grateful for any monetary contributions you can make to the film. We would also appreciate your effort in spreading the word about the project on social media, email or even old school one on one's. Thanks again!\nA Note on John K & Nickelodeon\nHappy Happy Joy Joy, The Ren & Stimpy Story is being independently financed. John Kricfalusi is not backing the film, nor is Nickelodeon -- it's only Kimo and I.   \"Ren & Stimpy\" and any relevant characters are fully copyrighted and owned by Viacom / Nickelodeon and are used with permission.\nWe have asked John K multiple times for an interview. He has okay'd the participation of several people close to him, however, as of now, John himself has refused to participate...but who knows what the future holds. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are incredibly fortunate to have the support of so many of the original Ren & Stimpy crew. We have also have received an initial project sign-off by Nickelodeon, who owns the licensing rights to Ren & Stimpy. This occurred days before launching this campaign and we could not be more excited! Needless to say, this has mitigated a lot of our risk. \n\nThe only other challenge would be finishing the film with a reduced budget. That said, Kimo and I are both very confident, given our years in film and TV, and the support of so many Ren & Stimpy fans, we'll be able to meet that challenge and complete the film this year.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ron Cicero\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nProducer / Writer Ron Cicero has produced award-winning content for a diverse range of clients over the past 25 years including the Academy...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Thank You Note + Stickers", "descp": "For your thoughtful contribution to the film, you'll receive a sincere, signed thank you note from two Eeeediots a.k.a. the director and producer!\nYou'll also receive one of a kind, Happy Happy Joy Joy stickers!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "A Link to the Film", "descp": "Happy Happy Joy Joy...A link to stream the completed film!! *\nYou'll also receive:\n+ a THANK YOU note from the filmmakers\n+ One-of-a-kind, Happy Happy Joy Joy stickers\n+ Insider updates on the film's progress\n+ A Shout Out on our Facebook page\n*The exact release will depend on festival and distribution schedules.

I went to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), and was forever transformed by my experiences there, and in the years that followed, performing with my friends and fellow artists, writing experimental poetry and music, and painting, writing, and drawing constantly. These early 90's experiences that were fueled by electric coffee and late night boozing, intense conversations about the future, the present, the past. Going to SAIC art school and being into performance art, metal shows, poetry readings, and last call pool halls. This is the mental goo from where Neo-Geneticism\u2122 was born: \n\"Isolated Mutations of the Assembly Line Baby\" is a book I've been working on and off on for over 25 years. I've finally finished it, and am currently creating the original art for the beginning of each chapter in the book, 28 pieces in all. I first started writing the words of Neo-Geneticism\u2122 through the voice of Tefflon Frampps\u00ae, and then the voices of both his followers and detractors came rushing forward in the form of many more additional chapters, words within words, books within books, thoughts within thoughts. This ebbed and flowed in the early 90's, then more in 2003-2005, and then picked up again in the 2013, to final book completion this month of May 2017. In pledging your support to help me make this book and get it out to the general public, you will not only be helping in spreading the word of Neo-Geneticism\u2122, but you will also be helping in the shared completion of a more than 25 year artistic process for myself. \nWhat I Need & What You Get \nLet me create several more containers of truth: This money is to help me print and distribute the art book \"Isolated Mutations of the Assembly Line Baby\". Any money made over that will go towards making additional video pieces of art for this project's next phase. You will get the \"Isolated Mutations of the Assembly Line Baby\" Hardcover book, along with options to get limited Printed Editions. The \"Impact\" This is an art book, and the chapters are free-flowing yet ultimately connected by both it's harsh group leader, Tefflon Frampps\u00ae, and his belief in how Neo-Geneticism\u2122 can truly transform the living mind, and bend it proper:\n \"Isolated Mutations of the Assembly Line Baby\" is an art book that I look forward to releasing onto the readers of the world. I have had great success with crowd-funding two projects, the animated pilot \"Grimm Fairy Tales\", and the live action documentary \"The Death of Superman Lives: What Happened?\". These were both successfully crowd-sourced and funded at the Kickstarter site. This book can only exist with your help in making it happen. \nOther Ways You Can Help \nIf you can\u2019t contribute monetarily, here's other ways you can help: Please share this campaign, help get the word out on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and all your other social media platforms. Help spread the words of Tefflon Frampps\u00ae and the Neo-Geneticists\u2122, and have fun with it as well. Use the Kickstarter tools that are provided, for ease of mass communication with your friends!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis book represents a several decades long project, one that I've noodled on since 1991 when I lived in Chicago, and used to do lots of spoken word poetry and live performances, doing reading and rants in front of local bands at various bars across the city.\n\nI've decided to make getting this book out of my hands and into yours as easy as possible! Not only providing a digital version, but a Paperback as well. Making the deliverables very clean and simple make it so I can concentrate on getting the books out immediately upon receiving them from the printers.\n\nI've run a few successful kickstarters, and the thing that always gummed it up for me was all the extra dindads and thingamajogs promised for an additional few bucks. I've shipped out all the blurays and dvds, but it's that darn patch or poster that makes it take much much longer. I still need to ship a few of the bigger and harder to make rewards, and as I get those finished, I don't want that problem moving forward. Henceforth, a very simple, clean and easy rewards system that can be completed and shipped, and are all part of the actual book I'm creating for you to enjoy.\n\nThis kickstarter is just going to be about the books, with a small group of options and added bonus items to make it fun and doable. I hope to move this project onward to its next phase, later in the year, by making accompanying videos.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "IMOTALB PDF", "descp": "The \"Isolated Mutations of the Assembly Line Baby\" in PDF form.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Name in Book Credits", "descp": "Your name in the credits end page under \"Contributing Neo-Geneticist\" in the book \"Isolated Mutations of the Assembly Line Baby\".", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Name in Book Credits & PDF", "descp": "Your name in the credits end page under \"Contributing Neo-Geneticist\" and a PDF copy of \"Isolated Mutations of the Assembly Line Baby\".", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["38 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "SDCC \"Earlybird\" Signed Softcover", "descp": "You can get an earlybird special edition softcover version of \"Isolated Mutations of the Assembly Line Baby\" Book, signed by Jon Schnepp plus name in the credits and PDF.

No electronics - some paper, a pair of lenses and a cartridge for instant mini photos. Environment friendly - we use less materials than used in the packaging of a regular camera. The camera body, the shutter and aperture are made of thick paper and laminated cardboard.\nStretch Goals:\nVintage Design - retro with a little steampunk.\nFoldout and Compact - a little bigger than an iphone box.\nA Great Gift - can be used immediately and instantly.\nA Great Toy - Jollylook is a great teaching toy for children. Your kid can take it apart and see how it works.\nA Great Souvenir - even after use Jollylook is beautiful on the shelf!\nFun - entertaining and positive emotions.\nBeautiful Photos - using Instax mini film you get 10 instant classic color or monochrome analog unique photos. (the cartridges can be changed many times easily and quickly )\nEnvironment Friendly - easily recyclable, as dangerous to the environment as a banana peal!\nThe Magic\nWhen moments of life that we see freeze on paper - it is magic. Imagine the people who saw it happen for the first time nearly two hundred years ago! Year after year, many people learned \"freezing\" moments of life on paper. Take what we made for you and create the magic for yourself, learn and experience some part of what had to be done, all the effort to freeze a moment.\nThe Magic!\nHow does it work?\nJust as an analog plastic and metal camera! Set the lens position to landscape, group, portrait or macro:\nChoose the aperture  (f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22; f/32; f/45; f/64; pinhole)\nPull out the viewfinder:\n Look through the viewfinder:\nPress the shutter-release button!\n  Then roll out the exposed photo by turning the handle for developing - the rollers break the capsule with the processing liquid, and initiate the developing process.\nAfter a few minutes you have a unique photo in your hands\n Jollylook uses Fujifilm \u201cinstax mini\u201d instant film cartridges which are available worldwide\n  The cartridges can be changed many times!\nHow it all began:\nOnce I was showing my son what's inside the analog camera and how analog photography works, I thought then - \"what if the package itself transformed and fulfilled the function of the camera and the picture turned out immediately?! There was no problem with instant photo technology, people solved this problem long time ago. What remained to create was an analog camera that would be simple and contained in the package, worked properly and allowed to take photos and get instant results.\nI had to study the structure of many analog cameras, before being able to make the shutter - the most difficult part in the development was the shutter (no existing structure worked for Jollylook, so I had to invent a new shutter). After construction and testing of many prototypes we made it, a shutter which works perfectly and consists of only four pieces of thick paper and two tiny circular rubber bands. After picking the right lens and calculating the aperture, we created a folding \"accordion\" camera body from paper, then the case where the cartridge is placed, and we moved to the design, here there where no doubts - it had to be retro with a little steampunk look. Then we had difficulties with the unit for getting the photo out from the cartridge but after testing many options, we achieved a perfect result, photographs are now developed and pulled with a rotating handle.\nAnd of course, drawings and mockups ...and then the development of the production technology, the development of the equipment necessary for manufacturing, the selection of materials, the search and selection of contractors, and many other important little things that make up the production preparation.\nSome photos taken with Jollylook:\n    You can take close-ups from a distance of 50 cm (20 in) and you can take photos with a pinhole.\n  A pinhole is a tiny hole that acts as a lens, you only need accuracy and patience. When taking photos with the pinhole - exposition can be up to a few minutes long!\nYou can take photos with a manually operated shutter speed and you can take double exposed photos\nP.S. The photo with the dog is the first ever photo made with Jollylook!\nJollylook consists of:\nTechnical specifications:\nLens - a meniscus lens with a focal length of 110 mm ( 4.33 in ), allows to take photos from portrait to landscape. can be moved up to shoot through the pinhole.\nViewfinder - a Fresnel lens \nAperture - a switchable diaphragm with manual adjustment for the seven values: f / 8, f / 11, f / 16, f / 22; f / 32; f / 45; f / 64 + pinhole.\nShutter - automatic with shutter speed of 1/250 or 1/160 and manual shutter mode with the possibility to control the exposure time manually.\nPinhole - a round hole in a copper foil 0.6 mm (0.023 in) in diameter, located on the diaphragm disk\n10 shots per instax mini cartridge (the cartridge can be changed many times)\nStorage conditions - store in a dry and dark place at room temperature.\nconditions of use - use at temperatures between 10 - 35 \u00b0C (50 -95 \u2109) in dry weather.\nSize when folded 85 x 127 x 48 mm ( 311\u204432 x 5 x 157\u204464 in )\nFujifilm \u201cinstax mini\u201d instant film cartridge\nPhoto size 46(W) x 62(H) mm\nThe Rewards:\n The Jollylook Team:\nOleg Khalip - the author of the idea - a designer and inventor with 30 years of experience in organization and design of production facilities in the field of engineering.\nYuri Sibiryakov - an experienced designer with 40 years of experience in aviation engineering, design of devices and equipment. in Jollylook he is in charge of product design and production equipment.\nEvgeniy Ivanov \u2013 a film director who loves instant photography and film. Our internet man, takes care of marketing, PR and social networks.\nAnna Gorbenko - organizes cooperations and procurement, monitors the delivery and saves our money. Also many times she reminds us to eat!\nMariia Khalip \u2013 creates computer graphics and artwork. Inspires us with her neatness and greate sense of style.\nWhat is done:\nDeveloped, manufactured and tested several dozens of prototypes\nWe have developed various versions and tested the tooling for production\nWe applied for a patent in the US and globally\nWhat has to be done:\nOrder the production of molds for the lenses and the developing unit\nOrganize a large-scale production\nMarketing\nWhy do we need you support?\nWe chose Kickstarter because this is where people who are interested in everything new and unusual are, they are positive and supportive.

Its charm and wonder is in everything from commercials, television shows, and feature films, to the classic visual effects that are beloved by so many. In todays society of high tech computer graphic engineering it's important to keep perspective of both modern and classic techniques along with recognizing that those classical artistic techniques are not out of date and are yet still very much relevant.\nWhat is Stop Motion Magazine \nStop Motion Magazine is one of the very rare publications in the world that focuses on an art form that can use every artistic method known to man. This little publication which has been published since 2009 takes its readers deep behind the scenes where they can get an up close and personal look at films and production both big and small. Stop Motion Magazine is a valuable resource to artists all over the world as a source of reference for their own productions, as an educational supplement, and as a source of news for what is going on in the industry. The magazine is produced as a quarterly publication that is available in both print and digital versions. We also produce stopmotionmagazine.net which is the magazines website with up to date information, news, and entertainment. \nFundraising for 2017\n We are running our Stop Motion Magazine 2017 KickStarter campaign to keep the lights on and the wheels turning while we continue production of the magazine. With your support we will be able to publish the magazine in 2017 and provide you with one of the most comprehensive animation publications in the world. The artists that have been featured in Stop Motion Magazine are a very diverse group of people from all over the world. Some of them are world famous and some of them are just artists wanting to share their favorite medium with the world. Unlike larger publications this little magazine doesn't have the luxury of accepting print subscribers year round. To be able to determine our publishing needs and budget for the year we need to run these type of campaign drives to insure that the magazine stays alive. Kind of like how Public Television runs a campaign to keep their lights on. Your contribution no matter how big or small will insure that we are able to stay in print for the 2017 calendar year. So please contribute if you can.        \n Perks:\n Magazine Subscription (1 Year) Digital or Print\n Pins & Stickers\n  Tie Down Puppet Feet\n  Micro Slate\n  Mixing Palette\n  Animation Dept Tshirt\n   Advertise", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThroughout the history of the magazine which started in 2009, we've faced many challenges.

They have one minute to draw what they drew from the deck. After the minute they must show the person/group, which then have a minute to guess what it is. The Duh-Doodler is not allowed to give them hints, but they can signal them if the person/group guesses one of the cards right. It's just that simple. \nWe are asking for start-up money to bring our prototype to life.

The script was written by Hank Huffman and the film will be directed by Derek Carl, the team responsible for the short film Bad Seed and the upcoming web series Y2K 2000. We will be starting production in mid\u00ad-October and the final version will enter the festival circuit in 2017.\nPLAY\n\nA special message from the star of The Brain That Wouldn't Die, Patrick Green.\n  Bad Seed was shot on a shoestring budget with a tiny crew. Just think of what we could do with a full professional crew and $70,000!\n  The team behind The Brain That Wouldn't Die has been working together for quite a while. It started with the Western short film, Bad Seed, where Derek Carl, Hank Huffman, Molly Preston, Daniel Timothy Treacy, and Jason Reynolds worked together for the first time. The synchronicity between the cast and crew led to one of the most enjoyable film experiences we'd ever had. Since then, we've been committed to keeping this merry band of misfits together, as we move from short films, to pilots, to features.\nDerek, Hank, Molly and Jason working on \"Bad Seed\"\nAs time went on, our team grew to include many more talented actors and crew members. It is our goal to bring together the best that Portland, OR has to offer, and to showcase the amazing talent that lives here.\nOn the set of \"Y2K 2000\"\nPortland is a thriving city for independent artists of all stripes, and one of the few alternatives to Los Angeles when it comes to production hubs on the West Coast. And while the city has become noted for its success in television, with hit shows like NBC's Grimm and IFC's Portlandia, we are determined to bring that same recognition to the Portland film scene.\nWe love working together, and we don't mind getting a little cozy\nOur team has been very successful together. We have been recognized by numerous film festivals, and have won multiple film making awards. We have no doubt that we will continue this record of success with The Brain That Wouldn't Die.\n        Derek Carl is an accomplished director and producer based out of New York, NY.

Franco.\u201d Additional television credits include Leverage, Z Nation, Monk and It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\n  It's a family movie.\n      Our primary reason for making this movie is because it's precisely the kind of movie we want to see. A fun, edgy, B\u00ad-movie inspired romp that emphasizes practical effects. We have a special fondness for films with that charming handmade quality, be it Evil Dead 2 or Re\u00ad-Animator \u2013 there's no mistaking a gallon of fake blood for CGI.\nIt also doesn't hurt that this story contains thought provoking social commentary that (sadly) seems just as relevant today as it did in 1962.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDecapitation.\n\nFACT! \u2013 Studies show that one in every five Americans will experience some form of decapitation within their lifetime. Should this happen to a member(s) of our cast or crew, it would significantly slow down the production. Fortunately, we have developed a serum that may rectify the situation (mwah ha ha).\n\nJoking aside, there are very real risks involved with independent filmmaking. It is always possible that unforeseen circumstances keep the film from being finished on schedule. But as the great Bruce Campbell once said, \u201cIf a movie has a release date, it's not a true indie.\u201d Making films outside of the studio system is a risky venture but when it succeeds, it can change the course of mainstream cinema (see Evil Dead, Clerks, Sex Lies and Videotape).\n\nFinally, as with all remakes, we run the risk of upsetting fans of the original. That said, it's not like we're remaking a hallmark of American cinema (*cough* Psycho *cough*). We are confident that our film will be readily embraced by fans of the original and newcomers alike. We remake it as to honor its legacy.\n\nFor more information about this project, go to: http://www.brainthatwouldntdiemovie.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "#1 JOIN THE TEAM", "descp": "You're now part of the movie making team!

Thank you so much for your support!\nThe Voyager Golden Record was a gift from humanity to the cosmos. And it is also a gift to humanity.\nIn 1977, NASA launched two spacecraft, Voyager I and II, on a grand tour of the solar system and beyond, into the mysteries of interstellar space. Mounted to each of these spacecraft is a stunning golden phonograph record, an interstellar message to introduce our civilization to extraterrestrials who might encounter the probes, perhaps billions of years from now. \nThe Voyager Golden Record contains the story of Earth expressed in sounds, images, and science: Earth's greatest music from myriad cultures and eras, from Bach and Beethoven to Blind Willie Johnson and Chuck Berry, Senegalese percussion to Solomon Island panpipes. Dozens of natural sounds of our planet -- birds, a train, a baby's cry -- are collaged into a lovely audio poem called Sounds of Earth. There are spoken greetings in 55 human languages, and one whale language, and more than one hundred images encoded in analog that depict who, and what, we are.  (To hear those greetings and Sounds of Earth and see a handful of the images, visit NASA/JPL-Caltech's Voyager site!)\nEtched on the record\u2019s gold-plated aluminum jacket is a diagram explaining where it came from, and how to play it. \nAstronomer and science educator Carl Sagan chaired the visionary committee that created the original Voyager Golden Record forty years ago. Astronomer and SETI pioneer Frank Drake was the technical director, writer Ann Druyan was creative director, science writer Timothy Ferris produced the record, artist Jon Lomberg designed it, and artist Linda Salzman Sagan organized the greetings. \nVoyager I entered interstellar space in 2013. It\u2019s almost 13 billion miles away from Earth, and in about 40,000 years it will be within 1.6 light years of a star in the constellation of Camelopardalis. Voyager II is right on its tail. We may never know whether an extraterrestrial civilization ever listens to the Golden Record. \nBut now for the first time in history, to celebrate Voyager's 40th anniversary next year, you'll be able to experience it for yourself the way it was meant to be played.\nAn exquisitely-designed objet d'art, this limited edition Voyager Golden Record: 40th Anniversary Edition vinyl box set will only be available through this Kickstarter. It is the ultimate album package of the ultimate album package.\nThe cloth-covered box with gold foil inlay will house three, heavyweight translucent gold vinyl LPs protected by poly-lined paper sleeves. The LPs will contain all of the same magnificent music, greetings, and sounds as contained on the original Voyager Golden Record, nearly two hours of audio. (Track list below.) Those records will slip into old style tip on, black ink and gold foil jackets. The audio will be complemented by a beautifully-designed hardbound book of captivating images from the original interstellar message, glorious photos of the planets returned to Earth from the Voyager probes, compelling essays, and ephemera from the project's history. \nEach set will include a color, plastic digital download card with a code to access all of the audio in MP3 or FLAC format. A lithograph of the iconic Golden Record cover diagram, printed with gold metallic ink on archival paper, high-quality enamel pin of that same diagram, and a custom turntable slipmat featuring NASA/JPL-Caltech's heliocentric view of the Voyager spacecrafts' trajectories across the solar system will complete the box set.\nWe are honored that Timothy Ferris, the original producer of the Golden Record, will be in the recording studio with us to remaster the audio for vinyl, drawing from the highest-quality sources we can access.\nThe overwhelming majority of the funds raised from this historic reissue will go directly to the high production costs, licensing, and royalties incurred in creating this lavish box set. All manufacturing, except perhaps the vinyl pressing, will take place in North America at highly-respected facilities using the finest materials.\nWe are excited about some very special plans we have for the net proceeds from this project. Please click here!\nThe creation and launch of the Voyager Golden Record was a testament to the power of science and art to ignite humanity\u2019s sense of curiosity, delight, and wonder. That is the mindset with which as we approach this effort to publicly release the Voyager Golden Record as actual phonograph records for the very first time. It is as relevant now as it was in 1977. Perhaps even more so.\nOur hope is that The Golden Record: 40th Anniversary Edition will provoke questions about our place in the universe, open our minds to possibility, and serve as a reminder that the future is really up to all of us.\nYour support means the world(s) to us. \nThank you,\nDavid, Tim, and Lawrence\nDavid Pescovitz is editor/managing partner of Boing Boing, the technology and culture web site with more than 5 million readers, and a research director at the nonprofit Institute for the Future.

Last week, we were fortunate enough to make a brief visit to the awe-inspiring cleanroom of the Spacecraft Assembly Facility where engineers were constructing the Mars 2020 rover. High on the walls above the workspace are huge emblems representing each of the missions that were assembled there, including Galileo, Cassini, Mariner, Viking, Spirit, and, the reason for our visit, Voyager 1 and 2.

We've got our band cast! Steve Agee, Jordan Carlos, Seth Herzog and Dave Hill will be starring as our Boy Banders!\n(now onto the original pitch...)\nAfter decades of writing comedy for other people, we\u2019re making our first movie, right here in our hometown of Dayton, Ohio. It\u2019s not about cancer or global warming, it\u2019s not about orphans in the Sudan or anything else that makes an indie film. It\u2019s a silly goofball comedy imagining a boy band who\u2019ve grown up into balding, fat idiots. And we need your help to make it, to make it right, and to make it here in Ohio.\nI mean, we also happen to believe that laughter makes the world a better place. Comedy is all we know and love, and this feature is the culmination of our life's work. It's literally our only path to emotional, spiritual and comedical fulfillment.\nPROBLEM:\nLos Angeles is the mecca of moviemaking, but the cost of living is so high that it prevents real creative experimentation because everyone is just trying to get whatever work they can to pay the bills.\nSOLUTION:\nPack up my family, move back to my hometown where you can rent a 3 bedroom house for the price you can rent a parking space in a big city, and spend every extra cent and every extra minute on projects that MEAN something to us. In this case - a comedy about 40 year old boy banders who are still singing about making out, the mall, and making out at the mall.\nABOUT THE PROJECT: \nA brand new musical comedy film about the boy band \u201c\u2764\ufe0fThrob\u201d and lead singer Johnny Throbstein, who have spent every day of the past 17 years working on the follow up to their multi-platinum debut album, leaving them older, fatter, balder, and less \u201cboyish\u201d than any boy band has a right to be. They\u2019ve run out of money and today is their last day in the studio to finish the album they hope will return them to their former international glory. \nWritten by Stephen Levinson (The Tonight Show) and Joel Moss Levinson (that one speedo video from the internet.) Staring Seth Herzog (The Tonight Show), Jordan Carlos (The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore) and Steve Agee (The Sarah Silverman Program) and more hilarious people we haven't cast yet. \nWith a crew made up of amazing people from across the Miami Valley, and filmed right here in Dayton, we intend to do for Dayton what John Waters did for Baltimore! What The Farrelly Brothers did for Providence, RI! What Mussolini did for... wait, wait, strike that last part. \nWHERE THE FUNDS GO:\nThe vast majority of the money goes to local Ohioan\u2019s who make their money in film. Lighting, grips, sound people, assistant directors, line producers - like the three people we showed you in that video - sound guy Ben Devine, Producer Kathleen Hartshorn and Coordinator Will Brown:\n- all of whom work hard to carve out a living making videos in Ohio and, like us, spend most of their time on commercials for products they aren\u2019t passionate about. Everyone is willing to work for less than they\u2019re worth to make an incredible comedy right here in Ohio, but we can\u2019t ask people to work for NOTHING. Plus catering (you know, so no one starves), equipment rentals, editors, and more. If we hit our reach goals, it allows us to film in unique Dayton only locations - The Art Institute, The Masonic Temple, The Cannery, etc.\nBen, Kathleen and Will are just three of the amazing locals helping to make this movie happen!\nIMPACT AND HOW IT HELPS\nHave you ever SEEN a good comedy movie? Do you need to be told how it helps? Okay, here\u2019s some things it does and some things it doesn\u2019t do, try to guess which is which: \nMakes you feel good \nCreates a drought resistant tomato\nPrevents Nuclear war \nMakes people laugh \nGives you something awesome to quote and/or talk about with your friends. \nPuts an end to racism \nProvides a much needed escape from parenting your children for 2 hours \nIs relaxing \nIs fun \nImproves the local economy*\n(correct answers - 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10* only if you support local filmmakers like us.)\nTRUTH:\nThe universe is vast, and probably meaningless. Our existence as humans is doomed to an abject failure at best. In a few billion years, nothing we've done will have mattered. So we've decided to dedicate our lives to one thing - making the time we are here great. That's done through art. Through creation. And for us, through comedy. This is our way of giving something of value to the universe while we are still here. With your help, we can make people laugh. Maybe even make you laugh. And make ourselves laugh. And every time someone, somewhere laughs, it makes a angel cry. \nDon't you want to make angels cry?\nOTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:\nWe don't just need your cash and your fandom, we want you to help us make this movie! That starts with this campaign and spreading the word! Beyond that, we will need extras during the shoot! We will need PROPS DONATED. Just by backing (even at the $1 level) we'll get your email address and know you're wiling to help, and can be in touch to help at every level from pre-production through marketing and carpentry!\nTHANK YOU:\nWhether you're backing or not, we appreciate you giving enough of a damn about independent comedy to read this far. Thank you. And please help us spread the word. \nPLAY\n\n Update (9/8/2016):\nWe are ridiculously excited about raising well over half the money we\u2019re hoping for - and to say thanks (and ask for your help in a push to get us all the way there!) we\u2019ve created this time-lapse animation of the ultimate Voltron Boy Bander. What does it have to do with our movie? Not much! But we like creating things which is why you backed us in the first place! \nSo enjoy! Tell someone (or three someone\u2019s) and help us make some Dayton magic!\nCheck out the media coverage:\nWe got some love from Film Dayton at the start of the campaign.\nNow, we have articles on Dayton.com and in the Dayton City Paper\nWe were on the news...

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Fidget Cube!\nWe can't do this without you!\n        Questions?\nAsk away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.\nFeedback?\nGot a creative idea you think we should implement with Fidget Cube? Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo.

Currently the design is going through a final iteration to refine the aesthetics so that Smoovie looks and feels great too. \nIn January this year Alex travelled to China to discuss the manufacture of the Smoovie project with factories the team had long term relationships with already. After comparing the quality of prototypes produced and manufacturing processes, a selection was made.\nWe are confident that the manufacturer we have chosen is best suited to help us get Smoovie ready for mass production so that we can deliver a product that satisfies our requirements and more importantly that you'll be happy with.\nWe are an experienced team based in London and HK who have designed, developed and delivered products  on a global scale.
