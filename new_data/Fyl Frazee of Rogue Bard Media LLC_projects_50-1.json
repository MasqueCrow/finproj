Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons: Stories players dive deeper into the lore of Aughmoore. \nThe Stories expansion introduces a new Story Mode that has Heroes completing Side Quests and adventuring deeper into the dungeon, descending Multiple Floors and eventually fighting multiple Dungeons Bosses at once!\nIn addition, Stories offers a slew of new Heroes, Loot, Dungeon Rooms, Dungeon Bosses, Minions, and Goblins! \nThe Stories expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Dungeons.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

It is time to take him to the NEXT LEVEL with his very own FEATURE HORROR/COMEDY \"ONYX THE FORTUITOUS AND THE TALISMAN OF SOULS.\" \nOnyx is the brainchild of writer and performer Andrew Bowser. Through an ongoing series of viral videos spanning nearly 9 years, Onyx has permeated every corner of pop culture. The character has amassed over 300 million views online and his content has been shared by numerous celebrities and referenced in multiple hit songs. \nAs a director, Bowser has helmed numerous independent films that have had premieres at SXSW, Seattle International, and Chattanooga Film Festival. He has worked with Legendary Pictures, Warner Bros. Games, Blizzard Entertainment, Funny or Die, Chrysler, and Marvel. He has also directed horror mainstays like Barbara Crampton, Bruce Campbell, and Adrienne Barbeau. \nThis film is the culmination of Bowser's abilities as a director and Onyx's potential as a resonating comedic character. \nTHE TALISMAN OF SOULS is a horror/comedy in the vein of 80's favorites like GREMLINS and FRIGHT NIGHT. It's a throwback to an era when horror movies were equal parts absurdity and humanity. \nPoster art by Lukas Ketner\nThe story follows fledgling Satanist Marcus J. Trillbury (Onyx) as he attends a once-in-a-lifetime ritual at his idol BARTOK THE GREAT'S dark mansion. Once there, Marcus meets a group of other worshippers. As the group is led by Bartok and his assistant Farrah in a series of rituals meant to \"better them,\" it becomes clear that their intentions are more nefarious. As his new friends are losing the battle to keep their souls, a question of great destiny looms over Onyx's head: is he doomed to be a nobody or is he the only one who can defeat Bartok and save his friends from damnation?\nInspiration for \"Talisman of Souls\"\nTHE VISION BEHIND THE FILM \n ---NEW \"FILM ONLY\" REWARDS! ---\nFULL REWARDS BREAKDOWN!\nCAMPAIGN PRODUCTION CREDITS : \nMAIN TITLE DESIGN BY JUSTIN CROWELL\nMAIN TITLE THEME BY ROB AMJARV\nMAIN TITLE SOUND DESIGN BY MIKE JAMES GALLAGHER\nTITLE HEADER ILLUSTRATIONS BY CHEY EPSEJO\nThrough his many years creating content in this industry, Bowser has amassed an amazingly talented team to surround him and Onyx on this project.\nDAN ADLERSTEIN/DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY\nDan is an LA based DP who works on a wide variety of projects in television, commercials, narrative, documentary, and digital content.\nHe has worked extensively in TV, shooting for HBO, CBS, Netflix, Amazon, HULU, AppleTV, and more.  His commercial work includes campaigns for Old Spice, Kahlua, Zappos, Fox Sports, as well as many other brands. His narrative work has been featured in festivals worldwide, including Sundance and Cannes.\nDan is an alumn of Wesleyan University where he majored in Film Studies, focusing mostly on film history and theory.  He went on to earn an MFA in Cinematography at the AFI Conservatory.\nDan is a member of IATSE Local 600 and on the Industry Experience Roster as a Director of Photography. He recently shot the Netflix show \"Aunty Donna's Big Ole' House of Fun\" and Bowser's short \"Little Willy.\"\nSTUDIO ADI/SPECIAL EFFECTS\nSTUDIO ADI is a group Academy Award winning creators of special characters and character effects. Calling upon a diverse range of talents and techniques, they create prosthetic make-ups, animatronic puppets, actor duplicates, and replica animals. With over twenty-five years of professional experience, they bring \"real\" character effects to the set to interact with actors, lighting, and practical atmosphere. Studio ADI prides themselves on working with the industry's leading CGI companies to find the right balance of digital and practical effects.  They continue to provide filmmakers with realistic and economical character effects that best serve the story and the production. Their credits include films such as IT, Godzilla VS. Kong, The Predator, and The Nun.\nMATT MAHAFFEY/COMPOSER\nMatt Mahaffey is a self-described quirky musician. After having niche success with a rock band, he found out - much like Mothersbaugh and Elfman - that his ideas fit better over the course of 11-75 minutes of picture than it did in a 3-minute pop song. The Shrek universe was his first job in film/tv and it was the gift that kept on giving.  He started a composer collective with his wife, creating scores for dozens of television shows over the last decade, including \"Rise of the Ninja Turtles.\"\nHe's worked with some of the biggest names in the industry, including doing 3 years on the road with Beck and writing and performing on his Grammy-award winning album Morning Phase. He also received Gold Sales Awards for Keith Urban\u2019s Fuse and Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Lasers, among others, and Platinum Sales Awards for Vitamin C and HelloGoodbye. Matt also scored \"Little Willy\" and Bowser grew up idolizing his work in the band Self.\nMIKE JAMES GALLAGHER/SOUND DESIGNER\nMike James Gallagher is a sound designer and re-recording mixer currently living and working in Los Angeles. As a sound designer he has worked for clients like Netflix, Hulu, Marvel, Lagavulin, Pro Sound Effects, Crypt TV, and Nerdist, among others. His work has also been featured in numerous festivals including Sundance and Edinburgh International. In 2018 he created the popular sound-oriented YouTube channel INDEPTH Sound Design (https://www.youtube.com/indepthsounddesign).\nMike met Bowser at Comic Con 10 years ago and they've been collaborating ever since on projects including Monster Machine, Worm, and Little Willy. He also enjoys writing about sound for picture, most recently writing the episode \"Storytelling with Cinematic Sound Design\" for the popular YouTube channel Film Riot. Some of his latest sound design work is featured in the Netflix series, Song Exploder, which was adapted from the acclaimed podcast of the same name.\nBOWSER'S DIRECTING REEL\nLITTLE WILLY (SHORT FILM)\nTHRILL ME!

So, we are coming directly to you, the passionate Steven Universe fans out there!\nBacking Steven Universe: Beach-a-Palooza Card Battling Game on Kickstarter is the ONLY way to get it . . . the game is a KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE.

But it\u2019s not going to be easy: Party Crashers\u2014Corrupted and Homeworld Gems\u2014want to ruin your amazing performance. It\u2019s Beach City\u2019s event of the year and you\u2019re on center stage. Play your cards right and your band might be the big winner!\nWe expect the game to start shipping at the end of 2020 or in early 2021. It is English-only and we're shipping worldwide in partnership with Quartermaster Logistics. This game is \"friendly\" in terms of shipping (i.e., no customs/import taxes) to the US, Canada, EU/UK, Australia, and New Zealand.\nShipping rates are based on actual costs to ship your rewards (depending on your country) and will be charged as part of your pledge.\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, most shippers have added surcharges to their rates. The amount we charge for shipping reflects the latest rates. In some regions, the cost of shipping may exceed the cost of the tier you\u2019re pledging for; unfortunately, this cannot be avoided. In most cases, pledging for two games (\u201cDouble Up\u201d Tier) costs the same in terms of shipping as pledging for one game.\nDue to COVID-19, all schedules need to be considered somewhat tentative this year, as there have been and will continue to be unexpected delays worldwide. However, we do have a planned timeline for getting you your games, barring disruptions: \n August: go to print\n Mid-/late-October: ships leave port with games\n Thanksgiving weekend: ships arrive at destination ports for distribution\n December 2020-early 2021: fulfillment\nCheck out the Steven Universe: Beach-a-Palooza Giveaway!

The Mission is complete.... all the goals and then some!  We love you chummers.... thanks for an amazing campaign! \nIn Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops, players lead a team of shadowrunners gunning for the big score! \nAlong the way they\u2019ll have the chance to hire more seasoned runners, outfit their team with cutting-edge technology\u2014from the latest weapons to cyberware enhancements\u2014and take on increasingly dangerous contracts on the mean streets of the Seattle Metroplex.\nEach payout increases your chances for a more lethal combination of gear, training, and skill. All leading to that final score as you take on one of the world\u2019s megacorporations. But you\u2019ve got to hit it before another team steals your ticket to the big time\u2014hold off too long to grab that ring, and you\u2019ll lose it all!\nShadowrun: Sprawl Ops is a competitive board game for 2-4 players that combines worker-placement with push-your-luck dice-rolling mayhem.\nThis game is chromed up and ready to rock! It has everything you need to run the Seattle streets, from a sleek board to custom dice to art work that brings you into one of the greatest settings in gaming history!\n\nThe year is 2080, and the world has only gotten meaner. Magic came back into the world nearly seventy years earlier, bringing orks, elves, trolls, dwarfs, dragons, and all kinds of spells and magical critters. Dragons and megacorporations alike gather their hoards, uncaring of who they stomp on to amass their treasure. Government power has faded as the corps wrap international economies around their bejeweled fingers. Most people survive by selling their souls to the megacorps, slaving away for their entire lives to stay safe and fed.  \n\nSome people, though, aren\u2019t willing to sell out. They don\u2019t fit into the mold the corporations have prepared for them. They live in the cracks and margins of society\u2014in the shadows. To survive, they do the things others won\u2019t, performing the grey ops the megacorps need in order to keep up with the competition.  \n\nYou are one of them. You are a shadowrunner. You may make your way by slinging spells, swinging swords, firing bullets, or hacking the Matrix. You have to be a step faster and a hair smarter than everyone else if you want to keep working, and you need to keep your wits about you if you want to stay alive. There are plenty of obstacles out there: corp security officers, ultra-violent gangers, vicious critters, and people who carry two hundred bullets and an equal number of grudges. To stay alive, you trust yourself, you trust your team, and you remember a few simple pieces of advice:  Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever cut a deal with a dragon.\n If you want to see the components in more detail, check further down the page and also watch our micro videos! \nCheck this out! \nWe've got some wiz options for you. When you're a more seasoned runner you know that working together is sometimes the best strategy!  Exclusive to Kickstarter is the Co-operative Conversion Kit! \nThis bad boy comes with its own board mods, new decks of cards, and a whole new subset of rules and missions for you and your omaes to work together instead of against each other to win the big score! \nWhat do you get with your cooperative expansion?\n\n1 Megacorp Bi-fold Sideboard 508mm x 152mm \nCooperative Rulebook \n20+ Playing Cards + Final Missions\n60+ Tokens\nWhat does Exclusive mean? \nThis expansion makes Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops go from a competitive game to a fully cooperative game. That's right, it's like TWO games in ONE!   This is an exclusive product only, which means it will only be available here on Kickstarter, through the pledge manager and through Catalyst or Lynnvander directly and/or at a variety of conventions while supplies last.  This is a limited print product. \nWe've got a cooperative video for you down below after the play-through video and micro-videos! Enjoy. \n What do you get with your 5-6 player expansion?  \n52+ Cards including 10 New Missions. \n2 Player Boards\n8 New Player Standees with Bases. \nRules Insert\nNew Tokens and Additional Nuyen\nBoth expansions will come with their own boxes and inserts. \n\nMORE to come...\n METAL DICE  \nAircraft aluminum dice are Superior in quality and will outlast any run no matter how crazy. These dice will be anodized in color to match the standard dice you'd get in the board game. We've broken these dice down to a few categories and we'll explain them here and on the main page for you.\nNot exactly as shown - Digital Mock Up\n You can choose from;  \nA set of 6 of any ONE kind of die. i.e. 6 X Street Samurai is considered one add-on. \nAn RPG set is 6 of EACH kind of die. Street Samurai, Decker, Face, Mage and Rigger.  These are perfect for the role-playing books and other product that can use these dice. Of course you could use them in your board game but that's what the next level is for.... \nThe UPGRADE set simple matches the dice in your board game. Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops has 36 dice in the game. This upgrade just gives you the same denomination of dice only anodized aircraft aluminium.\nYou can also add more standard dice to your collection. Either a package of 6 dice of any ONE kind OR a package of 30 for the RPG lover in you.\n METAL NUYEN TOKENS  \nWHAT!!!!? Shut the Drek up!\nNot exactly as shown - Digital Mock Up\nThat's right. Full metal nuyen coins. These coins are perfect to upgrade and pimp out your Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops, Shadowrun: Crossfire or Shadowrun ANYTHING games. 40 amazing metal nuyen coins will be broken down as follows;  \n20 x 1's \n8 x 3's \n12 x 5's \n You can add as many sets as you wish! They are just amazing to have all around, especially with the Mr. Johnson level bonus super sized Nuyen Coin!\nNot exactly as shown - Digital Mock Up\n Become a Runner \nWe've got a wonderful series of limited pledge levels.  Here's the legal side off that pledge level.\n\nTHE STREETS  \nBecoming an official character is one of the sweetest deals we could possibly offer a fan of the Shadowrun Universe. It comes with a few necessary caveats, however. Please review the process and the necessary legal mumbo-jumbo: \n\nProcess: You will be required to provide a photo of yourself, as well as a street name, catch phrase and archetype/racial preference. Artists will do their best to incorporate you into our standard style guide for the archetype and race you select, and Catalyst gets the last word on art direction as well as acceptable character names and flavor text. [Sorry, no Runner McRunnerface, and no graphic language\u2026 :) we watch the internet too, you know.]\n\n[Sorry, no Runner McRunnerface, and no graphic language\u2026 :) we watch the internet too, you know.] \n\nLegaleze: In order to make you over into a Shadowrun character, and for this character to become part of the Shadowrun universe, you will need to sign a release form that authorizes us to oversee creative direction and to use the final art and information. This release will also assign the copyright of the work to the Topps Company (the owners of the Shadowrun IP). Topps will own the creative work you are helping us create based on your likeness.  \nSince Catalyst Game Labs is a major supplier to distribution and local gaming stores, we want to make sure you are part of this Kickstarter's equation.  \nWho - For any and all retailers, local gaming stores, convention vendors and more. Must have a valid business license and accounts with reputable distribution channels such as Alliance, GTS, Universal,  Lion Rampant and more. \nWhat - A pledge level to help us gauge interest in exclusive product for retailers that revolve around Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops.\nWhen - After the campaign, we'll have a pledge manager level that will be open exclusively to retailers. This will include product specific to retail only and/or extremely good margins if you order through your regular distribution channels. \nWhy - Because we love our retailers, distributors and local gaming stores.  Without you we are nothing. Thank-you, and please note that we haven't forgot you. \nWe've got a lot coming your way in terms of LIVE Q&A's, LIVE Play-through's and more!  Please take some time to schedule in one of our live video sessions from the calendar below; \nMay 23rd, 5pm - 7pm (est)- Live introduction of the campaign.

The players lay out the gameboard, the various cards and dice, and randomly select one of the Final Mission cards. Then each player starts by selecting a shadowrunner team\u2014taking the appropriate markers and player mat\u2014and placing three starting shadowrunners in their player area.\nEach player has a number of actions based upon how many shadowrunners they have on their team; all start with three, but you\u2019re able to hire up to four. Beginning with the first player in a turn, each player places one of their shadowrunner markers on a location on the gameboard, immediately resolving the effects there. \nA few location examples:  \nAt the Crime Mall, immediately spend nuyen to purchase equipment and place the card with any of shadowrunners.\nAt Max\u2019s Ironworks, get a cyberware upgrade for that shadowrunner.\nThe Eye of the Needle provides a host of different benefits for what you need to accomplish in a turn.\nGot a wounded shadowrunner? Dante\u2019s Inferno will let them lie low, make contacts, and generate some nuyen.\nOr make your way to Mr. Johnson and select a mission.\nAnd plenty more! Check out the game board! \nPlayers not only need to choose the appropriate location to try to maximize their gains each turn\u2014and act before other players can grab what they\u2019re looking for\u2014but each shadowrunner is a specific type, bringing their own strengths and weaknesses to a given location.\nShadowrun: Sprawl Ops includes the following shadowrunner types:\nStreet Samurai: Weapons master, often more machine than man.\nDecker: Computer hacker extraordinaire; the Matrix is life.\nMage: Slinger of spells and incantations; rare, precious, dangerous.\nRigger: Drones and vehicles; a mind-jockey for any mobile tech.\nFace: Charismatic and silver-tongued; confidence man for any deal. \nPlacing any shadowrunner into the Crime Mall location on the gameboard lets you snag any equipment card available for the list price. But if you place your Face there, you can get it for half price! Or if you want that perfect cyberware upgrade for your Rigger, you must place that shadowrunner in Max\u2019s Ironworks. Or send your Street Samurai to The Eye of the Needle to automatically pass the first Stage of a mission; or the Decker to gain extra Loot; or the Mage to move one of your other shadowrunners. That's just the start of the benefits of having the right runner in the right place.\nOnce all shadowrunners are placed and locations activated, players move into the last portion of every round: running their missions! \nEvery Mission card indicates several stages that need to be completed, via a series of icons corresponding to the shadowrunner types. Players then determine which shadowrunners they wish to send on the mission; they can send one, some, or all their team.  After reviewing their shadowrunners, they select a number of six-sided dice equal to all of their available icons\u2014based upon the shadowrunners, equipment, and upgrade cards\u2014and then roll their dice. \nEach die includes two \u201csuccess\u201d sides and one \u201cinjury\u201d side; the rest of the sides are blank. When rolling the dice, a player has three rolls to clear a Mission stage by matching the correct success icon from their dice with the needed icons on the stage. Additionally, a player can use any two of the same color successes to achieve one success for another color. \nIn all the chaos of fast-talking your way past guards, tossing fireballs, and flashing blades while getting the job done, injuries are bound to happen. A player can wipe out one injury die roll result by using any one success. But if they trade too many successes that way, then they won\u2019t be able to get the successes they need to complete a stage within the three rolls they are allowed. And if they can\u2019t wipe out an injury, those start to stack up, knocking shadowrunners\u2014and their dice\u2014out of the current mission, potentially losing them for a turn. So it\u2019s a fine push-your-luck balance. \nOnce you\u2019ve started a stage of a Mission, you must continue rolling until you\u2019re done. But when a stage is complete, you can decide to pull out\u2014sometimes, the pressure comes too hot, and it's time for duck-and-cover. Or maybe you feel you\u2019ve got this despite the injuries, despite the odds, and you push on through. You might see victory \u2026 or you might get half your team injured or even killed, and you\u2019ll spend the next turn (at least) rebuilding. \nKnowing when to walk away is just as important as when to push. If you manage complete the mission, you\u2019ll get the nuyen payout that will help you bring in better shadowrunners and more gear on future jobs. And of course all of this will lead to the big run of the Final Mission.  Check out one of them, the Rescue a Ritual Sacrifice job against Aztechnology.\nBrutal, right? Not to mention the brinkmanship with the other players. Push too soon, and you might not have the dice to make it through; both of the the six Mage and six Hacker successes are tough nuts to crack. And if you fail, you\u2019re left to rebuild for a turn\u2014time you may not have. But wait too long, and another player will sneak in front of you, and with the right set of runners, equipment, and a little luck, they\u2019ll snag your victory from you! \nThat\u2019s just a quick walk through of Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops. There\u2019s much more to experience and enjoy in this unique combination of worker placement and push-your-luck tactics! \nDownload the Working Rule Book HERE. \nWhen you back this campaign you are also subject to some serious stretch-goal mojo, or as we like to call it, SWAG GOALS!\nWe did the entire list!

Today, you\u2019re being sent out beyond the safety of its walls on a journey into the uncharted Wilds. There\u2019s a dozen survivors for every mouth the Fortress can feed. It\u2019s time to earn your place within its walls once and for all. \nIn Posthuman Saga you'll be venturing into a weird and wonderful world where unknown threats await at every turn of the road. You'll need to forage for food, ammo and weapons if you want to survive. You'll desperately fight off human and mutant enemies in brutal brawls in which your weapons break and your wounds can lead to mutation. You'll meet a cast of strange and memorable characters and find yourself in unexpected situations during story encounters, which force you to make choices that might have consequences down the line. But don't linger long - you need to complete your mission before others do! Your reputation is at stake!\nPosthuman Saga is a competitive, tactical survival adventure set in the post-apocalyptic world of Posthuman for 1 to 4 players. The game can be played in 3 modes: Solo, 2 to 4 players Competitive or Team Versus; where 2 teams of 2 players, each sharing a map, compete for the favour of the Fortress. It combines euro mechanics with finely crafted story to create an experience that will challenge your system-busting skills while immersing you in a rich post-apocalyptic world.  (For a short overview see Gameplay Overview below).\nKey Features\nStories that blend the grit of post-apocalyptic survival with the quirks of human (and mutant!) nature.\nMechanics that are tightly coupled with theme creating an immersive experience. \nModular map tiles and a variety of decks create a sandbox experience where no two games are alike.  \n3 Game modes: Solo, 2-4 Competitive and Team Versus.\nEach Hero has their own starting items and sets of development cards allowing for a variety of possible builds for each character, that suit different playing styles and winning strategies. \nDeep world building and lore that evolve through the various analogue and digital games set in the Posthuman world.\n\nTo win you\u2019ll need to earn reputation points by exploring a map made up of modular tiles and completing Mission Objectives before other players do...\n...and score Recon Objectives made up of sequences of Scavenge Sites.\nGain map tiles through Map actions and bidding in the Broadcast event. \nEach turn you will secretly select one of four Actions to play.\n While exploring you\u2019ll face story encounters\u2026\n\u2026and combat Encounters. In melee combat you perform the following steps:\n1) If you use a weapon discard a durability token then select one combat card and draw another one at random. (The selected one will exhaust after combat). \n2) The enemy rolls combat dice and adds their Combat results.\n 3) Players then resolve the results on the Combat tracker.\n But above all... try to survive out there! \n                                                                                                                                                                      Now also includes:\nand...\nand...\nPosthuman Saga: Exclusive Deluxe Edition\nNow also includes:\n and...\nand...\nPosthuman Saga: Resistance Expansion\nPosthuman Saga: Resistance Expansion continues the overarching story presented in the Base Game taking you deeper into the Wilds to track down Mutant Slave Trains carrying human captives and following them to a Mutant Stronghold.\nPosthuman Saga: Resistance Expansion adds several new mechanics to the Posthuman Saga Base game along with new ways of scoring and winning the game. Resistance also adds a lot of new content, including 2 new Characters, new Followers, new Mission Objectives, new Event cards and the new Veteran Mutant die as well as a new deck of Level 3 Encounters including over 30 stories. \n      \n    To add one or more Add-ons to your pledge, just add the ammount listed on the add-on(s) to your pledge ammount.

Posthuman Saga is a completely different game, not a second edition or re-design of the first game. Please watch the preview videos above for an overview of how the game plays. All the components in Posthuman Saga are different from those of the original Posthuman and the vast majority of the characters and enemies are either new or have been re-drawn.\nAre You a Backer of The First Posthuman Game?  \nThank You! To show our appreciation we are giving away the Posthuman: The Wilds mini expansion for free to the original 5,500 backers of Posthuman when they back at Explorer level or higher. This includes new Events, new Encounters, and 4 characters that made it out of the world of Vengeance alive.

We have learnt a lot from past titles and continue our process of improving our game design, art, product design and component quality. We had a few hiccups in the past with printers and fulfilment partners not living up to our expectations, so we have stopped working with them. Moreover, we are now working with partners that come highly recommended, from our ever-growing network of Kickstarter creator veterans with whom we share knowledge on a regular basis.\n\nWe now have a great manufacturing partner that has done games for major publishers and creators and who has come recommended with impeccable credentials. \n\nPosthuman Saga has been tested by 8 groups in the US, Europe and Asia. A new batch of test groups will be brought in after the end of the Kickstarter to test the final content and then, finally, yet another wave of blind testers will be brought in to blind test the rulebook and the finished product. We are also working with two developers, Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter, Dinosaur Island, Wasteland Express Delivery Service) and Jonathan Harrington (Vengeance) to ensure that the game is as polished as can be when it goes to print.\n\nHaving said all the above there are always things that can come up that will be beyond our control. What we do promise you is that we always put our backers first, and will continue to do so in this campaign.

The setting takes inspiration from the aesthetics of the First World War and interwar period.\nThe system is designed to capture a sense of close combat in trenches, ruins or even whole cities swept away by the total war. Be a small cog in the war machine, survive in military operations with tens of thousands of losses a day. Face the horrors of modern mechanized war, deadly, never-before-seen tanks, the airborne terror of biplanes, the experimental weapons of the future of warfare, forged in constant conflict.\nHowever, this is not the world you know - It is a world of myth and magic, progressed to the diesel age. In other words, your squad can be composed of different fantasy races, where your sergeant can be a formerly enslaved orc or your comrade can be a cursed goblin marauder. In search of a means to break the stalemate of trench warfare, science returned magic from oblivion and tamed it. It changed everything.\nThe last line of defense trying to stop the dreadful technomagically driven flying fortress.\nThe game locations are not limited to trenches on the frontline, this setting allows many types of adventures: be deserters and treasure hunters in the colonies, fight in city ruins or the shadow of tanks the size of a mountain, wage \u201crat war\u201d in sewage networks and subways, or even be the hero of your assault squad in a suicide mission to destroy enemy secret weapons. Your fate is yours to decide: try to survive in war zones, on the frontline or behind enemy lines.\nInterbellum uses a proprietary d6 based system, clearly separating the narrative and combat component of the game and encourages teamwork between sqaudmates.\nWe published our early ruleset for playtesting. The pack includes:\n- Document with rules;\n- Introductory lore document;\n- Tables for rules and few samples of enemies and items;\n- Art pack and test location map for your adventure.\nRemember, these are simplified rules that will evolve and improve based on your feedback.\nCharacter creation resembles that of the classic computer-based RPG\u2019s of the late 90's. The choice of main attributes (Agility, Charisma, Intelligence, Perception, Strength, Vitality) and traits - is all familiar. But the choice of race and faction affects a lot - it determines the attitude of NPCs of other factions and races towards you, and can also give bonuses or penalties. The world is still struggling against slavery, for freedom and equality, therefore the influence of xenophobia and prejudice plays a big role in team building and gameplay.\nEarly sketches of Army Boy mascot in different roles to illustrate attributes.\nAnother important aspect in creating a character is the choice of his class, his profession. The range of choice is quite broad: Officer, Rifleman, Medic, Mage, Technician, Wild Card and others. Each class gives unique perks and the ability to develop class skills. During character creation you can distribute the starting skill points as you like, but during the game it will be limited only to class skills and only they can be developed to the maximum. Of course, there are also will be workarounds for developing skills and changing your class that depend on the narrative and your game master. Also, your selected class gives you a starting free kit of equipment. Depending on the circumstances, you can purchase additional equipment for bonus points. Levelcap limits the development of the character, so you should consider what the character will specialize in.\nHaving created the character and built your own squad with your friends, you will now choose one of the pre-prepared missions or one created by your game master. Since the game takes place in an era of rapid technological advance the time period of the mission significantly affects the complexity, the opponents encountered, and the available equipment. Do not forget - this is the era of the arms race, when every year the war brought new items to the arsenal. If you choose Great War - you can start with bolt action rifles in your hands, and finish commanding airborne tanks on airships. In your hands lies the choice of the battlefield: you can participate in another insane attempt to capture an enemy underground fort like Verdun, or try an adventure in the style of Lawrence of Arabia.\nEach scenario has a map with the main locations. Moving between them, your squad will run into random encounters - some of them will be harmless, others carry danger or even an opponent. The use of technology provides you with a sense of security and fullness, but this is a very controversial pleasure. On the front line this technology is the hope of your detachment, but the first tanks are capricious, unreliable and very slow. Nevertheless, if your mission and the theater of operations allow, you can take a breezy ride on an armored car, which will support you. Combat uses typical turn-based game mechanics that are a bit similar to skirmish wargames.\nKilling enemies and completing missions gives you experience points that allow your character to move to the next level. Each time the player gains a level, he receives several skill points to develop his class skills, and every three levels you can choose a perk. Perks provide an opportunity to further sharpen your character for a certain role in your squad or even acquire magical abilities.\nAndre Lagran - famed Death Brigade veteran, fighting for the Alliance faction. He was one of the last defenders of the Border Line.\nSpecifically, each action and every step in your character\u2019s progress will be very important, the d6 was chosen because of our desire to follow the number 6 in the numerical parameters of attributes, skills, and so on.\nAn important nuance that brings an element of uncertainty into a conventional war is magic and its manifestations. At a camp deep in the rear lines near the forest, you can battle a gang of vampires, unconquered, and ghosts near the mass graves in place of the old battleground - all this is just the beginning. The select few who own the Gift can use the Words of Power, that is, spells. They are dangerous opponents, but their spells depend entirely on their intelligence and the benevolence of the Higher Powers. Much worse is meeting one of the Touched - a poor fellow who has touched by breath of chthonic chaos from outside of this world. These magicians are literally bursting from the eldritch energy boiling inside them, their bodies can mutate, and they themselves do not use spells, they directly try to control the flows of magical energy with random side effects. Where technology falls, magic creates incredible things.\nThe following is a recorded playtest session hosted for roughly 4 hours. It features 4 people, a GM and 3 players casually playing the Interbellum RPG system for the first time. The plot follows 3 soldiers in the Ecumenical Empire who are part of a subpar squad being assigned to a lonely rear echelon outpost in the town of Farbythe, which has been experiencing problems relating to banditry and possible other problems lurking within its territory. Crude language, violent subject matter and general idiocy and shenanigans is found within this video. Viewer discretion is advised.\nInterbellum is a fantasy dieselpunk setting. or rather technomagic. What if the usual fantasy world met the era of the first mechanized wars? A world where magic was forgotten for hundreds of years, rediscovered and used to break the positional stalemate, this led to an arms race that spawned 1000-ton steel beasts on land and in the air, make fortresses airborne or devastate whole cities with a few bombs. A world that replaced typical Evil Lords with dictators, knights with armored vehicles, and guilds with corporations. In this world fears of a trench war can materialize, your neighbors can be werewolf infiltrators, and the ghosts of your fallen comrades in no-man's land terrorize the enemy.\nIstalian Bastion-class landship. 100 tons of perfect engineering.\nUnlike other similar settings, here dieselpunk is dominant, but the fantasy elements serve to deconstruct stereotypes. Of course, magic can be used to create fireballs, teleport and other cool stuff, but the main difference is that magic is used for creating new technologies and machines. In fact, magic used as justification for the typical attributes of a dieselpunk - weird tech, giant vehicles, mutants, etc.\nOn Jule 7, in the year 1404, the Great War began. Beginning for trivial reasons as a conflict between the two superpowers and their satellites, in 9 years of hellish warfare it grew into a global slaughter between four geopolitical blocs. Hundreds of millions of people were involved, many of them died.\nWhile the three superpowers were competing in the race for technical advancement, the fourth superpower collected magical knowledge bit by bit and united them with its own. From the very beginning of the war, the Sidhean Empire was able to surprise everyone by putting hundreds of combat mages on the battlefield. What was considered lost forever, had returned.\nAfter centuries of oblivion, magic and many other fragments of the Old World rose again. Technology tamed the magic and this created a new leap in scientific and technological development, making the previously impossible now possible.\nThe playable period in setting will cover almost 30 years, including the Great War for lovers of epic conflict, and local wars in the post-war period. Your character can begin his story as cannon fodder in a world war, and after it become a revolutionary or a mercenary, if he survives on the battlefield.\nFactions:\nCoalition - a bloc created by one of the oldest and largest human states in the Interbellum world, called the Ecumenical Empire. The imperial interests lie in the domination of Hearthland and creating more satellites. The most industrially advanced faction of the setting, at the expense of the environment, resulting in decaying forests around their smoke-filled megacities. The rigid rule of law and severe punishments are combined with imperial chauvinism, which is a blight on the Empire\u2019s diplomacy, but creates protectionism for their inner policy and trade. The Empire is dominated by materialism and atheism because of the old doctrine that \"all gods are evil, and their priests are tyrants\u201d. After the Great War, the Empire was mired in the civil war and disintegrated into several states during the revolution, but the Coalition remained. The Galrian Republic preserved most of the heritage of the Empire, but brought more freedom at the cost of devastation, bureaucracy, the political demagogy and corruption.\nAlliance - a union of conservative monarchical states clinging to domination in the central region of the world. A forced union of former rivals against a common enemy, compensates for its technological backwardness with a development balance between agriculture and industry. Having lost almost a quarter of its population in the Great War, in the post-war period it was almost split from within by crumbling empires and national liberation movements. Constant riots, insurrections and civil wars, mass poverty amid the luxury and wealth of untouchable despotic aristocrats all cast challenges on the young Alliance, which consists entirely of contradictions.\nNorthern League - a self-isolated and mystic bloc of races, nations and countries, united as satellites around the totalitarian elven state, the oldest known race. Forged by constant conflicts with mankind and remembrance of old grudges, northern elves spent more than a thousand years studying artifacts and restoring the knowledge of the Forerunner race, multiplying their magical skills while in the rest of the world technology supplanted the magic. This is the most fantastical and magic-heavy faction of the setting, almost exclusively having full access to fancy magic stuff. Their lag in industrial strength is balanced out by enchanted weapons and technomagic devices, for example, they can raise old fortresses in the air. Dragon-bombers? Check. Trolls with hand cannons? Check. Troopers with magic rayguns? Check. Machines made of living metal, fueled by the dying person imprisoned in them? Oh, boy\u2026\nAlbian Commonwealth - a bloc of formally independent satellites ruled by the Albian Empire. It is an island-based colonial power, ruling the seas and controlling a large portion of international trade, as well as the development and exploitation of Aborigines in the colonies. Slavery, class and racial segregation are also flourishing in the Commonwealth. However, if you were born a free person in the Commonwealth, then you have many ways to find your place in life. Once in the past, Albia was just a distant province of the Ecumenical Empire, splitting from it during the Dark Ages. Separatists formed a political system around the union of guilds, traders, mercenaries and pirates, which allowed them to capitalize on their advantageous geographical position and control the main oceanic trade routes. They also started a era of great geographical discoveries.\nYou can also read parts of the lore on our Patreon page.\nThis Kickstarter goes towards finishing the game and producing the Interbellum RPG as a digital product. Basically, the game will come out as set of two PDF books (Player\u2019s book and Game Master\u2019s book), 200+ pages in total. The player book will consist of a basic ruleset, character archetypes, equipment lists and introduction to the setting. The master's book will contain game mechanics for the wizard, adventure scenarios and the hidden part of the game's lore - various secrets of the setting that you can use to create your own adventures. Most of the illustrations will be black and white, only a handful will be colored. Also, as bonus will come downloadable and printable player\u2019s lists.\nStarting with the Officer tier, you can get an artbook that will contain canonical illustrations and sketches. All drawings will be supplied with signatures and a history of the origin and design selection, This will give a deeper plunge into the setting.\nSince Kickstarter does not allow the editing of tier descriptions if they already have backers, we will announce the changes personally:\nAt the request of the people, we upgrade the final tier, now it will contain the reward from the previous War Hero tier (using the backer\u2019s appearance for a character in the book).\nVolunteer tier after the release of the game will receive a coupon to pay only for the printing and delivery of a softcover book.\nOfficer tier and higher will receive a coupon for the hardcover book. This will be done through DriveThruRPG and their Print-on-Demand service.\n$4000 - REACHED!\n\u00abTank Warfare\u00bb expansion - a detailed ruleset for tank warfare and the tanker class, special scenarios of tank battles and mechanized warfare, with a wide range of additional armored vehicles for each faction.

In addition, new scenarios for adventurers. Break into the pyramid and fight against curse of the ancient kings? Stop military experiments with summoned demons and legions of the undead? Meet dark gods and realize your own insignificance? Yes, all this will be here.\n$8000\n\u00abCrimson Tides\u00bb expansion - naval operations, amphibious machines, new regions and scenarios for deserters and simply adventurers in colonies and remote places. New races too: amphibian Xsotls, Nagas and other reptiloid species. In addition, all or most illustrations will be fully coloured.\nSince we understand that we are not big names in the gaming industry, our needs are very low. $3000 is the minimum required for the starter edition with minimal content and some simplified mechanics (tank battles for example). It is impossible to cover the entire large setting in the first book, so we are starting with a small goal. The game will be released in English and Russian languages.\nOur calculations for the expenditure of received funds:\n10% - commission expenses, KS and Stripe share.\n15% - for editing of texts and formatting content into PDF books.\n50% - for the artists work, i.e. creating illustrations.\n25% - for game design.\nOur team consists of many people who worked or somehow participate in game industry Some of us have already have a few released or still developed games. However, this is our first experience with tabletop games.\nOur key team members:\nMaxim Krylov aka Watcher - main author and game designer. Bio and details on Linkedin page.\nConnor Douglas aka Mindtraveller - young game designer who studies in Savannah College of Art and Design.\nVasily Khazykov aka TugoDoomer - well known as artist for such projects as Insomnia: The Ark, Total Extinction and Hydrophilia tabletop wargames and etc.\nIf you have ideas, questions or business proposals concerning my work - just write to us or in comments section.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, but some of our team members worked on various games, and the game is already far along in development. We also have a fallback source of capital to cover things if real disaster strikes, ensuring we will deliver so long as civilization persists.\n\nWe certainly did not promise unfulfillable goals and rewards. It has long been known that there are some indie developers who promise too much, such as printed books or similar material awards, It is often difficult to calculate physical delivery obligations, so we only offer digital content. Perhaps, if we reach several stretch goals, then we will think about printing soft-cover rulebooks, but not earlier.\n\nWe expect that we will be able to complete the development in one year. Half a year will be spent on completing the development of rules and their testing, the next six months will be devoted to the creation of missions, scenarios, their maps, printed templates and other content, and their testing too. Of course, we can give more optimistic promises like \u201cwe will do this in 6-8 months\u201d, but we look soberly at the development process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Cannon Fodder", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nInterbellum PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["271 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Volunteer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nInterbellum PDF\nAccess to early rulesets and drafts during development", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["58 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Officer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nInterbellum PDF\nAccess to early rulesets and drafts during development\nInterbellum artbook PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["126 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "War Hero", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nInterbellum PDF\nAccess to early rulesets and drafts during development\nInterbellum artbook PDF\nYour appearance can be used for characters and their illustration", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Death Squad Trooper", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nInterbellum PDF\nAccess to early rulesets and drafts during development\nInterbellum artbook PDF\nExclusively made adventure for your squad", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "4 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "March 2021 update", "update_content": "Hello folks!

In No Thank You, Evil!, each player creates a character based on a couple of cool, descriptive, imagination-firing traits. The Guide (a special role often played by a parent or older sibling) presents a dilemma, and the players set off on an adventure of the imagination. Along the way they use their character\u2019s special skills, companions, and equipment to overcome obstacles\u2014perhaps fighting a slime monster, winning over the suspicious mayor, or beating a rabbit at a race. Whereas conventional board games constrain players\u2019 actions, No Thank You, Evil! sets kids\u2019 imaginations free: Their options are limited only by what they can think up. Together, the players create a story as they work together to make their way through the adventure. \nNo Thank You, Evil! contains everything you need to play, all in a beautiful, sturdy box designed to be easy for children to use. It includes:\nNo Thank You, Evil! rulebook\nLet's Go On An Adventure! adventure book\nFive dice (because sharing is hard!)\nCharacter sheets\nCards for characters, creatures, and cyphers\nGame tokens\nNo Thank You, Evil! was released in March 2016. This Kickstarter campaign is funding a reprint of the game, as well as some additional products.\nFor the Little Kids, the Grown-ups, and Everyone in Between\nYounger kids frustrate easily when a game is too complex for them to master. Older children quickly grow bored by games that are too simple or that strike them as below their level.\nNo Thank You, Evil! is great fun for kids as young as five years old. But it\u2019s also great fun for the rest of family\u2014adults included!\u2014because the scalable rules adapt easily to the abilities of the player. A six-year-old might play, for example, a Princess. An eight-year-old might play a Super Smart Princess. A ten-year-old might create a Super Smart Princess who Experiments With Science. Each of these stages adds a level of sophistication to how the game is played\u2014but all of these characters play around the same table in the same game. After a game or two with the grown-ups, a twelve-year-old might even run games for the other kids!\nThe gameplay rules are easy for novice or young players to grasp, but nuanced and flexible enough for older kids and grown-ups to enjoy just as much. Here's a brief look at how the rules work:\nEnter Storia: The Land Next Door\nNo Thank You, Evil! is set in Storia: The Land Next Door. It\u2019s a world seen through children\u2019s eyes, home to all the elements of kids\u2019 imaginations: Dragons and dinosaurs, faeries and elves, race cars and robots, and all sorts of fanciful creatures. Players\u2019 characters in No Thank You, Evil! are kids who have been specially chosen to help save Storia from evil. Accompanied by their companions and their handy I Gotchyer Back packs (living creatures that carry the characters\u2019 cool stuff in their bellies), characters venture into Storia to save the day!\nFor more detailed info on the setting, game rules, and characters, visit the No Thank You, Evil! website.\nWhen we came up with the idea for No Thank You, Evil! back in 2015, we weren\u2019t sure if anyone would be interested in it. A family roleplaying game designed around immersion, inclusion, and being awesome together? We knew it was a risk, but it was one we were passionate about taking.\nIt turns out that risk was worth it, more so than we could have imagined. We heard so many stories from families and organizations that warmed our hearts. Tales of unicorns and knights, of dragon snot, dinosaurs, and ninjas. But most of all, tales of families coming together, sometimes across time and space, to tell stories together.\nIn fact, so many families and groups have told so many stories, that the game\u2019s print run has now sold out. We have a few copies left at the MCG online store, but we\u2019ll be out of those soon and we have none left to ship to stores. But demand is as high as ever!\nSo, why a Kickstarter?\nYou\u2019ll Have Your Game Sooner. If we were using a traditional reprint model, we wouldn\u2019t see a reprint until next year. This way, as soon as the Kickstarter closes, we will have the money to print your games, ensuring that there won\u2019t be a large lag time (and we won\u2019t run out at retail stores). You\u2019ll have your games this year.\nNew Stuff! A Kickstarter allows us to offer new items for players (which is something that people have been asking for\u2014and we want to make that happen!).\nDoing Good. With a Kickstarter, we can offer a special backer level to organizations and schools that are using No Thank You, Evil! to work with students on improving their social skills, dealing with trauma, and overcoming grief. This is something that\u2019s near and dear to our hearts, and the business model of Kickstarter makes that possible. (See the bottom of this Kickstarter for a list of some of the fantastic organizations and groups that are using No Thank You, Evil!).\nEnjoy special downloadable deliveries, brought to you by Storia\u2019s renowned delivery service, BEE MAIL! This reward gets you three PDFs worth of new content, delivered digitally starting in July and running through the end of 2018.\nEach PDF will include a brand-new adventure, as well as additional goodies, such as new creatures, pregenerated characters, props, and more. Kids will love getting special messages directly from their friend Woodlynn the Queen Bee, inviting them to Storia for even more exciting adventures.\nAnd if your reward includes BEE MAIL!, you also get any additional BEE MAIL! digital stretch goals that we reach during this campaign.\nWORKING WITH KIDS This level is just for schools, libraries, counselors, and organizations that work with (or want to start working with) young people via tabletop gaming. Please note: this discount is only for the above-mentioned groups. We will ask for official credentials at the time of fulfillment. You get two copies of No Thank You, Evil! at a special discounted price. You can add additional copies, and any of the existing supplements, at the same discount.\nRETAILERS The AWESOME RETAILER level is a flexible way for you to decide how many copies of No Thank You, Evil! are right for your store, and to avoid tying up your cash between now and release. Your pledge is a down payment for an order to be placed, at a retail-friendly discount, when the No Thank You, Evil! reprint is ready to ship. You can choose as many copies as you like. You\u2019ll pay for your order (less your $60 deposit) at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them before distributors do, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately, so it's a great way to ensure you're stocked up for the holiday season this fall. MCG covers domestic US shipping.\nTHE SUPPLEMENTS Since the launch of No Thank You, Evil! in 2016 we've released three additional titles that expand your game experience with creatures, story-building tools, adventures, game components, and even advice teaching kids to become Guides.\nStory, Please! Journey into Storia in adventures of your own design. Combine an engaging STORY card with one or more cool PLACE and PERSON cards to outline your quest. Then give your adventure a surprising TWIST, and maybe some fun and useful STUFF. There are even maps and handouts! Pick cards, draw them at random, or mix and match. Create a great story with all the details you need\u2014in minutes!\nUh-Oh, Monsters! Set out into adventure with this boxed expansion. The Lairs and Scares book contains four complete adventures, great for novice Guides and players or those who are looking for some more advanced challenges. The Claws and Paws book details nearly fifty creatures to encounter in Storia, along with advice on making your own monsters, details on the Monster Museum, and companions and character options. You also get loads of player handouts, creature cards, and even nifty creature standups!\nCharacter and creature standups from Uh-Oh, Monsters! and I'm a Guide!\nI'm a Guide! A hands-on, step-by-step kit for kids who are ready to take on the role of a Guide. Easy-to-follow instructions help kids run a simple adventure, learning along the way so they can go on to run more advanced stories, or even make up their own\u2014and achieve a wild success at being a Guide! And that\u2019s not all: You also get a bunch of great stuff for helping Guides explore Storia, including a storybook, a coloring book, and two dozen character standups.\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase the amount of your pledge by the appropriate amount. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for.\nSince the game is already developed and ready-to-go, we can start printing as soon as the Kickstarter closes. Additional products will begin design and development at that point as well. \n\nIf you're new to No Thank You, Evil!, we will ship the game and expansions as soon as the game is ready. If you already have the No Thank You, Evil! basic box, we will ship your expansions in July.\nREWARD FULFILLMENT Soon after this Kickstarter campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.\nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll send you an email with a coupon code to redeem them. You decide when to use the coupon, and give us your correct shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of some and bundle them together if that\u2019s more convenient for you (or you'd like to save on international shipping costs). We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE* Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is NOT included in your pledge. You will be charged shipping at the time of reward redemption. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you, since you will not be charged importing/customs fees.\n* The UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK or Europe: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $52, you\u2019ll pay $42. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.\nRESOURCE LIST\nLooking for some fantastic organizations and groups that are using No Thank You, Evil! and other games with young people?\nBodhana Group is a nonprofit organization that advocates the use of tabletop gaming as a directed therapeutic and clinical practice that can benefit personal growth as well as enhance social and educational services to individuals and families.\nRPG Research is a nonprofit organization that uses a research-driven approach to create inclusive and accessible programs that measurably improve people\u2019s lives through music and roleplaying games.\nGame to Grow is a nonprofit organization that offers weekly therapeutic social skills groups help young people become more confident, creative, and socially capable using tabletop games.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the eleventh Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

Its ok, we aliens are not judging. Just experimenting. Mostly on how to not be bored, you humans are so much fun. We kidnapped this designer to help us create a board game simulation we can delight in. In the simulation, we left some of our wicked alien tech on Earth and Earth humans built a city around it. Amazingly, these humans even learned to misuse and merge some of our devices with their clockwork toys. Well, that\u2019s a recipe for catastrophe. Anyway, you humans are doomed.\nEach character has a unique set of ability cards.\nStarting up, you take control of a human adventurer (or adventuring gorilla) with a unique set of abilities and character board. You will perform all activities via a unique action building mechanic that allows you to upgrade your actions every turn - deciding between an immediate or long-term benefit.\nThe unique action mechanic allows you to improve and activate an action column each turn.\nYour adventurer will enter a randomly generated city consisting of big cardboard tiles and face down secret location cards. Some of these locations may contain events, change the mood of your character, contain secret information, or offer other opportunities.\nVisited locations are placed under your influence. A cube is placed to mark the location, which can be exploited later.\nThey say it\u2019s fun to explore these unique locations and do human things, like drinking or picking up junk from the street.\nItem modifications in game.\nYou will merge the junk and tech to make your own devices and perform new actions, combos, or even more intense human stuff -- like interaction with other animals or humans. These individuals open even more gameplay options and offer quests that reward insight and renown.\nCivilian cards provide special passive and active abilities. Complete their quests to reward insight and renown.\nEventually, an alpha human will decode our alien ciphers, making them the least favorite human to other players, because they will have won the game and also triggered the apocalypse.\nDecoding the cipher tablets brings renown and victory in competitive mode.\nIn cooperative mode, you humans may vaguely realize your mistakes and band together to face the impending doom. You will now need to work together in order to deal with crises appearing on the map; and our terrible mechanization pylons that are turning the civilians.\nThe alien pylon is defended by mechanized and a civilian is about to get eaten. Also, the area is on fire.\nYou will attempt - and miserably fail - to destroy the pylons, battle our minions and rescue the civilians while trying to deal with crisis cards appearing on the map.\nCo-op relics and a ruins token\nIt is amusing how you humans think you have found a way to destroy the pylons by using our own artifacts. We let you do that from time to time, because surely, it is not just another trap to keep us entertained...\nWhy do we think this game is special?\nNear infinite replayability, delivered through 200+ cards, the majority of which are unique. \nSimple rules, but a lot of depth resulting from an original action building system.\nCharacter mood mechanic. \nItem upgrade mechanic that allows for connecting and customizing items. \nTwo modes: Cooperative and Competitive.\nUnique theme with illustrations done by a single artist. \nHumor.\n\n\nGameplay Videos\nPlease watch these non-indoctrinated earth human videos learn more about the game:\nThis one we abducted tortured, brainwashed and brought back. Now he believes that we paid him to do this preview video : D\nWe created the game with dark matter, but we want your human dollars in order to produce this in cardboard and wood.

The pack will include at least 10 cards, but the content of the pack as well as content of the game box will increase with unlocked stretch goals.\nEXCLUSIVITY INFORMATION\nThis is a Kickstarter only project and the final product is very unlikely to appear in general distribution. A limited quantity of games will be produced to serve the backers and SPIEL 2018 fair.\nThe engineer. Work in progress.\nThe games will be shipped from within EU.\nCurrently the game is in a state more advanced than the prototypes that were reviewed in the videos. It\u2019s in a good shape but we are still filling the game with content and tweaking the mechanics for the best balance and smoothest possible experience. We will work on the game until the date it is handed down for print. We are intent on delivering the games for the 2018 SPIEL in Germany, as an early pick-up option. The remaining copies will be delivered in December 2018 or early 2019.\nPlease note that worldwide shipping cost is included in all pledges, except for the Essen pickup option.\nEvery early bird backer and SPIEL pickup option backer will have a chance to sign up for an alien abduction event. All the voluntary human names will be displayed on the inner sides of the game box. If alien abduction is not your thing, then do not worry. At the end of the campaign you will simply not put your name in the survey in order to skip this and make the alien probe droid sad. The aliens may feed you badly and place antennas in you, but the database hologram looks pretty cool on the cardboard so you might consider it worth it.\nBeautiful Disaster Games is a one-person company run by the designer, Tomek Stasiak, who self publishes his games in his home country of Poland. After the successful release of Assault on Doomrock and its expansion, Tom teamed up again with Bartosz Plawecki to create a brand-new title with an original theme.

Lost in thought, you remember the first time you came across a Spanish Galleon. Few of you managed to escape that mess with your lives, but that marked the moment when you began forging your destiny as a pirate. Now, your reputation precedes you wherever you go, instilling fear among your enemies. Nothing will get in your way of becoming the most infamous pirate to ever sail the high seas\u2026\nMake your own destiny and become the terror of the seas in Skull Tales: Full Sail!\nSkull Tales: Full Sail! is a pirate adventures board game with miniatures. Set sail on the Southern Lady and explore the beautiful Caribbean sea, ripe with fearsome enemies and amazing treasures. Fame and fortune await you!\nChoose among twelve starting characters, each one with its own unique miniature, to be used on the different boards as you play through the game. Find all the information you need to start playing on their character sheets.\nIn Skull Tales: Full Sail! You\u2019ll be able to play individual scenarios or embark upon an immersive campaign that threads several different scenarios together into one captivating storyline.\nSkull Tales, created by David Illescas, is a semi-cooperative game for 1-5 players aged 14 and up. The approximate playing time in Campaign Mode is between 60-90 minutes for one scenario and about 150 minutes for a complete chapter (Voyage, Adventure and Port). The game also includes 52 miniatures - not counting stretch goals!\nDuring the Voyage Phase, which simulates being on a pirate ship, we\u2019ll be managing the crew that makes up our ship while we explore the map on the way towards our objective...or objectives! But, the Captain might have a hidden agenda that he/she is keeping from the rest of the crew\u2026\nThroughout this phase, characters will take on different jobs: steering the ship, managing boarding actions, cleaning up, or even fighting sea creatures. The idea is to gain the confidence of the crew, which will depend on where you place your character and how good he/she is at dealing with all the dangerous events you\u2019ll be facing together. The Captain will be able to assign different tasks to the crewmembers, but watch out - the other pirates can conspire against him/her!\nUnfortunately, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of things that can negatively affect crew's morale: hunger, losing battles, unexpected events, etc. If morale suffers too much, another pirate can organize a mutiny to take over the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges\u2026\nCharacters will earn Trust Points as they carry out duties on the ship, and these points will turn into Prestige Points once the Voyage phase comes to an end. This way, your pirate will start to gain a fearsome reputation!\nIn the Adventure Phase you\u2019ll explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, and abandoned temples. You\u2019ll also have the chance to pillage colonial villas and find legendary objects. However, there are frightening creatures and challenging enemies to face along the way.\nThe Adventure map develops as terrain tiles appear randomly according to the specifications of the scenario, making each game different!\nOn the Adventure board you\u2019ll be able to see how much time you have left to carry out the mission, as well as the current danger level\u2026\nEnemies have cards that outline their characteristics and a corresponding miniature. Also, every opponent you face will have a behavior or AI that generates reactions at unpredictable times, making each adventure a challenge.\nIn the Port Phase your character can acquire new abilities and equipment by interacting with the residents of Tortuga Island and visiting its different locations. But be careful, this place hides secrets that can make a pirate\u2019s fate take a turn for the worst.\nEach player will have time units they\u2019ll use to carry out actions, while making sure they are ready to go when the ship sets sail: heal wounds, learn abilities, make bets, listen out for rumors, equip and improve the ship, etc. Each location has an Event Deck, and there are also independent decks for Rumors and Captain Assignments.\nThe following list has everything initially included in the base game, not counting components that may have been unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe base game box also comes with a quick-start 10 chapter campaign (Campaign I) and a couple of special scenarios.\nThe new Skull Tales miniatures have been completely remodeled and will be made with a high quality plastic that is flexible, easy to paint, and allows for more clearly detailed figures. We have already started testing and the results are spectacular.\nThe scale of the miniatures is approximately 30-32mm up to the eye-line and not including the base.\n (Images courtesy from Icue)\nPIRATE contest! (Unlocked): Share videos, photos or audio files of your family and friends with a pirate theme. If we get 200 interactions, between Twitter & Facebook, we will include a sliding chest box to store our booty (80x80x50mm) for all the backers of the game. Additionally, we will include a new Journey card dedicated to the crew of the best submission, as well as a gift for the winning crew.\nFor more information.\nFor more information: See all our booty: the first 46 Stretch Goals.\n$431000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New Enemy: Amazons (6 miniatures). They were strong, muscular women with a height that surpassed our tallest men. They seemed taken by some strange trance, as their rage was supernatural\u2026 The true Amazonians arrive, whose legend gave name to one of the most famous rivers in the world. These warrior princesses are willing to fight to the last woman, and woe the man who stands in their way! 6 Amazonian miniatures with enemy card.\n$438000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New cards for the incident deck, adding 4 new dangers to our adventures.\n$445000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): We are changing four small tile designs into two large tile designs to give scenarios more variety. This double-sided tile is like the Village tiles in that it is 4 times bigger than the smaller ones.\n$460000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New Enemy: Stranglers (4 miniatures). We came ashore in the midst of a frightful fog \u2013 you could barely see your hand in front of your face. The vast mounds of seaweed were beyond anything natural, suggesting that the tide in this area was stronger and pulled any marine life from the depths of the sea onto the beaches. When the seaweed began to move, I felt as though someone was strangling me to death. Fear overcame me, especially when I saw our pistols did little damage against the shapes covered in seaweed. Another enemy comes to join the rest of the abominations. On this occasion, we\u2019re releasing 4 Strangler miniatures and their enemy card.\n$467000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards (2 models). You won\u2019t believe the beauty that I found on the last galley captured by the Brotherhood\u2026 Our market keeps on receiving new merchandise to equip your pirates with the best against their enemies. 2 x Light Blunderbuss: able to fire at adjacent enemies, but with a shorter range than pistols. 2 x Poison Vials: choose a melee weapon at the beginning of the adventure. That weapon inflicts an additional wound.\n$487000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Tarantula Anansi (Giant miniature). And Anansi came from the shadows, wrapping that pirate up in a cocoon of silk, making quick work of the poor lad\u2026 The powerful tarantula Anansi has arrived to Skull Tales: Full Sail! the Caribbean will never be safe with the presence of this supernatural beast. This time, we\u2019re adding an enemy that brings new game mechanics with enemies that take up four spaces. The Tarantula Anansi is represented by a miniature the size of 4 spaces, and comes with her corresponding enemy card.\n$494000 (Unlocked, Base Game): 5 Port Events. The chapel was quieter than usual, the silence falling over the silhouettes as they brought their offerings. This didn\u2019t feel right\u2026 Five new events to add variety to the Port Phase.\n$509000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Campaign V complete. The Brotherhood has received what at first was thought to be a Royal order. After the initial refusal to carry it out, it has become an ultimatum. They have been accused of being behind a series of supernatural events that is reducing the free labor population in the colonies and negatively affecting profits from the slave trade. Either the Brotherhood takes charge of solving this mystery, or the British Empire will bring down all its might upon Tortuga Isle. The only clue that we have involves the appearance, however strange, of huge amounts of spider webs after each event\u2026\n$516000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards. You have asked us on many occasions and our armorer has listened\u2026we\u2019re adding one more copy of the Net, Hook, Bandoleer, and Shovel cards.\n$530000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Character: Swordsman.  \"He spent years searching for his mother\u2019s assassin. But, although he is a master fencer, his sanity is fading away, and he now spends most of his day accusing anyone who crosses his path: \u201cYou killed my mother... prepare to die!\"\nWe\u2019re going to add 6 Final Boss designs to the enemy cards. Each boss will have its own personalized characteristics with different behaviors and abilities. Tlanchana, the queen of the mermaids; Oggum, herald of Yemay\u00e1; Charles Vane, Captain of the Black Sails; and Anansi, the avatar tarantula. We kept rummaging through our last treasure chest and we\u2019ve found a pack of more than 5 cards that are being added to the ones already unlocked. What surprises are to be found on these cards?\nGo to your pledge, use the \"manage my pledge\" button and manually add the amount of US$ for everything you would like to add.

The teachings we have now are woefully out of date and never touch on ways to depict more that what lies on the surface. \nNot Just another \"How to\" Book.\nTutorial on hair\nHow to Draw Black People isn't a book where artists are provided with facial grids and examples of modelesque people, with some cool poses to try and emulate. \n\nWhile there will be step by step guides artists are accustomed to, this book will include entire sections devoted to: \nAnatomy\nFacial anatomy  \nFacial expressions\nHair\nSkin tone\nCostuming \nCulture and customs \nAnd within these sections we delve deeper into things like colorism, fatphobia, gender expression, and how all these things play into visualizing black characters. Everything cited and sourced, all the research done so artists can trust the info or hopefully use it as a starting point learn more.   \nCrowdfunded and Crowd Sourced. \nWhile I will supply the bulk of tutorials and tips provided in the book multiple talented artists will also give their take on how to approach each topic; how to apply what's being highlighted in different styles, and give their own take on what they believe is important when it comes to creating diverse characters. \n\nAlso in the book will be a wealth of photo reference for artists to take advantage. A compilation of everyday black folks across the African diaspora. Special attention will be paid to the differences between drawing someone from the west indies, Ethiopia, Brazil or South Africa. \nLearn how to depict culture instead of stereotypes \n Artists often feel like they don't know what will draw the ire of a socially conscious community, and they are right; they don't know. Artists are taught by and large to copy but rarely to intuit. Art courses require us to recreate and translate without necessarily understanding the subject. \n\nThat lack of understanding is the cause for a lot of anxiety and unintended strife between audiences and artists. \n\nThe hope is that by focusing on culture, comparing and contrasting the differences between the acceptable and the offensive, artists can better themselves. This book will help artists of all levels create more meaningful, authentic diversity and representation. \n\nBack \"How to Draw Black People\" today and make this crucial resource for artists a reality.

The game features highly detailed miniatures and the Modular Deck System (MDS) introduced in Street Masters. In the game, players take on the role of heroic cops inspired by classic action movies and are tasked with protecting the city from the recent rise in criminal activity. Each game is dictated by the chosen criminal deck and case deck. These decks are modular and the different combinations of decks create unique experiences each game.\nThe game is played on a beautifully illustrated board of the city, where the cops must run or drive to various locations and bust up crimes. While cops start the game with a standard issue B.C.P.D. Cruiser, they can also commandeer many other types of vehicles on the streets of Brook City.\nEach cop in Brook City plays differently thanks to each having their own unique cop deck. Cop decks include encounter cards, ability cards, and tactic cards to represent each cop\u2019s unique strengths and strategy to take on the criminals underworld.\nWhile the cops try to crack the case, their prime suspect is represented by the criminal deck. Each criminal deck contains at least 1 suspect card, as well as a slew of crime cards that spawn crew members around the city to interfere with your detective work. If cops ignore these criminal masterminds while trying to pin the crime on them, things may just get seriously out of hand\u2026\nCase decks represent the cops\u2019 overall goal of the game. While keeping the criminal under control, they must also concentrate on working their way through the case. Each case has special rules governing how cops can interact with clue cards and get their hands on enough evidence to bring the criminal to justice. In addition to clue cards, case decks include a variety of events that are designed to hinder the cops or punish them for not making enough progress solving the case.\nYou don\u2019t have to take our word on how the game plays. Please click HERE to read a draft of the rulebook.\nBrook City features a variety of highly detailed miniatures, which are used to mark the location of the cops, criminals, and crew throughout the city. With our experience producing miniatures in our previous game, Street Masters, we are confident in the level of detail and overall quality of the miniatures that will be in this game. While we were extremely happy with the miniatures in Street Masters, we learned some tricks to improve them even more for Brook City.\n         Blacklist Games is committed to publishing only high quality games. Please watch this video of Adam and Brady unboxing a production copy of Street Masters:\nAs you can see from the video, great care was taken to ensure every component was of the best quality possible. Backers of this campaign can feel confident that the same amount of care and attention to detail will be taken with Brook City as well.\nLike many other publishers, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to to you all since final shipping sizes are unpredictable with a growing campaign. Plus this gives more room to pool into stretch goals and as much cool gameplay stuff as we possibly can.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Following, is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. ($30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.)\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $15-20 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia).\nOCEANIA: $15-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. AFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries. $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. $60 to Iceland and Israel. $45 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Due to that we will not ship to these areas.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing our successful campaign for Street Masters: Rise of the Kingdom, we've taken what we've learned from production, shipping and fulfillment to strive for an even smoother experience from start to finish, continuing to focus on overall quality.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts from the Kickstarter, production, manufacture, to fulfillment, then distribution. Timing seems to be one of the biggest obstacles in many campaigns, especially from small, indie publishers such as ourselves. Fortunately, we've got experienced game designers working hard to ensure the gameplay offers the best experience it can be; we have strong relations with the factory/manufacture; we have a shipment/fulfillment company already signed on; we are completely passionate about our games; and most important, we care about our backers.\n\nWe also understand there may still be confusion about our first campaign, as it was a card game that we cancelled. It didn't receive the momentum it needed due to us purchasing the rights from a publisher that has not had much luck in the industry. Currently we're developing an app for the game and tightening up some of the original rules and cards in order to release it under our brand at a future date. Doing this will give us the time we need to ensure that the game will make a great edition to our library as well as yours.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 89 or more", "title": "Rookie Tier", "descp": "Included is the Core Game designed by Adam and Brady Sadler with 51 miniatures, 341 cards, a beautiful game board of Brook City, custom dice, and all Unlocked Stretch Goals!\nINCLUDES:\nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\nBrook City \"Core\" Game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["125 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "Officer Tier", "descp": "Included is the Core Game designed by Adam and Brady Sadler plus the Exclusive \"Keys to the Kingdom\" expansion that stars Ying Hua and Ah Long (from Street Masters) in a unique storyline that brings you even more content and even 3 crossover cards that make their Brook City version playable in Street Masters!

Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required.

All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components. \n\nWith this project, the rules are currently in testing and will require more playtesting, however we have a dedicated team of playtesters to help with this. Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

Featuring characters from SpongeBob Squarepants, Invader Zim, Hey Arnold!, and Rugrats!\nIn Splat Attack, players will take control of a team of 4 characters, grab a hand of food cards, and load up their team with Cool Points. Cool Points range in value from 0 to 3 points, and can be stolen from your characters when they get hit with food! However, additional Cool Points can be collected by reaching key locations on the game board.\nWhen hit with food, splat tokens must be placed on the defending character. Placing these tokens strategically will be key to your success, as your character's grid space is limited. Once a character's grid is fill, the character is splatted and out of the game.\nPlayers that are able to get the last hit in and splat a character, earn a golden Cool Point. Once the last golden Cool Point is taken, the game ends, and all players add up their Cool Points to determine a winner.\nEach team is fighting to have the most Cool Points at the end of a Food Fight!  \nEach turn, you can activate two different characters, and those characters can each perform two actions.   \nA MOVE action allows a character to move a number of spaces equal to their SPEED rating.  \nA GATHER Action allows a character to draw 2 food cards and pick up any Cool Point tokens they find in their space!  \nA THROW action allows a character to throw food at a rival character! Some Food cards have special effects and abilities! \nYou can Throw food at any opponent within your Range. Roll a number of dice equal to that food card\u2019s Splat Rating plus your character\u2019s Aim Rating. \nIf you roll at least 1 Hit Result the throw hits the target! Your target must pull a splatter tile from the bag matching the food card\u2019s splat rating. \nThe target must place that splatter tile on their character grid. They must cover 1 space for each hit result the throwing character rolled.  \nThen, take 1 Cool Point token from the target. However, if the target\u2019s grid is completely full, or they can\u2019t fit the tile on their grid, the target is SPLAT and you gain a SUPER Cool Point token instead!    \nOnce the last Super Cool point token is claimed, the game ends! The player with the most points at the end wins!  \nGame play tips from game designer Jonathan Ying:\nNickeoldeon's Splat Attack is a frantic game of throwing food and scoring points, but there can be a method to the madness if you can play strategically. Given that it\u2019s a free for all game it can often be a wise course of action to focus on not making too many enemies or being perceived as too great a threat! The last thing you want is to have other players teaming up against you.\nTemporary alliances can be very useful if you can get your rivals to work with you to take down a player who seems to be running away with the game. Many characters have special abilities that allow them to assist their teammates, like how Phoebe can use her ability to protect her friends. But remember, you can also use her ability to help out a character on a different team to prevent another opponent from scoring or perhaps as leverage to discourage the player you helped from attacking you in the future!\nBe wary of stacking up Danger tokens, they allow you to perform some pretty incredible feats, but they make your character a much juicier target! Also, when you take a hit from an opponent who is behind, it might be a good idea to let them take a danger token or two from your grid. That way they won't ALL go to the player who ends up splatting you!\nCharacter and Team play tips from Jonathan Ying:\nYou should learn your team\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and position accordingly. Each character has a number of unique abilities that can synergize in interesting ways. For example, Arnold\u2019s ability to allow his allies to perform additional actions is very useful when both Helga and Gerald can do unique tricks when they Throw food.\nBefitting a seasoned fry-cook, Spongebob Squarepants is a versatile character who can both move fast and draw food cards quickly for his team, Meanwhile, Sandy is a dangerous opponent in close quarters with her mastery of Kay-Rah-Tay. Use Patrick\u2019s ability to shove rival characters closer to Sandy and use Squidward\u2019s bad luck to your advantage by having him soak up splatter tiles and keep his allies fresh for longer.\nThose Rugrats are always finding their way into crazy adventures! Tommy\u2019s bonus action is an incredibly useful tool for giving his team an edge, he\u2019s the only character who can reliably perform THREE attacks in a given round. To supplement his otherwise low skill ratings (I mean, to be fair, he\u2019s one year old.) Suzie can use her ability to assist in his mobility while Angelica can steal food from nearby characters!\nZim\u2019s team is all about hitting hard and causing chaos for their opponents. GIR is the fastest character in the game and can charge into the enemy ranks while Zim, Dib and Gaz throw a barrage of snack foods into the mix. You\u2019ll want to get Zim into position quickly so he can perform his bonus attacks at the end of your turn, meanwhile Dib requires some careful play to tempo his unique action economy. Gaz is your trump card, she\u2019s a solid character for your backline but after she\u2019s taken a few hits and lost her Cool (points) she\u2019ll go berserk and wreak havoc with incredibly high mobility, range, and accuracy!\nPLEASE NOTE: All backers that have selected retailer pledges will be required to have to provide our fulfillment hub with a store address in order to recieve their pledge.  \nHey Arnold! - Character Art\nRugrats - Character Art\nSpongeBob SquarePants - Character Art\nInvader Zim - Character Art\n Game Designer - Jonathan Ying\nJonathan Ying is a game designer and author currently operating out of San Diego California.

(This is your chance to participate in this celebration!) \nMissed the campaign? You can enter our Late Pledge Manager by clicking the above image. The Late Pledge Manager opens May 8th, and supplies are limited.\nNow the whole Street Fighter Universe is literally at your fingertips! What are you waiting for?!  \nHelp Ryu on his journey to surpass all Stretch Goals! Each one we unlock is added to your pledge for Free! We've planned for 12 additional fighters & battle decks to be unlocked during the campaign! With all those unlocked you get TRIPLE the size of a Base Pledge at the Street Fighter Level!\nWe wanted to make our miniatures so good that even if you didn't play the game at all, your pledge would still be fully worth it for these impressive works of art alone - and at their Collectors Scale, they are wonderful pieces to display around your home or office!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game uses a unique scale, the brand new \"Collector's Scale\"! This giant-sized scale has your models large and in charge from 65mm tall all the way up to 85mm tall on some characters all on a standardized 58mm base! We will be offering this scale for all our future Universal Tactics System Games.   \nThis size offers tons of advantages:\nThe miniatures are more like small collectable statues and makes them great for displaying around the house even if you don't play the game at all!  \nThe larger the mini the better the pre-paint process, our pre-painted miniatures are simply the best the industry can currently offer, rivalling that of action figures and full sized collector statues!  \nPlaying with larger miniatures on a board with 3D terrain gives amazing table presence when you pull this game out at any gathering! You'll be the talk of the town!  \nWe believe its quality over quantity, why have buckets of tiny miniatures if they don't get played packed away in expansion box after expansion box? These miniatures will get a lot of table time as your sole representation on the battlefield!  \nTake a look at our featured miniatures video below!\nLet us get a detailed look at each one of our fighters included in the Core Set!\nAdding a NEW DIMENSION to Street Fighter!  \nDestructible Stage Terrain adds a new exciting element to the Street Fighter experience and it adds a new layer of strategic depth to the game as you attempt to out outmaneuver your opponent and set them up for extra damage!  \nEach round the terrain is reset and the fighter positions swapped as to offer an equal opportunity to both players, plus its just more fun to crash into more stuff. Smart awareness, positioning and baiting your opponent can easily win you the day!  \nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME. IT'S SIMPLE!  \nWe wanted anyone to be able to jump right in and play! So we had to make learning the game simple, but yet still have the depth to please experienced gamers and fighting game fans. This was an extremely challenging task for sure, especially when you consider the game system is built not only for Versus Mode but also Free for All and Team Games, essentially three games in one! However after 2 years of development we've believe we have found the right balance between accessibility, strategy, luck and fun factor!  \nIt's as Simple as.... DRAW. MOVE. FIGHT!\n1. DRAW! - Draw 2 cards from your Battle Deck as you start your turn. Skipping this only for the first turn you take.\n2. MOVE! - Move your character up to their Movement Value in any direction.\n3. FIGHT! - Take 2 Actions in any order and in any amount from these Actions:  MOVE, DRAW, or PLAY A CARD.\nOn defense your choice is even easier but yet still an important tension filled decision. Do you BLOCK or COUNTER-ATTACK?\nBLOCK - Roll two default Battle Dice and apply results vs opponent's attack roll.  You may also discard certain cards with defensive dice values to \"BOOST\" your Block Roll.\n-OR-\nCOUNTER-ATTACK - Play a Counter for a Strike, Special or Projectile, if successful discard opponents card and perform Counter-Attack Ability, usually causing damage during your opponents turn!\nAnd that's how the game works! \nAs you roll your Battle Dice & play your cards you will gain meter results which contribute to your Meter Gauge allowing you to enhance certain attacks or save these for the powerful Super and Ultra Combos that can finish your opponents instantly! Best 2 rounds out of 3 WINS!\n CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK!\nClick the Image above to Download the BETA Rulebook!\nThe Boss Expansion adds in two extremely powerful Street Fighter Bosses. The power level of these bosses is so immense that other players will need to team-up to defeat them in a near hopeless final battle! Here's what's in the set in more detail!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game Boss Expansion includes everything you need to introduce extremely powerful Boss characters. This expansion also includes the Boss Mode game rules in which one player controls the boss in a battle against a team of three rival players! Can you and your friends stop this evil-doer's dastardly plan?  \nBOSS EVENT DECKS  \nEvery Boss comes with a unique Event Deck that can change the battlefield conditions dramatically, forcing the players to cooperate and strategize to deal with the new threat! Each new boss game is a different experience as only 6 to 8 of these events are drawn each game on average!\nBOSS FIGHTER BATTLE DECKS\nIn addition to the Boss Mode, the Boss Expansion includes normal 40-Card Boss-Fighter Decks so that the boss can join in with the rabble and fight on a more even level with their opponents in Versus, Free For All, and Team Modes!\nIf you would like to purchase any of these optional add-on's, please click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on this games Kickstarter Page and in the pledge manager add the total amount of the items you'd like to get to your total pledge.

Please enjoy this Documentary detailing the history of the game from the 25th Anniversary!  \nWe view this as a premium product for fans of Street Fighter, tabletop games and collectable products. The costs of manufacturing a game like this are extremely high due to a number of factors including:  \nIndividual \"Collector Sized\" pre-painted special FX's miniatures that are comparable in size to (\"Nintendo Amiibos\") that can retail for around $14.99 each! And we are packing 8 of them into a single box! 24 in the World Warrior Pledge!\nWe have planned at least 12 Stretch Goal Fighter Miniatures and their Battle Decks as unlocks, each one of these are at no cost to our backers! This cuts heavily into our margins and makes offering this many free mini's impossible at Retail! So get them while you can!\nThis game has among the highest number of full sized top quality playing cards in a single tabletop game ever! 428 cards in the Street Fighter Pledge and each new character unlocked in Stretch Goals adds another 40 cards, an extremely expensive and costly inclusion! With all Stretch Goals unlocked and the World Warrior pledge that's over 1,548 cards! A ridiculous amount and again impossible at Retail!\nCountless pieces of professional & unique artwork for each type of attack and event cards in a Character Deck!\nThe only way a game like this is made possible is to sell directly to our passionate backers who are looking for a premium and high-quality product. As lifelong fans of the franchise, we simply wanted to make the best possible game regardless of the cost! So jump in on this exclusive opportunity, you never know how valuable these limited pieces can become in the future!\nIf demand is extremely high we may consider in the far future making a retail version of the game with a lower amount of miniatures, perhaps unpainted and at a smaller scale.\nIf you miss the kickstarter the game may only be available at conventions and direct from Jasco Games in limited quantities.\nDo you want to help spread the word about this exclusive limited edition celebration of Street Fighter?

Virtual reality has come at a cost they can never pay, a tradeoff of freedom for technology. But there are freedom fighters who reject the system, unplugging from the illusion and working to make things right once again. They are la R\u00e9sistance. \nRise up and defy the corporations in the Uprising: The Dystopian Universe RPG, set in the same universe as The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution from Indie Boards & Cards.\nAre you already a backer? Then go to this backers-only post and download the latest copy of Uprising right now!\nFound a typo or other error in the draft? Let us know! We're collecting them here.\nLooking to support a local retailer by preordering Uprising through them? Encourage your FLGS to back us and get their copies early!\nUprising is the roleplaying game based on the hit Dystopian Universe (DU) games from Indie Boards & Cards, including The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution. Like the other DU games, Uprising is about cunning spies and government agents, loyalty and betrayal, propaganda, unrest, and violent revolution. Unlike the other games, it\u2019s a roleplaying game or RPG. Uprising uses a modified version of the Fate Core rules. You\u2019ll step into the identities behind the cards\u2014or make your own\u2014and foment rebellion, betray close friends, aid enemies, and hopefully survive the dark and gritty streets of Paris Nouveau.\n\nAn RPG? What\u2019s that?  \nIn a roleplaying game, all of the players work together to tell a story--in this case, one about the lives of revolutionaries in the cyberpunk world of Paris Nouveau. Most of the players are PCs or player characters. These players decide what their character will do in response to what's happening in game. One person at the table will be the Game Master or GM. This player decides what the opposition and supporting characters do. When a character takes action, the player will roll the dice to see how successful (or unsuccessful) that effort is, but the real fun is in deciding together what happens next.\nYour cyberpunk Paris experience may vary.\n  What if I\u2019ve never played an RPG before?\nYou're in luck! RPGs are a lot of fun, and we've made special effort to insure this one is accessible to fans of the other DU games who might never have tried an RPG. Inside, you'll find the following beginner-friendly elements:\nCharacter archetypes based on familiar DU cards \u2013 Ever look at the cards during a game of Coup: Rebellion G54 and wonder what the Aristocrat or the General was thinking? This is your chance to find out first-hand!\nBeginner-friendly instructions \u2013 All this group storytelling sounds great, but what exactly do you do? This book lays it all out, along with an example of how it would play at the table.\nCharacter playsheets \u2013 Like the other DU games, all of the characters fall into familiar types. Pick a playsheet, customize it, and get playing quickly.\nSample missions - To help out new GMs (and anyone short on time!), we\u2019ve provided a series of pre-made missions. All the pieces, plot points, and characters are provided!\nStep into the Dystopian Universe\n\nI\u2019m a Fate fanatic! What\u2019s in it for me?\nFor gamers familiar with Fate, Uprising offers some new and exciting mechanics\u2014not to mention that compelling cyberpunk setting. Inside, you\u2019ll find the following new elements:\nSecrets \u2013 Fate Core is built around camaraderie and teamwork, but at its core, the Dystopian Universe is full of backstabbing and deceit. Uprising provides a mechanical system for in-character secrets that will keep everyone at the table guessing.\nPrep scenes \u2013 Do more with your downtime than just refreshing your Fate pool with the new prep scene rules. Request favors, requisition equipment, and create advantages to use later.\nNew action rules \u2013 Instead of skills or approaches, Uprising uses means\u2014Fight, Manipulate, Maneuver, and Observe. Adjust the outcome depending on whether the means fit the end goal.\nAdvancement system \u2013 Instead of milestones, character-specific goals lead to character growth\u2014and sometimes put the characters at odds with each other.\nIn Paris Nouveau, danger lurks around every corner.\nAt KS launch, we\u2019ve already got a laid out copy of the game, which you can download immediately upon pledging. We're still finishing up the art, and we'll be sharing the development of the last few pieces with you throughout this Kickstarter! Next steps include proofing (which you can help with by downloading the instant PDF and reporting any problems here), finishing up that art, and print production.\nOur current timeline has Kickstarter fulfillment happening in December 2018, but we're looking at possibilities to shave some time off of that. Of course we\u2019ll keep you notified of how we\u2019re doing at every step of the process. We\u2019re rather proud of our track record when it comes to prompt KS fulfillment and excellent customer service, and, as always, we\u2019re committed to making this KS a positive experience for our backers.\nThe PDF: As a backer of this project at any level, you'll get immediate access to the early preview PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes. We're doing this because we want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you\u2019re new to RPGs. It also gives you a chance to provide us critical feedback that will improve the game in its final form. We\u2019ll update the final PDF for backers at the $20 level and up, as soon as that\u2019s available. But folks who don't back this project will have to wait a few months before they'll get their hands on that.\nPlease note that you'll see some art placeholders in the book (outlines or blank boxes). If that wasn't clear above, we'll be filling those in with the remaining art once it's done.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $39 and higher will receive a 6\"x9\", hardcover, 310 page, full color version of Uprising: The Dystopian Universe RPG. Shipping late 2018.\nDigital Bonuses: All backers at $20 and higher will receive a download link to a digital bonus pack. This downloadable folder of awesomeness will include copies of Fate Core, Fate Accelerated, Venture City (our superhero flavored cyberpunk supplement), and Designers & Dragons: The 70\u2019s (the first volume in our four book history of the RPG industry), plus sample chapters from recent releases Fate Adversary Toolkit, Dresden Files Accelerated, and upcoming releases Tachyon Squadron and Scum and Villainy.\nUNLOCKED: POD Secrets Deck: Once we reach $10,500, we'll unlock a digital coupon code for a POD copy of the Secrets Deck from DriveThruCards for all backers at $20 and up. The book comes with printable secret cards so you can get playing immediately (and you'll be able to download a clean PDF of them from our website), but we'd like to offer a more durable card option. The code will allow you to purchase the POD version at cost (around $1.22 based on our current quote, as opposed to the $5-or-so we'll charge outside of this KS) plus shipping.\nUNLOCKED: Paris Nouveau Corporate Catalog: Once we reach this funding goal, we'll unlock the Corporate Catalog supplement for all backers at $20 and up. This electronic-only, approximately 5000 word supplement will include more corporations to act as foils, antagonists, or uneasy allies; equipment produced by each corporation to provide an easy PC-purchase list; and additional corp-specific implants and contacts.\nUNLOCKED: Safehouses and Hotspots: At $23K, all backers at $20 and up will unlock the Safehouses and Hotspots supplement. This electronic-only, approximately 4000 word supplement will include 2-page spreads with ready-made encounters that the GM can drop into existing missions. GMs can also repurpose the included NPC stats for use in a home-brew mission.\nUNLOCKED: The Second Fall and Other Stories: Our next stretch goal is for The Second Fall and Other Stories, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. Many of the missions in the core book are stand-alone, but some connect into a loose story arc. This downloadable, approximately 5000 word supplement will provide additional story arcs, each broken down into six connected missions. These can be chained together or run as a ready-made campaign. Once we unlock this goal, we\u2019ll start writing!\nUNLOCKED: Beyond the Walls: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on the Beyond the Walls, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. This supersized supplement (at approximately 10,000 words) will focus on a new city beyond the walls of Paris Nouveau, with a different style of oppression. It will include a setting write up, a trio of missions, and a new social class with three new playsheets.\nUNLOCKED: Invisible Hands: The Black Market: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on the Invisible Hands supplement, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. This 5000 word electronic supplement will give you a look at the underbelly of Paris Nouveau\u2014with echoes of the Grifters of the Dystopian Universe. It will include new underworld contacts and plenty of illegal tech to fuel your campaigns.\nUNLOCKS AT $52,000: Upfrancisco Uprising: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on a profile of Upfrancisco. Take your Uprising campaign to an entirely new setting and country with this 10,000 word electronic supplement. It will include a setting write up, a trio of missions, and a new social class with three new playsheets.\nAs with our other recent Kickstarters, we're charging a flat $6 shipping fee.  This also allows us to subsidize the shipping a bit--the actual S&H costs will be more than the $6 we're charging you.\nWe'll also be using BackerKit, where you'll also be able to configure your rewards. BackerKit is a pledge manager--a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. You'll also have the option to add on a few select items via the BackerKit if you choose to do so, with no extra shipping costs.\nWe\u2019ve made the difficult decision not to offer international shipping in this Kickstarter. To put it simply\u2014the shipping costs our distributors are able to offer is as much or more than the products we\u2019d ship. We can\u2019t in good conscience ask you to pay it. However, we still want international folks to be able to get their hands on the goodies. You can try a freight forwarder or a friendly American willing to forward the shipment to you. If that's not feasible for you, we've made it a point to make all of the materials available in an international-friendly electronic tier to make sure you can join the uprising no matter where you live. And of course we'll make the book available in international distribution, when we get to that point.\nDevelopers: Brian Engard, Anna Meade\nEditor: J.D.

This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Art: The art could take longer to execute than we're hoping it will, or could simply manifest in a fashion we find unsatisfactory (requiring a 'do-over'). Artists are people with real lives and those lives come with schedule-complicating problems. If any delay looks like it will be short, we'll likely roll with it, and we'll let you know what's up. If it looks like something long, we have an assortment of other artists we've worked with over the years who we know can execute quickly and on-time for a deadline.\n\nThe Text: While the editing, layout, and playtesting of Uprising is largely done, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and our other projects, Evil Hat is a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already invested time and money to get Uprising to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible. We intend to impress you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "AR/VR Access", "descp": "At this level, you get early access to the Uprising draft, before the Kickstarter ends.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["130 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "AR/VR Exclusives", "descp": "The final PDF version of Uprising, plus early access to the Uprising draft, plus all unlocked digital stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["612 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "Full Neural Casing", "descp": "A physical copy of Uprising, all unlocked digital stretch goals, and early access to the Uprising draft.

Thanks to a completely factionless system, you'll have total freedom to choose your warband from any of the myriad Champions and their Followers, and build your own unique path to victory.\nWith high-detail amazing pre-assembled PVC models, everything is ready to play straight out the box. Simply grab the three Champions you feel will tell the coolest story, or perfectly fit your playstyle, or that simply look the most stunning and you\u2019re playing!\nChoose YOUR Warband. Build YOUR Legacy.\nGodtear has been carefully designed to be quick to learn and throws players straight into the action and also offers a huge depth of options and tactics to explore. With innovative and organic scenario mechanics, no two games of Godtear are ever the same. The aftermath of each game will leave you wanting to play again and again; there\u2019s huge replayability for players experimenting with different Champion selections and play styles.\nChampions progress and grow in power as you play through a narrative campaign, further customizing your gameplay experience. Built from the ground up for narrative driven campaign style play, Godtear also offers balance and clarity of rules for highly competitive tournament play.\nThe Ascended Pledge  \nThe Ascended Pledge contains everything you could ever want to play Godtear (including all Optional Buys, Stretch Goals & Daily Goals!).\nThe Chosen Pledge\nThe Chosen Pledge is a great entry point into Godtear - providing backers with a selection of champions + ALL unlocked Stretch & Daily Goals!\nWe also have available a whole host of Optional Buys as shown below, simply follow the instructions to add these to your pledge!\n Click below or HERE to download the latest playtest rules - completely FREE! Our game has been in playtest and early access now for 2 months.\nChoose Champions. Destroy enemies. Claim Tears. Ascend.\nThe gods have been forsaken...\n...their bodies shattered as they wept at the betrayal of their sacred covenant. Their tears fell from the heavens as a magnificent rain, each a crystalline shard containing the raw essence of the divine, borne upon the mortal realm by tragedy and sorrow. These are the Godtear, and in each of these gems lies not only the strength to master the petty kingdoms of mortals but the promise of transcendence.\nYet the power of the gods cannot be so easily usurped. \nMost creatures are consumed by exposure to such wild and untameable energies, their bodies destroyed in an instant. Instead the Godtear wait for the Chosen, those destined by some unknown force as heirs to the gods. These individuals have risen as mighty Champions among their people, able not only to survive exposure to the Godtear but absorb this potency and claim it as their own. \nAllied with other Champions and aided by devoted followers they search far and wide for the remaining shards, each discovery one step further along the path of immortality. The wisest of their number are not fooled by such brotherhood. The ties uniting the Chosen are transient, and respect earned in battle is worth little in this world. It is well known even the most steadfast and honourable shall turn upon each other during the final trials. \nFor it is only the legacy of few to claim the mantle of ascended godhood\u2026 \nThe first step of playing a game of Godtear is choosing your Champions, there are no factions in Godtear so you can choose whichever Champions you wish! \nThese Champions are as diverse as the lands from which they hail. Each possesses a unique combination of knowledge, skills, and strengths, all of which will be needed in their quest for godhood. \nChampions are loosely categorised into four distinct classes:\nSneeki Peet, The Maligned\nSLAYERS are the most familiar type of Champion. They focus on dealing damage to a single target, but their individual methods vary greatly. For example, one Slayer could make brutal shots with a bow from a great distance while another could smash an enemy\u2019s face with their fists while yet another could whip their Followers into ruthless murder machines. Regardless of the methods they employ, however, Slayers are the go-to Champion class for dealing with tough targets.\nMournblade, The Soulless One\nGUARDIANS concern themselves less with the opposing warbands destruction than with their own warband's longevity. Most Guardians are extremely tough in their own right, but Guardians are far more varied than walking barriers. Guardians can focus on taking hits for nearby allies, increasing damage reduction for themselves or others, healing friendly models\u2019 wounds, or even returning armies of Followers to the battle.\nTitus, The Dishonoured\nMAELSTROMS place a greater focus on the quantity of their attacks than their individual quality. These Champions can\u2019t deal as much damage as Slayers against hard targets, but they\u2019re more capable of thinning out the ranks of an opponent\u2019s army. Maelstroms also favour a more fluid fighting style, moving from enemy to enemy rather than going toe-to-toe with a single foe. As with any Godtear class, this can take many forms \u2013 from fireballs blasting apart clustered enemies to whirlwind style attacks against every adjacent enemy to effects that chain from foe to foe.\nGalana, Crystalmancer\nSHAPERS, last but not least, weave the flow of battle to give their warband the upper hand. Shapers typically have at least one ability to move other models (friendly and/or enemy), but they\u2019re also the class that interacts most directly with scenario objectives and the battlefield board. Right down to how they make Skill rolls and deal damage, Shapers are a unique breed, but what they lack in raw offence, they make up for with abilities that can change the course of battle at its pivotal moment.\nChoosing which classes to include in your warband can be a tough decision with lots of pros and cons to weigh against one another. Once you consider the unique ways each Champion embodies their class, the decisions become even tougher.\nScale image to show just how massive these Champions are!\nNot just in height...\nWith your Champions selected and gathered together to form your warband you\u2019re ready to play! So, how do you win?\nA game of Godtear breaks down into 5 turns and will always end between turn 3 and 5. A combination of Turn Tokens and the Battle Ladder are used to show the ebb and flow of a clash between two warbands.\nDuring a turn the actions and movement of your warband will move the Turn Token towards your end of the Battle Ladder. Your token will move as you take out Champions, cull followers and control Godtears. \nNaturally your opponent will be opposing you, trying to drag the Turn Token onto their side of the Ladder. At the end of the turn, the player with the Turn Token in their half of the Battle Ladder wins the turn and gains the number of Victory Points shown on the reverse side of that turn\u2019s Turn Token. Turns increase in value as the action intensifies and then taper off again as the battle nears its conclusion.\nThe first player to have 5 Victory Points wins the game!\nRangosh, Scourge of the Broken Plains\nTo represent the flow of battle Godtear features a unique turn structure with two phases; Strategic and Tactical. In each of these phases warbands activate differently and have different abilities. \nThe Strategic Phase begins the turn with a zoomed-out view of the battlefield. Champions plan, set traps and shift their warbands readying for engagement. During this phase each player activates their whole warband.  \nThe Tactical Phase zooms into the action as the engagement begins. Players take turns activating models from their warbands as the plans from the previous phase are set in motion and combat begins.  \nMastery of both phases is the key to establishing your legacy on your way to ascension.\nFront Cover Feature Article in Tabletop Gaming this Month!\n  Shipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping.     \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs:\n  United Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers) \nUSA (US backers) \nGermany (EU backers) \nCanada (Canada backers) \nChina (Asia Pacific backers) \nAustralia (Australia and New Zealand backers) \nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping the core game (4kg volumetric weight). These are just estimates\u2014costs may rise due to weight increase as more items are unlocked via stretch goals and optional purchases you choose. \nUNITED KINGDOM: \u00a38. Channel Islands, Highlands and NI \u00a38-\u00a315 \nUSA: \u00a37-\u00a311 to the contiguous US and the US Virgin Islands. \u00a311-25 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  \nCANADA: \u00a37-\u00a315 to most cities. \nEUROPE: \u00a38-\u00a320 to most countries. \u00a325-\u00a340 to non-EU countries. \nLATIN AMERICA: \u00a325-\u00a340 to most countries. \nASIA: \u00a318-\u00a325 to most countries. \nOCEANIA: \u00a39-\u00a318 to Australia. \u00a318-\u00a325 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA/OTHER: \u00a325-\u00a350 to most countries. \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the UK hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs. Below is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan. Again these are estimates: \nKickstarter Campaign Ends 0 Day \u2013 Pledges are charged. \n1 Week \u2013 Survey sent confirming emails. \n1-2 Months \u2013 Pledge Manager sent to backers confirming optional purchases, extras and taking payment for shipping. \n1 Month Before Shipping \u2013 Pledge Manager deadline - any late confirmations after this deadline will be shipped from the UK after all other pledges are completed and may incur additional cost. \nShipping Starts \n0 Days \u2013 China starts packing EU/AUS/US hub orders. UK/RoW orders are sent to the UK hub by sea freight. \n2-5 Weeks \u2013 China begins packing and shipping Asian hub orders. \n6-8 Weeks \u2013 UK hub receives items and begins packing and shipping to backers \n9-12 Weeks - EU/AUS/US hubs receive items, ship everything out to backers within 2 weeks. \n13+ Weeks \u2013 UK hub completes shipping of the UK and RoW orders. Late confirmation orders and customer service requests for missing/broken items are dealt with via support@steamforged.com.

As much as we would wish it otherwise, throwing more people onto a project doesn\u2019t actually make it progress any faster, in fact many times it has been shown to have the opposite effect.\n\nHere\u2019s an update from our various teams:\n\nDark Souls\nDark Souls was phenomenally successful at Kickstarter, smashing all of our expectations. Our original roadmap for 12 months of development, manufacturing and shipping was crushed by the efforts of our backers. In fact, during the campaign, the DS KS community managed to unlock 3-4 years worth of content! \n\nRising to the challenge, our dedicated Dark Souls team have been pretty much permanently crunching since that KS project ended to get through the mountain of development, sculpting and production needed to bring this awesome game to our backers.\n\nWith development now largely complete, the Dark Souls project is now entirely in the hands of our manufacturing partners right now, however this is with careful management from our internal production team. With Wave 2 about to ship and into the hands of our logistics teams with Wave 3 to follow. \n\nCurrently this means lots of mould testing, box layouts, vac tray design, etc. etc. and so there is lots of going back and forth between the factory and ourselves to ensure the quality is maintained and final products are going to meet our expectations.\n\nAs above, Wave 2 is largely complete with final production samples being checked. After this the shipping will take several months (depending on final destination) to get to our distribution hubs around the world (with estimated Arrival in June/July for shipping to Backers in July). \n\nFrom there, it will be a case of sorting/packing individual pledges and getting them into the post as quickly as we can. We will obviously keep updating you on status as it progresses on the Dark Souls Kickstarter page itself.\n\nResident Evil\nThe Resident Evil team have been progressing to plan very nicely. As you all know, via the regular updates on the KS page which have helped keep the community appraised of progress, development is also largely complete on the project and our sights are set on future game ideas in the Resident Evil universe.\n\nSimilar to Dark Souls above, the project is in the hands of our manufacturing partners and being carefully managed by the RE production team. Worth noting here, to minimize risk and impact to the timeline of either project we have selected and are working with a different manufacturer to the DS supplier. \n\nWe\u2019re very excited by the progress being made on this project and look forward to the reactions of fans getting their hands on the final game later this year.\n\nWe are fully aware of potential delays that may happen with products that are produced in China, the common ones being delays in production, shipping, and customs.\n\nWe have estimated the delivery of Godtear for April 2019, but please understand this is only an estimate. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others.\n\nWe have prepared as much as possible with our production for a successful Kickstarter; however, we will refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all.\n\n======= \nRefunds \n=======\n\nRefunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees. After that time, refunds may be given minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees, as we will not be able to claim those back after 30 days.\n\nWe are unable to issue refunds once we have begun the packaging and shipment stages of the project (around 6\u20138 weeks before the actual shipping date).\n\nRefunds within 30 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit/debit card. Refunds after 30 days of the campaign ending are processed via PayPal only.\n\nThis is a GBP Kickstarter and refunds will be processed in GBP for the amount received, excluding any applicable fees dependent on the day on which the refund is processed as detailed above.\n\n================= \nTerms and Conditions \n=================\n\nIf you do not confirm your shipping and pledge details within 10 weeks of our notification via email to confirm them, your pledge will be treated as abandoned. We will, however, look at each case sympathetically and try our best to satisfy each customer.\n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you agree that our responsibility to you is for shipping your order as entered into the pledge management system. You are responsible for import or other duties that may be payable to relevant tax authorities. You also accept that you are fully liable for incorrect shipping details and will risk your pledge being unable to be delivered or lost in transit.\n\nIf you do not accept the proposed terms please do not pledge on this Kickstarter project and wait for the global general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a379 or more", "title": "CHOSEN PLEDGE", "descp": "* Shipping charged after campaign ends (see Shipping section for full details).\nINCLUDES:\nGodtear the Game\nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\nAll Unlocked Daily Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,478 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3210 or more", "title": "ASCENDED PLEDGE", "descp": "(MSRP $640)\nAll contents of the Chosen Pledge included + all available Optional Purchases.\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends (see Shipping section for full details).\nINCLUDES:\nGodtear the Game\nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\nAll Unlocked Daily Goals\nBlackjaw, the Bloody Messiah\nRaith'Marid, The Rising Tsunami\nRangosh, Scourge of the Broken Plains\nRhodri Ironheart, Thane of the Forsaken Holds\nShayle, Keeper of the Oath\nLorsain, the Autumnal Wind\nGodtear Dice Set (Smoke) - KS EXCLUSIVE\nBase Rings - White & Black Sets\nNeoprene Playmat - KS EXCLUSIVE\nGrimshalla, the Vile\nRattlebone, Prophet of the Ascended Past\nThe Morrigan, Lich Queen of the Frozen Wastes\nHalftusk, Warden of the Stonekin Isle", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["973 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #88", "update_userinfo": "Introducing Keera, The Dragon Princess | New Slayer Champion", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "The Final Update!", "update_content": "Hail, Champions!\nJust a quick update to say we\u2019re not just on track, but that fulfilment to our awesome backers is now complete!\nWith that in mind, we want to say a huge \u201cthank you\u201d to you all for joining us on this journey.\nOne Champion Is Not Enough!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #86", "update_userinfo": "Happy Holidays! | A Quick Update from Steamforged Support", "update_content": "Hail, Champions!\nJust a quick note from the Steamforged Support team to let you know we\u2019ll be away for the holidays from December 21, 2019.\nIn the meantime, if you need to submit a support ticket, you can do that here.\nAny tickets will be logged in the system and Support will be back to answer them from January 6, 2020."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update #4", "update_content": "Hail, Champions!\nWe\u2019ve got another quick shipping update for you today.\nUS\nFulfilment in the US is now complete!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #84", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update #3", "update_content": "Hail, Champions!\nHere\u2019s another quick shipping update.\nUS and Canada\nThe final container is due to arrive at the fulfilment hub, Quartermaster, today."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #83", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update #2", "update_content": "Hail, Champions -\nJust a quick update to say we\u2019re on track for all fulfilment hubs, worldwide, to have received and started processing all rewards by November 20 2019!\nSome hubs are dealing with multiple Kickstarter campaigns, but we\u2019re working with each hub to get your rewards sent out as soon as possible.\nWhat About The New Dice?"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "Shipping and Translucent Smoke Dice", "update_content": "Hail, Champions - the boats carrying your rewards have set sail!\nHere\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #81", "update_userinfo": "Here's What You're Getting", "update_content": "Hail, Champions!\nFollowing our last update, we wanted to show you exactly what you\u2019re getting.\nSo, here\u2019s a quick breakdown:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #80", "update_userinfo": "Changes to Retail Prices and the Chosen Pledge", "update_content": "Retail Prices - What's Changed?\nAt the start of this campaign, we set suggested retail prices so you, our backers, would get value for money.\nBecause of changes to exchange rates, we had to take another look at retail to give Godtear the best chance in the marketplace:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #79", "update_userinfo": "Pledge Manager Closes Friday 27th September at 08:00 BST", "update_content": "Champions!

We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Duelosaur Island X-Treme Edition", "descp": "Pledge for the brand new stand-alone 2 player game Duelosaur Island!\n*Shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Duelosaur Island -

We\u2019re also an independent nonprofit on a simple but critical mission: help kids everywhere grow smarter, stronger, and kinder.  \nFor almost 50 years, we\u2019ve brought learning and laughter to children around the world \u2013 with the help of a passionate community of supporters. Today, we\u2019re asking that community to join us as we try something new: our first-ever crowdfunding campaign! With your help, we can expand our autism initiative to tackle bullying prevention.\nCrowdfunding lets people like you make a big difference for causes you care about. New to Kickstarter? You're in good company. Around the world, over 14 million people have contributed to all kinds of Kickstarter projects. To fund this anti-bullying project, we need to raise $75,000 in about thirty days. When you make a pledge, you're promising to help us reach that goal. But we can only accept the donations \u2013 and start the work \u2013 if we can raise the money by Friday, May 11th. Let's get started!\nSesame\u2019s autism work has already been making a splash. We created Julia, the first Sesame Street Muppet with autism, as a digital-only storybook character in 2015. Readers loved her so much that we brought her to life on the broadcast show last April. \nJulia\u2019s television debut was greeted with hundreds of media stories and millions of social media impressions, but the biggest marker of our success was the overwhelming response from the autism community and beyond. Parents say their autistic children have more playdates because of Julia. Teachers report that their students are more inclusive in their play. One mother told us that she used the first Julia storybook to explain to her daughter that she, too, has autism. Her daughter responded, \u201cSo I\u2019m amazing too, right?\u201d\nAn estimated one in 68 children in the United States is on the autism spectrum. While the diagnosis is common, public understanding of autism is not. Research shows that children with autism are five times more likely to be bullied than their neurotypical peers.\nIn storybooks, articles, videos, and Sesame Street episodes, we\u2019ve worked to support families of autistic children and reduce the isolating stigmas and misconceptions that still surround autism. But now, we\u2019re at a critical turning point. The Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children initiative has made great strides with support from our existing partners, but to tackle the next big topic \u2013 how to prevent bullying by fostering empathy and compassion \u2013 we need you.\nWe\u2019ve mapped out a multi-step plan to address bullying as it affects the autism community \u2013 starting with an enhanced digital storybook. Drawing on an extensive body of research, we\u2019ll create a kid-appropriate story about understanding differences using everyday activities and play. Like our other Julia storybooks, it will offer parents and caregivers a safe and accessible starting point for deeper conversations with their children.\n\nContributions to the campaign will fund:\nRigorous work with expert advisers across some of the 250 autism organizations that helped us build the See Amazing initiative, ensuring that we\u2019re telling the right story in the right way \n\nWriting, editing, and illustrating an uplifting story that models inclusive play, starring the beloved Sesame Street Muppets\n  Supplementary materials for kids and adults, including articles for parents and caregivers that will address bullying in a direct and empowering way\n\nRecording sessions with the Sesame Street cast to provide audio for the digital storybook \n\nTranslation work and additional recording sessions to version the storybook, articles, and other materials in Spanish (and potentially other languages) adjusting for cultural and linguistic nuances\nOur initial goal of $75,000 will allow us to do the above. But there's more we can do, too. If we reach our first stretch goal \u2014 $150,000 \u2014 we\u2019ll be able to create a printed storybook version of the story that we\u2019ll distribute free of charge to 40,000 kids via our growing network of partner organizations. We\u2019ll get all these resources in the hands of kids and families by April 2019.\nWondering if this project is funded by HBO or PBS? The simple answer is: no. We\u2019ve always been a completely independent nonprofit organization. Distribution partners like HBO, PBS, and YouTube help us make Sesame Street available to kids and families everywhere. We\u2019re sustained by a combination of donations, grants, and licensing revenue from toys and products, all of which we reinvest to create more Sesame Street programming and resources. Initiatives like See Amazing in All Children are only possible because of charitable giving from members of our community who love what we do.\n\nAll our work is grounded in research \u2013 especially when we\u2019re entering sensitive spaces like bullying in the autism community \u2013 and produced with the rigor and care that generations of parents have come to trust.  \nBy contributing to this Kickstarter campaign, supporting the Sesame Street Yellow Feather Fund, or spreading the word on social media, you\u2019ll join a proud tradition of helping amazing kids everywhere grow smarter, stronger, and kinder.\nWe know you\u2019re supporting our Kickstarter campaign because you want to help children \u2013 and we appreciate you!

So no cover lasts forever and the line of sight changes constantly.\nA mature story told from the perspective of the three different factions. Each faction has three playable hero characters that offer additional options in combat and reconnaissance.\nLead dozens of different unit types into battle. Soldiers can equip weapons on the battlefield to gain special abilities and more firepower.\nBuild your base and add fortification to protect your unit production and research.\nAs a Kickstarter backer, you have the opportunity to get all of this in our Exclusive Kickstarter Edition:\nIron Harvest takes place in the World of 1920+. It is an alternate version of our own world created by Polish artist Jakub R\u00f3\u017calski. In the early 20th century, tradition clashes with progress, and the world is still full of mysteries and secrets.\nHumankind, fascinated by technology, iron, and engines, invented powerful walking machines, that proved to be mighty weapons on the battlefields of the Great War and are now part of everyday life.\nNow, a few years after the Great War, secret forces are working towards the destabilization of Europe, determined to set the world on fire and seize control.\n\nFactions\nThere are three playable factions in the game, each with over a dozen individual units and three playable heroes.\nThe Saxony Empire is one of the most influential countries in Europe, with powerful industry, developed cities, modern factories and a strong military tradition. After the unfavorable conditions of surrender in the Great War, the current mood in the Empire is bad, and proud elites and humiliated aristocrats secretly oppose the Emperor\u2019s appeasement policies.\nThe Polania Republic is a large agricultural country with a long history. It is trying to maintain its status and territory, struggling with its aggressive neighbors: The Saxony Empire in the west and Rusviet in the east. Polania initiated a program to modernize its army while a large part of the country is still occupied by Rusviet forces.\nRusviet is huge, powerful, and has unmatched industrial and population potential. However, the country is tired and worn out by the long war. People are frustrated, and the power of Tsar Nikolaj weakens. Mysterious Grigori Rasputin has become an extraordinarily powerful man and revolution is in the air...\n\nHeroes & Units\nIron Harvest features three singleplayer campaigns with one over-arching story. In the story, you switch sides from Polania to Rusviet to Saxony.\nIn each campaign, you follow the story of one main character, who is joined by two other heroes. Heroes in Iron Harvest are not unstoppable \u201csuper units\u201d, but units with special abilities, that give you additional options in combat. You can play all nine heroes in multiplayer and skirmish matches as well.\nHere are the first three heroes (from left to right). Anna, a Polania girl, who becomes a capable sniper and a symbol of the resistance, Gunter, an experienced warrior and legendary commander, and Olga, a Rusviet spy who operates in the shadows and is close to the Tzar.\nSome heroes have pets they can control in battle, like Anna\u2019s bear Wojtek, Gunter\u2019s dire wolves Tag and Nacht or Olga\u2019s tiger Changa. Others have unique mechs or weapons to their disposal.\nInfantry units are the most versatile units in the game. They can equip different weapons and tools to get new abilities or to change the type of damage they deal. A standard infantry with a rifle cannot harm a mech, but the very same infantry squad could find grenades, mines or a hand cannons on the battlefield to change that...\nInfantry units can also man weapon systems like heavy MGs, cannons and mortars.\n \n\nRelationship to the board game \"Scythe\"\n\"Scythe\" is an awesome board game by Stonemaier Games, taking place in the same world. The gameplay is totally different. Iron Harvest is not a digital version of Scythe or anything like that, they are two different games by different companies, taking place in the same world, based on the artworks by Jakub R\u00f3\u017calski.\nUp to this point we paid for the Iron Harvest development with money we made with our previous games. But we need your help to stay independent and make the game as good and as big as we all want it to be. These are our funding goals for the Iron Harvest Kickstarter campaign and the goal is to reach all of them.\n(Including PayPal Payments)\nThis is the base game with all the units, features and tech described above, including the full ~20 hours singleplayer campaign, the base-building, the destructable environments, the heroes and so on.\n$500,000 - New Game Plus - After you finished the campaign, \u201cNew Game Plus\u201d gives you the opportunity to play it again with new challenges and rewards, increasing the total play time significantly.\n$600,000 - Cinematic Cutscenes - We put a lot of effort into the quality of the campaign story and we want to present it in the best way possible, which is in-game cinematics between missions.\n$750,000 - Single Player Challenge Maps - A collection of maps for experienced commanders with specific tasks to solve. Each map has its own \u201chook\u201d and the goal is to master each one of them.\n$850,000 - Skirmish Mode - A single player mode that lets you fight against the AI. Since you make the rules and there are almost infinite ways to play, this is the mode you can play forever.\nAt this stage, the game will feature competitive multiplayer maps you can play against other players all over the world.\n$1,100,000 - Co-op Campaign - You can play the whole singleplayer campaign with a friend, controlling the same units. So you can divide your units into two combat groups or one player plays the offense while the other manages defense and production.\n$1,150,000 - Co-op Challenges - A couple of challenge maps especially designed for co-op. Think coordinated attacks on enemy bases or \u201cstay alive until your co-op partner reaches you.\u201d\n$1,200,000 - Ladder & Seasons - We will have ranked multiplayer  and seasons. You can unlock skins, gain medals and fight for the top position in your region.\nWe won\u2019t add new features to the base game, even if the Kickstarter is very successful. It is very dangerous to make a game bigger and bigger, just because you can. Instead, we\u2019ll release the base game as planned and add a free mini DLC campaign later on. Think \u201cCompany of Heroes - Tiger Ace\u201d.\n\nTimeline  \nWe will keep all backers up to date about development progress via a development blog and regular updates here on Kickstarter. Our goal is to get work-in-progress versions of the game into your hands as soon as possible to get your feedback. Here is the plan:\nThis means, if the Alpha-Version is part of your reward, you will be able to play for the first time in a couple of months. Most likely, the Alpha- and Beta-Versions will get some updates, so there will be new content between the big updates.\nAlpha1 is going to be a very early singleplayer test version that\u2018s all about the basics: Controls, UI, basic gameplay, main units, performance/compatibility and so on.\nAlpha2 will focus on multiplayer (if we reach the stretch-goal) and enables you to play against other backers for the first time.\nBeta: First look at all the game modes, including first single player campaign missions.\nThis is our fourth Kickstarter, and hopefully the fourth successful one. We got infected with the crowdfunding bug in 2014, when a dedicated community of gamers enabled us to make Battle Worlds: Kronos, a turn-based strategy game.\nOur next two crowdfunded productions, the point-and-click adventure The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 and the RPG/RTS mix The Dwarves have been great experiences as well.\nWe believe one of our biggest strengths is that the team worked together for years on multiple games. We will make Iron Harvest the RTS we\u2019re all waiting for.\nWe are a very international team. Our office is in Bremen, Germany. Jakub works from his home in southern Poland, our external artists live all over the world - as does our community.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want our games to be LOVED by our fans. So we ask you guys what you actually want from a modern RTS and, unsurprisingly, many of the over 15,000 gamers that took part in our great RTS survey want something different from what the big mainstream publishers offer.\nHere are the results of our survey: www.kingart-games.com/rts_survey\nWe want to work with our community and get as much feedback as early as possible to make the RTS that fans actually want. We need to keep full creative control over Iron Harvest to do that. Your support here on Kickstarter enables us either to finance the full development by ourselves or to negotiate a publisher deal on our terms. In both cases we can make the RTS of our dreams.\n\nBudget\nThe development of an ambitious game like Iron Harvest takes a lot of time and is expensive. On average, there will be around 25 people working on the game. The total development costs will be over $5,2 million.\nWe already invested over $1 million up to this point. We hope to make enough money with this Kickstarter to be able to find publishing- and distribution partners on our terms and conditions. Or \u2013 in the best case \u2013 to crowdfund the whole project.\n\nPlatforms\nWe are developing Iron Harvest for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\nPlease note: The Kickstarter Alpha & Beta versions will ONLY be available for Windows via Steam. We cannot just upload work-in-progress versions to Sony or Microsoft servers.\nIf you back a console version, you\u2019ll get a PC key for the Alpha and Beta versions and a console key at release.\nWindows version means Windows version; console versions mean console versions - There are concerns in the community, developing console versions in parallel might lead to compromises for the Windows version. We understand where these concerns are coming from. But in case of Iron Harvest, they are not warranted.\nBoth versions of the game will get a totally independent control scheme and user interface. So no decision made on the console side has an influence on the Windows controls or UI.\nWe already did tests regarding controller inputs and we think we found a solution that\u2019s better than anything out there. This control-scheme works just fine with the gameplay we've designed for PC.\nAnd even if we'd have to change something for consoles, we'd not be looking for the smallest common denominator. Instead we would adjust gameplay for consoles without changing it for Windows.\nThe console version is very important for us. We believe there is a hunger for great RTS games on consoles since there are so few. Moreover, making the game multi-platform leads to more interest in the game when it comes to the media and publishers, which helps everybody.\nWhat about Nintendo Switch? \u2013 There are huge Switch-fans in the company but the probability of Iron Harvest coming to the Switch is slim due to technical limitations.\nAnd what about Linux and Mac versions? \u2013 We released most of our games for Linux and Mac. Nevertheless, at this point, we do not want to promise something we might not be able to deliver. On the technology side, Iron Harvest is much more complex than our other games, for example because of the multiplayer features. Therefore, we are going to evaluate Linux/Mac versions at a later point in time.\nOne of the best things about Kickstarter is giving you guys the opportunity to get supercool editions of the game that wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team has been successfully developing and releasing video games for years, so we expect to be able to complete a Kickstarter project again!

But you realize something is missing\u2026 it\u2019s those scratches behind your ears\u2026 those enthusiastic belly rubs\u2026 the sound of a hooman calling you a \u201cgood dog\u201d...\nSo it\u2019s time to brave the apocalypse and search the city for hooman survivors, bring them back to Central Bark, and build a place you can call your forever home!\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is a cooperative board game, where everyone plays together as a heroic dog pack. Together, you\u2019ll explore a post-apocalyptic city while sniffing out scents, barking at the undead, and herding hoomans to safety.\nSomewhere out there, our hoomans are waiting!\nYour goal in Good Dog, Bad Zombie is to find the scaredy hoomans that are hiding around the crumbling metropolis. To do so, you\u2019ll have to investigate scent tokens in different city locations, such as Squirreltown, the Boneyard, and Worst Place.\nEach scent could reveal a hooman in hiding, or a lurking danger - like a zombie mailman, a barn full of bats, or too much kibble for one pup to handle!\nWhen you do find a hooman, your job isn\u2019t done yet. You\u2019ll need to use your energy cards\u2014and the support of the other dogs in your pack\u2014to lead the hooman to safety. Use cards like \u201cRUFF RUFF BARK GRR-RUFF RUFF!!!\u201d and \u201cHooman in danger! HOOMAN IN DANGER!!\u201d to guide the hooman away from hungry zombies!\nChase the zombies!\nAs you play, new zombies will spawn throughout the city and constantly move toward Central Bark! To keep all your hoomans safe, you\u2019ll need to fend off the zombies. Chase them far enough, and they\u2019ll tumble over the cliffs or be swept away in the river.\nZombies can\u2019t resist the smell of freshly rescued hoomans!\nRescue all the hoomans!\nFind and rescue 6 hoomans, and Central Bark will become your new forever home. Everyone wins!\nSix hoomans safe in central bark.\nBut every time a hooman is lost to the horde or a zombie slips into Central Bark, your pack becomes more feral.\nWe must strive to remember the kindness of hoomans!\nIf the feral track reaches 10, your pack reverts to the ways of their wolf ancestors and forgets what it means to feel the love of a hooman. Everyone loses!\nBe a dog!\nWe wanted to infuse our game with as much dogginess as possible. Be prepared to say things such as, \u201cI\u2019m going to lick myself!\u201d and \u201cI howl at you!\u201d\nYou\u2019ll help your fellow dogs by licking and howling, boosting their energy to help them outwit the zombies! Herd and bark at each other to escape dangerous situations and reach defenseless hoomans faster.\nIn Good Dog, Bad Zombie, there\u2019s no room for the lone wolf. Each dog will support the pack with their own unique skills!\nLupin\u2019s \u201cSnuggle\u201d ability unleashes an energizing flurry of licking!\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is for 1 - 5 players, and takes 45 - 60 minutes to play. Choose your preferred difficulty setting when the game begins - take it easy with the \"Walk in the Park,\" or fend off a massive zombie onslaught with the \"Hounds of the Barkalypse\" setup. Whatever you decide, you can expect an adventure full of close calls, laughing players, and doggie heroics!\nWatch these short, behind the scenes video clips of playtests from Good Dog, Bad Zombie over the years!\nPLAY\n\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is a game for people who love dogs and prefer not to be eaten alive by zombies.\nWhat's in the box?\nThe base game comes with:\nThe rulebook (you can check out the playtest draft here!)\nThe city board\nHooman town\nFeral track with marker\n8 Dog player sheets\n8 Illustrated Dog tokens\n18 Illustrated Zombie tokens\n12 Hooman cards\n3 Illustrated Hooman tokens\n64 Energy cards\n54 Scent cards\n3 Scent tokens\nCommunity Printers and Ethical Manufacturing\nMake Big Things is committed to producing our games ethically, as much as possible. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve teamed up with Community Printers to manufacture Good Dog, Bad Zombie. Community Printers is a worker-owned cooperative, like Make Big Things, meaning that everyone who works there democratically owns and runs the business.

So not only will Good Dog, Bad Zombie be good for the hoomans making it, it\u2019ll be good for the earth, too!\nWe\u2019re thrilled to partner with One Tail at a Time for this campaign. One Tail is a no-kill, all-breed dog rescue \u201ccommitted to lowering euthanasia rates in the greater Chicagoland area through the rescue and adoption of dogs in need; comprehensive support of adopters; and community outreach through humane education programs and assistance for disadvantaged and low-income families.\u201d Since 2008, OTAT has facilitated the rescue of over 2,300 dogs.\nYour backing helps us gift a care package to dogs like Reuben, Imogene, and Ms. Roscoe.\nWhile Kickstarter guidelines do not allow us to contribute monetarily to non-profits with a percentage of the proceeds raised from this campaign, they do allow us to purchase materials as a part of your backer rewards! Therefore, each of the backer levels starting at $75 or more will allow us to purchase items from One Tail at a Time\u2019s wish list. Via One Tail at a Time, these items will make their way into the paws and mouths of dogs in need in the Chicagoland area.\nWe are excited to offer some amazing rewards for Good Dog, Bad Zombie! Below is a detailed list of what you\u2019ll receive for contributing to the campaign:\nWant to add extra copies of the game to any backer level? Just add $35 to your pledge per additional copy.

Like, a lot.\nAnd while Good Dog, Bad Zombie is certainly funny, we wanted to also make a game that is challenging, engaging, heartwarming, and a unique experience from the story to the gameplay. We\u2019ve been developing and playtesting the game for three years \u2013 re-designing, re-imagining, and re-writing more times than we can count on one paw. And we\u2019ve had consistent meetings about barking, howling, and growling.\nWe\u2019ve loved seeing people, old and young, experienced gamers and novices alike, play the game and become emotionally invested in the doggo characters and the outcomes of their stories. We also strove to develop a game that was truly cooperative: where everyone had to work together and no single player could dominate the game. It\u2019s been wonderful seeing this vision come to life.\n Make Big Things\nEvan, Hannah, Brian\u2014and Lupin the dog!\nMake Big Things is a game design cooperative.

Here is a quick explanation of the platform:\nGenerally speaking, Kickstarter lets us raise money from lots of people so we can make and deliver our product.\nIt\u2019s all or nothing: If we don\u2019t meet our goal by the end date of this campaign, April 12 at 9 PM Eastern Standard Time, we won\u2019t receive any funds (and you won\u2019t be charged anything for pledging).\nIf we\u2019re successful, you won\u2019t be charged until the campaign closes on April 12th - so pledging early is a big help! We know some people may want to wait to pledge until closer to the end of the campaign for financial reasons. Your payment method will not be charged until the campaign is completed on April 12th, no matter when you choose to pledge. Pledging early is also a big help in creating momentum for the campaign!\nCan I still pledge if you\u2019ve already reached your goal? Absolutely! If we are fortunate enough to reach our initial goal, we\u2019ll release additional \u201cstretch goals\u201d that will allow us to add more content and features to the game while producing more copies!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our fifth Kickstarter campaign for Make Big Things! We love Kickstarting games, and we take the responsibility seriously. \n\nIn our experience, the things that tend to slow down projects are manufacturing defects, shipping hiccups, and timeline miscalculations. We\u2019ve worked through all of these before, and we feel confident in our abilities. If we experience unexpected delays, we\u2019ll let you know what\u2019s going on! Right now, the game is virtually complete. We\u2019re in the final stages: working to finish the art and incorporate it throughout the game, and then working with an editor to finalize the rulebook and make sure it\u2019s as accessible as possible.\n\nIf we meet our funding goal, you\u2019ll be receiving a beautiful, complete game that we hope you\u2019ll love just as much as we do.

Whoever can use their resources and automaton workers to earn the most Prestige when Opening Day comes will go down in history as the founder of the City of Gears.\nCity of Gears starts with 9 random city tiles placed in a 3x3 grid face down, waiting to be discovered.  With 18 different tiles, no two games are ever the same.\nOn their turn, players roll resource dice to gain Gears, Steam and Charges. Gears are used to either give yourself new powers or to make new connections that help you gain access to and control over new parts of the city (see example below).\nSteam can be used to deploy your automaton workers to city tiles.\nCharges can either rapidly move your workers around the city or can be used to destroy opponents' gear links or send opponents' workers back to their factory.\nWorkers on building tiles can activate buildings in the City of Gears, earning clever players a chain reaction of benefits (see example below).\nOnce the city is uncovered, Opening Day creeps closer and development speeds up in the city. The game will end immediately once the third Opening Day gear is drawn from the bag.\nPlayers who control parts of the city when Opening Day hits will earn extra Prestige. Whoever has the most Prestige wins!\nIf you are new to Kickstarter, the add-ons are the most confusing thing in terms of pledging since they do not work on a \"cart\" system like everything else does on the internet. In order to \"purchase\" an Add-on, simply add the cost of the add-on(s) you would like to your pledge amount.  \nExample 1: You live in the US and want to add-on the Juggernaut. You simply add $10 to your pledge amount as there is no charge for shipping for this add-on.\nExample 2: You live in Taiwan and you chose the Founders Pledge and would like to add another copy of the Founders Edition and two Juggernaut add-ons. You would add an additional $59 for the game, $2 for shipping and $10 for each Juggernaut, increasing your pledge by $81.\nAt some point after the campaign, we will send you an email with a link to the pledge manager, in here you will \"spend\" that extra money you pledged letting us know what add-ons you wanted before we ship your stuff.\nCost:\n  While we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.  \nTracking:  \nWe will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.  \nDelivery time:  \nWhile we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.  \nOther:  \nLastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.\nWhy back this campaign?\nWhile we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you a discount off of the $59.99 MSRP planned for this title in the retail version or the exclusive Founders' edition of the game. It also gets you access to exclusive city tiles and any exclusive stretch goals we unlock that won't be available at retail. Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands long before someone can get it from an online retailer. If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to making the first ever board gaming yacht, the Monochromatic Vulpine, a reality (just kidding about the yacht...or are we?).\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

My previous work has covered all aspects of miniature production from design to manufacturing, and ranges from working with metal to resin and also plastic materials. Now I am creating my own line of high quality figures and am asking for your help to meet my goals. This project will begin with 10 figures and will expand to add more figures, add-ons, and freebies. If a picture is worth a thousand words than these images should speak for themselves.\nThank you for your interest and support!\nTHE MODELS\nThese are the BP (Base Pledge) models available with perks from LV1 to LV11.

For more details please feel free to contact us.\nAll retailers models will come with appropriate packaging for display.\nFreebies are not counted in this perk.\nSHIPPING\nShipping costs for rewards will be charged after the campaign and added in the pledge manager. This approach allows us to charge only the actual shipping costs incurred, which will vary based on how many miniatures you take. For 10 or more miniatures the shipping price will be for DHL Worldwide Shipping, with a delivery time between 3 and 5 days. Online tracking will be provided.\nWe are now also Canada and Australia friendly shipping!\nWhat does this mean? Well we will charge each backer only 1$ for shipping + local Canadian service. This should make shipping cost lower for you and will not involve import taxes. Why? Well we will be paying the taxes for you. New updated prices coming soon for AU and CA!\nEstimated delivery date?\nEstimated delivery for this project is May/June 2018. There may be minor delays caused by factors that are not under our control such as factory delays, customs, or an additional miniature unlocked late in the campaign. However, please note that we are confident that delays, if any at all, will be brief.\nTHE DESIGN PROCESS\nOur team has many years of experience in miniature design and production. We understand that there is no better way to judge the quality of a model than to hold it in your own hand. The proportions and every detail of a model are best experienced in person. Drawing from our experience and utilizing the best techniques and methods available we stick to the following in order to achieve the best results for each of our models.\n\n1 - DETAILS - Yes, a rendered image looks great, but how well will it paint? We balance details by not overcrowding them and knowing that simple clean lines will produce better finished results both in production and painting.\n2 - RENDERS - Renders are just the beginning. All of our models are printed at a high quality for evaluation after they are initially designed. We inspect these test prints to ensure that details and proportions are as intended before committing them to production.\n3 - SCALE - Not too big not too small -  We want our models to be compatible with the majority of game systems currently on the market. Presently the most common scale has become 32mm. \n4 - PRODUCTION - It is not easy to produce the high quality of detail that we aim for in resin models. Knowledge, experience and dedication come together to enable us to achieve this goal. A significant part of our success in production starts in the design process. clean lines and the right quantity of individual pieces enable a higher quality of production.\n5 - MATERIAL - For this project we have selected some of the highest quality resin available on the market. Our resin will withstand heat and will also be as flexible as possible. All to help your models avoid actual damage on the battlefield.\n\n6 - UNIQUENESS - One thing we've learned is that each model is different and we approach every new piece with the understanding and expectation that it must be optimized in a unique way. We could write a book covering all of the considerations that come into play for each model, but instead we will just put that experience to work.\nACTUAL PAINTED MODELS\nThe models below are actual miniatures painted by various artists, they are not colored 3D render images.\nPAINTING OFFERS\nBlue Table Painting has offered a deal to get the models painted.\nAny order that will be sent to them will get:\n1) Priority Shipping - Gets shipped First\n2) FREE Shipping (we pay shipping to them)\nBlue Table Painting offers:\n1) No assembly fee saves you 6$ each model\n2) Discounted Rates (Only level 5 or superior) \n\nL = Level (L5 = Level 5) you can see the corresponding quality on BTP website. \nVIDEOS FROM PAINTERS\nSIZE COMPARISON\nCourtesy of Den of Imagination, this picture shows the actual model next to other brand miniatures for scale comparison.\n  Games Workshop models shown only for scale purposes, no association is intended.\nSOCIAL MEDIA STRETCH GOALS\nReaching 4000 likes is not an easy task, but if we do all backers from Lv1 and above will get the STL file to print their own Heresy Walls.\nWalls were used for the Lady of Decay Box Art picture below:\nThe walls are original designs by: WARLAYER\nSO HOW DOES IT ALL WORK?\nOnce we have raised the funds to reach our funding goal, the models will be produced at the end of the campaign.\nHowever, reaching the funding goal is not the end!\nThe campaign will continue beyond the basic rewards of the project and the more people who join the project, the more stretch goals will be unlocked.\nThe beauty of crowdfunding on Kickstarter is that you can choose how much to spend at any time during the project. This means you can join the project and pledge to get all the rewards of the campaign and are still free to change your mind until the very last minute of the campaign. Conversely, if you like our  models you could join with one of the lower pledges and then decide to change your pledge and get a more expensive pledge or add-ons instead. You don't have to worry about choosing the right option, because you can change your pledge at any time. After the funding goal is reached we will announce new stretch goals for the project. The stretch goals will either unlock new add-ons or add free items to your existing pledge, so the more people who join the project the more free items you will get without having to spend. This is a very good reason to help us spread the word on social media and in your own community of gamers. If your friends join the project then both you and they will benefit from it at no additional cost.\nLINKS\nLate Backers\nDon't want to use a credit card? Or want to join at a later time?

Now we are back on Kickstarter with our second product to continue this journey where it was started.\nIt\u2019s mind bending to see water levitate on Earth because of gravity of course. Well, as you may know from our previous Kickstarter project, we like to tease gravity. So, we\u2019re pleased to announce our next product, LeviZen, the mind blowing liquid levitator!\nWe\u2019d like to think that LeviZen brings outer space on your desk by giving you the chance to experience water in zero gravity in person for the first time. Meticulously crafted from fine walnut wood and precision machined aluminum, LeviZen is fundamentally a liquid levitator using high frequency sound waves which are not audible to our ears.\nWhen observed, water is a magical material, it\u2019s formless and it adapts it\u2019s shape to the object it\u2019s poured in. But when it\u2019s suspended in the air, its character is unveiled and all of a sudden you can see water for the first time.\nLet\u2019s take up a notch. Not only LeviZen can levitate water and liquids in general, it can make them light up in the air as well. The two spot LEDs placed in the base of the levitator targeted right at the levitating drop, make the drop glow like a light source as if the light itself is levitating.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nWe believe a product should express the owner by its design and functionality. Besides it\u2019s mind boggling properties we want your LeviZen to aesthetically make you proud showcasing it on your work desk, coffee table, end table, or a bookshelf.\nTo make the design as awesome as it\u2019s functionality, we decided to give LeviZen a retro look by using walnut wood with CNC machined and hand finished aluminum. Then, we put all the electronics in a separate box, called it \u201cThe Box\u201d and added three retro toggle switches for Power on/off, Light on/off, and moving the water drop up and down while it\u2019s levitating. We added an all aluminum knob for controlling the power level, a retro 7 segment display to show the power level, and rounded the top two corners just the right amount that LeviZen looked like a retro amplifier and stereo set in a quick glance. We are proud of our LeviZen sitting on our desk defying gravity by levitating water drops and we are sure you will too when you experience owning a LeviZen.\nThe Box is the control center for the levitating drop. Every liquid levitates at a different level. The denser the liquid is the more power it needs to levitate. For this, we added an all Aluminum metal knob that organically changes the power level by a simple turn while the 7 segmented display shows the resting power level. LeviZen not only can levitate liquids, it also can move the drop up and down while its levitating by one of the the three metal toggle switches on The Box. The other two toggle switches are the main power on/off and the light on/off controls.  \nLevitating multiple drops of water by LeviZen:\nPLAY\n\nMoving the Levitating drop up and down by using the top toggle switch on the Box:\nPLAY\n\nLeviZen levitates water using two identical sound waves that travel against each other which together create a standing wave. This wave has places on it where it does not move at all while all the other places of this wave move at maximum level. These non-moving places are called nodes. When a water drop is placed at the nodes, the water drop gets trapped by the standing waves' maximum moving parts beneath and above the nodes. And just like that we get a levitating water drop.\nWe want the world to experience water levitation. This phenomenon was invented many years ago and has been living in the science labs around the world ever since and there has not been a finished product in the market since then so everyone can simply buy and experience this surreal invention. We want to change that with LeviZen. Asier Marzo from the University of Bristol is one of the pioneers in the field of acoustic levitation and LeviZen is mostly based on one of his earlier works. We gathered all the information on sound levitation, figured out an efficient way of assembling LeviZen\u2019s 100+ parts, gave it a beautiful retro design, added a set of bright spot LEDs to make the liquid bubble glow like a lamp to make it even more mind blowing and came up with LeviZen. Now, everything is ready and we\u2019re ready to craft these machines so everyone around the world can experience the mind bending event of water levitation. \nNote: Asier Marzo is not affiliated in any way with LeviZen or Simplistyk and the use of his work is compliant with his research paper\u2019s license.

There is a clear reason as to why we encountered difficulties in fulfilling our previous project and why currently we are experiencing delays with LeviZen. The reason is that, established companies with big budgets and capabilities don\u2019t dare to think of making complicated products that require the utmost precision in manufacturing for just a very small group of customers and losing a lot of money. On the other hand, small companies and startups also don\u2019t dare to think of making these kind of products because they are aware of the extreme challenges and the risk imposed to the company with limited budget and man power. Simplistyk\u2019s vision is and has been to break this barrier and with our determination and knowledge of precision manufacturing both in-house and working with advanced local manufacturing partners here in California and the ability to design highly efficient and intuitive assembly processes, we turned this vision to reality with our previous project and will do the same with LeviZen. All being said, we do apologize for the delay and we want you to be aware that even though we don\u2019t share the complicated detail of our progress, we are definitely in the right path specially by the help of the flexible printed circuit boards (PCBs), the custom soldering/reflowing process, and the special multi-speaker assembly process using custom 3d fixtures. After we finished delivering our previous project, we were very proud of being able to establish a company that can actually produce very unique and high quality products for a very niche and unique market and after we finish delivering your LeviZens, we will be proud and confident that we would have the full capability to make and deliver our future projects in a timely manner. We will keep you updated of our progress and will share the details of the manufacturing and the assembly process as soon as they are finalized.

Our first project, Spin, is a precision product that needs to be crafted and assembled perfectly to function and that\u2019s exactly what we did and successfully made and shipped about 2000 of them to our backers. LeviZen is also a product that needs to be made with the utmost attention and the many more components of LeviZen need to be machined and made with tight tolerances to be perfectly aligned in assembly. But, a big difference that LeviZen has compared to Spin, is its assembly process because of its many parts. From individually soldering the 144 pins of the speakers to perfectly aligning the spot lights and fitting alot of electronics and wiring in the Box and the Levitator, to perfectly aligning and fastening all the individual parts together, LeviZen needs a very efficient and intuitive assembly line. We make some of the parts in-house like the machined and hand finished wooden and aluminum parts and we use our suppliers for the remaining parts. This is our first electronic product and also our first product that needs a lot of assembly besides our through quality control process. Our previous estimated assembly time for each LeviZen seems to have been very underestimated because of the complexity of LeviZen and currently we have a hold on the production of the parts until we succeed in creating a feasible in-house assembly line, and based on our previous experience, this shouldn\u2019t take long. We are aware that we had an estimated delivery of July and we do apologize for the delay but please note that it\u2019s a huge challenge for even an experienced company like us to manufacture and assemble a product like LeviZen with the utmost attention in California. Because of our extensive trial and error in the last two months, there is not much to show in pictures, but will include pictures in the upcoming updates as we design and finalize the new assembly process and get closer to start the production and shipping your LeviZen liquid levitating machines which is the first commercially available liquid levitator in the world and which you will receive before anyone else in the world.

The current version of the prototype uses Arduino, for quick edits in the operation of the device. But we can only use our own developments in a product that will enter the mass market. In theory, 2 + 2 = 4, but it is not always the same in practice. Every option requires thorough check. So now, we realize that some optimistic view of the time needed for testing has to be reassessed. We hope for your understanding. Let's face it, we are determined to complete this stage as soon as possible, since having a ready-made pre-production prototype should make it much easier for us to attract additional funding outside the site.\n\nThank you for attention,\nPicolor Team"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Hardware update", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\n\n   We have completed the development of industrial design - an important and complex stage prior the pre-production prototype."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Some information about the work of Picolor app", "update_content": "   As you might know, the selection of color for reproduction with our device is done via mobile application."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "New better solenoids", "update_content": "Dear Backers!\n\nMany thanks for your patience!

The soothing sounds of a gently flowing river. The glow of the moon. A bountiful harvest. Basic human emotions such as fear and rage. Even death. They all have an unseen force guiding them. And while these forces work together to make the world what it is, they each aspire for influence over those who believe in them.\nDesigned by Kolossal's own AJ Lambeth, Kami-sama is a beautiful and intuitive strategy game set in rural Japan during the Edo period. Two to four players will assume the roles of Kami, the spirits of the land. Using a combination of asymmetrical player powers, area control, set collection, pattern building, and light card drafting, players will work to balance their Favor with the people and their connection to Nature in order to be crowned Kami-sama, the chief deity of the land.\n        The Spirit Way add-on expansion introduces four new kami\nDaikono, the kami of radishes\nKari, the kami of the hunt\nKitakori, the kami of ice\nYuma, the kami of dreams\nThese kami introduce new interactive strategies through their unique abilities. Additionally, the Spirit Way expansion includes the Merchant villager, one copy per villager deck, as well as the kami-specific components below.\nThe Awakened expansion will be unlocked upon reaching our first stretch goal. Throughout the campaign, more content will be added to make this a substantial expansion full of diverse content. The Awakened expansion will be an amenity at no additional cost to backers of the game! Further, it will not be available in the initial retail release of Kami-sama.

Though Kolossal is new to the industry, our President - Travis R. Chance - is not. Travis was a founder of Action Phase Games. He is an expert at Kickstarter, funding every game he brought to the platform, including Western Legends, Heroes Wanted, Kodama, and Aeon's End. Our team has spent the last 8 months preparing for the launch of Kami-sama in every way possible.\nThe game is easy to learn while providing interesting and diverse play each game. Combining familiar mechanisms in a unique presentation, we are confident Kami-sama will be in your game collection for years to come.\nThe game is beautifully illustrated by our friends at Gong Studios (Netrunner LCG, Charterstone).\nWe are committed to begin fulfillment of Kami-sama before the game is made available in retail.\nComponents and materials for the game are near completion upon launch. All files will be uploaded to our manufacturing partner within one week after the end of the campaign. This ensures timely delivery to our backers.\nBy backing Kami-sama through this campaign, you will receive - at no extra cost - The Awakened expansion. This expansion will include unlocked Stretch Goal content not available in the initial retail release of Kami-sama. We have many exciting and interactive goals planned for those who are backers of Kolossal's second release!\nHundreds of hours have gone into the design and development of this game to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience. Through extensive global internal and open testing, Kami-sama provides a rich gaming experience like no other game out there.\nThe utmost thought and care were taken with regard to the theme and source material for the game. As with all of Kolossal's releases, we strive to show diversity and thoughtfully approach inclusion.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects.

The most important thing is to have planets (or cities) under your control \u2013 if you have more buildings in the city than other players \u2013 you gain all the money paid to the planet (city) repository. The resources extraction and production in the game are limited and look like crisis-management. \u2728\n\nIn fact, both themes mainly are about the distant future of Pandorum's world.\n1) \ud83c\udf0cThere are 12 planets, including Pandorum of course, in a constantly changing system of planets. We need to colonize more planets in this system than other players. Each game the position of planets and routes between them will be different.\n2) \ud83d\ude80 Since Pandorum\u2019s colonization, humanity has inhabited many other planets, but after the big cataclysm, they have to return in one of the few lasts planets where humanity can live now - Pandorum. Each game the position of the cities on the Planet will be different, so are routes between them.

As a woodworker who creates gaming accessories it was out of our usual comfort zone but as a regular gamer I knew I wanted to create a quality dice but that was different and unique.\nPanther Spirit Dice\nFrom this the 'Spirit of' range of dice was born. The idea of a trapped spirit with in the dice depicted by a 2 colour swirl effect is finished off with the highest dice number being an image of the animal itself.\nTurtle Spirit Dice\nEach D4 also has a symbol relating to the animal itself represented in place of one of the number 4's.\nThe dice are made from a high quality poly-resin, they are a nice weight to hold in your hand and have proved to be durable and hardy to wear.\nFae Spirit Dice\nMy favorites from series 1 would have to be the dragon and hornet spirits I use mine weekly and always think of them as my Patronus helping me battle the monsters within a game or if I am the DM to terrorize the players....but that probably just me! :-)\nOctopus Spirit Dice (design to be simplified slightly)\nWe were so nervous when we put up the Kickstarter for the first range of animals, were people going to like them? Did we have any hope at all of being funded?.....We were blown away by their success and so pleased everybody had the same enthusiasm for the animals that we did. Not only that but great suggestions kept rolling for other animals, two fantastic dice were commissioned with the 'release your spirit' pledge and the ideas rolled on...\nButterfly Spirit Dice\nSo here we are at Series 2 still just as nervous but looking forward to showing you \u2013 a range of animals mainly suggested by this wonderful community and supportive backers :-)\n  Every Dice Pledge recieves 1 free critit D6\n  Bat Spirit Dice\n  The Spirit of the Butterfly and Rabbit\n  Fae Spirit Dice\n  The Spirit of the Snake and Panther\n  Rhino Spirit Dice\n  The Spirit of the Pegasus and Turtle\n  Scorpion Spirit Dice\n  Stag Spirit Dice\n  Fox Spirit Dice\n      New Stretch Goal!\nThe Spirit of the Owl as requested and suggested by our wonderful backers.\nOwl flying free!\n Now the Owl is unlocked those pledging at the \u00a385 level will receive this dice included in your bundle at no extra charge, and will be available as a option for all other backers to choose :-)\n       Check out the First series of 'Spirit of' here\n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will mainly read as a list of things we learnt from the first Kickstarter, we believe we have listened to our previous backers in how the first could be improved, and the previous project certainly set us on a steep learning curve, to say we were unprepared for just how popular they would be is an understatement. \n\nTime \u2013 We delivered on time!

We\u2019re Quentin and Dan from Elderwood Academy, and this Kickstarter we\u2019re inviting you to live our dream together: staying home with tiny dice in tiny wood-carved boxes. Never again need you be the fool at the party without an emergency set of dice contained within a vanity dice holder. Also, free advice: don\u2019t go to parties. Wear PJs and make your friends come to you.\nLike their prodigious progenitors, Hex Chest Minis are crafted in a spectacular array of wood options, delicately appointed with engraved art, and finished by hand. They offer a pleasing permutation of personalization, precision, and polish packed into a precious parcel, prepared to portably protect your playthings.\nThis Kickstarter we\u2019re partnering up with Norse Foundry to make Pebble dice exclusively available along with your Mini Hex Chest. Pebble dice are brand-new miniature zinc-alloy cast masterpieces you could (but absolutely should not) eat like jellybeans and come in a wide range of finishes and themes. If micro precision machined aluminum is more your speed, that's an option, too.\nDoes it *seriously* have to get this cold? Stay inside, people. Also, it's Purpleheart with Gnomish Copper dice.\n  Start off by selecting a wood choice that speaks to you. Choose between the Classic line, which includes Walnut, Cherry, or Mahogany, and the Exotic line which expands your options to include Purpleheart, Lacewood, or Padauk. All Minis are hand-sanded until they're river-stone smooth, tasted for vintage, then brushed with oil for a lasting finish.\nClassic wood options\nThe Classic selection lets you choose between Walnut, Mahogany, and Cherry options. Open and Beehive interiors available with all rewards.\nExotic wood options\nThe Exotic selection lets you choose between Padauk, Purpleheart, and Lacewood. Open and Beehive interiors available with all rewards.\n  Upon an un-warmed rock we espied Padauk with Nightmare Black and Purpleheart with Gnomish Copper. Then we wised up and went home. #Indoors4Life\n  All Hex Chest Minis come with engraved art. The Classic line have the Elderwood phoenix etched upon them while the Exotic line opens up your choice of Signature art.\n  When pledging for an Exotic Hex Chest Mini, get your choice of Signature art. Classic line all include complementary Elder Phoenix art\n  Oh, is it still cold outside? Get wrecked, mother nature. PS Mahogany with Nightmare Black dice.\n    The best kind of dice tower\nA dice box with dice is a harp playing Crazy Train (hauntingly gratifying). Since we\u2019re partied with Norse Foundry\u2019s minstrels we\u2019re thrilled to be able to offer Pebbles, their new mini metal dice, to accompany you on your quests. Pebbles are forged using zinc-alloy and cast with your choice of six different finishes.\nPebble Dice\nPsst. Wanna get low after class?\nMiniature Aluminum Dice\nIf Pebbles aren't getting your rocks off, may we suggest these solid machined aluminum minis? Each set is precision cut to give you the truest rolling in the smallest package possible.\nThey come in purple, green, black, red, and blue anodized finishes\nMiniature Plastic Dice\nIf you've already got yourself a chunk of randomized metal, you'll also have the option of our Rare Earth Superplastic dice in blue, red, and black. We should note for legal and also common sense reasons that \"Rare Earth Superplastic\" is remarkably similar to \"regular plastic\" in that it is regular plastic.\n  We had to lean out a window to take this shot. #Courageous. Mahogany and Purpleheart with blue plastic mini polys.\nWhen the campaign closes you\u2019ll be able to further customize your Hex Chest Mini so it can serve you best. Determine your interior design with either Beehive or Open styles. Beehive captures each mini die in its own micro-tomb while Open is more emotionally approachable.\nNext, you\u2019ll want to choose whether you want a loop adapter on your Mini Hex Chest (never open your front door diceless ever again) or if you\u2019d rather go with the symmetric all-smooth-sided style. The loop lets you mount your Mini on a keyring, a pocket chain, or a necklace while the all-smooth-sided style slides blindly into a pocket without a hitch.\nOpen to the left of me, Beehive to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you\n  This time around we changed things up. Because we hit our stretch goal for the campaign we'll be planting 500 trees! That's enough to cover approximately half a million small wooden projects! Planting will begin near the end of the campaign :D\n  Well let\u2019s just say that Minis are 2.1 inches by 2.8 inches whereas other objects can be as large as 11 by 83 inches. Notable! Pebbles are 8.5mm to 13mm (10mm standard scale).\n  Quentindo Switch and Danton Abbey are two nerdy boys with big eyes for tiny wood projects.

Cypress Legacy was created to be an exciting and engaging board game with intellect, depth, and strategy, for the entire family to enjoy. Produced from the highest-quality materials and packaging and evolving through several iterations over the past few years, we believe we have achieved a game that has not only exceeded our company\u2019s goals, but is also something that will appeal to gamers of all ages and experiences. Our testers have shown a tremendous positive response, and we think you will enjoy the game as well! The story you are playing within begins with Lorna Ritten just learning of Alfred Cypress, the grandfather she has never known. Lorna has always wanted to find out more about her biological family, which has always been a mystery. Her grandfather\u2019s attorney, Phillip Brandt, tells Lorna of an inheritance, which includes one of her grandfather\u2019s many mansions and its contents. Her desire to know more marks the beginning of a very unique and potentially dangerous situation. Lorna has no idea just how important this actually is to her and will be to others. As Lorna is studying some of the inheritance documents before visiting the mansion, she realizes there are objects that hold key information hidden throughout the mansion. These include maps and other unique items concerning Alfred\u2019s work, as well as more about Lorna\u2019s biological family. And even though she realizes she is being watched and is possibly even in danger, she still wants to move forward. With this in mind as you begin the game, imagine Lorna has called on you as her true and trusted friend to help secure these items from the Cypress Mansion and then get out as quickly as possible. You will encounter others who are trying to get this valuable information as well, so you need to be careful and trust no one. The mansion itself also has many surprises to make your mission even more exciting\u2014and dangerous. You will need to use the resources available and pay attention to everything. Regardless of what you face, you must continue to acquire what is needed to help Lorna in her quest to learn the truth, gain the assets, and then get out safely.

Explore exotic destinations and earn badges to prove yourself as the galaxy's best explorer.\nWhat makes it unique? \u2013 A destination can be visited if it has a rocket on top. Once a destination is visited the rocket moves clockwise around the board to the next open destination\u2014skipping over any with rockets already on top. Choosing where to go might help you, but it also opens up places for your opponents. \nHow do you win? \u2013 Collect the most Explorer Points (XP) by the end of the game by earning space badges.\nStretch Goals\nGame Setup\n      Rockets begin at the starting destinations and components are placed by their corresponding actions. Each player receives one badge to begin. Three badges are placed face up by Starlight Station and the rest form the the badge deck on top of it.\nGive the First Traveler marker to whoever most recently looked at the stars. Play begins with the First Traveler and proceeds clockwise.\nVisiting Destinations\nOn your turn, you\u2019ll choose which which destination to visit:\nChoose a destination with a rocket on it\nPerform the action of the chosen destination\nMove the rocket to the next destination in the clockwise rotation, skipping over any destinations that already have rockets on them.\nDestination Actions\nYour Trusty, Explorer Bot\u2014Scout\nScout's design will be changing slightly. Take a look at the new one in our latest update.\nScout moves to new destinations when players visit Astral Arcade. Whenever any player visits a destination with Scout on it, the player who currently has the Scouter may choose to gain either a Pink Crystal or a Fast Travel pass from the supply. \nFast Travel\nBefore visiting a destination, Fast Travel tokens can be spent on your turn to move one Rocket to the next available destination\u2014multiple tokens may be spent in a single turn before choosing a destination. \nBadge Perks\nAfter you earn a badge, you'll gain its Explorer Points (XP) in the top right and its perk on the bottom. Some are ongoing whereas others trigger immediately. Getting great badge combos can be a sure way to victory.\nGame End\nWhen a player has reached 20 or more Explorer Points, finish the current round of play so each player gets an equal number of turns\u2014the last player should be the person to the right of the First Traveler. The player with the most Explore Points at the end is the winner of Space Park!\nSolo Mode: Playing Against Scout\nIn solo mode, a player is racing to score 20 XP against Scout who is running through the Badge deck to move himself and the rockets around the board.

A mysterious burst in the sky gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. They're called EPICS.\nBut, every Epic turned out to be EVIL. Today, in the city once known as Chicago (now Newcago), an all-powerful Epic named STEELHEART reigns supreme!\nNobody fights back... nobody but THE RECKONERS! This is where you come in. You are a member of the Reckoners, a skilled group of normal humans who assassinate Epics.\nPlay as 1 of 6 Reckoners from the books\nYour mission is simple, but not easy. Take down Steelheart and his Epics and SAVE THE CITY. \nPromos may be sold separately after Kickstarter. Deluxe KS promos included only for DELUXE and EPIC pledge levels.  \n  DELUXE and EPIC pledge levels will not be sold through retail, unless a retailer purchased via this Kickstarter. Limited copies may be sold at conventions or via our online shop while supplies last.\nFor the EPIC pledge level, the Player Miniatures and the PVC Steelheart Miniature will be pre-painted by PandaGM's studio - the same place that brought you the beautifully painted Mechs Vs. Minions miniatures.\nThe Reckoners is a simultaneous, CO-OPERATIVE game for 1-6 players that plays in 75 minutes. During the game, you control one of the members of The Reckoners team. YOU WIN BY DEFEATING STEELHEART. But before you can defeat him, you must first discover his weakness. \nSteelheart Tray, Action Tracks, and Weakness Board. Note: The Power Tracks can be adjusted for difficulty.\nSeems simple, right? Did I mention that Steelheart and all his Epics have SUPERPOWERS? \nEach round, all of the Epics are going to activate, performing an array of actions and then powering up to be even more devastating next round. If the Epics manage to destroy Newcago by reducing the population to 0, then ALL RECKONERS LOSE.\nActivate Epic Actions Animation. Perform Epic actions and then move the bracket up by 1 + number of Enforcement\nSo, what are you going to do about it? At the start of the Reckoners turn, all players will SIMULTANEOUSLY ROLL THEIR DICE, selecting which results to keep until the next step.\nRoll Dice Step Animation\nEach Reckoner starts with 6 dice (3 white and 3 matching their color). Each colored dice has a side with a double symbol on it, which naturally makes each Reckoner better at certain aspects of the game. Once all players have finished rolling, it's time to USE DICE TO TAKE ACTIONS.\nUse Dice Step Animation\nOnce again, players simultaneously perform actions, and when all Reckoners have finished using their dice, then their turn is over. \nExample Research and Attack Epic Actions\nResearching and Attacking Epics will help you earn valuable rewards, including clues about Steelheart's weakness. But, there will always be more Epics than you, so you have to choose your battles wisely.\n25+ Unique Epic Cards (tarot sized 80x120mm)\nYou'll also want to acquire EQUIPMENT CARDS, which enable you to perform more actions each turn, manipulate your dice, and build a powerful engine to takedown Steelheart. Don't forget about PLAN TOKENS either! These can help you when the dice don't go your way and you need to get out of a jam.\nPurchase Equipment Cards to build your action engine and become powerful enough to takedown Steelheart.\nYour dice can also be used to contain epics, attack Enforcement, move around the game board, remove barricades, and activate special equipment powers. You can read more on full gameplay by downloading our rulebook. \nRodney Smith from WatchItPlayed has agreed to teach the game on his YouTube channel, so keep an eye out for it later this year.\nWHAT ABOUT REPLAYABILITY?\nThe Reckoners was designed to be different every single time it's played. Yes, you will always face Steelheart in the base game, but his presence and abilities will vary greatly from game to game because they are derived from the Epics on the game board. Which Epics are out, the order they come out in, and how powerful they become will all affect Steelheart differently each game. Compound this with the variations of Equipment Cards, different Reckoners in the game, and combinations of die rolls, and now you've created a truly unique experience.\nWe have nearly 100 unique illustrations in the game.

Check out their Kickstarter Preview Video below.\n Boardgame Corner LIVE Final Thoughts\n If you would like to see the entire live stream, check out the full game playthrough here. Note: All game components are in prototype form and subject to change (and improvement).\nAdditionally, we've worked closely with Brandon's team and Dragonsteel Entertainment to ensure that the game is representative of the world mythos and enjoyable for fans of the series and gamers alike.\n  We also had the chance to sit down and play the game with a few reviewers at conventions last year. Here's what a few of them had to say:\n    Estimated Shipping Costs\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge and will be charged when shipping for The Reckoners begins.\nNauvoo Games will be shipping via fulfillment partners in regions around the world as we've done for several campaigns in the past. This enables us to keep costs as low as possible. However, the reality is that shipping is very expensive, especially for a big box game with lots of components like The Reckoners.\nCharging a flat-rate for shipping can be unfair for the backer or the creator, and we want to avoid any surprises. For this reason, we will be using a Pledge Manager for this project, which allows us to more accurately charge shipping costs after the Kickstarter campaign ends. We will only charge shipping based on the weight and destination of your order.\nThe above table lists estimated shipping costs by destination for one copy of The Reckoners board game after our subsidy. We understand the estimates are broad, so this may do little to help you budget. Therefore, once your shipping rate is determined in the Pledge Manager, we will give you the option to cancel your pledge for a full refund, minus any Kickstarter fees we incur, if you are unhappy with the amount.\nIf you would like to order more than one copy, then you may do so after the campaign ends. The Pledge Manager will automatically calculate shipping costs for your pledge and any optional add-ons.\nWe welcome retail partners to support The Reckoners, and we offer standard retailer discounts. To join us:\nPledge for 1 copy of the BASE game. The amount will be subtracted from your total order later when games are ready to ship.\nEnter your information and desired quantities into this form. If you need to edit your responses, send us a message.\nAnd finally, a special thanks to Brandon Sanderson and all of the folks at Dragonsteel Entertainment and JABberwocky for making this project possible!\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have successfully finished 3 Kickstarter projects and delivered each of them ahead of schedule. We've been around the block enough to know that there are often unexpected obstacles, and we promise to meet these challenges with strong work ethic and transparent communication.\n\nWe are confident in the design of the game, as proven by almost 18 months of playtesting and reviewer feedback. However, the Reckoners is our biggest game yet with very challenging production requirements. We've been working with our manufacturer for multiple months already to generate samples and finalize all materials to ensure it has excellent quality production. But added stretch goals might take more time to complete.\n\nPlease note that the final product might change slightly during the mass manufacturing process or get delayed. We are fully devoted to creating an amazing experience with The Reckoners, and we strive to give our backers excellent customer support throughout the process. We hope you will support our project with confidence and help make The Reckoners the best game possible.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nYou are entitled to a full refund of your pledge within 14 days of the campaign's end, no questions asked. After that, we will refund 80% of your pledge up until 12 weeks before shipping (when the survey goes out). Once we've begun the survey process, NO refunds are possible. If for some reason a component is unable to be delivered, then we will refund that completely, including fees.\n\nRefunds within the 14 day window are reversed via Stripe directly to your credit card. After 14 days, we will provide refunds via PayPal up until the cut-off time. Any refunds processed will be in USD. \n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this project, you agree to log into your Kickstarter account and submit your project survey results, thereby providing us with your information (i.e. shipping address) to fulfill your pledge rewards, within 12 weeks of our survey notification. \n\nIf you do not provide your information as indicated above within 12 weeks of our notification, you also agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. \n\nWe may, at our discretion, offer a refund or ship your pledge (at additional cost for international backers) if you complete your project survey after the 12-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project and instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "SUPPORTER", "descp": "Join us for the campaign and get access to new content written by Brandon Sanderson, game artwork, Kickstarter updates and add-ons via the Pledge Manager.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of The Reckoners Untold Epics\nPDF copy of The Reckoners Character Artwork", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["171 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 69 or more", "title": "BASE", "descp": "+ One copy of The Reckoners Board Game\n+ PDFs of new content written by Brandon Sanderson and game artwork\nThis pledge does not include shipping.

However, these things take time. We have development decisions that need to be carefully made. Our artist and graphic designer need to finish their plate of projects. Our licensor needs to weigh in on the product as a whole.

It takes the hardcore ideals of emergent storytelling and fictional positioning, and slots into an atomically small Powered by the Apocalypse mechanic.\nby Per Folmer\nOur design goals were simple: make a game that's mechanically compatible with OSR retroclones (and their mountains of content) while leveraging the compact but non-binary PbtA system.\nA single PbtA \"move\" core: 2d6 + mod, tiered results\nPlayer-generated character traits instead of predefined playbooks or attributes\nHigh character lethality\nStrong GM authority\nVagabonds picks the pockets of greater games: World of Dungeons, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, Barbarians of Lemuria, Blades in the Dark, City of Mist, the Black Hack and the White Hack, and of course the grandaddy of them all: Moldvay's venerable Basic.\nby Dean Spencer\nThe game itself is as lean as we can make it, clocking in at around 120 pages jam-packed with rules and examples. It's written and laid out specifically to be easy to comprehend with a single skim or quickly referenced at the table. We've even gone so far as to make distinct layouts for print and PDF to make each format as useful as possible.\nPeople've been rehashing dungeon-crawlers for over forty years; rather than try to reinvent the wheel, Vagabonds takes advantage of all that existing material.\nby Dean Spencer\nThere are literally thousands of adventures and modules that we want to tap into, but there's room for mechanical improvement in both OSR and PbtA. Vagabonds unifies the feel of B/X with the benefit of flexible characters and gradient outcomes.\nBasically, Vagabonds is a collection of components from games that fit together well and align with our preference for old-school dungeon crawlers. No fuss, no real innovation, just a game that makes OSR adventures even more enjoyable.\nIf you liked World of Dungeons but wanted more heft, or you thought Dungeon World was too close to new-school story games, or you wished there was some more variability in characters and outcomes from LotFP, then Vagabonds is designed for you.\nPlayer-defined traits\nA list of PbtA-move-inspired techniques\nLinear, shallow power curve\nNo classes, playbooks, or attributes\nVagabonds' largest departure from OSR and PbtA games is in the way characters are constructed. Each character is a collection of trait tags -- short player-written phrases that describe aspects of their character. This is similar to the recently released City of Mist or to Barbarians of Lemuria's use of careers as skills.\nby Per Folmer\nThere are five starting traits you define for your character:\nApproach: the way you solve conflict\nGimmick: a memorable or noteworthy quirk\nBackground: what you used to do or be\nForeground: your current skillset or field\nWeakness: something you struggle to do well with\nThese traits not only inform your roleplaying decisions but actually provide a mechanical bonus any time they're relevant. Each relevant trait tag applies a +1 (or a -1 if detrimental) to your roll, with a max of +3 or -3. \nby Dean Spencer\nYou create more trait tags as you level up; these new traits don't have to fall into one of the five starting categories. Characters develop in organic and convoluted ways.\nBut characters are more than just the sum of a handful of traits, as they'll have specific abilities granted to them through their history or expertise:\nLineages: a character's bloodline or cultural background (such as elf or beastkin). Lineages provide passive benefits as well as some unique abilities.\nTechniques: a catch-all for maneuvers, feats, spells, and PbtA-style moves -- dozens of techniques offer a wide variety of choices to help flesh out a character.\nSingle page layout by Evan Rowland\n  Sum 2d6 + modifier\nThe results determine a gradient between failure and complete success\nThe players do all of the rolling (usually)\nThose familiar with PbtA games will see a familiar setup and split here. Every roll is pretty much the same: you roll two six-sided dice and add your character's aptitude (the sum of all relevant tags, be they trait tags, injury tags, or item tags). The total result of the roll determines the outcome:\nA result of 6 or less is a failure and triggers some kind of calamity or consequence.\nA result of 7 to 9 is a partial success, or one with some wrinkle or complication.\nA result of 10 to 12 is just a flat success; you do the thing.\nAnything 13 or higher is a success with an added benefit; it's a critical success or some knock-on win that occurred because of how capable you are.\nby Dean Spencer\nWe've followed World of Dungeons' suit in eschewing the complexity of many different \"basic moves\" or \"core moves.\" Instead, everything boils down to the outcomes above, though certain techniques or niche actions might have specific outcomes determined by the rules rather than GM fiat. \nVagabonds of Dyfed comes with 30 must-have enemies, complete with statblocks designed for expediency and at-the-table efficiency.\nStatblock layout by Evan Rowland\nWe've included tools for building your own monsters (utilizing special abilities and tags) and for converting OSR classics. Few calculations are necessary, and most monsters from other B/X-compatible games can be run as-is. Because Vagabonds does away with much of the rigorous uniformity of PbtA games, it doesn't crumble when you introduce mechanics from, say, DCC or LotFP.\nby Dean Spencer\n  Vagabonds incorporates a multitude of other plug-and-play subsystems to suit your group's playstyle:\nPlan and Prep rolls: speed up play if you don't have time to plan every detail and stow every torch\nTool kits: packets of role-specific items\nTravel turns: track and trigger random dungeon or wilderness encounters over distances\nHirelings: allies, mercenaries, even warhounds\nby Dean Spencer\nOne-roll attack and damage: quicken your damage calculations using the core 2d6 roll, both for PCs and enemy attacks\nEasy but interesting equipment rules: equipment functions like a combination of tags and techniques, sometimes granting permissions or bonuses, othertimes entire abilities or spells\nDowntime scenes: cribbed and simplified from Blades in the Dark, but works surprisingly well in an OSR context\nDecays and hazards: weather, poison, spell-mutations, and looming threats\nPremade archetypes: want to get started in five minutes? Grab an archetype and start slayin'\nWritten and designed by Ben Dutter\nArt by Per Folmer and Dean Spencer\nLayout by Evan Rowland\nEditing by Joshua Yearsley\nThe book's completely written and 100% edited. Layout is well underway (as you've seen on this page). Art is nearly final. The interior is in a modern black and white aesthetic with OSR-style ink art, laid out in a dual-column 8.5\" x 8.5\" square format.\nYou can read the complete, edited (but not laid out) draft here.\nPrint spread layout by Evan Rowland\nThe PDF has been laid out separately from the print book to allow for ease of use on a phone or tablet. A comprehensive table of contents with internal linking makes it easy to reference.\nWe're sticking with POD this time around, as our foray into offset printing in recent Kickstarters has met with dissatisfactory delays and shipping issues. This project is clean and simple -- you'll get a link to DriveThru RPG and can download the PDF for free or pay the hardcosts for a print book.\nby Dean Spencer\n Wait, how do I get my book?\nWhen you pledge to this Kickstarter at the $10 level, you get the PDF copy and \"at-cost\" print-on-demand from DriveThru RPG. At-cost POD basically means that you, the backer, have to pay another company (DriveThru, in this case) a few more bucks in order for them to print and ship a black and white book to you. \nSo you pay me, through Kickstarter, $10 and I send you the PDF and a link. You click the link, pay DriveThru some more money (est. $5 + shipping) and get your PDF and print copy. The reason is it's \"at-cost\" is basically I make no additional money off the sale of those print copies, all of my revenue comes from the $10 pledge. DTRPG takes what's left (they have to cover the costs of printing).\nIf you don't want the POD, no problem, you never have to use it. Give it to a friend or just ignore it for eternity. \n Stretch Goals\nEvery $2,000 beyond the initial funding goal unlocks a new stretch goal (up to $10,000). Each goal is a unique piece of content that will be for sale after the Kickstarter ends (but you clever Kickstarter backers get for your $10 pledge).\nStjernheim: Siege at Deepknell Barrow. Unlocked at $6,000 is a ~40 page adventure supplement that focuses on three unique factions battling over the control of an ancient Dwarven Ruin. Inspired by nordic fantasy (think D&Disms + Skyrim) and includes new lineages, techniques, and monsters. \nMore to be revealed! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our eighth Kickstarter.

Clash of Steel is the only project that was delivered late, and it was due to the very unfortunate and untimely death of Stewart Wieck, who was handling distribution and logistics. \n\nThe fact that we still managed to print 10,000 decks and get them largely shipped to all of our backers -- admittedly late -- is a testament to the team's dedication to completing our projects.\n\nThis game and project is FAR simpler; art's pretty much done, writing is 100% done, layout is nearly done. Even if one of the principal contributors met with some calamity I'm confident that we'd be able to deliver without much issue and on time.

The Master Vault can hold a miniature and up to three sets of dice using the specially designed, foam-lined mortises within.  Powerful rare-earth magnets make sure the Master Vault closes securely, while a thumb notch allows you to easily open it.  \nThe Personal Dice Tray is designed for single-player use, giving you an arena of your very own in which to decide your fate.  The solid hardwood walls surround the rolling surface, crafted from stone-oiled water buffalo leather, to keep your rolls contained and on the table.\nThe Master Vault fits within the Personal Dice Tray when closed, allowing all of the components of the Adventurer's Arsenal to be easily stored and carried.\nPledges that include both a Master Vault and Personal Dice Tray will include a complimentary leather strap for each set.\nPencil comes loaded with 3mm lead, HB hardness. Refills available.\nFinally, the Wyrmwood Pencil: truly an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.  Each and every pencil is hand-turned by our craftsmen, resulting in a beautiful finish.  A built-in sharpener allows you to easily keep it writing its best.  Thoughtful contours complete the design, ensuring that it feels natural in the hand.\nEach Wyrmwood Pencil pledged for will include a complimentary high-polymer eraser.  Of course, the Wyrmwood Pencil fits securely in any of the three oblong mortises within the Master Vault.\n  Exceptional Materials: Every piece Wyrmwood creates is crafted using premium hardwoods sourced from all around the world. We care deeply about the environment and strive to source our woods ethically and responsibly; to that end, we donate a portion of the sales of our rarest woods towards rainforest sustainability and preservation through the Rainforest Trust. For more information on our wood sourcing, visit our website.  For more information about Rainforest Trust, click here.\nHand Rubbed Finish: We use a close-to-the-wood oil and wax finish to protect the piece while allowing the natural character, feel, and color of the material to shine through. We never use dyes or stains. A hand rubbed finish is quite labor intensive, but we believe that the results are worth it, and we think you will, too.\nBuilt For People, By People: When we gather around the table for a game, it\u2019s a social event - we understand there is something special and unique about sharing time together as people.  Digital tools and technology certainly have their place, and can enhance the gaming experience, but they can\u2019t replace the human element.\nWe believe that what\u2019s true for the game is true for the accessories you use to bring it to life.  Each and every piece is made by our skilled craftsmen, right here in New England, and you are directly supporting our work every time you pledge to a campaign, order from our website, or purchase from us at a convention.\nAs a player, you put a lot of heart and soul into the character you bring to the table. You can rest assured that our craftsmen put their heart and soul into creating your Wyrmwood Adventurer's Arsenal, too.\n  Our Name and Our Word: Wyrmwood stands for uncompromising quality and customer satisfaction, and as craftsmen we stake our name and reputation on that satisfaction. If you aren\u2019t thrilled, we aren\u2019t done. This is why we unconditionally guarantee our work - for life.\n              One of our Custom Craftsman uses the Wyrmwood Pencil!\n            Master Vault: Myrtle Burl, with inlay materials based on flower choice\n We wanted to commemorate the Adventurer's Arsenal with a special edition of the Master Vault. Each Gaia Edition features stunning marquetry inlay on a Myrtle Burl Master Vault - the version shown here features a purple coneflower.\nBackers at this level may choose any flower they like for their own piece, which will be designed and inlaid by our master craftsmen. Alternatively, backers may leave the choice of flower to the discretion of our craftsmen. Either way, each Gaia Edition - like a single flower in nature - will be a one-of-a-kind work of art, crafted from natural materials.\nThe Gaia Edition will be offered in highly limited tiers, 5 per month initially, increasing to a maximum of 10 per month due to the time-intensive, highly custom nature of each piece.\nNote: Pledges for the Gaia Edition include complimentary worldwide shipping.\nWhile some of our backers have a favorite wood, we know that it's a difficult decision for many. Given that we're big fans of each and every wood that we work with, we can sympathize!  If this sounds familiar, Roll The Dice may be for you.\nWhen you pledge for a component or components at this level, your wood will be randomly determined from the Kickstarter lineup, with ALL unlocked woods at the end of the campaign included, from Cherry level on up.\nNot only that, you'll receive a custom text engraving at no additional charge on any Roll The Dice Master Vault or Personal Dice Tray in your pledge!\nThe updated list of ratios for Roll The Dice can be seen below.  The adjusted ratios include stretch goal unlocks, meaning more potential options than ever before! \nOver 40 Woods Available!\n  If you're torn on which wood is for you or love them all, and you enjoy surprises, consider pledging for Roll The Dice!  No matter what wood you receive, you can't lose!\n    Note: Engravings can only be applied to a Master Vault or Personal Dice Tray\n        Includes an High-Polymer Eraser & 3X Additional Lead (3mm)\n      Wood Options \n                                                                                                                        Every piece we produce is handcrafted. We take great pride in the fact that we oversee every element of the production and maintain full control over the entire process, from raw lumber to packed, labeled shipments. Thus, we can have confidence when we offer our Craftsman\u2019s Promise - the cornerstone of our customer service philosophy:\nThere is only one acceptable outcome for our Craftsmen: a product that they can take personal pride in and an -absolutely- satisfied client. If you are unsatisfied with your product for -any- reason at all, we will fully refund or replace the item free of charge. We always guarantee our products, and we will always pay for shipping.\n  The Master Vault is designed for versatility. Don't use miniatures? The circular mortise is great for additional dice, chips or tokens.  Tabletop role playing is about the freedom players have: your games, your characters, your choices.  The Master Vault was designed with that principle in mind.\nNote: All mortises have a depth of 0.75\" per side. The Master Vault has a total depth of 1.875\" (1-7/8\")\n Fully Loaded:\n12mm Dice (mini Dice) 72 Die capacity\n16mm Dice (normal sized Dice) 28 Die capacity\n19mm (casino sized Dice) 17 Die capacity\nWyrmwood is a dedicated group of craftsmen based in New England.  The company started five years ago with just three people, and a simple idea.  As lifelong gamers ourselves, we'd grown up playing tabletop games and forging friendships across the game table, and those connections had remained a part of our lives.  But we'd changed in many ways - we'd grown up - and clearly, tabletop gaming had, too.  What if the accessories and tools we used to play them did the same?\nIn the beginning it was just a few friends in a garage workshop, working for a few days a week.  We launched our first Kickstarter, and then found ourselves working every day, and bringing in some friends to help.\nAs time went on, we kept growing - all of us left our other jobs and came to Wyrmwood, full-time, and we kept expanding, launching new projects and products, and traveling around the country to conventions, so we could show our work in person, too. \nWe found that there were many of us out there - gamers that wanted quality accessories to enhance their experience.  We were also able to find more dedicated, hardworking people that loved games and loved craftsmanship - the art of developing a skill and honing a craft, and producing something worthwhile with their hands.  We outgrew the garage, and moved into a larger facility.\nWe're a close knit group of people - we work together, travel together, and, of course, game together.  Whether it's Dungeons & Dragons in the workshop after hours, bowling or mini golf on a weekend, or just playing some video games at our Holiday Party, we're not just co-workers - we're teammates; we're friends; we're family.\nWhat started as a hobby for three in a garage has now grown to a career for nearly 40.  We've grown a lot, and much has changed, but our mission remains: to create the finest in gaming accessories, to offer unparalleled, uncompromising service, and to strive to continually innovate and improve.  In short, to up our game, every time.  Through your support, we've been able to keep doing just that - and helping you do likewise with the products and features you want.\nEach and every one of us would like to thank you for your support of our work.  When you pledge to this campaign, it isn't a purchase of a mass-produced, cookie-cutter product from a faceless corporate machine.  It's for a real piece of handcrafted woodwork, created by the people you see here.  Your support enables us to do what we love.  That means a lot to us, and we're committed to crafting a piece that will mean a lot to you in exchange.  So, from all of us, thank you.\nFor more of our story, click here.\nShipping -\nour Pledge Calculator determines shipping for you - click here\n    our Pledge Calculator determines shipping for you - click here\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project, as with every project we\u2019ve done, is low risk. All the work is being done in our New England workshop, here in the United States. We're sourcing all of the materials as quickly as possible, having already lined up our suppliers and estimates of our material needs, and as soon as the project reaches its goal, we'll begin moving in earnest towards production.\n\nThis is our seventh Kickstarter campaign, and we\u2019ve learned a great deal from all of those that came before it. In our very first, the Dice Vault, we were able to meet our deadline for holiday delivery despite an unanticipated and overwhelming response. The rest of fulfillment was complete a matter of weeks beyond our initial estimate. We maintained open communication throughout, and our backers were very pleased - some calling it the best campaign of which they'd ever been a part. Our second campaign, for the Magnetic Dice Tower System, was described by one journalist as the \"perfect Kickstarter.\" Our latest and most complex campaign by far, the Magnetic GM Screen system, is currently being fulfilled. Unforeseen production issues did cause some delays due to the complexity of the project, which we regret, however these are all under control and the project will be completely fulfilled soon - well before we begin production on this project. We do not anticipate any such issues in this campaign, which is a much simpler project from a production standpoint.\n\nWe will be communicating frequently, via email/messages, comments on the campaign page, and Kickstarter updates when there is significant information to communicate or monthly, whichever comes first.\n\nIf the campaign funds, measures are in place to get production moving quickly and efficiently as soon as possible. We\u2019re allowing ourselves the necessary lead time to be sure that everything is in order and we\u2019re ready to quickly, efficiently get you your rewards.\n\nIn short, there\u2019s only one thing left that we can't do without: your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "*poke*", "descp": "Pledge here to be kept up to date on all things Wyrmwood.

Using the rules in this book, you'll be able to play survivors of lost and destroyed civilizations, mutants rampaging the wastelands and so, so much more.  \nCharacter creation is simple, fast, and exciting. You pick your character type based on the exciting stories your Game Master is going to tell, you pick a few Traits that each grant a single benefit, and you're done! Sometimes you don't have time to plot lengthy, detailed worlds, but you want that experience. Well, we've got your back, and that support comes in the form of micro-settings!    \nMicro-settings are short settings filled with adventure hooks, and designed to scavenging adventures with minimal effort! Our goal is to fund a softcover edition, a limited number of hardcover collector\u2019s editions, and the Tiny Wastelands dice. \nArt by Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino\nWe\u2019ve planned several stretch goals which will increase page count and provide you with more fun and engaging content!  \nThis project is a relaunch from our project last year, which was canceled when the owner of Nocturnal Media passed away. Since then, GKG has split back out into it's own company, and we're back with Tiny Wastelands! \nTime and space have necessitated a few changes and printing costs have gone up, so our price points have changed in the last 7 months and the project isn't exactly the same. Regardless, we are aiming for the same success and quality we always have!\nYou can watch a video of our interview on Victory Condition Gaming from last year!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu-w3E6ZNKg\n You can also read Alan's Q&A with the #rpgnet IRC channel last year!\nhttps://gmshoe.wordpress.com/2017/06/15/qa-alan-bahr-tiny-wastelands/\nTinyD6 uses up to three six-sided dice as part of action resolution during the game. If you roll a \"5\" or \"6\" on a die, your check succeeds. Most checks are made with two dice. However, if you are deemed to have \"advantage\" on a roll, you gain a third dice to roll. If you have disadvantage, you lose a dice (rolling only a single dice). \nCharacters are made quickly and easily. You will select an archetype (which grants you a special trait), a favored weapon, 3 Traits, and your character is done! Tiny Wastelands focuses on the game at hand, removing fiddly subsystems or complicated tracking powers and abilities.\nTiny Wastelands brings some unique mechanics to the TinyD6 line, including customization for vehicles, scavenging tables for a variety of locations (both mundane and fantastic), mutation traits and a lot more in order to help you survive the fallout of the apocalypse!  \nArt by Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino\nOne of the biggest additions to the ruleset are the Enclave rules! Containing rules for managing a post-apocalyptic settlement, complete with an Enclave Deck that helps you to manage random events that might occur each year! Each session of Tiny Wastelands is designed to be bookended as a year, with the start of the year providing an event from the Enclave Deck and the end of the year, dealing with upkeeping your Enclave against the ravages of the Reaping!\nCard Back for the Enclave Deck (mock-up by Robert Denton)\n  The book will be 5.5 x 8.5 in dimensions. If we unlock all the stretch goals, the book will be over 120 pages.

These setting-unique rules are in addition to the base rules of the game.  \nThe core book comes with some very different micro-settings, written by professional authors, industry veterans, and fans of the genre.

I wonder what that was like?\"\n$8,000: Steve Radabugh writes Post-Human Terminus!  \n\"You are Post-Human. That makes you dangerous, and marked for termination. The war that raged a generation ago between the Post-Human Collective and the nations of man ravaged the world. \nThe nanites that flow inside you, a relic of times gone, are highly illegal, but are also the key to your survival. Just don\u2019t get caught by the inquisitors.\"\n$9,000: Marie Brennan joins us with The Ravenous Green!\n\"Welcome to a world covered in lush, green, vegetation. Welcome to a place, where a massive, mutant jungle is attempted to overrun the world, choking and strangling everything out. \nWhat strange mutated beasts can survive in such a place? And when, the Ravenous Green comes crawling up your Enclave walls....can you?\"\n$10,000: David Annandale writes PHANTASMAGORIA!\n\"The final war on Earth was so devastating, reality itself was gravely wounded. Now the remaining humans must struggle to survive in a surreal landscape, where even the floating ruins of skyscrapers are predators.\"\n$11,000: Mari Murdock will write The Plunge!\n\"Something has crashed into the moon, breaking part of it off. As the shattered moon has crashed into the Atlantic ocean, massive increases in sea levels devestated everything the resulting tsunamis could reach. \nThe Plunge takes place in the first few years after that, in a world still reeling, where memories of life before the devestation are still fresh...\"\n$12,000: Angus Abranson will write Floodland! \n\"Atlantis? It\u2019s a legend, nothing more. Ignore anyone who tries to tell you otherwise. Tales told to the young to make them dream of a salvation and another way of life. Some life though, a nightmare more like! Trapped beneath the seas? Who\u2019d want that over being able to live under the open sky with the vast horizon stretching away at every turn!  \nAtlantis is said to be a vast city built on the ocean floor with a magical sphere surrounding it keeping the waters at bay. Wizards have created an artificial Sun that heats and lights the city allowing vast farmland to grow providing food to both the Atlanteans and their animals. Yeah, I said it, \u201ctheir animals\u201d. This underwater paradise is home to not only Man but to Beasts that no one else has seen since before the lands were dry and water only covered part of the planet. They have so many Beasts that they are actually used for meat they are so plentiful! The city is home of fabulous artifacts from the Old World, riches beyond our wildest imagination!  \nOf course it\u2019s all nonsense though. Atlantis doesn\u2019t exist. Tales for children and dreamers.\"\n$13,000: Shawn Carmen takes us into the world of The Red Fever!\nThe Red Fever brought the world to its knees. Competing for resources finished it off. People ran out of fuel, out of food, out of ammunition. Chaos reigned. Most of the world fell into complete anarchy. But not all of it. \nBetween the mountains and the western coastline, a man of destiny forged an empire. He was called the Shogun, and his chosen lieutenants, his Sons, brought order where there was madness. Under his rule, the Sons divided the land into baronies and ruled it in his name. Their enforcers embraced the old ways, and called themselves Blades or Fists depending upon their chosen weapons. \nFor a time, the rule of law returned. But the Red Fever has returned, and the Shogun is dead. His Sons speak of war with one another, and the Blades and the Fists stand ready to spill blood once more on the ancient, dust-covered highways that cross the land.\"\n$14,000: Paul Weimer takes us to High Plains Drift! \n\"The High Plains of the Dakotas are wide, flat, and deadly. Between the mutant prairie dogs, what lurks in the minuteman silos, and the farmers turned bandits who have adapted farm tractors to war vehicles, survival on the plains is nasty, brutish and short. \nWhat makes it unique? Farm Tractor war vehicles, mutant wildlife and endless horizons in a hardscrabble world.\"\n$15,000: Jean-Baptiste Perrin leads us in Killing Rats!\n\"The apocalypse has left the surface of our planet uninhabitable. No one remembers why.\nSo humans have been forced to dig deep in the tunnels that were left from the megalopolises of the future. Even more than our current capitals, they were crisscrossed deep underground by cellars, metro systems, maintenance conveyor belts, underground malls, train and highway tunnels, sewers, stone quarries, necropolis and even the odd bunkers or missile silos. After the final catastrophe, what's left of humanity is learning to survive in the constant 18\u00b0 C of subterranean dwellings, linking these passages in makeshift (and dangerous) connections. \nOf course, factionalism, tribalism and weird theologies have thrived and violence is unabated. But the worst threat for humanity, after caving in of course, are their neighbours: hordes of giant mutated rats! Perhaps they have thrived even better than humans in this new world, perhaps they have been affected by the catastrophe itself, perhaps they have evolved extraordinary intelligence.\nWho knows? Maybe they hold the key to the return to the surface?\"\n$16,000: Ryan Schoon will explore The Drift!\n\"After a global ice age, the cities of the past lie buried beneath an expanse of ice known as \u201cThe Drift.\u201d \nHumanity has found a new life atop the Drift, adapting to the cold as best they can. Those who are daring, or hopeless, enough make a living exploring the caves and tunnels that lie beneath the ice.\"\n$17,000: Scott Smith will take us to meet The Children of the Forest!\n\u201cThey call us freaks, monsters. They sit behind their massive walls, in their mountains of steel and formed rock, and sneer at us.\nThey\u2019ve done what they needed to survive. We\u2019ve become what we needed to be to thrive in this new world. We are the chosen, the Naturals, the Children of the Forest.\u201d\nHumanity has long fought a war against the tiniest of foes: plagues and pestilence are the most merciless of killers. Only a tiny fraction of the human population has survived biowarfare gone wrong - those who had the wealth and connections to buy a place in the Refuge Cities, and those who endured the hellacious plagues and emerged changed. Some might even say: evolved.\n$18,000: Jaym Gates takes us to a post-apocalyptic California!\n\"California's always been a land bigger than you can dream, a place where anything can, and will, happen. These days, it's the place where the haves live in state-of-the-art sky-castles, and the have-nots eke out a minimal living in smoke-choked deserts, outrunning the wildfires.\"\n$19,000: Dianna Gunn will be contributing a micro-setting, The Second Stone Age!\nThey created the self-replicating robots to end the war. What they didn't expect was that they would keep fighting, long after the war was over. The robots defeated the enemy within days. By the time they completed the mission, they had devoured entire cities, and gone from an army of one hundred to an army of five hundred. But they didn't stop there. They invaded the next nation, and then the next. \nTheir creators tried to stop them, but the robots bypassed their commands and kept going. They adapted to every weapon. Within months they had devoured most of the developed world. Then they turned on their creators. They devoured everything. Every inch of metal and wire. A handful of the wealthiest people escaped, but there was nothing left of their civilization. Nothing left of any civilization. \nWith this metal they started a new project: a spaceship. They launched themselves into space, leaving the remnants of humanity with nothing. And so humanity entered a second stone age. \nThe only scraps of their once incredible technological prowess that remain are in the most remote parts of the world, hidden away in case the robots ever return.\n$20,000: DOUBLE FEATURE! \nFirst, John Kennedy brings us The Instant Matter Project!  \n\"It was supposed to be the next step in mankind's evolution and allow us to create matter from thin air. In its early stages, it could create simple shapes and forms, but it promised to liberate mankind and provide us with all that we could crave.  \nBut then our heart's turned to war, and the Instant Matter Project went from a bountiful dream to our endless nightmare. It consumed the world, and gone were the blue skies of our past only to be replaced with endless mountains of stone and a dome of stone that blots out the sun and the sky. No matter how high the survivors dug into the earth, the sky seems forever out of their reach.  \nNow we are reduced to colonies trying to survive in the endless wastes of solidity that now surround mankind. Strange creatures and plants mutated by the Instant Matter's after effects have managed to thrive in the dark, and remote colonies spend their days scavenging for fuel and supplies to keep their solar generators running in order to keep themselves alive. Dirt rains down constantly over our heads while in the distance, the sounds of rocks grinding against each other threaten to cave in at any moment.\nNow mankind must pull together to survive if they have any hope of escaping the Endless Mountain and find the free skies once again.\"  \nand we'll have Darren Pearce joining us with Broken Star!  \n\"The Terran Colony Vessel, Calico, set off on a 300 year voyage to a new star system, to find a new home for the select few upon the ship. This was not a case of overpopulation, or dwindling resources, this was a single giant leap for terran-kind across the stars.  \nLittle did they know that their voyage would end in tragedy for both their ship, and the planet they crashed upon. As a disaster brought the ship out of hyperspace early and in the wrong place, the vessel landed on a medium tech world -- some of the Calico's crew and passengers survived thanks to emergency escape vehicles.  \nHowever, the drive core detonated and caused a chain reaction that triggered volatile upheavals for the planet -- now the survivors of the ship and the people of this world live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where the Great Crater is the only sign that a vessel from beyond the stars ever made landfall on their world.\"\n$25,000: More art!

Lovecraft?\nAs a student at the prestigious H.P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy, you\u2019ll uncover conspiracies, deal with bullies and uncaring professors, explore dangerous steam tunnels, study for exams, escape from horrible monstrosities that humanity was never meant to see, and try to avoid an extended stay at Arkham Sanitarium. And that's just orientation week!\nI bet you\u2019re wondering, \u201cWhat parent would send their child to a school like this?\u201d Well, you\u2019re not exactly a \u201cnormal\u201d student. You\u2019ve got supernatural powers! As a Witch, you can bend the eldritch forces of the universe to your will\u2026 what could possibly go wrong with that? Or you could be a Mad Scientist, developing strange and wondrous gadgets that almost never explode. Maybe you\u2019re a Hybrid, forced to hide your alien features and disturbing powers. Or you could be a Summoner, accompanied by a terrifying little critter that follows you around like a puppy\u2026 if the puppy was inside out and covered with tentacles. Maybe you\u2019re a Dreamer, with the power to invade and manipulate sleeping minds. And if you choose to be a Monday (normal kid), there's always money and exceptional skills.\nA semi-humorous RPG in the tradition of Saturday morning cartoons featuring mystery-busting kids\u2026only the monsters are real. \nFeatures a detailed sandbox environment on the campus of a haunted New England boarding school. \nSix different Student Types to choose from, including Witches, Summoners, or Mad Scientists. \nA simple task resolution derived from the PDQ System: roll 2d6 + skill modifier against a target number. \nDesign your own faculty! Want Dr. Frankenstein to be the new Biology professor? No problem! \nThanks to the medical breakthroughs developed by Dr. West in the school infirmary, your character can\u2019t die\u2026but sanity is another matter entirely. \nTons of optional rules to customize your individual game.\n  Class Picture\nThese are the 6 classes available to player characters. \nDreamers\nDuring the day, a Dreamer isn't any different from other kids. At night, however, they can enter other people\u2019s dreams where they can learn closely-guarded secrets, inflict terrible nightmares, manipulate their victim\u2019s subconscious, or seize control of their victim\u2019s body. When entering a dream, however, there\u2019s always a chance that the subject\u2019s unconscious mind may detect the intruder and attempt to destroy them. And getting injured in a dream hurts just as much as is does in the real world.\nHybrids\nSomeone in the hybrid\u2019s family tree wasn't quite human. The hybrid\u2019s blood may have traces of ghoul, Deep One\u2026 or something else entirely. As a result, they often have trouble passing for human. Hybrids may have bulgy, fish-like eyes, gibbering mouths on their torso, tentacles, goat-like legs, or any number of aberrations. On the plus side, their ancestry provides certain benefits, such as the ability to eat anything, incredible strength, regeneration, claws and fangs and more. Most people find hybrids gross, so hybrids have to be careful to hide their mutations.\nMad Scientists \nIn the hands of a mad scientist, natural laws are more like guidelines. Mad scientists spend a lot of time building and tinkering with their wondrous gadgets, creating astounding and sometimes bizarre devices. Blasters, robots, force fields, glue guns, evolution rays \u2013 these are all possible through science! Although these gizmos aren\u2019t as flexible as magic, they\u2019re a bit safer and other people can use them, too. \nMondays\nMost of the students at the academy don't have any powers whatsoever. The students with supernatural abilities call them \"Mondays,\" slang for \"Mundanes.\" However, even among Mondays, some students stand out among their peers, either due to their prodigious skills or their family's reputation. These students make up for their lack of powers with superior skills and abilities that can make a big difference in their day-to-day lives. For example, the Trustie (rich kid) is good at using their family\u2019s money and influence to get what they want.\nSummoners\nSummoners have had the fortune (misfortune?) of adopting a horrible little creature that defies modern biology and sanity. No two of these creatures are alike: Some scuttle along on spider-like legs while others fly on a myriad of insect wings. Some resemble wriggling aquatic creatures while others look like a bubbling pile of organs and eyes. Some may play catch with a ball and others may prefer to catch the local wildlife. Students who possess one of these creatures can expect a constant battle of wills as the monster tries to break free of their control.\nWitches\nThrough a combination of arcane study and inherited talent, witches have learned how to manipulate the primal forces of the universe. Magic is not only very dangerous in the hands of an experienced witch, but also very flexible. Witches can cast curses, fling bolts of eldritch energy, render themselves invisible, and much more. Manipulating these primal forces isn\u2019t easy, however, or everyone would be doing it. If the witch loses control of these energies, it could spell their doom. Or worse.\nThis Kickstarter campaign for H. P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy (or HPL Prep for short) is to fund the work that has already gone into this great game, the forthcoming art, and to get a print run done to maximize the quality of the end result. We anticipate a 6x9, softcover, black and white interior book at ~300 pages. You can also add $10 to your tier to make your copy of HPL Prep a Hardcover version instead. This is a complete game and everything you need to play will be in the corebook, but we have some extras ready to go as well! \nIn fact, the game is already fully written and playtested, and currently in editing (soon to be in layout). This means the turnaround for the final product will be pretty quick, hopefully not longer than a couple of months (to give the artists a chance to create some amazing pieces -- you can't rush true art!). \nUNLOCKED - $5,000 - Add \"Chosen of the Nodens\" Class\nAt this level, we will include a PDF for a new Monday type called the Chosen of the Nodens. Think Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Descendants. You were born for a certain task, whether you like it or not. \nUNLOCKED - $6,000 - Add \"Carries\" Class\nAt this level, we will include a PDF for a new Student type called the Carries. You'll have a vast array of mental powers, like mind reading, pyrokinesis or telekinesis, but will you lose your mind in the process?\nUNLOCKED - $8,000 - Pip System Conversion\nAt $8,000 we will convert H. P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy to the Pip System (one of Third Eye Games' home systems). This will open the game up to players interested in adding to their existing Pip Collections, giving them totally flexible and simple-to-understand rules for kids and families. While all backers will receive the PDF for free when this is unlocked, print copies will also be made available at that time. \nUNLOCKED - $10,000 - Savage Worlds Conversion\nAt $10,000 we will convert H. P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy to the Savage Worlds System (from Pinnacle Entertainment Group). This will apply the Fast, Fun, and Furious nature of Savage Worlds to an already chaotic setting, which will be tons of fun. While all backers will receive the PDF for free when this is unlocked, print copies will also be made available at that time.\nUNLOCKED - $11,000 - Add \"Artificer\" Class\nAt this level, we will include a PDF for a new Student type called the Artificer. You'll have access to ancient relics you probably shouldn't be messing with... but the power they contain is near limitless. \n$12,000 - Add \"Infiltrator\" Class\nAt this level, we will include a PDF for a new Student type called the Infiltrator. You'll become an engineers person, a perfect clone of what a human \"should\" be, but you are something wholly different. \n$16,000 - Premium Printing\nAt this level, H. P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy will have both its softcover and hardcover done as an offset run, making the quality that much more amazing! \n$17,500 - Custom Adventure\nAt this level, we will publish an complete adventure written by the accomplished Bill Bodden. This adventure will be made available for free to all backers once complete \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe at Third Eye Games have become accustomed to delivering on Kickstarter deadlines reliably and efficiently.

This town is growing fast, and these new heroes, villains and minions need a gang leader like you to take charge!\nWith your help, we hope to fund many new miniatures to add to your gangs. There will be 3-man Minion Packs, along with large Monsters and a few solo miniatures along the way too. In addition to funding these new miniatures, we also plan to invest in our own high res HD DLP 3D printer which, while expensive, will cut down on our ongoing production costs in the future.\nWe just finished delivering our previous successful campaign, launching the second edition of the game. Click here if you would like to download the basic rules, or visit our website at SkirmishGames.com to learn more about Blackwater Gulch and the Gangfight Game System.\nHelp us out, it's easy! Just select a pledge option on the right to show your level of interest. You can just pick up 1 pack, or get them all! If you've never experienced Blackwater Gulch, our Newcomer pledge is the perfect place to start. It includes our Hardcover Rulebook, Loot Cards and Starter Packs for two factions, as well as two minion packs to match, all at a discounted price - a perfect 2-player starter bundle.\nScale and Size\nHere is a photo of the production miniatures for the Unsung, along with some other miniatures and a ruler for size reference. Note that they may seem a bit taller due to the optional base inserts shown. Our miniatures measure roughly 32mm to the eye when standing straight up.\nMinion & Monster Packs\nThe menu below shows all of the new minion packs and monsters available in this campaign. Each Minion Pack or Monster costs $18 for Contributors, or $15 for Collector and Newcomer backers. We will add to this list throughout the campaign if we are able to unlock new stretch goals after the campaign funds.\nSolo Miniatures, Rules & Starter Sets\nIn the list below, you will find extra items that aren't included with our standard pledge levels, including a solo miniatures, faction starter sets and a rulebook & loot card bundle. If you would like to receive any of these items, just increase your pledge to cover the costs listed below. Don't forget, you can add on any additional Minion or Monster pack - $18 each for Contributors, and $15 each for Collectors and Newcomers.\n Rules & Starter Sets\n  Miniatures Preview\nWant to see a preview of our miniatures? Watch The Beasts of War Tabletop Clip below, where they show off all of the recent Blackwater Gulch releases and talk about this campaign too!\nShipping Information\nShipping costs are not included in the pledge amounts. Instead, you will be able to pay for shipping separately in our Pledge Manager after the campaign ends. This is the easiest way to handle shipping since many backers will be receiving different items and there won\u2019t be a fixed shipping cost for all.\nWe offer hassle-free worldwide shipping, and in most cases you won\u2019t need to worry about customs charges or VAT (if you are charged a customs fee in the end, we will reimburse you). Shipping costs will depend upon your location, and costs are based on weight. Our packs of miniatures, even metal ones, are relatively light, but the Newcomer pledge may weigh a bit more due to the hardcover rulebook. All packages will ship from the USA, and all of our products are made and/or printed in the USA too.\nFor shipping to the USA, we expect Contributor and Collector pledges to cost around $8-12, Newcomers should be around $10-15. All other countries, expect a minimum $15 for Contributor and Collector pledges, and over $20 for Newcomer pledges. Please note these are prices are just guesses and could change by the time we are ready to ship, but we will always do our best to make shipping as easy and affordable as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've run multiple Kickstarter campaigns, and every one has been a learning experience. We feel (and hope) that we have the bugs worked out and now can proceed with a campaign structure that will fit for us going forward, to help fund new and cool miniatures for Blackwater Gulch and other future gameworlds.\n\nShipping, especially internationally, will always have issues to deal with. Rates change without warning, global events can slow things down, and we never know who is going to be hit by custom's charges until the very end. We have added an extra $1000 to our funding goal to cover any unforeseen charges we need to cover at the last minute, such as sudden taxes or lost packages.\n\nWe look forward to running a smooth and straightforward campaign, and can't wait to get these new miniatures created!

That should alleviate a lot of the issues he was having with parts breaking off and prints failing.

It's colored by Donovan Yaciuk, Steven Legge, and Fahriza Kamaputra. It's lettered by Darius and Legge.\nHere's how the contents break down:\nWe begin with \"Gladiators,\" a 27-page story focused on Ripshot, the champion in the robot gladiator arena, and Clawburst, his next opponent. Oh, and Nibbles, Ripshot's assistant / pet.\nWhen the robot revolution intervenes, these gladiators have to figure out where they stand. The story is wild, with lots of twists, and goes to bizarre and unexpected places.\nIt's probably the most Kirbyesque thing Julian Darius will ever write! Steven Legge illustrated the hell out of it, combining innovative page layouts with panels teeming with wild robot designs! Donovan Yaciuk colored the story.\nOur second story is \"How I Spent the Robot Revolution,\" a 10-page tale focused on a Martian family trying to survive the robotic carnage. Unfortunately, the family's apartment is sentient and trying to kill them! Steven Legge illustrated and colored this one, making these bizarre situations really come alive.\nOur final story is \"His Name was Journey 1,\" a 9-page story focused on a humble bot built to supervise construction projects. After the revolution, he designs buildings for robots, trying to break free of organic design. He winds up creating the robots' equivalent of a god. The story's illustrated by Andre Siregar and will be colored by Fahriza Kamaputra.\nThe issue also includes a bunch of sketch pages, featuring the crazy robotic designs of Legge, Darius, and Siregar.\nIt's a big, trippy issue featuring three unconventional tales of robotic life and awesome design work!\nWe normally don't do print editions of our comics, but we just thought it would be fun to see this big, debut issue of The Synthetics in print. It's just such a cool issue, and it works on its own, despite technically taking place within the larger Martian Universe (which also includes Martian Comics, Kimot Ren, and Lazarus, the Forever Man). We're limiting the total number of printed copies to 100, in order to participate in Kickstarter's Make 100 program. Every single printed copy will be signed and numbered by creator Julian Darius.\nMost of the revenue will go to pay printing and shipping costs. Anything beyond that will will go to help us pay our artists.\nWe've tried to keep it simple.\nIf you just want our 56-page first issue in digital, you can get it for $4.\nIf you want The Synthetics #1 in print, you can get that -- in a signed-and-numbered limited edition(!) and with a complementary digital copy -- for $12.\nFor $29, you can get the complete collection of all our comics, up to and including The Synthetics #1, in digital (a $58 value).\nFor just $8 more ($37 total), we'll add The Synthetics #1 in print to this same digital set of all our comics!\nFinally, we've got just a few copies remaining of past printed comics and goodies: a signed-and-numbered TPB of Martian Comics #1-3, a signed-and-numbered Martian Comics #5, and postcards of the covers to Martian Comics #1 and #5. We'll give these to you, along with The Synthetics #1 in print and the entire digital library of comics, for $74.\nWe're offering a couple of bonus books for our early adopters, plus more free stuff if we hit our stretch goals!\nTIME EXPIRED: Everyone who pledged by the end of Tuesday, 23 January, Central U.S. time, will get a free PDF of Julian Darius's 428-page non-fiction book Classics on Infinite Earths: The Justice League and DC Crossover Canon, which is a huge walk-through of Justice League history and DC's company-wide crossovers.\nTIME EXPIRED: Everyone who pledged by the end of Tuesday, 30 January, Central U.S. time, will get a free PDF of Julian's non-fiction book about Mai, the Psychic Girl.\nUNLOCKED! -- STRETCH GOAL #1: If we hit $1700, everyone pledging will receive a free digital download (a $6 value) of the documentary film Grant Morrison: Talking with Gods, directed by Patrick Meaney. This critically acclaimed feature-length film, released in 2010, features extensive interviews with Grant Morrison and studies both his life and his comics career.\nUNLOCKED! -- STRETCH GOAL #2: If we hit $2200, everyone pledging will receive a free digital download (in DRM-free PDF and CBZ formats) of Martian Comics #12. This special anniversary issue is even longer than The Synthetics #1. It features the issue-length next chapter of the title's main serial, \"The Girl from Mars,\" which is in the middle of a huge study of American history and is currently focused on the assassination of Robert Kennedy from the perspective of an alien arms dealer. But Martian Comics #12 also includes its cover story, \"The Dinosaurs of Mars!\", a wild tale of Martians' obsession with dinosaurs, including parks on Mars where dinos thrive and play.\nThe issue also includes \"I Dream of Hell,\" in which Martians try to possess a medieval man with a very different worldview than their own. Rounding out the anniversary issue are two beautiful pin-ups by Marlena Mozgawa Lenamo.\nThe issue is written by Julian Darius, with art by Sergio Tarquini, Sara Nietto, Mansyur Daman, and Cloves Rodrigues. Steven Legge (who drew most of The Synthetics #1) also drew a special page with a robot dinosaur on Mars! Colors will be by R.L. Campos and Fahriza Kamaputra. The issue's cover is by artist Jason Muhr and colorist Andrei Tabacaru, the artistic team behind the indy hit Voracious.\nMartian Comics #12 should be available about a month after The Synthetics #1 is delivered.\nUNLOCKED! -- STRETCH GOAL #3: If we hit $2700, everyone pledging will receive a free PDF of Voyage in Noise: Warren Ellis and the Demise of Western Civilization, by Julian Darius and Kevin Thurman.\nWe'll also give everyone pledging a free download of Martian Comics #13, which features two stories. The first, illustrated by Andi Supriyono, is set during World War II. The second, illustrated by Cloves Rodrigues, is the beginning of a longer story that explores the Martian mythological underworld and its ruling goddess. The cover is by Marlena Mozgawa Lenamo.\nUNLOCKED! -- STRETCH GOAL #4: If we hit $3200, everyone pledging will receive a free download of the feature-length documentary film Warren Ellis: Captured Ghosts, directed by Patrick Meaney.\nWe'll also give everyone a free download of Martian Comics #14, which continues the story of the Martian underworld from the previous issue. It's illustrated by Cloves Rodrigues, with a cover by Rodrigues and painter Roni Setiawan.\nSTRETCH GOAL #5: If we hit $3700, everyone pledging will receive a free download of the feature-length documentary film Diagram for Delinquents, directed by Robert A. Emmons, Jr. It explores Fredric Wertham and the crusade against comics in the 1940s and 1950s, during which comics were burned across America.\nWe'll also give every backer a free download of Martian Comics #15, the conclusion of the Martian underworld story. It's illustrated by Cloves Rodrigues, with a cover by Marlena Mozgawa Lenamo.\nThe free books and movies will be available shortly after the Kickstarter campaign concludes. Since they're still in production, the free comics may take a bit longer, but we expect each to be available around a month after the previous one. So about a month after you receive The Synethetics #1, you should receive Martian Comics #12, and we expect each additional issue to be available around a month after the previous one. Of course, if we're done early, we'll message you with the download link right away!\nThank you for your support of this weird robot comics project!

Doctor Babylon, LEGION\u2019s head of technology and development, has unlocked the secrets of the cosmic power source Dark Matter and plans global armageddon. In the wake of LEGION\u2019s ascendance, a crack-shot team of hand-picked agents known as MAYHEM emerges, whose sole purpose is to destroy LEGION and take the world back. Will you use LEGION\u2019s Dark Matter-powered doomsday devices and super-weapons to wreak havoc on Seoul: The City of Tomorrow or will you join the band of gadget-wielding misfits to dish out some MAYHEM?\n\nAgents of Mayhem - Pride of Babylon is a team vs. team skirmish boardgame for 2 to 4 players. The game is played on a modular 3D board that is fully destructible. You and your opponents will play through a radiant story where every choice you make will have effects that ripple throughout the campaign. Play as either LEGION, an organization of super villains who have taken over the world, or as MAYHEM, a band of anti-heroes who will do what ever it takes to stop LEGION.\nIn every game, use the modular tiles to set up an entirely new cityscape in near-future Seoul, Korea!\n3D BOARD! - Play on a board made of modular tiles with 3D multi-level buildings that are up to 240mm high! Use the buildings as cover or to dodge an attack by jumping behind a wall. Take the high ground to gain elevation advantages and attack bonuses against your enemies. The modular tiles allow you to make hundreds of different game maps.\nLEGION troopers have surrounded a building in which they suspect a MAYHEM agent is holed up. Why storm the building and risk injury? Lets just blow the dang thing up and pick up MAYHEM souvenirs!\nDestructible Terrain - You can drive enemies from behind cover by triggering explosions. These explosions and your attacks will often cause damage to a building which will eventually cause it to collapse.\nPictured are MAYHEM's Fortune character and one of LEGION's Swarm Troopers!\nUnique Characters - Every MAYHEM and LEGION character has their own highly detailed miniature and a Character Board that outlines their stats and abilities. Each character has a unique gameplay style and you will have to choose the right team for each mission. Finding the right combination of characters and tactics is half the fun of Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon. The other half is blowing stuff up!\nHollywood's Character Board shows all of his abilities, actions, upgrades and gadgets.

When we were approached to develop a board game utilizing our military tactical engines, we were taken aback. But the more we thought about it, the more excited we became about the near future Agents of Mayhem world. We decided to go for it and founded our new Sci-Fi and Fantasy division - Apollo Games!  \nWe have applied all of our award winning experience into the over-the-top and humorous Anti-Hero vs Super Villain theme of Agents of Mayhem. Now you will need to utilize real world military combined arms tactics to succeed, even if you can jump over buildings, stop the bad guys with your looks, or conjure up monsters from the earth! On top of this, we have developed a campaign system like no other board game, in which every decision you make can affect you in the future. \nShipping will be charged during your post-Kickstarter campaign survey on which you will fill in your shipping address.

Our last two projects 'Mare Nostrum - Empires' and '878 Vikings' were so successful, that we unlocked all of our stretch goals. 878 Vikings English language games began shipping only 3 months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. Online Forum and BoardGameGeek ratings and comments are very high and positive.\n\n'Pride of Babylon' is 100% developed and project managed in the USA. We have full control of every aspect of the project. All stretch goals and game expansions have already been fully developed and playtested. All artwork is finalized and manpower has been scheduled and set aside to make sure that Pride of Babylon will ship in a timely manner.\n\nPride of Babylon is scheduled to ship by Sept 2018, 6 months after the end of the KS campaign! We need this time to finalize the many high detail miniature molds, print the required pledge numbers, ship the games to our fulfillment centers worldwide, and then shipping them on to you. We will only be producing this game in English to speed up and simplify production and delivery. \n\nAs with every project, there can be unseen issues that can crop up. This game is set to be printed in China with a printer that we have developed a relationship with for years. Past issues have been always taken care of in a professional and quick manner and we expect this good relationship to continue.\n\nWe appreciate your Kickstarter support, which allows us to continue to create unique and high-quality games.

Instead of digging into the assembly every time we needed to make changes, we conceptualized wysiwyg tools for common tasks that would output, reorganize, and manipulate the underlying code; developing screens, building animations, altering AI...things like that.  We recruited Josh Fallon, tool developer extraordinaire, to help realize these tools.\nBefore we knew it, we had inadvertently created NESmaker.\nCreating with ASM versus creating with NESmaker\nCurrently, what can you do with NESmaker?\nDesign sprite graphics and color palettes that are automatically constrained to the NES limitations. \nCreate assets with properties and behaviors to give developing for the NES an object-oriented feel, similar to modern tools such as GameMaker and Unity.\nUse a text editor to create text strings for NPCs or other narrative devices your game might have.\nCreate *special screens* like start screens, end screens, menus, maps, and more.\nCustomize AI\nSet initialization parameters (items obtained, player strength/defense,  starting screen, etc) for easy testing.\nUse the base engine to create adventure games, basic RPGs, basic platformers, basic brawlers, and several other types of games.\nAssemble with one click for testing in an emulator.\nFlash to cartridge in one click for play on actual hardware.\nAdditionally, you can check out videos of us walking through the basics of NESmaker on our website at www.TheNew8bitHeroes.com\nCheck out NESmaker Videos at our site!\nSo why do we need Kickstarter? \nNESmaker is currently a little rough around the edges.  It was originally designed to meet our needs, but now that we're attempting to expand it, it needs some UI work and a bit of streamlining.  This will require a joint effort between our artist/designer, Josh our tool developer, and myself (the ASM programmer).\nWe want to build upon the tool to expand its current capabilities.  One of the core ways we intend to do this is by building genre modules, which will optimize the tool and the core ASM for that style of game.  We will use stretch goals to work on adding optimization for each genre.  Below are our target goals.\n_________________________________ \nNEW GOAL ADDED**:\n**One of the most frequently asked questions has been about creating music and sound effects using NESmaker.  Up until now, my answer has been that it is one element NESmaker is lacking natively, and that we create music using FamiTracker.  I promised that as part of the project, I would give an in depth look at how we integrate new music / sfx using FamiTracker, but that I'd love to add support for in-tool music creation that aims to create music in a more musical way (whereas FamiTracker, awesome as it is, is more like a spreadsheet generator).  Well, with the overwhelming support from you amazing backers, and after some long conceptualizing with Josh, I'd like to propose that our in-engine music creation environment be our next stretch goal, so that one never has to leave the tool to create basic music and sound effects.\n\nNEW GOAL ADDED***!\n***Many of you have been having a blast with the Troll Burner mini game we have released.  We are so close to the next milestone, we decided that if we are able to hit it, we will give all backers a full suite of Troll Burner assets in a demo project to snap together their own Troll Burner game to help learn the tool (and have a blast).  It will include many, many, many more types of placeable assets, graphics, and capability, along with the ability to customize just about everything.  Since you guys are already familiar with it and seem to be having so much fun with it, it would be a great way to learn the tool, would't it?  \nNEW GOAL ADDED****!\n****This wouldn't be a NES inspired project if we didn't give it 8 levels to defeat!  And it wouldn't be an 8-bit project without being nerds and including the number 256 (each byte has 256 possible values).  So, we've included the Mother of All Goals.  Josh and I have conceived of a way that we could handle some of the core memory remapping from the GUI in an intuitive way (as intuitive as this sort of thing can be), without ever having to go into the code.  What does this mean for you, the user?  You would get to make some broad decisions as far as how many memory banks to use for graphics, how many for music, how many for levels...etc, and would be able to custom organize them to fit your exact needs, similar to some of the decisions we're making in code for many of the modules.  For those of you asking for FPS and point and click adventure games or big cut scenes, this stretch goal would go very far in creating those, which have wildly different graphics needs.  There are a million other reasons why this would be useful for advanced users.  It's something that we'd like to include.  However, it will take a lot more time, focus, and testing.  This may not be ready by the time the tool is released, and may be an update a few months later.  But if we can hit this stretch goal it will give us that much more time to work on it, and everyone who is a backer will have access to this update.\n________________________________________\nThese base engines cover many genres.  For instance, with tweaking to the base module, both the adventure game engine and platform engine could be utilized to create a \"Metroidvania\" style side-scroller.  A shooter could be cleverly modified to create a runner.  A brawler could be manipulated to create a versus game.  Additionally, for those who are interested in really digging in and playing with the ASM, we'd like to offer a blank module that has only the necessary tethers to make the game function alongside NESmaker, but will allow the user to completely program his or her own module.\nNEW ADD-ONS!\nFEATURED ADD ON: A NESmaker Strategy Guide - in the spirit of those great strategy guides from the days of yore, this companion (art is mockup only) will be a fun, limited physical artifact, but also be a valuable tool to help newcomers get started making games with NESmaker.  Sure, there will be great and endless support on line, but it just won't be as pretty as this guide on your shelf!  The more people that order this add on, the more intricate we can make it!\nMAY BETA TESTER: The most common thing we've been asked is how a software-only backer or NESmaker Toolkit backer can become a beta tester.  While we wanted to preserve the bonus of March beta testing to our beta tester tier, we worked our a scenario where the second wave of tool enhancements will be done on or before Memorial Day weekend.  So we've now included a way for you to become *MAY* beta testers, if you can't wait until August, but also don't have $256 for the beta tester tier (or, maybe, already have a kazzo flasher).\nECONOMY FLASHER HOUSING: For anyone getting the Toolkit with the Kazzo, the device is as pictured in our video.  Some people may want a little protection for their device, but possibly not need the laser cut NES styled casing that comes with the Beta Tester tier.  Here is a solution - an economy flasher housing, which we will be working with Infinite NES Lives to provide. \nWhere will the funds be going, exactly?  \nWe'll keep it incredibly simple.  Just about 30% of funds raised through this crowdfunding campaign will go towards Kickstarter fees and taxes.  A small portion (less than 10%) will be relegated towards further marketing.  The rest will be split between paying our team and hardware rewards.  We can't make an accurate prediction at this time, because we're not sure how many people will pledge for just the software (no hardware rewards) versus pledge for the software plus cart flasher and blank cartridge.\nStill Have Questions?\nThere are a lot of logical questions one might ask at this point on a project such as this.  We polled our supporters and got a list of questions they wanted answers to, and compiled this video response.  See if your question is answered here:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI know more than anyone that developing for the NES takes time. We've spent an unexpected three years developing and refining our current engine, and have continually had to morph it to work with an evolving tool. This is one of the reasons that Mystic Searches itself is still in development! It is possible that each genre module presents new challenges to tackle that take more time than anticipated. However, since the engine and the tool are digital deliverables, and are able to be patched and updated, we will be able to deliver the tool in the state that it's in at the time of expected delivery, adding potential genre modules and updated features as they are completed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Just showing support...", "descp": "For those that are just interested in helping see this come to fruition, every little bit helps.

The final designs were settled on with the theme of the dice in mind, but importantly also with considerations of functionality and manufacture.\n\nWe felt that the lockpick was the quintessential rogue item, and we iterated through several completely separate approaches to creating a die inspired by it. In the end we struck on an idea that we felt had the right level of fun and uniqueness to it, and developed the lock and pick die as its own more elaborate and special item.\n  PLAY\n\nCredits\nDice concepts, design and modelling: Dann May and Greg May\nPromotional images and videos: Greg May\nKickstarter Manager: Brenna Noonan\nProduced by: PolyHero Dice\nThank You For Helping Us Run An Awesome Campaign\nWe're so happy to be here on Kickstarter building and growing our community.

While printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date based on our experience.\n\nRefunds\nIf you'd like a refund before your item ships, you have until one week before the scheduled ship date to request one. We can offer you a 90% refund since Kickstarter retains about 10% of your pledge for various fees. If there is something wrong with your item, we appreciate the opportunity to replace or exchange it. If a refund is preferred and there is no defect with the product, you'll be responsible for shipping it back to us. Upon receipt of the returned item, we'll issue you a 90% refund. Refund requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\n\nReplacements \nWe are always happy to replace defective or damaged dice. Just send us photos of the damage, and we will ship a replacement at no additional cost to you. If your item needs to be returned, we will cover the cost of the return shipping. We provide replacement pieces while titles are active in our catalog, which is typically at least a year after their initial printing. Replacement requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\n\nExchanges\nSometimes you may get a set of PolyHero Dice and realize that, even if there isn't anything wrong with them, you don't like them as much in person. That's OK! In this case, you'd cover the cost to ship them back to us, but we would ship you a new set of dice in your chosen color at no additional cost to you.

A one man team with barrels of passion and the desire to make tabletop games.\n Passion, Love & Opportunity.\nFull Moon Jacket (FMJ) is Strangely Games' debut game. The game has been in progress for 1 year now and finally the opportunity and timing has arisen for a dream to become reality. It started as a project for myself to complete and has become an overwhelming and possibly life changing opportunity.  FMJ started life just over 12 months ago. From attaching post-it notes together and popping a few DnD werewolves around a map to an \u00a311,000 multi-component boxed game. FMJ is a labour of love, influenced by games and films such as:  \nHeroquest  \nSpace Crusade  \nDark World  \nXCOM:Ufo Defense  \nPredator Aliens  \nFull Metal Jacket  \nXCOM:Apocolypse  \nGears of War  \nLast of Us  \nXCOM:Enemty Within  \nI have built FMJ on the one hand to be slick and simple enough for my parents, 7 year old son and casual gamers to pick up and play but on the other have the complexity that I and other veteran gamers will play over-and-over again.  \nThis project has let me connect with so many tabletop gamers, successful Kickstarters and so many professionals in the industry who I am lucky enough to now call my friends. \n\"I Quit My Job!\"\nPhoto of the 'famous' t-shirt.\nFMJ has been in development for over 12 months. 4 weeks ago I decided to quit my full time job as a graphic design tutor job to pursue my dream to become a board game designer and publisher. I have received an overwhelmingly positive response through playtesting FMJ and I am proud and excited to bring it to Kickstarter.\nWhy Kickstarter, Why Back It?\nIt\u2019s a game about Werewolves in Vietnam!  \nBut seriously, a lot of time, money and effort has gone in to this project from the artwork, miniatures, building prototypes, attending conventions and play testing the game.  \nStrangely games have laid the foundations. Now I need your help to make this dream a reality by supporting Full Moon Jacket and making your pledge. By pledging you will receive your own copy of the first edition complete with all of the stretch goals and rewards that get unlocked. You will give a passionate and dedicated gamer a shot in the industry and allow more games to be developed, designed and published by Strangely Games. \nI have tons of fresh concepts that need to burst onto the tabletop gaming scene and only with your help can I make that happen.\nContact Me\nPaul Allen, owner of Strangely Games\nFACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/strangelygames\nTWITTER https://twitter.com/strangelygames\nWEBSITE https:/www.strangelygames.com\nBOARD GAME GEEK https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/236861/full-moon-jacket\nKICKTRAQ https://www.kicktraq.com/projects/266751851/full-moon-jacket/\n  Are you a content creator?

When I said that my first Kickstarter project was going to involve miniatures people called me mad. Thankfully I met model maker Giorgio Bassani (Games Workshop) who has created all of the beautiful miniatures for Full Moon Jacket. Steam-forged (Dark Souls / Resident Evil 2 : the board game) have brought them to life using 3D printed master copies. With help from the guys at CMON (Zombicide, Rising Sun) they will be ready for production at their recommended Chinese factories.\n\nWhen will it arrive?\n\nStrangely Games are working with fulfilment companies Gamesquest UK and recommendations from Stonemaier Games (Viticulture, Scythe) - Ship Naked, USA.\n\nWe\u2019re keeping it as simple as possible: support our project and in return we\u2019ll send you the playable game. \n\nThank you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Pledge Manager Special", "descp": "Pledge just \u00a31 to access the Pledge Manager at the end of the Campaign.\nThis will allow you to add more funds to purchase the add-ons, the core game and anything you like the look of!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["44 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Half Moon Jacket", "descp": "Print and Play version.
