[{"backer": "SavySoda", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "PLAY\n\nWatch this quick unboxing video to see what comes with every Lumos Ultra and how it works. \nLumos Ultra comes included with a wireless handlebar remote to make signalling as easy as pressing a button\nGot an Apple watch? You can control the turn signals on Lumos Ultra by simply raising your arm.\nKeep the sun and rain out of your eyes while you ride with an optional attachable visor.\nLumos Ultra will also come with an option to add MIPS. This is an extra safety feature that is built into the helmet to add protection against rotational motion transferred to the brain. Rotational motion affects the brain and increase the risk for minor and severe brain injuries.\nPLAY\n\n\nChips On Board (COB) is a method of LED packaging which has a number of advantages over more conventional technologies. It allows for a more compact footprint whilst delivering a higher intensity of light meaning you\u2019ll be seen from further away. It is also what gives the lights a more uniform look. We like to think of it as Currently Our Best LED technology.\nIt\u2019s our most vented helmet yet. We\u2019ve been listening to customer feedback and have paid very close attention to the way Ultra directs air through its internal venting system. We\u2019ve created 3 enormous exhausts in the rear to ensure hot air gets pushed out helping to keep the rider cool whether on a commute or on a training session.\nWe\u2019ve already done the initial crash tests on our beta units and they pass with plenty of safety margin to spare. We\u2019re confident that Ultra will be one of the safest helmets on road even without the lights on. \nWhen you ride, you must be prepared to ride in any weather. That's why Ultra is built to IPX6 standards, to withstand the elements and keep you riding bright, come rain or shine.\nWe've worked really hard to improve the weight of our smart helmets. By using more efficient manufacturing methods, we were able to use less material without compromising the high level of protection that our helmets provide. Our very first helmet weighed in at 490 grams, Ultra is estimated to have a final weight of 370 grams. Now that's a big win (or loss).\nThere are multiple benefits to wearing lights high up on the head. Firstly, it makes it possible to be seen more clearly by motorists on the road. You're less likely to encounter a situation where your lights are being blocked by parked cars or other things on the road. Secondly, by illuminating your head, it's much easier for motorists to see where you're looking and thus know approach more carefully.\nFor Kickstarter, we've decided to go crazy with colors. The beauty of pre-launching Ultra is that we get to lock down the exact quantities of colors and sizes so that we can optimise production, and therefore create more variants and ensure you find the perfect one.\nThe colors you see here are likely going to be limited to just Kickstarter. After the campaign ends, many of the colors here will NOT make it to retail. So if you see a color you like, now may be the only time to get it.\nWe will be gathering feedback throughout the campaign on what colors our backers would like to see. We have a few ideas already, such as metallic colors, country colors and possibly even 2-tone colors that change with different viewing angles. Stay tuned :D\nUltra is the helmet for everyone, from kids to even bigger kids. It is available in the sizes S, M-L and XL, and they are all equipped with a click-dial fit system to ensure that Ultra sits firmly yet comfortably on your head.\nSmall (S): 51- 55 cm\nMedium to Large (M-L): 54- 61 cm\nExtra Large (XL): 61- 65 cm\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nDespite starting with a design brief of creating the successor to the wildly popular Kickstart helmet, but at half the cost, the design of Ultra has been a labour of love. We could\u2019ve just taken the simpler approach of cutting costs from the Kickstart helmet, but we wanted to create a helmet that takes all of our learnings from building smart wearables and push the limits of helmet design to completely new heights. We\u2019ve agonized over all the small details refining them to the point where they\u2019d feel more at home on a $200+ helmet.\nJust a few of the things we\u2019ve considered include a design that\u2019s not too overstated, yet exudes style. We\u2019ve taken an even more focused user-centric approach to consider useful extras such as the sun visor and overall weight, as well as taking a keen interest in venting to help keep the head cool on more demanding rides. We\u2019re super stoked about how the design has progressed over Ultra\u2019s development cycle, and know that our customers will appreciate the attention to detail once they get the product in their hands.\nFrom sketches, to CAD, to 3D printed models and design validation beta prototypes, we are now in the final stages of the design process. We are collecting tons of valuable feedback and are working on refinements to release the perfect product. With each new version, we get closer to the ultimate helmet for cycling.\nPLAY\n\nWe've completed our beta testing phase. These are some of the pictures and feedback we've gotten from our beta testers. \nBetter styling, amazing air flow and a shockingly lower price. Lumos Ultra really deserves the name, and frankly should be selling like hot cakes. The Lumos Ultra shows how the brand has matured from its Kickstarter roots into an established and innovative company. \u2014 James Gill, Nuneaton UK\nHonestly having lights on your helmet is life changing.. The thing I like best is that if I have any doubt about whether a driver has seen me, I can look at them or their rear view mirror and know the light will flash right at them. \u2014 Caterina Buizza, London, UK\nNot only will you will be investing in your safety, but you will also be getting a premium helmet. Ultra is light and breathable. It\u2019s innovative, giving you THAT thing that other helmets are missing. I love how it looks awesome and really feels great. \u2014 Francisco Garcia, New York\nFor anyone that was on the fence with the previous products due to price, hopefully this new version makes the decision much easier. Just as effective as the previous versions in terms of safety (see and be seen), but with a sleek new design and more accessible price point? What\u2019s not to like\u2026.! \u2014 John Yu, San Francisco\nThis is by far the best helmet if you want great protective gear, slick looks -and- lights. With the lights on your head they are above car roofs so they can always be seen. The cool look, the ventilation and the lightweight, non-bothering fit makes this my A+ choice for my 100 k per day commute as well as for ride my race bike or going on trails with my kids. \u2014 Henrik Becker, Germany\nI love the concept of the Lumos helmet. I\u2019m pretty sure my previous Lumos helmet saved my life before. The Ultra feels like a totally normal helmet. The price is reasonable for any helmet and it looks like a helmet I would buy even if it didn\u2019t have lights. Throw in the lights and it\u2019s totally a no-brainer! Everyone should have one! \u2014 David Rolfe, San Francisco\nIt\u2019s obvious that Lumos Ultra was built on love and experience.\nI have been following Lumos products since the first helmet came out on Kickstarter, and I believe the Ultra is the best one yet. It looks really cool, is super comfortable to wear, and feels very light on my head. As a surgeon, I have to go to the hospital at odd hours, lots of midnights and early mornings.. Since I\u2019ve had the Ultra helmet, I am more confident in cycling to work. The bright lights and turn signals makes me feel more visible on the road, and visible is safe! In broad daylight, the smooth design and good-looking colors turns a lot of heads! \u2014 Petra Wahjoepramono, Indonesia\nAre you are looking for a helmet that gives you the best protection both day and night? Look no further! Lumos Ultra is lightweight, high quality, durable and has the most awesome front and tail lights customization that other similar helmets only can only dream of. \u2014 Stijn Buyse, Belgium\nThis is the Tesla of bike helmets. Style functionality, safety features and comfort. It\u2019s unlike any helmet I have seen on the road. This is the future of bike helmets. \u2014 Grant Leslie, Australia\nNote: \nThis timeline is for the first batch of Lumos Ultra with and without MIPS, size M-L.  \nWe estimate that sizes S and XL will be shipped out starting from Jan 2021. This is because the factory has a limited production capacity per month in order to control a high level of quality. Therefore we will be focusing on getting the more popular M-L sizes out first. \nAs this is an estimate, timelines may get pushed up or pushed back but we will give our 100% to make sure that things are completed on, or even ahead of schedule. \nAt the end of the campaign, we will send you a Backerkit survey via email.\nFrom there, you will be able to choose your: Color, MIPS-add on, size, visor and other add-ons we might release throughout the campaign.\nColor\nThe beauty of choosing your colors at the end of the campaign, is that you will be able to choose from all the new colors that we release at each stage of the campaign.\nNote: Many of the colors we are making for the Kickstarter will NOT be available for retail. If you see a color combination you really like, now might be the ONLY time to get it. \nMIPS\nIf you have already purchased the Lumos Ultra MIPS reward, you will not need to add MIPS in the survey. It will be assigned to you automatically.\nHowever, if you have bought the standard Lumos Ultra, you will still be able to purchase the MIPS add-on for the difference in price between the rewards.\nSize\nWe will be launching Ultra in small (S), medium to large (M-L) and extra large sizes (XL) so that anyone from kids to adults can have an Ultra. You will be able to choose the size you want through the Backerkit survey we send you at the end of the campaign.\nVisor\nYou will also be able to add on the attachable visor if you decide that you need one for your daily ride. The visor will retail for $25, but for this campaign, we are launching it at only $14.95.\nOther add-ons\nWe are currently working on some Lumos merchandise, ranging from other cycling gear to everyday wear items. Once we lock down the designs and start building prototypes, we will share them with you! You will also be able to buy these add-ons through the Backerkit survey.\nShipping, Taxes (and VAT) will be calculated and paid for towards the end of the campaign, before we ship the helmets out to you. During these uncertain times, shipping costs have gone up significantly, however, we do believe that the prices will go down as the situation gets better globally.\nHence, we do not think charging shipping right now, upon pledging is at the interest of our supporters as the prices today might be more expensive than that in a few months time.\nHere are our estimates of what shipping would be. \n* Prices do not include taxes and VAT. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country.\n ** Note that these prices are dependent on the situation and may increase or decrease by a few dollars in the months to come.\n\"I don't see my country as a shipping option\" : If you do not see your country as a shipping option, it means that we currently do not offer shipping to that country. However, do send us an email if you are from a country that is not shown above, we'd love to know about it. If enough of you request for it such that it makes sense logistically to ship to that country, we will add it as an option later. \n\n\n\n\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike most Kickstarter campaigns, Lumos actually has a working, mass production ready early prototype of the product (Lumos Ultra). We believe in making the best product possible and we will be making some big improvements to the design and functionality of the helmet. This means that not only will we definitely deliver the product to you, we will also deliver a product that has been perfected though all the feedback we've gotten from the early prototype we mass produced. \n\nThe Lumos team have been designing and manufacturing smart helmets for the last 5 years, and we have gotten pretty good at it. We also have very reputable and highly qualified manufacturing partners that we've been working with for the last few years.\n\nSo we feel that the risks of us not delivering a great working product as shown above, is close to zero. We are extremely confident and dedicated in delivering our products to everyone who needs one. \n\nHowever, it is important to understand that unexpected things may happen along the way, which are very hard to predict now. For example, delays in shipping can occur due to factors like viruses, travel restrictions or even, trade wars. \n\nIf any delays were to occur due to such circumstances, we will definitely consistently update all our backers with full transparency and of course, aid you with any of the doubts you have along the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe have designed Ultra to be water resistant, so that it can handle all weather conditions you bring it to. \n\nWe have also chosen the highest quality electronics in the market. We have tested a large range of electronics, and ensured that the components chosen to build Ultra have survived and surpassed levels of usage that is way above that of the final product.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe have made sure that the factory that we are working with are all abiding by the rules and regulations of the government to ensure that all waste is either recycled or disposed off correctly.\nSustainable Distribution\nThis isn't our first rodeo.

Your adventure awaits - come play it - come build it.\nInspiration for Voxelnauts is drawn from the threads of the novel Ready Player One, virtual reality, and the melding of retro gaming with the games of the future. Voxelnauts is an MMO Sandbox RPG that allows you to do anything, be anything, and go anywhere. \nOasis, Our First Planet\nEvery quest begins with a single step. Your first one is on Oasis, the planet where you\u2019ll learn how to navigate the universe of Voxelnauts. It\u2019s where you start out, but it\u2019s far from a starter planet. Use your design skills to attract NPCs who will help you on your adventure and teach you new trades and abilities. Stock up on building materials to make custom creations or buy ready-made items from the Galaxy Bazaar on Deep Space Station 1. Oasis is full of ancient ruins to explore and boundless opportunity to hunt or harvest to your heart\u2019s content without having to start from scratch.\nAncient ruins to explore!\nArchitect. Smith. Miner. Warrior. Designer. These are only some of the hats you can wear while exploring Oasis. The universe contains vast resources, exotic locations, and creatures ranging from dangerous to cuddly (sometimes both.) It\u2019s up to you to choose how you\u2019ll survive and thrive in the beautiful, but often perilous, world of Oasis and the rest of the universe.\nA mountain top village in a rain forest\nThere\u2019s plenty to do on Oasis, but the worlds beyond offer even more opportunities. From here you can become a nomad as you experience these planets and creations of other players, the Voxelnauts team, and other developers given early access to shape stunning environments for you. Collect treasure and rare resources, fight diverse monsters, and take in the sights--or settle down to make your dreams into reality on your own personal planet. You are the architect of your own adventure.\nDeep Space Station 1 - DSS1\nOrbiting above Oasis, the central hub for commerce awaits inside the Galaxy Bazaar. Here you can buy or sell just about anything: blueprints, items, pets, monsters, and even planet designs. DSS1 also features The Hall of Legends which houses NPC representations of some backers and other famous Voxelnauts. Chill out in the Arcade, meet other Voxelnauts in the private club, awe at the amazing views in the Stardeck, and join exclusive clubs with special amenities and amazing views of Oasis below.\nHyperion - Our Second Planet (PVP Stretch Goal)\nA castle built for war!\nFueled by his love of carnage, an ancient Voxelnaut berserker forged Hyperion for the ultimate Voxelnaut-vs-Voxelnaut experience. Built from nearly indestructible materials, it offers a series of unique fortresses to serve as the perfect backdrop for combat. Join a faction, capture castles, and fight for supremacy on the premier battleground of the universe.\nYour world, Your rules\nAs Voxelnauts spread across the universe from Oasis, they craft new planets to be explored and conquered.\nOnce you've terraformed a new planet, it\u2019s up to you to determine the style of gameplay, as well as the items and creatures that inhabit it. You can purchase items, creatures, and even the design of the planet itself from other users at the Galaxy Bazaar, or sell your own. Other players can travel to your planet and experience it in real-time VR. Don\u2019t worry--you can decide whether other players can alter your creations to protect your hard work.\nMaking your visions a reality: Voxels and You!\nYou can design your own furniture, items, and even yourself using the building block of the universe, the High-Definition Voxel. Gather raw materials and use them to alter your appearance and that of everything around you. The Voxelnauts suit is infinitely modifiable, so your armor, clothes, and weapons can all reflect your unique style. The quality of the HD Voxels allows for high-fidelity luxury designs of everything around.\nVoxels are building blocks that allow anyone to \u201cdoodle\u201d 3D modelling, the modern advancement from 2D pixel sprites. They\u2019re easy to use, but provide gorgeous payoff. You can even directly alter 2D pixel art into 3D Voxels to use in the universe using our tools, or integrate your preferred tools like Blender, MagicaVoxel, and more.\nWe know that building a world from scratch can be a daunting task, which is why we are open sourcing Oasis for free to everyone. With a great starting code base we hope developers and modders alike will create amazing experiences for everyone to enjoy.\nHyperion PVP Planet - Stretch Goal\n400k - Fueled by his love of carnage, an Ancient Berserker forged Hyperion for the ultimate Voxelnaut-vs-Voxelnaut experience.

Fusing the knowledge of the virtual property experts we have on board and 50 years of combined experience in gaming, our team is built of talented, dedicated people with the desire to bring a new era into the video game world.\nComing from the background of living and loving games, we set out to make what other sandbox games should have been. We are demolishing every boundary and making a game that transcends genre. Whether your taste is for collecting, combat, or creation, Voxelnauts will satisfy it. But we need your help.\nKickstarter Funding\nVoxelnauts was initially funded by $1M in capital from angel investors.  Most of the primary platform is complete; all screenshots and game footage were recorded live in-game, we have a functional multiplayer server and we are already using our own in-house tools to build content for the metaverse.  A number of team members are currently unpaid and we would like to be able to be able to compensate them for their contributions.  Our Kickstarter goal of $200,000 will be entirely allocated to pay developers and bring interns onto the team.  We are entering the final stretch to launching the Voxelnauts alpha and with your support we can make it happen!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs most of you probably know, game development is never a guaranteed process. There is always some sort of risk involved in this type of project. In fact, statistically only 37% of successfully funded projects deliver a finished product to backers. There is no 100% guarantee that we will be in that 37%. However, we are an experienced team and have shipped many games across many different platforms and collectively have decades of game development (including MMO development) experience. \n\nWe are building a metaverse - which hasn\u2019t been done before at this level. About half our team has made MMOs before, and so we have a good understanding of what to do and we are confident we can succeed. We have a solid plan for how a metaverse can work, however there are always technical hurdles that can get in the way and delay the development process. We are confident that any problems that crop up can be solved with the expertise of our team.\n\nWe have had strong financial backing from dedicated investors throughout the development process, which mitigates the chances that we will run out of money before completing our project, even if unexpected obstacles arise. Moreover, because this is a MMO, if time constraints necessitate removal of some features from the game in order to meet our release date and stay on budget, we would likely be able to include these in a future release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Retro Ronin\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nFounded by industry veterans from Starbound, Oculus VR, Naughty Dog, Id Software, Neversoft, and Red 5 Studios - RetroRonin is a games...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Voxelnauts Demo Update + Salamandria Swag!", "update_content": "Hello Voxelnauts!\nIt\u2019s been awhile, hasn\u2019t it? \nWe\u2019ve been super hard at work one the demo, new website, and store. \nSooo, on to the updates! \nWe just launched a our new website, with tons of new information, pictures, and screenshots from the Graveyard.

The game is currently in early development by Zadbox Entertainment. Quern refreshes the genre with flexible gameplay and reuseable puzzle mechanics. The visuals and the music combine traditional and modern elements providing a unique mood for the game.\n\u201cQuern is but a little fragment of the World Chain, but it has quite an important role. Civilisations rise and fall due to this world.\u201c\nAs huge fans of story-driven games and detailed narratives, we wrote and sketched the concepts of a complex and coherent world. The works of Jules Verne in particular, influenced us greatly. Our aim was to capture the mood and essence of his novels and combine that with magical, fantasy elements.\nThis universe is a structured system of worlds all connected to each other. The player assumes the role of a person, who has been trapped in one of these worlds which is a mysterious island surrounded by oceans as far as the eye could see. He finds himself in front of an entrance to a deserted ancient city.\nThe player recieves guidance from two different sources, which are both mysterious in completely different ways. One of them is a scientist, who talks to the player through letters, which are factual, rational - written with a logical approach. The other one is an ancient spirit, who makes connection with us through visions, and gives us guidance about the spirituality of the island.\nThe player soon finds out that these two guides have conflicting opinions about the island\u2019s mysteries. They both demand us to understand Quern, but while the professor wants us to experiment with the environment and manipulate it, the spirit asks us to observe and be a part of it, without physically changing anything. The letters we find contain direct instructions and answers, whereas the visions raise questions, so we find out the answers ourselves. It is up to the player to decide which guide they want to follow, but sooner or later, they must make a permanent choice.\nBefore we created the story of the stranger (the player), we wrote a whole backstory for the island itself. There were three heroes of an ancient civilisation who have been trapped in Quern long before the stranger has. They managed to understand how the operating principles work in this world and experienced a whole new way of existence. Their presence here made great consequences in their home world. They left behind fragments and the wisdom of their culture in many different forms. Thousands of years after the three heroes managed to leave the island, an archaeologist came in search of their legacy. He knew about the unrealistic nature of the island and he came here with a clear purpose, to understand it. The professor tamed the elements of the island and learned to use them for his own purposes, his knowledge has grown more powerful than he has ever imagined. However, unexpected events happened in Quern not long before the stranger arrived.\nAs we delve deeper in the story, we find hints of the happenings of the past, and these aid us in understanding our role and importance in the story.\nWATCH THE GAMEPLAY TRAILER IN HD \nThe gameplay follows the main elements of classic puzzle adventure games. We can pick up many different objects and store them in our inventory where we can inspect them and interact with them. These objects all have colourful and varied purposes. We run into hints and clues that we will need later on to solve riddles or complete puzzles. At first, we face smaller, easier, independent challenges, and as we progress, the game starts to get more complex and unpredictable.\nWHAT IS DIFFERENT?\nQuern is open world, meaning the players can freely explore and wander around the island. Putting an object in a slot and walking away is simply not our style. Of course we have keys opening gates, but in Quern most of the puzzle mechanics are reusable in some other way. As the story is progressing, we face more and more complicated challenges that might lead us back to an earlier puzzle, forcing us to re-imagine it with the extra items or knowledge we have gathered. This way the player needs to think about the game as a whole, not just as a series of individual puzzles. We also allow the player to mess with the game mechanics by not stopping them when the interaction is incorrect. The player has the chance to experience other outcomes which sometimes seem to be completely pointless. These results help the players find out how to get to the solution.\nTHE MAP SYSTEM\n Looking at the map provides the player with a better understanding of the place he is currently exploring. Different zones and locations are revealed on the map as the player wanders around the island.\nCONTROLS\nDespite believing that FPS controls give the player the perfect freedom, we are working on another option for people who are more familiar with the classic, mouse-only controls.\nTo make the game more immersive we wanted the players to be themselves instead of playing a role. One of our main concepts was to give no information about the look or the backstory of the main character. This way people can easily connect with the stranger regardless of age, gender or ethnicity.\n\nAs great fans of the MYST series, the visual style of these fantastic games have been our biggest influences. We aimed for a surreal mood to make the player curious as to what the rules of this world are, and urge them into diving deeper and deeper into its secrets. \nTo further the surrealism, we designed Quern to be a world full of contrast, yet still maintaining aspects of realism. We have a warm, sandy island in the middle of an endless ocean covered with pine trees, which are originally native to mountains. The sky is full of rain clouds but it never rains, so the ground is dry and cracked. The buildings are clearly ancient with relatively modern, mechanic additions. \nAs the puzzles get more challenging, completing them becomes even more visual and directly rewarding in addition to the progression made in the game.\n Though the island itself is highly detailed and well processed, the menu and interface design is elegant and minimalist, which fits well with the realistic graphics.\nWhen we started the development, we worked with the free version of Unity 4, but we recently transitioned to the brand new and more efficient Unity 5. This change gives our artist a new level of freedom to further improve Quern's graphics.\nWe are working on the English texts and voice over for now, but we plan to translate the game to at least three other languages: German, Spanish and Hungarian.\nFor now, we are developing the game for Windows, Mac and Linux but we hope to be able to reach PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well.\nWe are already testing Oculus Rift with satisfying results and we are eager to work with it, and make Quern a more believable experience.\nThe game in it\u2019s current state works perfectly with 4:3, 16:9 and 21:9 aspect ratios and we are working on interface optimization for 4k to make it ready for future standards.\nWe all knew each other before we started working as a video game development team. We were a group of friends with completely different professions and interests, but one thing we all had in common, was our love for games. Soon we realised that our differences complement each other, and we started working together on a test project years before Quern. It started out merely as a hobby but we turned out to be an efficient team and we all really enjoyed working together. At the time we were all university students and we had no time to finish the project.\n HOW DID QUERN START?\nQuern was originally a 3D artwork for our designer, Daniel\u2019s dissertation. It was basically a non-interactive environment design demonstration for his thesis. People\u2019s reactions to the project were far better than expected and they wanted to explore this yet unfinished world themselves. After getting his degree, Daniel started thinking about developing a game with the already created and beloved style and mood. Years have passed since the test project and we came together as a team again to create something bigger than any of us has ever done before.\nWHAT IS ZADBOX?\nWorking on video games is our dream, and we are eager to do this as a full time job. After we finish Quern, we would like to continue working together on other video games and media related projects as an official studio. For this reason we founded a company called Zadbox Entertainment.\n    The game has many different areas with their own individual moods and atmospheres. We wanted each zone to have its own unique music while still keeping the soundtrack consistent. One of the challenges was to find the right ambience for each area and to build interesting soundscapes around key scenes in the game. \nThe music is an important factor in making the gameplay even more immersive, by having it react to interactions made by the player. The soundtrack of Quern works well on its own but we had to make sure it also works as background music. It\u2019s very atmospheric with a combination of textural sounds and traditional instruments with the addition of unique musical elements for each scene.\n\nAs indie game developers we don\u2019t have a publisher to cover the expenses that come with creating a video game. This is our first major game and we would like to get feedback from as many sources as possible. Kickstarter is the best way to achieve this. Supporting us here gives us immediate feedback about the possible success of the game.\nOur biggest hope is to get enough support to fund the game so we can dedicate all of our time to the project.The money goal we set would allow us to create Quern the way we imagined it.\nWHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?\nWe dedicated most of our free time throughout the last year for the development of the game. We need your support so we can focus on Quern above anything else and invest all of our time and energy into the game. We already have plans we can work with although the game\u2019s quality, length and the amount of details all depend on the money we can invest into the development.\nBesides that, there is a fair amount of money we would like to spend on recording the voice over. We\u2019ve already got in contact with a brilliant voice actor, Michael Morris, who we think is the perfect match for the narration of Quern. We talked to him about the game and our vision and he supported us by recording the narration for our trailer. We knew we needed to work with him at the very moment we first heard his amazing voice.\nFinally there are the expenses we simply cannot avoid. Fees for the services we use, prices of the software we need to buy, renting a workplace for us, paying taxes and managing our company.\nOur money goal would allow us to finish Quern but we have further plans to improve the quality of the game and to give you more content.\nWe highly appreciate any support you can give us! Here are a few perks you can choose from when deciding on backing the project. The game will be DRM FREE.\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, go to the \u201cmanage\u201d section on the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge by the amount your desired add-on costs. (Keep in mind you can add multiple add-ons to your pledge.) These add-ons allow you to add individual items to your rewards. To be able to purchase add-ons however, you need to pledge a certain amount first.\nPlease pledge \u00a310 (\u00a38 for early birds) - \u2018Digital copy of the game\u2019 or more to get access to the following add-ons:\nand please pledge \u00a340 - \u2018Hard copy of the game\u2019 or more to get access to the following add-ons:\nAt the end of our Kickstarter campaign we will contact you to specify your add-on choices.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a video game is something we have always wanted to do so we started working on Quern out of passion. The more time we spend on it, the more we realise creating a video game is a lot more difficult and challenging than we had imagined. There are many risks involved, some of which we can\u2019t necessarily deal with without money.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for us as a newly founded company is that we have a very limited budget. We don\u2019t have a portfolio in game development to show people who we are, so we can only hope that our game itself is enough to get the community\u2019s support.\n\nAnd for the same reason, there is a chance that the game won\u2019t find its audience on Steam Greenlight. This would put us in a very difficult situation, as we would have to come up with a different solution to release the game and make it commercially available.\n\nAs well as having all the risks of the development itself, there could also be personal risks.\nThere are only four of us in our group, so if anything happens to any of us, the whole development might need to shut down, until they are able to get back to work. Since all four of us are great friends, it would be impossible to find a perfect replacement for anyone in the project. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about personal issues, apart from taking care of ourselves.\n\nThere are also technical difficulties that come with working with certain software. Ever since we started adding in puzzles and complex game mechanics, we\u2019ve faced many different technical issues. So far we have managed to overcome all of them, but it is possible that one day we\u2019ll find an issue that we simply can\u2019t fix without having to hire someone with a lot more experience than we have.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "All Rewards Shipped", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nBig news!

I getcha.  But what about the actual gameplay?  What does that look like!?!?\"  Well, good question!\nWe're so excited to bring you a mock up of what we'd like to do with it.  Think of this as a sketch!  It's not a finished game (hence, why we're looking to kickstarter for funding... otherwise we would just sell it, if it was finished!) but hopefully it gets the idea across.  Animations, art, voices, music, etc. aren't finalized... but it should get our vision for what to expect across. We've used Unreal Engine 4 as our platform to bring this idea to life, because it's an amazing piece of technology that can deliver exceptional visual fidelity.  Plus, if you're a team of artists like ourselves, this particular engine makes life 50-times easier.\nAND IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY...\nSo watch the video below!  Like we mentioned, it's an early build with plenty of things to work out, but hey, that's why we need you guys!  So watch, critique, hopefully support, and have some fun!\nGAMEPLAY PROTOYPE DEMO\nTWITCH Q&A SESSION 01 \nKINECT IS A FUN ENHANCEMENT, BUT NOT REQUIRED!\nThe Kinect is entirely optional!  As you can watch in our first twitch video above, we think it's an awesome device with tons of potential that opens up a lot of neat avenues for gameplay (especially since it allows Pisces to actual see your face and reactions!) but it's not a requirement!  Let me just repeat that: KINECT IS NOT REQUIRED TO PLAY THE LOST PISCES.\nWe understand there's plenty of folks out there that don't own a Kinect and aren't likely to buy one for our title alone. That's fine, and we want you to be able to experience the game anyway!  Plus, as an update, we'd like to bring the game to Playstation's network, and obviously that console doesn't include Kinect technology.  As you can see in our twitch Q and A video above, we have so many great things in our game for all versions. Dynamic changing worlds, rapid decision based events, mysteries and puzzles in the ruins of Atlantis, the face that all choices the gamer and Pisces make have consequences, and that interacting with Pisces and our Emotional AI is the core of our game play. And besides all of that, the story and art can stand on their own too. If you choose to play with the Kinect you are getting an enhancement layer, but it is not a core part of our experience.  \nGAMERS DESERVE SOMETHING NEW.  HERE'S OUR VISION.\nAt it's core, The Lost Pisces relies on Procedural Emotional AI... an artistic approach on how AI characters can interact and grow with you, the gamer!\nWhen we began Pisces, we wanted to give you, the gamer, a new experience. We've seen graphics get better. We've seen action evolve and new interactive peripherals emerge. But what about characters? The human being connects to characters. It's through characters that we relate to a story. And so we wanted to make a character that you'll fall in love with... because she grows to understand you. It's called Emotional AI.\nWHAT STYLE OF GAME IS THIS  \nThe Lost Pisces is a new path to gameplay. At a top level the game will play like a third person adventure style game. We blur the line of strategy, open world exploration, and elements of a FPS. But the core essence of The Lost Pisces gameplay is around building a relationship with Pisces, using our Emotional AI concept. Pisces will act as a compass to the gamer, and through your interactions you will shape her perception. It is her perception of you that is the core game mechanic to our story.\nWHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT\nWe have a vision for a new path for how we interact with a story and it's characters. We have been fortunate to have the right core team with the right skills to get us this far. But it still is a conceptual prototype. We're serious about what we put out into the world, and we wanted to make sure our ideas had a solid base before we reached out to the community. Now we have finally gotten to that point and that is why we need your help.  We want those who support us to also help us map out the path forward. To shape the path to reach as many gamers as possible, we need to fund the next stages of development. This includes bringing on additional talent to help us move our prototype into a full fledged game. In addition we utilize developing technologies and need support to push those technologies forward. We want to grow our Emotional AI into a serious new path for story telling. With funding we can take these next steps.\nWE BEGAN WITH THE LITTLE MERMAID. WE WENT FURTHER.\nHans Christian Anderson created a piece of art in 1837, named \"The Little Mermaid.\" It was a story about a creature looking for a soul. The concept of death with no continuation of consciousness terrified the character... and so she became obsessed with the idea of gaining an immortal soul. Same as a human being. That's where The Lost Pisces begins. It's a re-imagining of a beautiful, meaningful story.\nThe setting has changed... it's set sometime at the end of humanity's technological peak (though we're not saying it's set in the future... wink wink), and instead of a mythical mermaid, we've created a synthetic creature that desires the same thing... a soul. But her journey is similar. It spans an amazing science-fiction world. One filled with massive denizens that stand in the way of our Little Mermaid.\nA WORLD TEEMING WITH BEAUTY.\nSee that water in the image above? You can dive into it. In fact you'll be spending half of your time under those waves... this is a retelling of The Little Mermaid after all. The massive denizens that occupy the land are spawned from those icy depths, and they know no bounds when it comes to hunting their prey. The world beneath the surface becomes especially treacherous the more Pisces becomes human... it's hard to survive under water when you need air to breath.\nThe tides of time have drowned the world, and there's plenty of valuable items hidden in the crevices of the ocean floor. Sunken ships, cities, and technologies hold the keys to defeating your foes. The only way to reach them, is to dive in.\nTHE CHARACTER MATTERS\nThe Lost Pisces is an experiment in connecting the human to the story.\nFrom the beginning, we understood that to make you fall in love with a story, you need to fall in love with its character. We're human beings... we connect to other human beings. Empathy, passion, heartbreak, jealousy... we're complicated creatures. By nature we look for those qualities and shortcomings in the people we interact with. And so, we didn't want to construct Artificial Intelligence... we needed to grow Emotional Intelligence. Something that notices you, the gamer.\nLike The Little Mermaid's original heroine, Pisces begins her journey devoid of a soul. She's reborn into a world of emotions and dangers and personalities. Even more so, because in our version of the classic tale, she begins her journey as a machine.\nAs the story progresses, she grows to know you. And you'll grow to know her. That's what makes a good story... one where you deeply connect to the character. That's what you remember.\nA NEW WAY TO FALL IN LOVE\nWhat if she could see you? We mean, really see you. See your emotions. Could it give a piece of AI a better insight into who the gamer was? And how to react to them?\nOur faces tell each other an incredible amount of information. Without even speaking, we can communicate a great deal about our current emotional response to a situation. The gamer has to develop a relationship with Pisces. Because like the little mermaid our Pisces looses her voice as the human condition weighs on her. Communication between the gamer and the girl have to take place on a different level. A deeper level. Let's use the 3D Sensors for something more.\nSensors, such as the Kinect for Windows V.2 (along with a few others) allow for the computer to see you. The real you. The one that expresses itself subconsciously throughout the day. By watching the gamers face, Pisces will understand a deeper version of you. This is only one element of many that Pisces will use to understand you, the gamer.  And it's her response to these emotional queues that will make her more alive to the gamer. If you are to care for the character and story, you need to fall in love with her. She has to mean something to you. You, the gamer, has to want her. Want her to survive. Want her company. You need to miss her when she's not around. That will force you to remember her, and her story.\nEmotional AI\nThis is something we've been toying with for a bit. Instead of sticking with your usual path-finding and nav-mesh AI components, we wanted Pisces to have a memory. But not in the traditional sense... in a very special way. She captures moments, images, from her adventure with you. Images make up \"neural pathways\" that resemble sequences known as memories, and based upon negative or positive outcomes, these memories become a method of learning about her world and the person most important to Pisces: you, the gamer.\nThere's more coming...\nThis is just the surface of something big. There's a lot more to be revealed in time, so stay tuned to kickstarter launch, and we'll soon be adding a development blog to compliment our efforts and achievements.\nCONTRIBUTE AND BE REWARDED\nWe've worked on The Lost Pisces for over 3 years now, and while we've enjoyed every minute of it, we want to bring additional talent onto the team here at Sirenum.\nWhy? Because artists and designers feed off of one another. We act as multipliers to one another. We inspire each other, because every creative individual brings their own unique skill sets and perspective to a project. Additionally, we're a simple team of 3 artists, 1 programmer, and a writer. While Unreal Engine 4 has provided exceptional opportunities to design without the need to code, some of the more advanced features The Lost Pisces includes requires additional personalities to complete our vision.\n\nMusic, software, and marketing all cost something too. It's for these reasons that we've decided that now is a good time to seek additional funding from the indie-gaming community (or anyone really!) as we've laid much of the groundwork for the game. We would like to complete The Lost Pisces within the next 1.5 - 2 years. In order to do this, we need crowdfunding support.\nWe've compiled a list of compelling rewards for those who choose to contribute, and encourage you to look at them yourself. As a \"thank you for believing in our vision,\" anyone who contributes $15 or more will receive the game, be included on insider info, and invited to provide feedback as a part of the community. Anyone contributing $30 or more will be provided with BETA access when we're at that stage, and so those patrons will be able to experience the game as we develop it... which we think is pretty exciting.\nLet's do this. Coming to XBOX, PC, and Playstation. Everyone's happy.\nIf you're here, let me thank you for at least checking our project out. That's huge enough that you saw something special in The Lost Pisces. If you choose to contribute, then thank you even more for taking a chance on our project and our team.\nThe Lost Pisces is a part of me. It's like a child that I've watched evolve and grow into something i couldn't have imagined in the beginning. It's taken a lot to get it to here. A lot of sleepless evenings. A lot of weekends given up. It's not a matter of martyrdom... its a passion. It's a love for the piece of art and an absolute devotion to its eventual completion.\nOne of the reasons I avoided launching a crowdfunding campaign up until now has been because I wanted to be confident that what I offered on the campaign site was achievable. There's been rashes of dishonest characters in the crowdfunding community that have unfortunately resulted in over-promising results that were never very likely to succeed. That's unfortunate, because crowd funding is an amazing phenomenon that has propelled many otherwise impossible-to-fund ideas into the consciousness of the populous. It's brought products and artwork to life that would never have seen the light of day, had it not been for the generous and confident backers who provided that funding. They've donated money while knowing the risks involved, and as a result of their selflessness we have a more imaginative society.\nSo crowdfunding is something special. I don't take it lightly. And as a result, I promise that our team will devote themselves to trying to finish this game the way that we've dreamed it should be. We will try our hardest... and then try some more.\nThe Lost Pisces has taken 3 years to get to a crowd-funding point because our team has lofty goals... most of which were initiated by myself. But we believe we can deliver on the ideas we've set forth here, on this website, and in the crowdfunding campaigns. We believe we can construct an amazing new AI that builds a relationship with the gamer. And we believe that using a Kinect for Windows, or the XBOX ONE Kinect in subtle ways, will enhance the gameplay for some truly unique experiences to play out between a real-life gamer, and their digital female companion... our Little Mermaid... Pisces.\nPisces is a character I think you'll fall in love with. Because unlike other NPCs (non-player characters), she will create a memory of her experiences with you. She will imprint her surroundings and experiences with you. She'll see subtle expressions in your face. A smile, a look of confusion, bored expression, and frustration. She will learn from your actions in game in her own way, and in doing so, I hope she'll become someone to you. Not just some-thing.\nREWARDS!!!!  Cuz that's what you really want anyway.\nAlright so we've put together some pretty cool rewards for anybody who helps out.  Whether you donate a little or a lot, you'll still get something fun (and a sense of being an awesome person, of course) that you can treasure forever, and look back fondly upon this moment as a time when you helped The Lost Pisces become a reality!  Exciting.\nSo check out the gifts we've come up with.  And if you have another awesome idea, just let us know!  We'll consider it.  We like awesome ideas.\n\nIT'S COME A LONG WAY...\nAnd finally some of the art that led to the game you see before you!  It's always fun to see how thing came to be, so take a quick look through the gallery... you'll see how the game appeared back when we were first concepting it out in Unity, as well as some sketches and other work.  We figured it would be good to look back at how The Lost Pisces came to be where it is today... we hope you do too!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere's plenty of challenges along the way... after all, this is an experiment in uncharted waters.\n\nHowever we're a group of designers by trade, familiar with the many stumbling blocks and pitfalls that any creative en-devour can experience. We encounter constraints and tricky situations continuously, and understand that adapting the vision to meet the technical limitations is something that any artist has to deal with. But we wholeheartedly believe that we are at the beginnings of something magical. Something impressive. Something that will change perceptions of what AI should be.\n\nThat said, we've been working on this project for a few years now. While we had planned to release the project to crowdfunding a while ago, we chose to hold off until now, when we believe we can create something fun and engaging that plays with the gamer as much as the gamer plays with it! We're of course faced with the usual project constraints... budget, time, and resources. Items such as motion capture can be quite expensive and timely, and there is of course the fact that the Unreal Engine 4 is still a work in progress, making it challenging to finalize certain items. But in the end, we've gotten a fair amount of the leg-work down for the general concept. The idea and characters and world are in place, and we want to continue to develop the project to its fullest potential. This is an experiment! It's a fun one... a game trying to do something different. So let's have fun building it together!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dan Rutkowski\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nTHIS IS OUR BABY CROWDFUNDING IS SOMETHING WE TAKE SERIOUSLY, AND WE ASK FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE.

You take on the role of an employee working for a dystopian corporation called A.Q.U.A. carrying out their oceanic operations. As you explore the open ocean you'll discover supernatural wreck sites, ancient artifacts, lost treasure, and dark secrets. Neptune Flux is inspired by games like Myst, Minecraft, Fallout, Bioshock, and classic Lucas Arts point-and-click adventures. If you like story-driven exploration, this game is for you.\n Neptune Flux will be available for Windows & Mac. It can also be experienced on VR headsets like the Oculus Rift, however a VR headset is not required; you get to decide how you want to play.\nStretch Goals\nNeptune Flux is getting close to funded, so it's time to announce some stretch goals. I sent out a survey to backers recently asking what everyone would like to see, and overwhelmingly the response was a PlayStation 4 release and more content. So let's do both!\nPLAYSTATION 4 RELEASE - $9,500\nI've been exploring the possibility of a PS4 release for a few months now, and at this juncture, it's simply a matter of having the extra cash to do it! Releasing on the PS4 would be huge because it would help give the game more life beyond next year's initial release, including future updates.\nCAVES - $11,000\nThe terrain in Neptune Flux will have lots of trenches and pits, but one of the technology limitations of Unity (the game engine running Neptune Flux) is that it's technically challenging do caves that actually go underneath the terrain. But I still want you, the players, to be able to explore cave systems and experience a new part of the story. Extra funding will go towards contracting a 3D artist to help build out some of the cave assets, which will free up my time to do the programming involved in making caves work.\nSARAH'S PROLOGUE - $14,000\nLet's shoot for the moon! :) The writer for Neptune Flux, Brandon Tenney, has a fantastic prologue written for the game that sets up some of Sarah's backstory. Presently, this is going to be mostly voice over as opening credits play, but it would be way cooler to make this an intense playable part of the game. Extra funding will go towards more voice acting along with contracting a character animator to help flesh out a playable prologue that reveals more of Sarah's past.\nStory\nThe world above the water is a dust bowl and an escape into space is just out of technology's reach; humanity's last and best hope of survival is the untouched ocean depths, and A.Q.U.A. is the global conglomerate tasked with colonization preparations and resource harvesting.\nA.Q.U.A.'s funding comes from political puppeteers, desperate celebrities, and shadow governments all hoping to escape to a new beginning while the rest of the world ends in a whimper. A.Q.U.A. has over promised a bright future and now there's pressure to deliver.\nIn Neptune Flux, you take on the role of Sarah, an A.Q.U.A. employee trying to keep her mind off of her troubled past. Working for A.Q.U.A. means being in the dark, literally and figuratively. Sarah has learned to stop asking questions about her missions, but when her assignments become increasingly unusual, she begins her quest to learn the truth. As Sarah uncovers the ocean floor, she finds more than just sand and lost cargo.\nGlow-in-the-Dark Sonar T-Shirt\nA new reward level has been added that includes a super comfortable American Apparel shirt with glow-in-the-dark ink! All higher reward levels will also include this shirt featuring the visual sonar iconography seen in the game.

It's like a classic point-and-click adventure game for the modern age.\nIn the deep sea there\u2019s no natural sunlight, so you\u2019ll need to use tools on your vessel to see in the dark. Your dive pod is equipped with flood lights, but you can also use other tools like flares and more advanced upgrades like visual sonar. A.Q.U.A. headquarters will give you missions to accomplish, but you\u2019re also free to explore the open world and discover supernatural wreck sites, ancient artifacts, and lost treasure. Successful missions and treasure are immediately rewarded with cash, which can be used for upgrades to your dive pod at any A.Q.U.A. base.\nAs you carry out missions and explore the sea floor, you\u2019ll advance through the main storyline, and learn about some of the dark secrets that lurk below.\nArtwork\nThe ocean floor can be a beautiful place; from sunken ships to coral reefs to futuristic underwater bases, Neptune Flux features an incredibly detailed setting that's filled with amazing places to explore.\nNeptune Flux uses the Unity 5 game engine and takes advantage of physically based rendering, image based lighting, and global illumination; all combining to create a beautiful and dynamic virtual world.\nThe game can be played on a traditional computer screen or with a VR headset. Both experiences are immersive and fun! If you do choose to play the game with a VR headset, you'll also be able to explore the ocean in stunning stereoscopic 3D and look around in 360 degrees at the interior of your dive pod!\nSound\nAn immersive experience like Neptune Flux would not be complete without a vivid soundscape. You'll hear every bubble, sonar ping, and flare in exceptional clarity. Neptune Flux uses positional audio to help capture the full spectrum of sounds all around your dive pod as you explore.\nPLAY\n\nThe game will also feature an original score by Chris Zabriskie. You can learn more about Chris and his work in the \"Collaborators\" section below.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nIt's now possible for individuals and small teams to create fun video games, music, movies, and more. This digital democratization is enabled by powerful software and hardware tools that save time and close the gap between inspiration and creation.\nMaking a game like Neptune Flux involves software subscription fees for a game engine, 3D modeling software, texturing software, licensing fees, code plugins, and more. It also involves several pieces of development hardware that are updated frequently, such as the Oculus Rift development kits and hardware upgrades to support them. There are also costs involved with delivering the game to some distribution platforms. None of these things are expensive on their own, but taken together, it can add up.\nAnd that's just the beginning! There are lots of cool enhancements I have in mind for Neptune Flux and Kickstarter is a great way to fuel their creation. If this project is successfully funded before the deadline, stretch goals will be announced that will make the game even better.\nCollaborators\nZoxide Games is a one person company created by me, Nick Pettit. By day I teach 100k students how to make websites through Treehouse, an online school that teaches web design, web development, mobile development, and much more. I've worked on many large software projects in the past, including mission critical applications in the healthcare field. I am the one solely responsible for the end product and I will deliver. If you have any questions for me, feel free to send a Kickstarter message or tweet to me; I'm @nickrp on Twitter. This project wouldn't be possible without the help of a few talented artists. Games are an interdisciplinary medium, so it takes a lot of different skills to make it all work together. Other talent may be added as development continues, but here's the roster so far.\nBrandon Lee Tenney is a screenwriter living in Los Angeles, California. Earlier this year, Brandon sold his feature film script THEY CAME FROM ABOVE to Focus Features with Appian Way attached to develop and produce. Brandon traffics most often in grounded science fiction thrillers via film and TV scripts as well as short stories and long form prose. He has a keen interest in viewing our future through the lens of our present in hopes of learning the lessons present in our past. Brandon and Nick have known each other for well over a decade and have collaborated on many short films, web content, and various other flights of fancy throughout the years that Nick has always managed to hone into reality. Brandon is represented by William Morris Endeavor and Art/Work Entertainment and lives with his soon-to-be wife, Melissa, and their two cats, Barnaby and Liam.\nChris Zabriskie is a music producer and composer who specializes in ambient soundscapes and minimalism. Songs from his Creative Commons-licensed albums can be heard around the world in everything from YouTube videos to Academy Award-nominated films, and his clients include NPR, adidas, Kotaku, BBC, Major League Soccer, The Museum of Modern Art, and many, many more. His music can also be heard in dozens of video games, including Mind: Path of Thalamus and the upcoming A Light in Chorus. Chris first met Nick while working together at Treehouse, and, despite his best efforts, he has yet to defeat Nick in a game of Hearthstone. Chris lives in Orlando, Florida with his wife, son, and cat.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny idea worth pursuing involves risks and challenges, and making a video game is no exception. It's a balancing act to invent interesting gameplay, build software that works as intended, write an engrossing story, and bring it all to life with artwork and sound. The interdisciplinary nature of games is both exciting and stressful; it's beautiful when a game starts to harmonize and become more than just the sum of its parts, but it takes a lot of iterations to get there.\n\nI am well prepared to overcome these challenges. My background in both art and programming includes many long-term interdisciplinary projects and I thrive at the intersection of art and technology. My experience includes everything from putting on art shows to writing mission-critical healthcare software to teaching hundreds of thousands of students online. I've been working on Neptune Flux for over a year now and my passion for the project has only grown stronger. There may be bumps in the road ahead, but with my experience and the progress I've made so far, I'm confident I can overcome just about anything that might stand in the way.\n\nIf you back this project, I promise to keep you informed of the game's progress on a regular basis and deliver the best video game that I can make.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "HORIZON - A sci-fi novel from the writer of Neptune Flux", "update_content": "Hey backers!\nI hope you're all doing well in these turbulent times.

It's also got 7 Japanese-English combinatory pixel language modes, both for the dialogue and interface.\nIt's inspired by SRPGs such as D\u2665sgaea and F\u2665nal F\u2665ntasy Tactics and platformers such as Ice Cl\u2665mber and Super M\u2665rio World, with game mechanics inspired by the works of psychiatrists and psychologists such as Hermann Rorschach, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud: repressed emotions & psychiatric transformations, psychoanalytical spell-like abilities, a Rorschach inkblot treasure system, flashbulb-memory treasure mechanics, and more.\nSpinal Blast follows the story of Ulyss and Tay, two space explorers who get lost in Psychoreality after falling into a wormhole while trying to take a shortcut through space. They become separated from their crew members, and it's up to them to find them and discover how to escape from Psychoreality.\nPsychoreality is a dimension where all of your worst fears and emotions come true. When you reach various heights of Anger, Stress, or Sorrow, you can transform into monstrous incarnations of your psychological state. Ulyss, Tay, and all of the people they discover stranded with them in Psychoreality -- have therefore become psychiatric fighters par excellence.\nUlyss and Tay's goal is to gather an army of these psychological fighters and, uniting with their spaceship crew, burst out of Psychoreality and back into their home dimension.\nSpinal Blast is their story, and you're in for their wildly cute and action-packed ride.\nIn the following sections we'll brief you on the game mechanics.\nSpinal Blast is structured like a classic SRPG (think D\u2665sgaea, F\u2665nal F\u2665ntasy Tactics) with colorful retro graphics. It also features various platformer elements, such as in-battle coin-collecting, treasure hunting, and an interactive environment with discoverable items.\nYou'll build an army, explore Psychoreality and try to help Ulyss and Tay (they're on the title divider above) find their spaceship crew members and escape Psychoreality, all the while interacting with the native psychocitizens of the dimension, collecting Anger, Stress, and Sorrow for a myriad of purposes: to transform into psychological monster forms, to access story routes, and to activate spell-like psychological abilities.\nThe game has other features such as a Rorschach treasure system where characters read inkblots to gain items according to their personality, and a freshness mechanic that, instead of salvaging items after combat, lets you obtain treasures during combat for double payoff.\nAlso included are 7 language modes of graphical and font-type combinations of English and Japanese. The Japanese text also has a furigana option. Furigana are transliterations of the more complex characters (kanji) in Japanese.\n\u2605All-Pixel Intro Sequence & Title Screen\u2605\nThe game begins with a classic all-pixel introduction sequence (skippable of course -- screenshot preview at the top) that are the mainstays of classic retro RPGs. Next comes the title screen (above). It has the following features:\n\u272a New Game - Start a new game / new game+. Every time you complete a campaign route of a game, you can start the game with other new routes unlocked. Inspired by Visual Novels.\n\u272a Load Game - Load a previous save game. There will be 5 save slots.\n\u272a Options -The 7 language options are located in here. You can also \"reset\" the number of new game+ playthroughs so you can start the game fresh with the first routes. (Not recommended unless you've thoroughly enjoyed every last route first!)\n\u272a Credits - Our backers are listed here according to tier.\n\u272a Handwritten Thank You Section - Hardcoded thank-you section from Aftertype Games staff: our personal message to you is handwritten in here. All backers who pledge at least $70/100 get this.\n\u2605The Psychoreality World Map\u2605\nHere's a tiny peek at part of the Psychoreality world map. The world map system is inspired by adventure platformers.\n\u272a Explore themed SRPG levels - conquer independent SRPG levels with various psychological, psychiatric, and anatomical themes. \"Spinopolis\" and \"Pituitaria\" are included here. Some other names are: Oblongatia, Medullania, Egoland (there are some big enemies there), and Shyworld.\n\u272a Unique Treasure and Skills in Timed Bonus Levels - Timed bonus levels also feature special treasures and skills not found anywhere else.\n\u272a EXP and Progress Meter - You can take a break from any themed level at any time and return to it later. the EXP and Progress meters mark how far you've gotten. Bonus Levels are the only levels you cannot leave in the middle of. Once you leave, these disappear, so get as far as you can.\n\u2605Recruitment, Reserves, and Army Formation\u2605\nThe army formation screen lets you view all of the characters you've ever recruited. You can have up to 100 characters in your reserves.\n\u272a Party Leader decides Active Army Size - You will choose a Party Leader. The Level of this leader designates how many characters can join the active party.\n\u272a Recruit Psychocitizens, Psychodenizens, and Crew Members - Build your army by recruiting Psychocitizens (from towns and other places), persuading Psychodenizens (the native humanoid incarnation of emotions) to join, and finding your own lost crew members.\n\u272a Learn psychological abilities from Psychodenizens - Place Psychodenizens in the active party to have all party members learn abilities from them.\n\u2605Classical SRPG Mechanics and More\u2605\nSpinal Blast has a solid SRPG foundation with its own bells and whistles:\n\u272a Turn based grid style mass combat - Strategically command large psychological armies formed from a reserve of up to 100 characters, with active party size depending on the Party Leader's level.\n\u272a SRPG Stats: Counter%, Accuracy%, Critical% - convenient hover-on info displays tactical stats relating to attacking an enemy.\n\u272a SRPG Use of space: Range and Area of Melee Attacks - Melee attacks in Spinal Blast have a Range and Area property. Some attacks reach farther, some hit more than one enemy at once in different patterns. Choose what's best for your army when you set up your active party.\n\u272a In-battle Treasures - Treasure is present and will randomly generate onto the battlefield. Some are things like coins and stat boosts, and some are treasure chests that contain items which may not be found in stores througout Psychoreality. All treasures are salvaged at median value after combat. (see Freshness Effect below.)\n\u272a Freshness Effect - All items are salvaged from the playing field at median value after combat. However, if you collect them during combat (and risk being hit by enemies by doing so) you can gain them at twice the bonus, and items will even be upgraded into their next tiers. This is inspired by the psychological intensity of short term memory.\n\u2605Rorschach Treasure System: Inkblot Readings Create Treasure\u2605\nSpinal Blast has a treasure system influenced by the work of the psychologist Dr. Rorschach of inkblot fame. Characters must read inkblots contained in treasure chests, and the treasure chests create items based on the character's psychological reaction to the inkblot. This usually results in items that the current character hates, but is important or immensely powerful to other party members -- so plan accordingly.\n\u2605Collect Psychoenergies: Anger, Stress, and Sorrow.\u2605\nIn Psychoreality, Anger, Stress, and Sorrow are the basic units of psychological energy. They're obtained through interactions, conversations, and during combat through a variety of ways and are used for a variety of things.\n\u272a Collect Anger - Anger is collected through appropriately angering interactions and dialogue. It's also collected during combat by being directly hit by an enemy attack.\n\u272a Collect Stress - Stress is collected through stressful roleplaying situations. It's also collected during combat by being close to a team member who is hit by an enemy attack.\n\u272a Collect Sorrow - Sorrow is collected through sad roleplaying moments. It's also gradually collected through combat by remaining damaged without being healed.\n\u2605Therapeutic Transformations and Special Abilities\u2605\nOnce you have a certain amount of Anger, Stress, or Sorrow, you can activate Transformations or use Special Abilities.\n\u272a Transformations - Turn into monstrous incarnations of extreme psychological states. Some examples include Paranoia, Desperation, Hatred, and Melancholy. Transformations upgrade the basic combat stats of the character, improve the character's melee attack stats (counter%, range, and area of attack), and allow use of Transformation-only special abilities. Transforming uses up a lot of psychoenergy, and there's an upkeep cost of psychoenergy each round for the character to stay transformed. So please budget your Anger, Stress, and Sorrow wisely.\n\u272a Special Abilities - Psychological special abilities are spell-like actions that range from neuron synapse attacks, brain-storm generators, to telepathy and the empathic transfer of psychoenergies to other units. These use up a modest amount of psychoenergy. These are either native to Transformations or learned.\n\u2605Special Abilities can be gained from two sources:\u2605\n\u272a Abilities native to Transformations - Many transformations have their own unique special abilities. Characters can access these only when transformed. Many of them are destructive, awe-inspiring area spells and field attacks which are not possible in the regular human form.\n\u272a Abilities learned from Psychodenizens - Abilities from Psychodenizens function similarly to spells and can be learned by any playable character in your roster.\nAll special abilities, being psychologically derived, scale with the character's Level and three psychoenergy levels.\n \u2605English & Japanese: 7 Language Modes\u2605\nWhether you're fluent in English or Japanese or wish to practice either language, Spinal Blast also doubles as a nice language practicing tool, all while playing a video game.\n\u272a 2 Monolingual Modes - Monolingual English, Monolingual Japanese.\n\u272a 2 Bilingual Modes - Bilingual English-Japanese, Bilingual Japanese-English.\n\u272a 3 Furigana-enabled Modes - Monolingual Japanese, Bilingual Eng-Jpn, Bilingual Jpn-Eng.\nAftertype Games is an independent video game development studio consisting of die-hard retro and JRPG fans.\nWe're eager to make RPGs and RPG-inspired games just like how we remember enjoying them. Every game is an attempt at recreating the feeling we used to have of playing our favorite classic retro RPGs.\nWe strive to make every game multilingual with several language options, and enjoy working on hand drawn pixel animation and illustrations. We like to keep the old-school alive, infuse it with heart and soul, and give it a touch of the new and the different. And of course, we hope that you enjoy the games that we make.\nOur role model is FF4/FF6 and Chrono Trigger era Sq\u2665resoft. With your help and support, we'd like to make games that come close to being just as engrossing -- it's a goal that we won't stop at until we've fulfilled one day, and Spinal Blast is one of our steps toward that goal.\nWith your help, we'd like to have Spinal Blast finished by June 2016. That's one year, and we'll be working hard to make sure we can get it to you earlier.\n \u2606 Featured by \u2606\nUmbra, Extra Mana", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCertainly there are numerous obstacles that come with creating any video game.

We've slogged through tons of illustrations and sprite animation made from scratch, and we're determined not to let all of that come to naught.

Yet odd and troubling events have started happening recently. A powerful radio signal has suddenly begun broadcasting from the topmost tower, and the locals have reported sightings of strange lights moving in the mist.\nYears ago it was once the home of an odd and reclusive family, but they have not been seen or heard from in many years. With the sudden activity the townspeople begin to recall old tales of ghostly figures, violent storms, and vast swarms of eerie lights.\nAfter years of silence something inside the castle has awoken, its identity and purpose unknown. It's up to you to venture inside and discover the truth!\nThe Eyes of Ara is a modern evolution of a classic genre, built upon inspiration from old classics like Myst, through to modern games that focus on exploration-based puzzles and environmental storytelling, such as the 2013 Tomb Raider.\nYou will explore an immersive, fully 3D environment, riddled with secret rooms and hidden passageways. Each room contains multiple puzzles and hidden secrets, ranging from simple lock-and-key style puzzles to complex multi-stage puzzles that may even span multiple rooms throughout the level.\nEach puzzles leads intrinsically to the next, but not all of them need to be solved in a predetermined order. You are free to explore the castle and tackle many puzzles at different times, unlocking more rooms or returning to complete previously inaccessible puzzles as you progress.\nEvery puzzle in the game is unique, and beyond the main puzzles each level contains a series of advanced, optional puzzles, that once solved will reveal the true secret of the castle.\nFurthermore, after completing the main story each level also includes a host of further secrets to discover - Including the lost stories of the castle\u2019s occupants, hidden treasures, and secret bonus rooms.\nOnly by solving these puzzles and finding these hidden items will you achieve 100% completion.\nThe Castle\nThe Castle is split up into four areas, with one Chapter of the game taking place in each.\nThe Undisturbed Halls: Explore the great halls and antechambers of the Castle's ground floor. Work your way through its ancient corridors while an ominous presence awakes at this unexpected disturbance.\nThe Silent Home: Wander among the bedrooms of the former occupants and discover their stories. Search for secrets and clues in the Library and investigate the the story behind the increasing number of mechanical creatures now tracking your every move.\nThe Great Tower: Computers and complex scientific equipment litters the floors of the Great Tower, while the generator in its depths supplies power to the castle. Investigate the mysterious research that took place here, and uncover the truth of the strange creatures.\nThe Tower of Night: Only after solving the bonus puzzles in the previous Chapters will you unlock the sealed door at the base of the tower. Climb the steps to the roof of the tallest tower and discover the final secret in this Epilogue to The Eyes of Ara.\nI'm a Senior 3D Environment Artist and Level Designer by trade, something I've been doing in the Australian Games Industry for over ten years now. So when it came to creating The Eyes of Ara I wanted to draw upon this experience and build a game in which the environment was the central character.\nThe Eyes of Ara tells its story, not by relying on characters and cut scenes, but organically through exploration and interaction with the environment. This technique, known as Environmental Storytelling, is central to the Eyes of Ara experience.\nThe story is told visually through the puzzles you solve, the items you collect, and the dusty old artifacts scattered throughout the environment. Hurriedly abandoned rooms, cluttered desks, and cobweb covered trinkets all serve to tell a visual story and give insight into the lives of the castle's former occupants.\nThe Eyes of Ara also utilities more traditional storytelling techniques. Throughout the game you will locate notes, journals, computer logs, artworks and more. Delving into to each of them will reveal a little more about the history of the lost family and the secret of the strange presence.\nHowever, simply completing all of the puzzles and finishing the game will not reveal the full story. It\u2019s up to you to search through the rooms, discover the hidden compartments, and put all of the pieces together. Only then will you understand the complete picture. The Eyes of Ara is not a game that holds your hand, this is a mystery that you will have to solve for yourself.\nThe Eyes of Ara is built upon the Unity3D game engine, and all of the screenshots and videos that you see here are captured in-game running in real time from the PC version.\nAfter previous experience using Unity, it was obvious that The Eyes of Ara would utilize this technology. Its streamlined development pipeline, ease of use, and one-click deployment quickly made it my engine of choice.\nThanks to Unity\u2019s versatility, The Eyes of Ara will be available on multiple platforms. The game will ship first on PC and Mac with features designed to take full advantage of the power of these platforms. This version features exclusive content designed with desktop gaming in mind, as well as high resolution art, detailed pixel shaders, and beautiful post-effects such as Depth of Field and Screen Space Ambient Occlusion. \nFollowing this initial release, a version optimized for mobile and tablet platforms will be made available at a later date. This version will feature a redesigned UI for small touchscreens, optimized graphics, and revised puzzle interaction to meet the unique playstyle of these platforms.\n100 Stones Interactive was founded by myself, Ben Droste, with the dream of forming my own games studio. I am a ten year veteran of the Australian Games Industry, working as a Senior 3D Environment Artist and Level Designer.\nDuring my career I have worked on a lot of professional titles and a range of personal projects, but after SEGA Studios Australia shut down in 2013 I decided that it was time to carve out my own path. It was time for me to work on my own games, tell my own stories, and craft my own experiences.\nThe Eyes of Ara marks the beginning of this endeavor, the first step on the road to realising my dream of becoming a purely independent game developer.\nBut this dream needs your help to become a reality. So if you are a fan of adventure games, or would simply like to help an independent studio get its start, I hope you will join me in this endeavor and support The Eyes of Ara.\nFind me on social media: Facebook | Twitter | YouTube\nKickstarter offers a wonderful opportunity for small, independent developers such as myself to fund their dreams without having to tie themselves down to publishers. With the community's support, it allows developers to build the games we want to build, and cater specifically to the fans we want to cater to. We can build detailed games for specific audiences, without a publisher demanding that we dumb the game down for mass market appeal.\nYour support means that you, the player, gets to have input into the games you want to play. A chance to influence the genre\u2019s you love, and help shape the future of independent development. Kickstarter represents an amazing future for independent game development, and it\u2019s exciting to be a part of it.\nI have already invested a lot of my own funds into the development of The Eyes of Ara, and funding from Kickstarter will be used to help complete the vision I have for the game and bring it to market. It will help pay for expenses such as software licences, hardware, asset creation, marketing, and legal costs.\nThanks to everyone's amazing support The Eyes of Ara has been officially Greenlit! This means that everyone who pledges $10 or more for a copy of the game will have the option to claim their copy through Steam (a DRM free option will also be available though another distribution service).\nThis is very exciting news for me as a small, one-man indie studio. As one of the largest game distribution platforms on the web, having my game on Steam is a big deal. So thank you all again for helping to make this possible.\nYou can view the Greenlight page here.\nAchieving the initial Funding Goal will allow allow me to develop the core vision for The Eyes of Ara, but should the target be exceed, all extra funds will go towards creating an ever better experience.\nThe first stretch goal will see The Eyes of Ara localized into multiple languages, expanding the audience and allowing more players to enjoy the game. This goal value is based off correspondence from professional translation services.\nFurther stretch goals will fund additional Chapters, released as free downloadable updates after the game ships. The first of these will be the Castle Grounds, featuring a unique exterior art set (some early in-game concept of which can be seen in the screenshots above and in the opening shot of the trailer). This goal value is based off the estimated workload for creating this unique Chapter.\nNew rewards have been added to certain tiers!\nNOTE: Kickstarter does not allow the text of reward tiers in the sidebar to be edited once someone has pledged in them, so they will not show these new additions. Feel free to contact me with any questions.\nPicture in the Backer's Gallery is now included in all tiers of \u201cTrailblazer\u201d ($45) and above. If you pledge enough to get the Beta, you get your picture in the gallery.\nThe Backer's Book reward is now available for all tiers of \u201cArchaeologist\u201d ($150) and above. Scattered throughout the castle you will find hidden books dedicated to Backers. Each backer with this reward will have a place in a book, which includes:\nYour picture on one page.\nA short message by you on the adjacent page (a story, a poem, whatever you wish to say).\nNaturally, there will be an achievement for finding and reading all of the Backer Books :)\nPhysical Copies of the Game & Soundtrack are now available as an optional inclusion for backers of the Field Agent ($100) tier or above. This two-disk set contains a copy of the game on DVD and the soundtrack on Audio CD.\nThis reward is optional and replaces 1 digital copy of the game (at no extra charge). After the end of the campaign, you will receive a survey in which you can opt to replace one of your digital copies with a physical copy.\nBecome A Prior Owner of the Castle is available for the new reward tier: \"Historical Figure\". The Castle has a long and troubling history, and stories of the former lords and ladies that resided there all tell a similar tale: They became reclusive, prone to unsettling and lucid dreams, and some say driven to madness in their isolation. It is even said that many of them took to locking themselves away for days on end, and attempting to commune with ghosts and spirits.\nPaintings of these people can still be found throughout the castle. At this reward tier you can name one (with your name or a made up one), and if you wish, have your likeness used for the painting.\nThe Backer's Gallery Secret Room\nA special, hidden room located somewhere in the castle, this room is a special acknowledgement to all the backers for making this game possible, allowing you to leave a lasting impression in the game that you helped to create.\nInside you will find extra bonus puzzles, hidden pickups, commentary from the developer, and special backer recognition: a Portrait Gallery displaying the pictures of backers who contributed $45 or more, with large scale portraits of the Top-tier backers alongside details of the art and puzzles they designed for the game.\nThe Backer's Gallery Secret Room A special, hidden room located somewhere in the castle, this room is a special acknowledgement to all the backers for making this game possible, allowing you to leave a lasting impression in the game that you helped to create.

While this was a considered and deliberate decision for my own personal development as a game developer, it also means that the biggest risk is the limit of my personal skill set. As such, all of the budgeting, scheduling, and design decisions for the game were made with this in mind.\n\nPlaying to my strengths, the design of The Eyes of Ara focuses heavily on environmental art and intricate level design.\nThe support of friends and colleagues from my time in the industry has been, and continues to be invaluable in areas of development in which I have less experience.\n\nLong before any art was in the game, multiple levels were completed and fully playable in a \"grey-box\" state. It was only once this major milestone had been accomplished to my satisfaction did work begin on the art you see above.\n\nWith the bulk of the programming and design tools already developed, all that remains is to complete production of the remaining levels. This means that the game can scale easily.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I am confident that I will achieve my goals for The Eyes of Ara.

We love games that require you to replay and go down different routes in order to get the full story, rather than a \"one and done\" approach.\nWhat we've set out to create is a titan of a VN, with an estimated count of almost half a million words. At average reading speed, that's nearly 30 hours worth of story to read, with as much replay value as we can stuff in.\nThe game's set in Japan, in the relatively near future. Still this century, but a couple decades from now. Advancements in fields like robotics have made a lot of jobs redundant, and nearly omnipresent devices like smartphones have the done the same for face-to-face conversation. HRP as a game examines the impact that technologies like these have on our lives and relationships. Within the story, the Human Reignition Project is a small group formed by one old lecturer; a relic of a more personal generation. He'd like to see things go back closer to the way they were.\nWe're not trying to teach a lesson or anything like that, though. It's setting and flavor, instead of a moral approach. We also blend in some light science fiction elements, and even some aspects of action/thriller stories, as a shadowy organization on the outside begins to make their presence known.\n Not everyone in our story has such questionable goals, though. The main cast of the heroines are really, at their core, just a bit lonely. Check 'em out.\nWe're working with extremely talented artists to help bring our game to life. In order to maintain such a high standard throughout the rather beefy duration of the game, we're looking to raise upwards of twenty thousand dollars. Every penny earned goes to making The Human Reignition Project even more visually and audibly stunning, with stretch goals for an expanded CG count, extended soundtrack, and even full-motion video.\nWe've made it this far through the gracious assistance of our publisher, Sekai Project, who supported us financially to help complete the demo. Now, we're turning to you to help us carry that on. Those of us at Alienworks have already invested significant amounts of our own savings into the project, and will continue to do so as much as we can. The fact of the matter, though, is that we're all college students or retail workers, and our personal funds are pretty limited. The writers of our team have opted against taking a share of the funding raised in order to allow everything to go towards improving art and sound. Plus, Pytom's famous Ren'Py engine, upon which our game is built, makes coding a snap.\nThe funding goal of 22,000 is what we anticipate it'll cost to complete the game to our minimum standards. That's about 60 unique backgrounds and roughly 15 CG's per route, once fees and reward fulfillment have been accounted for.\nOne of the prints we'll be selling at Anime Expo, by Rosuuri\nAnime Expo poster print by Shiyun\nAlienworks formed in late 2012, inspired, like many others, by the surprise hit VN, \"Katawa Shoujo.\" We've grown a lot from the starry-eyed bunch of amateurs that we were back then, and now make up one of the most talented Western visual novel development groups. I'm probably a little biased though.\nAnyway, we've been working on the Human Reignition Project for the better part of the last two years, though frequent hiccups and changes in staff left our initial progress slow. It was around the time of July 2014 that we started making some serious overhauls to the writing team, and when we changed sprite artists towards the end of that year, HRP began to turn into something pretty special.\nNow, we're working with people whose talent can't be overstated, with the goal of creating the best Western visual novel to date. We hope that you believe in us, too.\nMusic Samples:\nStill Life:\n Concrete Jungle:\n Old Spice:\n Lost:\n One Day:\nWhen searching for artists, we looked to build a team that's both cute and eye-catching, and that would help us stand out from the crowd. To that end, we have three CG artists: Rosuuri and Shiyun, whose work can be seen just above, as well as Hibiki, who did our campaign header image . Our resident master-of-moe, Myuto, is behind sprites, a few CG's, and also the cute graphics that you see accenting this page.\nAdditionally, backgrounds are currently being handled by zydaline, who's working hard to really bring the city to life. Backgrounds for the demo were created by Jake Bowkett/Tempus as well as Badriel, who are both also phenomenal artists.\nFirst draft of Zydaline's work\nOne thing that we're really proud of is the level of immersion that we've achieved. The main character uses a Contact lens that works a lot like a smartphone, and its functions are actually represented on-screen to simulate what Ken himself is seeing.\nThe Contact marks a location on Ken's map\nWe're really excited about the different rewards that we'll be offering. Besides the basic digital copy of the game, we've included digital add-ons for both your eyes and ears, in the form of an artbook and soundtrack. The artbook will feature concept art as well as full-color illustrations, from both our staff artists as well as a few guests.\nLooking for something a little more tangible? Well, for one thing, we're offering physical copies of all three of the items I just listed. The game itself will come in a hard, DVD-sized case, while the soundtrack will be in a traditional jewel case. The artbook will be hardcover, and measure roughly 9 by 11 inches. Physical copies of the game will include a Steam key.\nIn addition, we have a handful of other physical goodies that you can add on to your pledge. Keychains of our heroines will be made, and available individually or as a set. We'll also be producing a series of body pillow covers, or dakimakura, featuring our heroines - PG13, not adult-rated. We'll be posting the designs and rates for those as soon as possible.\nDesigns for the keychains, by Rosuuri\nWe'll also be offering some limited prints and posters, exclusive to Kickstarter. In other words, these will be different from the ones that we/Sekai Project will be selling at particular conventions. \nIf you're fast, it's also possible to score a drawing of you or your own character, done by one of our artists.\nOn top of all that, we have a few limited, very special rewards for big supporters who want a more intimate reward.\nOur print series reward tiers are for the ultimate fan and collector. You'll receive 6 one-of-a-kind posters, one for each heroine, with a corresponding seasonal theme. The posters will measure roughly 24\" by 36\" - in other words, full-size. No one else in the world will have these prints, and it'll be up to you if the rest of the world even sees what they look like. Currently, these are planned to be drawn by Rosuuri.\nAdditionally, our highest reward tier is the Executive Producer tier. Not only will you be credited by title within this game and all others, but you'll be privy to the development process along the way. We'll keep you updated on what's going on through personalized emails, and you'll also be able to access different builds of the game as we assemble them, as well as getting sneak peeks at assets as they're created. If you have thoughts or input on the direction of the game, or suggestions for what you think could make it better, we'd be glad to hear them. At this pledge level, you're not just a backer - you're part of the team.\nAdd-Ons\nKeychains will cost $7 each, or $30 for all 6. The prints, for which we'll include designs soon, will be A3 sized and be $10 a piece, with one print for each heroine. You can also get the set of 6 for $55. If you're interested in the exclusive prints, dakis or keychains, please pledge an additional amount based off the rates listed above. We'll get in touch post-campaign to find out which characters you want.\nIf you'd like to tack on a physical copy of the game, artbook or soundtrack, please also include an extra amount in your pledge. A game copy is $50, the artbook is $30, and the soundtrack is $20.\n $30,000 - Expanded resource budget. More CG's, more music, more sprite poses, more everything! The minimum budget forces us to be very selective in which scenes deserve CG's, which side characters get sprites, and other limitations. By expanding our base asset budget, we have more freedom to diversify the visual aspect of our game. It also helps with purchasing new software and sound packs for our musicians, to get a richer and more full audio experience.\n$35,000 - Opening theme. At this point, we'll have the funds to commission an opening theme from professional Japanese musicians, on par with what you see at the start of most major VN titles and anime. We're currently looking to work with a well-known doujin circle, though the prospect of hiring a specific singer isn't impossible either.\n$50-70,000 - Animation. At this level, we'll collaborate with Collateral Damage Studios, famous for the Internet Explorer-tan video amongst other things, to create a fully animated opening sequence for the game. This will be used in conjunction with the previously mentioned opening theme. If we can afford it, we'll also add in more video to highlight key parts of the story or as introductions to the routes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince almost all of us work on the game as a hobby, rather than full-time or as a source of livelihood, there is the potential of us not meeting our estimated completion date of mid-2017. Given that we have a strong team that communicates well, we're comfortable that any setback caused by scheduling will only be a minor thing.\n\nOur funding goal is higher than a lot of projects similar to ours because we're striving for a higher quality and density of visual assets. We know that we're running a risk by asking for such a high amount, since if we fail to meet it, we get nothing. One way or another though, this project will be completed.

Tim and I have been working on this soundtrack for years now, and to finally see it come together is really an indescribable joy. To get into the specifics, we're looking at a total runtime of about 2:30:00 for the in-game soundtrack, and then somewhere around thirty minutes to an hour's worth of bonus content.

While exploring in your sub, you'll view the open world around you in 3D. When visiting towns and interacting with your crew, a cross-section view reveals intricately painted 2D interiors.\nThe cross-section view showing the interior of Dweller Colony 92.\nAs the captain of your sub, you have access to an array of weapons in addition to sonar and salvaging abilities. Sonar is essential for getting information about the world around you. However, it can be a deadly game of cat and mouse. By sending out a sonar ping, you also alert hostile subs in the area to your presence.\nSonar in action\nCombat in Diluvion is derived from the classic space trading and combat simulation genre. We drew inspiration from games like Wing Commander and Freelancer. The combat is fully 3D, and your sub has multiple weapon rooms which can lock on to enemies. There's a full arsenal of underwater weapons to master as well; bolts, torpedoes, mines, and railguns, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. \nThe swift Huron sub has a torpedo lock on two enemies.\n In the video below, Jacob talks about combat basics as he plays the pre-alpha build!  (Sorry about the missing thumbnail, youtube be trippin'.)\nWhile designing the subs, we put a lot of thought into what's inside. There's a great emphasis on the interior of your sub and the crew that operates it. Different Gunners will give unique firing bonuses, Helmsmen can increase the effectiveness of your ship with advanced maneuvers, and a good Sonar Tech can give you the edge in a long-range torpedo battle. Additionally, your crew can often function semi-autonomously. For example, your gunners can be told to engage previously designated targets while you're busy dodging a torpedo! \nThe more crew you have in a station, the more operational bonuses it will have!\nAs you progress through the game, you will naturally find yourself in larger submarines, and to operate them you'll need a bigger crew. There will be also be new job classes you'll discover as you advance.  In the video below, Jacob shows the crew mechanics and narrates the details.\nThe denizens of the flooded world generally fall into one of three factions: The Icers, the Royals, and the Dwellers. They each have their own culture and technology, but the biggest defining factor is their geography.\nThe Icers tend to live in colonies drilled into the ice or anchored near it. They have exceptional advanced technology and hope to one day finally drill all the way through the ice. The Royals live in great domed Old World cities on what used to be the surface. They see themselves as the rulers of the flooded world, and their Houses control immense military power. The Dwellers live in the darkest depths of the oceans. They survive by fishing and mining, and are the most superstitious inhabitants of Diluvion. In the murky darkness of the sea floor, they turn to their religion for guidance, worshiping the strange sea creatures around them.\nWe started on Diluvion as soon as we finished Ballpoint Universe in early 2014. We spent a lot of time developing the lore and technology that would exist in our sunken world. A good portion of 2014 was spent developing the visual style, and learning how to apply that to assets across the board.\nOnce the art style had been developed to a point we were happy with, we began developing a pipeline that would work well for our small team.\nIn early 2015, we completed our vertical slice which contains a majority of the key core gameplay elements including combat, docking, looting, crews, dialogue, and inventory.\nWe're working with Razer to create the highest quality in-game audio for Diluvion.\nWe are a proven team of developers who have shipped games to many platforms including Steam, Desura, Wii U, iOS, and Android. We were awarded the Indie DB 2013 Visuality award for Ballpoint Universe. Our team has a combined total of 19 years of game development experience, 12 years of programming experience, and 13 years of Unity game engine experience.\nLeo Dasso is guy from North Carolina who's been designing games since he was 16, and drawing since age 3.

They won't be sold separately, however. Purchasing the game (or contributing at least 10$ through this Kickstarter) will get you the initial release and 2 planned expansions of Diluvion without additional charge.

We've developed a vertical slice of the game to help us determine roughly how long assets take us to create, and made a schedule based on that for the production of the rest of the game.\n\nHowever, life brings unexpected events all the time. In the case of development delays or mishaps, we will push development back. Of course, as a backer you'll be the first to know about it via our updates. We'll talk about what happened and why we were delayed.\n\nData loss is a significant risk in development! But we have four local copies of the game project, and we keep backups on external servers. \n\nAs far as overcoming the challenge of developing on a large scale with a small team, it's simply a matter of having experience and being able to streamline the development pipelines to match the given amount of time.\n\nIn the case of a major development setback due to a life event of one of our crew, we'll be sure to keep you up to date via backer updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Diluvion: Where is it now?", "update_content": "We've been talking about the big 1.2 revision for Diluvion, but it's been taking longer than we expected.

It's really important that everyone vote!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=456249358\nLong ago, a great and prosperous colony drifted among the far-flung stars of the galaxy. Founded by the savage and treacherous Daedens, it was built on the soil of a terrestrial jewel, with oceans of water and an atmosphere rich with oxygen, still untouched by civilization due to its isolation. But civilization was not brought to the planet, rather, it was the planet that civilized the Daedens. For in time, a new people was born of the colonists, who forfeited the vicious arms of their ancestors for stately wealth.\nBut as they grew in wealth, prestige, and power, so too were they met with greater threats, both at home and abroad. Rebellion after rebellion, war after war, the colony fell into decline, and in the chaos that ensued, the warp gate that connected it with the rest of civilized space was destroyed, consigning what remained of that planet to the pirates of the deep void. Soon, the echoes of their broadcasts through space grew thin, and people spoke of that colony only as of a memory.\nThat colony was called...\nIn Sethian, you play as an archaeologist from thousands of years in the future, exploring a distant colony, which has been abandoned for centuries. In the ruins, you discover a functional computer, which operates in the native language. The core gameplay of Sethian consists in deciphering and studying this language, and using it to communicate with the computer, to find out what happened to the colony.\nIf anything, Sethian is a puzzle game, where the puzzles involve interpreting and utilizing the game's language in order to uncover the mysteries of the planet. But Sethian is not a game of decryption--the game uses its own language, unrelated to English, which must be translated by the player.\nThe game's language is based heavily off of Chinese, which I've been studying for about three years, but also draws on the quirks of other languages, such as American Sign Language.\nChinese isn't written with an alphabet. Instead, it uses a complex system of symbols, originally meant to represent the meanings of words rather than their pronunciations, but has developed over the course of millennia into a system which blends meaning with homophones, with each symbol representing a single syllable, not necessarily a single word.\nLikewise, the game's language does not use an alphabet. Instead, it uses a series of 100 unique symbols to represent each of the language's 100 roots. These function as words on their own, but also combine to form new words. Here's an example: you know what a foot is, you know what a ball is, and together they make a new word, football. Here's another: \"no\" + \"where\" = \"nowhere\". Now here's an example in Chinese: \u9152 means alcohol, and \u676f means cup, but a \u9152\u676f is a wine glass. This kind of thing is actually even more common in Chinese than it is in English.\nThe symbols of the game's language draw on ancient geometry. This decision was inspired by Carl Sagan, who worked on the plaques of Pioneers 10 and 11, as well as the Voyager Golden Record. Sagan wanted a message that could be understood by aliens, so he included mathematical and scientific information which would be recognized by all intelligent life in the universe - with some deciphering, of course. All symbols shown in the trailer come from Euclid's Elements (except the Pythagorean Theorem, for which I used a different proof), but later we'll see symbols that draw on Platonic solids, conics, calculus, and even non-Euclidean geometry.\nOne hundred symbols might seem like a lot to learn, but you'll have a trusty, easy-to-access dictionary in-game to refresh your memory whenever you need it. No need to flip through every time you want to check it: simply right-clicking on any symbol will take you to its dictionary page.\n\"I don't think 100 is too many, I think it's not enough! How can you possibly make an entire language that only uses 100 roots?\"\nThat's easy: by not talking about everything.\nIn English, we can talk about so many things. We can talk about concrete things, like the groceries and clothes, and we can talk about abstract things, like love and death. We can talk about philosophy and experience. We can talk about complex hypothetical situations, and the consequences of our suppositions. And there are a lot of things we can talk about which neither you nor I have ever thought to talk about before with anyone.\nBut the game's language doesn't need that degree of breadth and versatility. In the game, you'll need to learn how to talk about history and politics, but you won't need to know how to talk about your first love, or what you had for breakfast this morning. This kind of simplicity makes the language easier to master for the player, and easier to program for me. It's part of what makes this game feasible as a personal project. Its scope is limited.\n\"I got D's in high school Spanish! How could I ever learn a language for a game, let alone enjoy it?\"\nOne of my strongest focuses in designing this game is to make a smooth and simple tutorial, which never asks the player to learn too much at once, or asks the player to ride around with training wheels all day before getting down and dirty with the real game. I honestly believe that a lot of people graduate from school thinking they're no good at languages when really they just weren't taught right. If you're interesting in learning languages, I will be able to teach you mine.\nWhen learning a new language, there are four main skills you're working on developing: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. However, the game's language is only experienced in text, chopping the skills you need to master in half. You're not learning any weird sounds or trying to understand people who talk too fast.\nFurther, the game is specifically designed to be easier to learn than a real language. Natural languages develop quirks and irregularities, borrowing vocabulary and grammatical structures from other languages, and evolving through generations of speakers. By making something up, I can create a language that plays by all its own rules, and keep those rules short and sweet.\nThe gameplay in Sethian is simple and minimalistic. With gameplay, I feel the best way to explain is often \"show don't tell\", so I've recorded a short video to give you an idea. This is the first of several videos I'll be recording throughout the campaign, so stay tuned!\nUPDATE May 15: Video #2!\nUpdate May 24: Video #3!\nAn Open World\nThe game is designed with a kind of open world philosophy in mind. To be specific, I want the player to have several challenges, in the form of \"topics\", available to pursue at any one time, in the same way that a player in a conventional open world game has several places they can go at any one time, with things to do in each of them.\nMore importantly, I want to stimulate a feeling that the game has a vast, deep world, which is both interesting and rewarding to explore. Naturally, a game has to tell you what your goals are, and so you will be given hints, however clear or vague, about what you're supposed to do next - or more precisely, what you're supposed to ask about. But I want the player also to feel like other, less obvious questions are worth asking.\nMy primary influence here is Morrowind. I loved how the landscape was littered with caves and dungeons, which subtly told their own stories, whether they were hideouts for slavers, Daedra worshippers, or worse. Once in a while, you could come across something really amazing out of idle curiosity, and suddenly the whole world was worth combing over. I want to bring that feeling to my game, and translate that design philosophy to what I'm doing here.\nMy name is Grant Kuning, and I'm the one-man team behind Sethian. I'm a programmer who likes linguistics and learning new things. I've always played video games, and I've been making them for as long as I've been programming. This is my first that I want to share with the world.\nA lot of Kickstarter campaigns will announce the experience of their team in the games industry, but my experience is a little different. Actually, what I bring to the table is my experience teaching English as a foreign language. When I graduated from college, I decided I wasn't ready to be a desk jockey, so I went to China, and taught English while I was there to put food on the table. I moved on after a few semesters, but I learned how to teach myself, and teach others. I want to share the experience of learning a language, as I understand it: Language is a vessel for culture, and by absorbing language, you absorb the cultural attitudes and assumptions of its speakers. You experience a new way of thinking.\nI understand that not being able to point to big budget AAA games with my name on it like other Kickstarter developers will shake the confidence of prospective backers. In recognition of that, I am trying to be as humble as is financially possible in what I ask of my supporters. But moreover, to increase the confidence of prospective backers, I will attempt to post daily updates throughout this campaign discussing the game in detail, as well as video updates which will show as much of the game in its current, early alpha state as I can, giving a comprehensive walkthrough.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI want to finance this game personally, but I just don't have enough to keep myself afloat. Right now, I'm planning to finish this game by the end of the year, and while my personal savings could probably take me that far, they won't cover licensing fees, or legal consultation. They won't be enough to hire artists, and on my budget, even Steam's Greenlight submission fee is nothing to sneeze at. The amount I'm asking for is less than how much I intend to personally invest in this project.\nBut ultimately, this Kickstarter campaign is asking the question, \"Do people want to play this game?\" \"Is this something people want me to make?\" \"If I throw all my money at this thing, will I get a return on that, or will I wind up on the streets?\" If you want me to move forward with this project, let me know with your support.\nRewards\nBecause I'm doing this on a super tight budget, I can't send out anything physical. Manufacturing costs money, and shipping costs money. Offering stuff like that means I need to raise more money. But more importantly, it would mean dealing with more factors. This is a huge learning experience for me, and I need it to be as smooth and simple as possible. That means limiting the number of things for me to focus on.\nTo make up for it, I've tried to offer great, cheap rewards. If you don't have much to give, that's fine, you can still get the game with no strings attached for just a few bucks. But if this is the game you've been waiting for all your life, I'm more than happy to get the community involved in the creative aspects of the game, and I've tried to keep those rewards quite a bit cheaper than similar rewards for other projects.\nEveryone who gives at least $5 will be named in the game's credits, and all rewards are cumulative. That means if you pay $10, you also get the $5 reward, if you spend $25, you also get the $10 reward and the $5 reward, and so on.\nStretch Goals\nUPDATE June 6: We're funded now, and a lot has changed over the course of this campaign. A lot of people have reached out to me to ask to work on this project, and it looks like this game will have a very affordable original soundtrack, plus a handwritten journal. As such, there's no longer any point in asking for extra money for those things. Therefore, I've decided to change my stretch goals. The only one I really want to push for now is new game+ mode, which I've dropped from a $20,000 goal to a $12,000 goal. We can do it!\n$12,000: New Game+\nIn terms of gameplay, one idea I've been interested in implementing from the beginning, but wasn't sure I'd be able to, is a new game plus mode. This is a mode where the player would start from the beginning, but skip the tutorial, having already learned the language. The game would shift in focus from challenges in language use to a sort of battle of wits with the computer. I'm afraid I'll only be free to implement this if I'm relieved of artistic responsibilities.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI anticipate that a lot of potential backers will be concerned first and foremost with my lack of experience in the industry, which I respect. However, I don't want anyone to doubt me as a programmer - not because I'm a great programmer, but rather because this project simply doesn't need a great programmer. It doesn't have or need a big in-house engine. It's simple enough that it doesn't need to be highly optimized - even an ancient computer will be able to run it. The challenges to my skills here are creative, not technical.\n\nHowever, there are other concerns regarding my lack of experience which are absolutely valid. Questions of, \"Do I know how to handle a budget?\" \"Do I know how to plan a project long-term?\" and,\"Do I understand the less glamorous aspects of game development, such as the legal problems that can arise?\" These questions all deserve serious, well-thought-out responses.\n\nBut the short answer - the humble answer - is no, because I haven't done this before. I'm learning as I go. The best answer I can give in general is that my strategy is to prepare to learn quickly, and early. How? By publishing my plans and progress frequently and consistently. By reaching out to the community for advice and criticism, and being humble in the face of that criticism. That's how I've learned as much as I have already, and that's how I intend to learn enough to take me the rest of the way.\n\nThose are the major difficulties, but there are other challenges worth mentioning. I'm not as concerned about these issues, but I expect they will be brought up before the campaign is finished.\n\nOne problem arises from recursion. Without getting too technical, recursion is a feature of all languages that allows us to form an infinite number of unique, grammatically correct sentences. Thankfully, however, I don't need an infinite amount of code to handle all that, anymore than you need to hear a specific sentence before you can say it yourself. The infinite variety of sentences we're able to form arises out of a finite vocabulary, and a finite grammatical rule set.\n\nIt's also worth noting that not all infinities are equal. Consider the numbers between 1 and 2. You have 1.1, 1.01, 1.001, and so on. Now consider the numbers between 1 and 3. While that set of numbers is also infinite, surely it is a greater set of numbers. Likewise, while in theory, an infinite number of grammatical sentences could be formed in the game's language, that set of sentences is much more manageable to program for than the set of sentences that could be produced in English, or any other natural language. And of course, not every question is interesting. Many questions will have generic, uninteresting answers by necessity. For comparison, you could probably give a much more interesting answer to the question of \"What are you doing with your life right now?\" than \"What do you think about the price of trout in Thailand?\" (Although surely in certain situations the answer to the latter could be more interesting than the answer to the former.)\n\nI've also been asked about the difficulty of making a language, but honestly, there's not much to it - at least for this project. The game's language is essentially Chinese with a hat on. I've tried to make a language before, and that involved some pretty intense research, identifying major world languages and comparing the phonetic inventories of about 40 of them. But this project mostly goes off of stuff I already know.\n\nMy last concern that I think is worth mentioning here is issues of design, from a big picture standpoint. I mean planning out the player's progress through the game, and the player's experience of the game as a whole. In a way, I imagine this happening a lot like an RPG. You see, in RPGs, maybe JRPGs especially, developers can plan out your progress because they know how leveled up you're going to need to be to overcome the next challenge, and they know how much XP you've been gaining off the last few enemies you've had to fight, so they can sort of chart your progress. I'm imagining something sort of analogous in my game with mastery of vocabulary and grammatical structures, but it'll take some pretty solid planning which just hasn't been filled out yet. My remedy for this is thorough testing, but I'm not sure the current beta release will give me enough information to get it quite right. I might consider doing the beta earlier, or if I can afford it, extend development. No game was so good that it couldn't have benefited from a little more time in development.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "Looking Back, Moving Forward", "update_content": "Howdy folks.

The campaign's funding was never meant to fund its development on its own; half of my funding was roughly two years' worth of personal savings.

This means finishing a trailer, setting up a store page on Steam, figuring out who I'm going to send review copies to and how to pitch the game to them, as well as a few other things.

This meant programming the endings. To program the endings, I had to write code to make text fade in and out. But that wasn't possible in the graphics coding I had at the time. A rewrite seemed drastic, so I spent a long time looking for workarounds.

Through dynamic narration, you play the mother\u2019s re-telling of the events surrounding her son\u2019s disappearance in a setting heavily influenced by Norse mythology and Norwegian folk tales.\nThe interrogation that covers the mother's tale is never seen, only heard, as the actions unfolding on the screen have already happened. You control the past, shaping the story of the present.\nWith Through the Woods, we are attempting to capture the forest as we saw it as children, with all the frightening and mysterious feelings of roaming the woods alone. This is coupled with a poignant story and high quality sound design that acts as a core mechanic in the darkness of the forest.\nVideo Update #6: Motion Capturing a Monster\nVideo Update #5: The Systems and Swordsmanship of Through the Woods\nVideo Update #4: The Art of Through the Woods\nVideo Update #3: The Sound of Through the Woods\nVideo Update #2: The Emotion of Through the Woods\nVideo Update #1: Why we're on Kickstarter\nThrough the Woods tells a personal and serious story in a setting inspired by Norwegian folk tales and Norse mythology. A woman is being interrogated by a man and is asked a straightforward yet difficult question: \u201cWhere is your son?\u201d The mother begins to tell her story, and the game begins. \nPlaying as Karen, you must find your way through the woods, and to your son. The only thing you have to help you is a flashlight, which you must decide carefully when to use. The forest is dark, and a little light helps with navigating, but it also makes you more visible to the unknown things that lurk in the woods. Switching off the flashlight may be safer, as it lets the protagonist focus her other senses on avoiding danger, but it makes navigation difficult.\nThe game's narrative is delivered through the dialogue in the interrogation room, describing the player\u2019s actions in the past tense, slowly unfolding the mystery of why your son has been taken. Instead of focusing on 'jumpscares', the game is meant to instill a lasting sense of dread in the player. This brooding menace is delivered in a slow drip as part of a narrative, interactive experience, with fear and melancholia as the two opposing points of the emotional spectrum.\nThe main gameplay of Through the Woods revolves around exploration, avoiding the dangers of the forest, uncovering the mystery around what happened to your son through collecting story elements and driving the narrative forward by unlocking dialogue along the way. \nThe audio also acts as a core gameplay mechanic, giving you a warning as to what creature may be lurking nearby. By learning from each encounter you can figure out the best way to deal with whatever you meet and whether you run away, hide, or blind your foe with your flashlight.\nSo, why third-person? We have received a lot of questions about why we don't we go for first-person instead. Some people say that first-person is the standard for horror, that it would make you feel more immersed, like you're actually there. The thing is, this story isn't about you. We are telling Karen's story from her perspective, and we feel that the best way to do that is to let you observe her actions as you move through the game world.\nThe sound design of Through the Woods plays a very special role in the game and, unlike most other games, actually acts as a core mechanic. \nOn your journey through the forest and across the island, you will come across various enemies and creatures. Some will want to harm you and some will just be protecting their territory, forcing you to take another path. \nEach creature has its own theme and, based on what you know about their behavior from previous encounters, the sound design will help you survive in the darkness of the woods. You will usually hear the creatures before you see them, which gives you a little time to prepare your approach, and turning off your flashlight will help you focus your hearing on whatever lies ahead; our night-blindness / sound-focus mechanic.\nSome creatures will chase you if you run, so if you recognise the sound of this creature you can quickly hide and sneak to pass by. Others will charge at you and kill you in the darkness but fear the beam of your flashlight. \nSince the game takes place in Norway, we have chosen to use Norwegian actors for the dialogue. We believe this choice is the right way to go over actors with American or British accents that you hear in a lot of games, and that it will help with strengthening the immersion. \nWe have taken inspiration from several sources for the art style and environments of the game, mostly from the Norwegian artists, Theodor Kittelsen and Lars Hertervig. Their work is melancholy and unusual, and perfectly represents the uncomfortable atmosphere we want to create in the game.\nWe've also taken a lot of inspiration from Norse mythology and old Norwegian folk tales. You will be able to find and collect lore throughout the forest that enrichens the environment and story, and also discover runes carved into rocks and trees that you can translate with a little ingenuity. \nWe miss the third person horror games that seems to have gotten lost in the past few generations of video game consoles. More specifically, we miss the tension and the pacing from the early titles in game series like Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Fatal Frame. \nHowever, that\u2019s not to say that we hate newer horror games, as we also draw inspiration from modern titles like Alan Wake, Gone Home, Amnesia: The Dark Descent and The Last of Us.\nWe have a bunch of great rewards to offer you in exchange for helping us reach our goal with your hard earned cash.\nFirst of all, everyone gets access to our free playable prototype, whether you pledge or not. Hooray! This is so you can check out an early level of the game and make sure it's something you want to invest in. \nAfter this, everyone who pledges also gets two exclusive, high resolution wallpapers and their name in the credits for everyone to see. \nGoing up the list, we have digital and physical copies of the game, digital and physical art books, digital and physical original soundtracks and having your name immortalized by finding it somewhere in the game itself. \nWe've also added some really cool T-shirts! Our WOODS WEAR tier allows you to choose between two awesome designs. If you want one of the other tiers but still get a t-shirt you can Addon $40 to your pledge (Please add $15 for shipping if your tier doesn't already include shipping). Available in sizes: S, M, L and XL.\nEven further up we have some very unique rewards such as adopting a beautiful Norwegian tree, you can request a piece of customized artwork from one of our artists, and they will spend up towards a full day of work to finish it. And then we have a few very limited Executive Cabineer credits where we fly you to Norway and take you with us for a cabin-trip with the team. Come join us for the true Norwegian experience Through the Woods!\nDetailed overview:\nAntagonist is a small independent studio based in Oslo, Norway, and was founded in 2014. Our team's overarching aim is to focus on delivering story as an integral part of the experience, without sacrificing gameplay.\nThe studio is made up primarily of friends who studied game development at the same university college, but the team has grown as we've become more experienced from working on smaller projects. Development on Through the Woods began as part of the teams' final Bachelor thesis project.\nIn addition to the core-team we are working with several really talented freelancers, among those the exceptional Jory Prum, whose resume boasts dialogue production on Telltale Games' Walking Dead-series and much more. We've also engaged Funcom, developers of Age of Conan and The Secret World, for help with motion capture to bring our future animations to the next level.\nThe Norwegian game development community is, in general, very open, and any challenges we've faced so far have been made easier to tackle with the help and support we've received from our colleagues. Notably among those is Krillbite Studio. Their experience with bringing the horror-game, Among the Sleep, to fruition has been an immense resource for us as we've been experimenting with our direction for Through the Woods.\nWell, we have managed to get halfway through development through an investment in the company, some development grants, and also a lot of devoted effort from ourselves. We worked on Through the Woods for around eight months with essentially no pay at all, so hopefully this tells you something about how dedicated to the game we are. Some of us are even living with our parents to try and save money...\nBut now we are close to running out of money, and we just can't do this alone anymore. We need your help! We are using our slow and slightly broken personal laptops at work which really slows down the rate at which we can produce content. And since we have spent all our savings so far we will have to get extra jobs for income if the Kickstarter doesn't succeed, something which will obviously further slow down the development of Through the Woods. \nMaking a game is expensive and running a business is hard, but we have seven very professional and talented developers here who only want to produce an incredible game for you to add to your collection, and to keep doing what we love to do.

More announcements for the remaining roster will come in the future!\nCurtis Arnott (Bruizer) - Widely known online as \"Takahata101\" and his work for the DBZ and Hellsing Abridged series as Creative Director of Team Four Star. Also, he recently did voices for Dragonball Xenoverse.\nMichele Knotz (Pugi) - Michele has an extensive resume of voicing a multitude of Pok\u00e9mon characters for Nintendo, and voiced in various anime such as To Heart and Genshiken.

The game has already been greenlit on Steam, and approved for the developer programs for Microsoft's Xbox One and the Nintendo Wii U. The game is progressing very well, but will need several more months in development to make it a complete product. This Kickstarter campaign is to help get the game to the finish line!\nVisual improvements from the January 2015 build (left) and January 2014 build (right)\nCombat Core has been completely self-funded so far, but extra funding is needed to cover cost of several things:\nMore Art Assets and Game Features - There are still a lot of art assets needed to finish the game! There are several more character models, weapons, and environments still being created. The kickstarter will cover the cost of creating and improving 2D illustration/concepts , environment and character models, animations, and special effects.\nMusic and Sound Production/Licensing - Combat Core will feature a fantastic EDM-heavy soundtrack produced by a variety of contributing artists. Funding will cover the cost for music licenses and production.\nVoice Casting/Directing - We need to cover the costs for casting and recording voices for all the characters and other voice clips like the announcer(s)\nLiving Expenses - Without funding, Combat Core will be shifted to a part-time project and I will need to focus on other jobs to make a living and to pay my partners for their work, and completing the project will take much longer.\n ***INFO ON CONSOLE ADD-ON PLEDGING***\nWe plan to distribute alpha builds to backers and utilize Steam Early Access in the future, but these avenues are not available for console releases. For this reason, ALL backers will receive the PC/Mac version rewards. If the console port stretch goals are reached, we will allow $5 add-on pledges (per key) to receive keys for the console of your choice when it releases.\nRewards are detailed in each pledge description, here's a chart to easily compare them!\nAlso, Alex Ahad \u201co_8\u201d (Character Design) is an amazing artist and the creative director of the smash-hit indie fighting game Skullgirls. If the $60k stretch goal is met, he's contributing 4 additional character designs in Combat Core! You can view more of his work on his Twitter, Tumblr, and Deviantart.\nI started full-time development of Combat Core in Summer 2013. Most of the gameplay systems are in place and the game is playable. Most of the development moving forward will be for adding/producing new art assets, attacks, music, bugfixing, balancing, and polishing the presentation to the existing framework. Barring any significant setback, here is the projected roadmap for the release of the game:\nQ2-3 2015 - Immediately after the Kickstarter, a private, DRM-free pre-release build will be released to $25-tier and higher backers. The current build has 5 original characters, 4 stages, 4 weapon types and several custom character options. Expect new builds to be released about every 2-6 weeks with new content.\nQ4 2015 - The game will be publicly released on Steam and other available digital storefronts, and backers at the $13-tier and above will receive their keys. This will be the \"early access\" release, and the game will continue to be updated regularly. Minimum features targeted for this release are:\n8 original characters playable (possibly more)\n6 arenas (possibly more)\nOnline multiplayer\nMore weapons and custom character assets\nQ1 2016 - The game and content (all characters, weapons, modes, arenas) are complete, and bugs/presentation have been polished as much as reasonably possible. The PDF guide and soundtrack should be complete, and the game will be \"released\" as version 1.0. Some stretch goals such as Extra Modes may be completed post-1.0 release, and the game will be ported to consoles.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMost of the groundwork for Combat Core is already in place. The game is playable and we have an efficient pipeline to continue to add new content.\n\nHowever we understand that game development will always have unique hurdles, so there is always the possibilities of production delays due to all kinds of life situations. There may be technical hurdles but we are certain we will have the resources to deliver on all promised features.\n\nWe have a clear roadmap to delivery.

Stopping destructive meteors heading for the planet? Fighting against madmen, clowns and madmen clowns? Travelling back through time? Obviously evil party members who turn on you as the plot comes to a bombastic conclusion? Amnesiac, grumpy protagonists winning against impossible odds?\nDo you? Well, that's a shame. Because you will find none of these in Regalia.\nInstead, you will get a compact and light-hearted slice-of-life story of a young man who was (un)fortunate enough to become a ruler. As he arrives to live out a personal fairy tale, it quickly becomes apparent that there won't be a Happily Ever After - his domain lies in ruins, his forebears have left behind a massive debt, and nobody's left behind to even acknowledge his claim.\nNaturally, in all these perils, he won't be alone. Presenting the main four:\nBut worry not, that's not the entire cast (not even close!). A truly merry band of misfits awaits, and not all of them will be blonde. We promise.\nWith additional mission control from a ghost of a sagacious ancestor, success seems assured...\nYeah, no. We won't lie - it's pretty much a lost cause. Or is it?\nYou can read more about the story and characters here.\nBattles\nRegalia's battles take place on an isometric grid, in a turn-based combat system. You control a party assembled from the protagonist and up to 4 other companions (out of the total 12!). \nWhen it comes to skills, we are focusing on quality over quantity, and therefore, every character and/or enemy feels different; every skill is unique to its owner, without boring duplicates. You can push and pull characters around, buff and debuff, summon new units or gadgets... and more!\nThere are no heals and no restorative potions in Regalia. Instead, the player is given a number of ways to shield a character from incoming damage. Keep this in mind, as pontless rushing and incorrect positioning usually translate into swift defeat.\nEach battle is a part of larger chain of encounters, contained either in a dungeon or an outdoor battlefield. Because of the lack of healing, each encounter must be carefully planned in order to persevere, and perseverance will be rewarded with fabulous loot from deepest parts of the dungeons.\nYou can read more about the Battle System here.\nRip and tear!\nYour own Village\nYou begin the game with nothing but a dusty, ruined castle, a nagging ghost of your grandfather and a vague promise of glory. As you progress in the game, you will harvest resources and gold, which can be used to construct new buildings in your village or upgrade the already existing ones.\nEach building has its own occupant, a unique villager who brings additional benefits to your playthrough. For example, build a Smithy, and by doing so recruit Gunther, a mighty blacksmith who will be able to upgrade your weapons and armor.\nTo top it off, there's also the family castle. This central building lets you exercise your ruling authority, serving both as a diplomacy hub and housing space for some of your party members.\nYou can explore your town freely, visiting crucial hot spots like the market square or walking inside every building you have constructed.\nWorld\nFor Regalia, we have opted for a classic overworld map. However, you will find no content gating here - everything is discoverable right off the bat. The world itself contains both static and procedural elements, so no two playthroughs will be the same.\nOur map is divided into small regions, all of them containing many different goodies. You will be able to explore these regions both with your main party (led by Kay, naturally) and with the so-called expeditions - a group of party members hand-picked by you, the player. Such expeditions may be then issued orders, carrying out exploration and gathering duties in your stead.\nAnd what exactly lies on the map? Dungeons (with randomized interiors, rewards and enemies!), crafting materials, treasure caches and also something we are really excited about - text adventures. Each of those adventures is a really short, self-contained story that you will be able to influence through your choices.\nFinally, there's the Codex, which contains huge amounts of extra lore and background information. At the same time, it is dynamic, filling up as you travel around the nooks and crannies of the world.\nIn-game world map\nSocial Links\nEach inhabitant of your village, be it a companion or a villager, has a unique social link you can pursue.\nBeneath every link lies a short story focusing on a particular character. To advance the link, you will have to spend time with him or her, listening to their experiences and reacting accordingly.\nAs you work on your relationships, your links will go through 5 stages, each stage bringing something tangible that would aid your gameplay. New crafting recipes will unlock, store discounts will be given, new skill modifications will appear - and so on. In addition, some links may contain hidden quests; completing those will reward you with fantastic pieces of loot and money.\nDiplomacy\nWe mentioned diplomacy before, and indeed, 6 factions can be found in the game. As each is mutually exclusive with its political rival, this leaves you free to ally with 3 of those in a single playthrough... and make enemies of the other 3.\nIn general, diplomacy works similarly to Social Links. However, instead of befriending specific characters, you befriend whole nations. Remember, though: as one faction slowly becomes your ally, its rival will start to resent you, which in turn will make your progress more difficult.\nNaturally, securing an ally grants you perks, such as economic benefits, faction-specific buildings or, last but not least, a unique party member. A total of 6 faction characters can be recruited, but - due to aforementioned rivalries - only 3 will be available to you in a single playthrough.\nTo encourage partaking in diplomacy, we tried to make our factions colourful, unique and instantly recognizable. We will discuss them in greater detail in future updates; however, at this point, we can already share that you will encounter nordic elves, samurai dwarves, Arabian Nights-esque gnomes... and more!\nAll six factions of Regalia's world\nTime\nThe main campaign lasts two years of game time. Time is a scarce resource, and so you will have to manage carefully, dividing it between combat, exploration, diplomacy and social links. You and your progress will be evaluated every three months. Fail, and it's game over!\nWe designed the game to make it impossible to achieve everything in a single playthrough. Simply put, there won't be enough time. If you want to beat that secret superboss (and you can bet there will be one), better start working on your muscles right from the start.\nDon't fret, though. If you happen to be a completionist, all progress can be carried over to the next playthrough via the New Game+ feature.\nPlay the way you want\nRegalia features a dynamic scoring system that evaluates your progress every three months of game time. You can achieve your goals in multiple ways, focusing on the part of the game you enjoy most - fighting, exploring or socializing.\nThough the main story itself is linear, the bulk of it unveils every three months. Apart from those \"story clamps\", we chose a hands-off, sandboxy approach. You'll be given a large set of quests and objectives generated uniquely for you - ones that do not aim to railroad the content, enabling you to proceed according to your own wishes.\nPerhaps you'll finish a chapter doing nothing but slaying monsters. Perhaps you'll dedicate yourself to improving social links and crafting. We won't penalize you for this; instead, we want to provide rewards for both balanced and specialized approaches.\nMinor things\nWe aim to make the game's smaller systems as fun as the core of the project. To list a few: characters and villagers talk to each other, producing tiny, optional banter cutscenes, weapons and armors can be socketed with gems, weather phenomena happen in the form of rain and snow, skills can be upgraded and customised, seasons may open or block passages around the world, each week brings a new set of unique buffs (or debuffs!)... oh, and there's a truckload of references to many classic video games.\nAll backgrounds are hand-drawn in glorious 2D, while characters are rendered in 3D (why?). Every character and background is unique - we don't use tilesets or templates for our assets.\nOur lead artist, Runshin, has chosen an art style which blends a familiar Japanese vibe with a hint of western influences. Inspired by works of George Kamitani, our characters are vibrant, colorful and slightly disproportionate, helping them achieve the additional \"pop\".\nThe use of 3D elements allows us to leverage all the goodies that come with the third dimension, like reflections, dynamic shadows and lights, or Havok physics calculations for both gravity and cloth simulation. In the end, there is nothing funnier than launching a physics-afflicted zombie into the air, right?\nRegalia features an original soundtrack produced by Game Audio Factory, known for their fantastic sound-work in Endless game series. The composer for the score is H-Pi (Trackmania, Aarklash Legacy). We are using live instruments for many parts of the music; as you will notice, in the battle theme below, both violin and trumpets were recorded live.\nThe game will ship with a full OST produced by GAF and will be available on their bandcamp page and most digital platforms.\nHere at Pixelated Milk, we are all huge fans of Yuzo Koshiro's music, the man responsible for the amazing music of Etrian Oddysey games, and we hope you will recognize his spirit in our soundtrack.\nYou can listen to Regalia's main battle theme below.\n\nThis is not your typical fund-my-life campaign. Everyone on our core team (writing, design, code) has been working for free for the past six months. Throughout the journey, we have supported ourselves either through our day jobs or personal savings. Every single dollar earned here will go towards content creation: 3D models, 2D art and music.\nUp until this point, Regalia had been funded from savings and a bank loan - in other words, out of our own pockets. Over the course of the last six months, we have completed around 50% of all game systems. This includes a combat system, which is feature-complete and currently in polishing stage, procedural world map elements generation, item and skill systems, dialogue and cinematic systems and all base engine work.\nWe have completed all major character designs and a large part of 2D hand-drawn backgrounds. 3D model creation is currently at around 20%, with models completed for the majority of the main cast. \nHere is a quick graph showing the projected split for the 40k USD funding level:\nTaxes and Fees include Kickstarter and Amazon fees, legal fees for setting up a Kickstarter from Poland and a handful of our domestic taxes. Yep, that's a 25% of the funding down the drain right from the start. ,_,\nSoftware Licenses will allow us to invest in software licences for new employees.\nMusic & Sound covers the costs of producing a full soundtrack to accompany our battle theme. Everything will be composed by Game Audio Factory and performed with the use of live musicians.\nFinally, Art allows us to keep our current artists employed while expanding into additional 3D and 2D artists.\nWe are a small, fresh studio, united by the shared dream of creating games. We lack long resumes and work experiences of other projects, but we try to compensate for it with hard work and transparency. For us, your trust is the key to making this possible.\nPixelated Milk is based in Warsaw, Poland, with some of the team members working remotely from the other parts of the country.\nThe team consists of:\nBartosz \u0141ojewski, project lead and main programmer\nLucjan Pakulski (http://runshin.deviantart.com/), lead artist\nJ\u0119drzej \u0141ojewski, writer\nArtur \u015awi\u0105tek, designer, co-writer\nTomasz Niezgoda, animator and designer\nPatryk W\u0105siewicz, programmer\nSylwia Pakulska (http://sylwiapakulska.deviantart.com/), 2D artist\nDaria Wadas-Modrzejewska (http://yaminolady.deviantart.com/), 2D artist\nShaham Imtiaz, 3D artist (https://www.artstation.com/artist/polymator)\nPawe\u0142 Krzepis, concept artist\nMariusz Wojciechowski, tester and designer\n\u0141ukasz \u015aledziewski, PR and marketing specialist, designer\nJason Summers, PR and marketing specialist", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou heard it a thousand times already - making games is risky stuff. Not to mention this risk increases significantly when you are making games as fresh-faced newcomers, without the aid of industry veterans.\n\nWe did the best we could to minimize this risk. Our team, despite lacking experience in the industry per se, has hard, verifiable skills in programming, 2D art, 3D art, animation and project management. \n\nWe have also invested heavily in this project from our own pockets. Personal savings, family loans and finally a big bank loan enabled us to prepare a prototype for this campaign and code most of the significant game systems. This phase wasn't easy, and we had experienced many difficulties, but ultimately persevered.\n\nWith the majority of critical engine obstacles resolved and core systems implemented, we are confident that the programming itself poses a minor risk. Gameplay scope is kept razor-sharp and we have trimmed all the redundant fat to avoid feature creep or unnecessary bloating. Stretch goals were also thought through to prevent shooting ourselves in the foot through the way of drastic changes.\n\nAs we see it, the biggest risk lies with creation of content. Regalia is extremely art-heavy. Our current artists are tasked to 100% of their capacity, and we would like to have all the pretty things made a little bit faster. Having only one 3D modeller makes for yet another challenge - in this case, some redundancy is very much required. To mitigate all those risks, we plan to hire additional 2D and 3D artists after this campaign concludes..\n\nWithout a doubt, the biggest risk lies with the eventual quality of the game itself. When you are working on something day after day, it's easy to stop being objective about your product. To mitigate this, we have done two things. Firstly, twice a week, we hold brainstorming sessions, where we evaluate the quality/fun factor of what has been produced.

But, to get there you may have to pass through some tall grass... Will your champions defeat all of the random encounters standing between you and epic loot? \nRandom Encounter is a strategic number game for all ages that is quick to play, easy to learn and fantastically fun.\n\nPlayers build 'encounters' made up of various creatures and to try and win as many battles as possible at the table in the pursuit of loot! Each fully customisable deck is made up of different leveled creature cards along with several trick creature cards to throw your opponents off guard.\n\n2 or more players compete to reach 5 loot before other players by either winning the most battles or stealing loot from the coffers of their fallen enemies. You still want more? Sure! Random Encounter will be opened up to the community where everyone will get the chance to design new sets in quarterly competition rounds where the most popular set each round will go into full print(!!).\nThe game and pixel art is being created by Jamie Keddie (creator of Jackpot! and Artist on Minecraft: Console Edition at 4J Studios) of Joyride Games who has extensive experience with both card and video games design. Random Encounter combines these things in a new, fun, package for everyone to enjoy! \nAlthough Random Encounter is an awesome stand-alone game it is also extremely easy to integrate into your favourite role playing games to replace encounters, a replacement for dice rolls, a quick game that can be played between rounds and/or to settle disputes. There are all sorts of mixable themes to match your game of choice. The game will come with suggestions of how you can make this work simply.\n\nThis project is worldwide shipping friendly!! This project has no extra shipping charges no matter where in the world you are from by sharing the costs.\n Random Encounter started it's life as a weekend project. Not Long after Jackpot! was released I decided to try my hand at a contrasting project. Something quick and simple. What came from that was a variant of a small game called \"platoon\" from Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch (Sony PS3). Because of the repeating, bean like, figures I had drawn it was given the name Battle for Beanville and was played week after week at the local game stores and pubs. And we loved it!\n'Battle for Beanville' playable prototype cards\nSo, I continued to work on it. Changing cards, mechanics, scoring and theme until I came out with something I thought was really special. I took the pixel art experience that I am continually developing while working on Minecraft at 4JStudios as well as inspiration from some of the most cherished video games (Final Fantasy, Pokemon, Zelda etc) threw it all in the idea pot and what came out was Random Encounter! The theme fit the game mechanics perfectly and several iterations/versions later I was happy with the style and decided to bring it to you on Kickstarter. \n\nI hope you like the game as much as I do. I really cant wait to interact with the community in what I hope can be a living project for a long time to come.\n\n- Jamie", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been here before!

Use this powerful magical artifact wisely to get through the dangers of the game.\nThe Shadow Core offers many possibilities to the players. Without revealing too much, here are some of them:\nIt can act as a shield to block incoming damage; \nIt's a mobile platform that you control at will; \nIt can disarm traps, solve puzzles and unlock doors; \nIt can be a counterweight in leverage situations; \nIt can become a self-made wall to side jump;\nYou can also move it around aimlessly and contemplate life.\nThe concept behind the Shadow Core is simple: to give players a tool to be used how they see fit. Whether you're exploring, speedrunning or just having fun, there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to use it. Whereas most platformers are built around inflexible mechanics, the versatility of the Shadow Core allows you to dictate the play-style.\nLight Fall takes place in the Forgotten World of Numbra, a dangerous land completely shrouded in darkness. As you progress through your journey, you will realize that Numbra is the home of many strange creatures. Some will be your friends, some will be your foes. \nIn search of clues about your mysterious past, explore the many regions of Numbra. Wander through the calm night of the Lunar Plain, venture into the Marshlands of Sorrow, face the exotic wildlife of the Vipera\u2019s Forest and explore the Unknown Depths, where no man ever set foot. \nIn Numbra, one misstep is all it takes to meet a quick end. This harsh world is colossal and ancient; the entire continent permanently shrouded in darkness, lit only by the moon. Its inhabitants live and abide by a simple law: the strongest survive, while the weak are crushed.\nThat did not stop the Kamloops, a small and peaceful Nation, from leaving their homeland for Numbra. Exhausted from the constant wars between rival nations and trapped in the middle of an everlasting conflict, the Kamloops left everything behind. Everything but a hope for better days, a hope for peaceful solitude.\n\nFollowing the steps of their ancestor, the legendary explorer Paddlewood, the Kamloops braved the sea and traveled into the night as he did 400 years ago. After a laborious journey, they finally reached the eerie Numbra. As they landed on the dark and cold shore of the Lunar Plain, they suddenly realized their life would never be the same. The warm and sunny days of their homeland were forever lost, and their lives would be filled with constant hardship.\nAt first, they struggled mightily, but eventually they adapted and established their new home. Despite often being perceived as weak, the Kamloops had two strengths of their own; their cunning and their piety. Without the manpower and desire to participate in the wars waged by their neighbors, the Kamloops had always relied on clever traps and barriers to protect their homeland and defend themselves. Their devotion is also very strong, so strong in fact, that their Gods have the power to manifest themselves in the world. \nThe Kamloops worship several different Gods, each and every one of them a powerful prodigy in his own right. For generations, these celestial beings have vowed to protect their people. \nAlas, something vile stirs in the dark night of Numbra. Mysterious crystals have appeared out of nowhere and scraped the entire landscape. Houses and entire villages are being razed to the ground. With the world crumbling once again, will the Gods answer their people's plea one more time?\nWe have come a long way in a year. If you compare the screenshots below, you can see the evolution of Light Fall from our initial concept to early prototypes and what the game looks like today.\nEarly black and white concept\nTrying a different approach with the grey replacing most of the black\nSlowly getting there... few weeks later we added colors to the world\nSome details kicked in\nA much more recent level concept\nWhat the game looks like today\nGame development, like any creative endeavor, is rarely a smooth and linear process. It is fluid, shifting as challenges arise and new ideas take shape. Eventually, the roots take hold and the final vision begins to emerge.\nAfter a year of devotion, Light Fall is becoming something that we can be proud to share. In the past few months, we brought Light Fall to PAX South and PAX East, became certified devs for Sony, and were Greenlit on Steam almost immediately.\nFear not, you won't be alone on this dangerous quest. You will be accompanied by Stryx the Night Owl. Stryx will act as the in-game narrator and will travel at your side throughout the game.\nJust be careful not to anger him. As you will see, Stryx is quite the character. He will provide help with his immeasurable knowledge of Numbra but he really has a short temper. Be ready for his...harsh tutelage!\nStryx is voiced by Mr. Tim Simmons, who has worked on many high-profile games such as Torchlight and PAYDAY 2.\nWith our initial 20 000$ goal, we will be able to provide the backers with a complete and unique product. Still, we always have crazy ideas in mind when it comes to improving Light Fall. These are some of the things we would like to push forward if the support from the community is there.\nOur priority platform remains the computer (PC, Mac) as we are already approved on Steam (Greenlight). Consoles certifications require a lot of dedicated time. As a team of three, we simply cannot do a multi-platform launch on day one without delaying the game.\nOur plan is to release the computer version first, while working on the certifications for the PS Vita, followed by the certifications for the PS4 and Xbox One. Bottom line, if we reach the console port stretch goal, Light Fall will definitely launch on them, but probably at a later date than the computer version. \nFinally, we are also planning to release Light Fall on Linux. A lesser delay should be expected, but if everything goes well it might be released at the same time as PC and MAC.\nIt\u2019s important for us to be honest with our backers about the manpower and production capacity we possess and to set realistic expectations.\nYou want to see us perform some Light Fall speed running in extreme conditions? As a group, you have the power to make it happen! Every couple achievements unlocked, we will put our lives on the line just for your amusement. Ok, not that extreme... or maybe?\nBishop Games is a 3-man cell: Ben Archer, David Dion-Paquet and Mathieu Robillard. Funded in March 2014, the studio is located in Quebec City, Canada. Driven by a passion for video games since our childhood and a real desire to create something unique, we jumped without hesitation in this crazy adventure. \nThe indie life can be hard at times.\nAs a small team of three, we have surrounded ourselves with talented people for the music and the in-game narration. Tim Simmons is the in-game narrator, voicing Stryx the Night Owl. Mr. Simmons has worked in the industry for more than 30 years and on several best-selling games such as PAYDAY 2, Heroes of Newerth, Torchlight and many more. You can visit his website here: http://www.timsimmonsvoiceover.com/index.html \nJean-Philippe Tessier aka Jupiterion, is the genius behind the music and the atmosphere of Light Fall. You can listen to his port-folio right here: https://soundcloud.com/jupiterion-studio\nAnd here's a sneek peek of the soundtrack he created for the game.\nWhy Kickstarter, indeed? The reason is pretty simple. The project has been mostly self-funded so far, we are not affiliated with a publisher or anything of the sort. We are three guys working hard for our dream and our passion: video games. \nWith your support and Kickstarter, Bishop Games will be able to continue the development of Light Fall without having to worry about money or having to sacrifice cool ideas for the game or make concessions. We will be able to make Light Fall the way we want it to be, the way it should be. \nIf we partner with publishers in the future, we want it to be for the good reasons, not because we can't feed ourselves anymore.\nKickstarter also offers us a great opportunity to meet and connect with new fans. We went to PAX South and PAX East in the last year and the reaction from the media and the crowd was humbling and outstanding. At the end of the day, we still remain pretty much unknown. Kickstarter gives us tremendous visibility and a unique way to interact with you, the players. We want you guys to be involved in the process, so have at it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you most probably know, game development is never a guaranteed process.

Based on real events, Unraveled takes you through a child\u2019s imagination as she seeks out her parents. Relive your childhood fantasies on a journey that will make you think, laugh and tear up (just a little bit).\nUnraveled takes you back in time with slick gameplay and a charming retro look reminiscent of the PSX days. Combat is infrequent, smooth and strategic \u2014 each battle feels unique and interesting.\nOn the little girl's journey, her plush doll comes to life as a monstrously cute creature that aids her on her quest! However, as she traverses through the ship, the rotting environment takes its toll on the doll and he slowly starts unraveling... Can she find her parents before he has fallen apart completely?\nClick to read what others have to say about Unraveled!\n                                                                                               Experience a deep and touching story in \"show, don't tell\"-style that will tug at your heartstrings as you learn of a little girl's melancholic past and her hopes for a better future. \nImmerse yourself in a moving musical score hand-crafted by Japanese RPG veteran composers Hiroki Kikuta and Dale North.\nAdventure through a wondrous, intricately detailed world that is filled with beautiful imaginary, dastardly platforming and enchanting events. \nEvery scene and every emotion is shown purely through our beautiful hand-crafted sprites.\nEngage in slick, strategic combat with your monstrously fluffy companion in a completely unique State Balance battle system that is fun and deep, yet easy to understand. \nCollectible items are rare and tied into the story. Each one serves a different purpose and shows you a brief flashback about how the item played a part in the little girl's life! This gives emotional depth to even the gameplay.\nRelive your childhood fantasies as you travel through a little girl's imagination, full of giant sand castles, dragons, magical items, classic puzzles and an 80's themed doll house. \nDiscover a bit about our world as the story of Unraveled is based on real events at a ship breaking yard -- inspired by the documentary The Wire Nest!\nWith Unraveled we want to capture the essence of nostalgia. Aside from the sentimental and relatable story, the game\u2019s overall aesthetics are a throwback to the days of the JRPGs on SNES and PSX. The main character\u2019s companion is based on a plush monster doll first produced in 1986. There is an doll house that you can decorate for combat bonuses, filled with subtle references to famous animated movies from the 80s.\nThe exploration and enemy encounters in Unraveled are inspired by JRPGs like Chrono Trigger and the adventureous feeling of a 2D Tomb Raider game. You will run, jump and climb through various imaginative environments: a giant sand castle maze, a beautiful forest with oversized flowers, an Indian Rapunzel-inspired tower and many more. The combat system is in Final Fantasy turn-based style with a unique, strategic twist.\nWe took real life inspiration and styled it like it came from Chrono Trigger.\nThe story is based on real events \u2014 inspired by the documentary The Wire Nest. Ship breaking yards and those who live around them are hardly ever covered by media and news. These families have to cope with horrible living conditions while facing the daily threat of their extinction. Forced to work for a penny, breathing in toxic fumes and toxic waste... We wanted to cover this obscure aspect of our world and came up with the story that is Unraveled.\nOur goal for the combat in Unraveled was to create a strategic experience that is easy to get the hang of and fun to play around with. Combat is infrequent and we want each enemy to feel unique \u2014 like a boss encounter. A couple of random encounters are thrown in for variation.\nPLAY\n\nEach character has their own State Balance scale. The State Balance and skills are divided into Calm (blue) and Anger (red). Using a Calm skill lowers the scale and using an Anger skill raises it. When your State Balance is far on one side you are able to use stronger skills, but it leaves you vulnerable to the opposite type.  \nThis innovative battle system allows you to plan your actions ahead of time. Combined with smooth particle effects and imaginative enemy designs, it truly makes the combat in Unraveled a unique experience!\nIn Unraveled you will explore the depths of a rusted ship being taken apart at a ship breaking yard. You will not only have to overcome the dangers of the ship, but also the dangers of the little girl's imagination. As with any child, she imagines that she is on an exciting adventure. A small patch of moss turns the room into a giant forest; a slightly flooded hallway turns into an underwater cave...\nPLAY\n\nExploration is done in platforming style, inspired by the 2D Tomb Raider. You will jump, climb and shimmy across dangerous gaps and metal spikes, seeking out hidden passageways and safety.\nAn artistic interpretation of the game's doll house.\nTo give the journey variation, there are several points where you can access an 80's themed doll house. Using points collected throughout the ship, you can buy furniture and objects, allowing you to unlock combat bonuses. Have trouble defeating a boss? Go back to the doll house and adjust your bonuses!\nAt the end of each battle you can be awarded with up to three Stars. Collect all stars for a Secret Ending!\n\u2605 One Star for taking minimal damage.\n\u2605 One Star for defeating the enemy.\n\u2605 One Star for defeating the enemy within a certain amount of turns.\n\nWith a smooth and modern interface, retry the battle at anytime to achieve a better score! After each battle your characters will become stronger by receiving a power boost. Every now and then you also get the chance to choose between a new skill or upgrading an existing skill, giving you the chance to shape your arsenal of magic in any way that you want!\nSo you might be wondering who we are. If you're going to pledge money to help us release our game, you'd want to know more about us of course! First let me explain who we are as a group: RosePortal Games.\nWe're a tiny group of individuals scattered across the world who have been releasing indie games since 2008. We have 2 games on Steam (Whisper of a Rose and Sweet Lily Dreams) and have released 4 epic games in total. This gives us proper credibility; we always finish a project when we start it!\nWe love to work with elements of human nature and the real world that are barely covered in commercial games. For example: alcoholism, homosexuality, domestic violence, addiction \u2014 we take such sensitive material and subtly create a relatable story around it. That way our games are still fun and exciting, but have a certain depth and uniqueness to them that you cannot find in mainstream media!\nThe Team\nHiroki Kikuta\nAn absolutely fantastic composer and arranger has writing the main theme song for Unraveled. We feel very flattered that this extremely talented individual has given our game his blessing. Kikuta-san has composed for Secret of Mana, Soul Calibur V and Shining Hearts among others and is providing us with some with beautiful melodies and emotional arrangements that are perfect for Unraveled.\nDale North\nThe infinite pool of musical talent and lover of all that is Corgi, Dale will be composing a full-length score for Unraveled! His beautiful music will bring Unraveled to the next level. He has composed for Silent Horror, Dragon Fantasy Book II and is an online celebrity who has contributed to OverClocked ReMix.\nArtists \u2022 Florencio D Duyar III \u2022 Stanley Vue \u2022 Bailey Gautier \u2022 Chris McColgan \u2022 Agnieszka \"mrsseclipse\" Szwarc\nMusicians \u2022 Tarissa Tavelier \u2022 Brian Coffi \u2022 Mattias Verbinnen\nBackers: VIP Insight #1\n$25 Tier - Secret Level details here!\n$25 Tier - Kickstarter Exclusive Item details here!\n$30 Tier - Ultimate Game Bundle details here!\n$100 Tier - Plushie Key Chain video\n$30+ VIP Giveaway: You get the Dragon Fantasy Book II OST!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nYou may be wondering why we are on Kickstarter. I mean -- if you're going to pledge money to a project, you want to know exactly why this money is needed, right? Especially when the creators of the project already have 2 full games on Steam.  \nBasically, Unraveled is by far our most ambitious project yet. It covers a subject we are very passionate about and we want it to be a beautiful, perfect gaming experience. Our first game -- Whisper of a Rose -- took 3 full years to develop, because it was made mainly by one person. For Unraveled we have a group of very talented individuals interested in helping out, but of course they don't work for free. With Kickstarter we want to raise enough funds to hire their help.\nFacebook\nFans actively engaging in social media is the only way a project like this can succeed! Please support Unraveled on Facebook, and help spread the word to your friends!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any large undertaking, unforeseen challenges could arise during the development of Unraveled. Producing a video-game is like constructing a ship. Each individual part needs to be functioning properly or the project could get stranded.\n\nFortunately, we are well-prepared for any problems that might arise. The game is being coordinated by two main producers, which gives us a clear vision of where we want to go and how we want to get it done. We also have over 5 years of experience with creating professional and commercial video games, with 2 games on Steam to back us up.\n\nWe have done thorough research into previous video-game Kickstarters -- those that have failed, and those that have succeeded. We are well aware of all the risks that come with running a Kickstarter campaign and we are well equipped to deal with them. In fact, just the two of us are capable of finishing a game, it would just take a bit longer. So no matter what happens, Unraveled will be finished and in the not-so-distant future. This has always been our passion; it is not just a business to us.\n\nUnraveled is our dream, our rainbow's end, and we would never let it fail. We do, however, need your help to make it the best it can be!

Once there, Cassie finds that Echo Bluff is worse than her nightmares. A ghastly Presence has tormented its inhabitants over generations, and it now hunts Cassie. She must solve the estate's mysteries or become one of its victims.\nWhile Cassie doesn\u2019t have an arsenal of weapons, she does have her wit, her cane and her smart phone. Armed with these tools, she finds clues to unravel history as she navigates her way through the home via echolocation. But the house and its deadly Presence go to great lengths to prevent her from deciphering its secrets. \nAnd yet, they won\u2019t let her leave either. Surviving this deadly game of cat and mouse with the Presence is especially perilous when your only way of seeing is by means of sound, and so you must carefully weigh the risk of making too much noise against the possibility of being discovered by the terrifying Presence. \n\"Tapping\" in slow-motion\n Once spotted, your only hope is to run, hide, and pray that it doesn\u2019t find you. Cassie uses ambient sounds of the house as well, such as taking advantage of when the grandfather clock rings, or when a loud pipe whistles. She can throw objects and use items like alarms to create \"sound bombs\u201d to distract her enemies.\nWhen you sense The Presence...hide!\nCassie uses her smartphone to examine evidence left behind. And as she puts the pieces together, she\u2019ll find herself jumping back in time.\nPerception takes place over many different eras. You get to see the house retreat back to its origins and witness it evolve over time. Through the decades and as it changed hands across generations, the house and its inhabitants change significantly. \nPoppets roam the halls of Echo Bluff in one chapter\nArchitecture and d\u00e9cor evolve, entire wings and buildings come and go and alter your relationship with the space. Once you\u2019ve discovered the source of evil in each generation, it\u2019s your job to right the wrong.\nWith each chapter, there are new questions that need answering.  And you'll need to keep on your toes for new threats.  The Poppets, for one, completely change what it's like to explore the mansion.\nAbout \u201cWorld Access for the Blind\u201d\nIf the Kickstarter hits $250,000 in funding, after the game is released, The Deep End Games will commit to donating up to $25,000 of the game \u2019s proceeds at retail to \u201cWorld Access for the Blind,\u201d a Non-Profit organization that teaches blind people to \u201ddiscover a new way of \u2018seeing through sound\u2019\u201d.\n\u201cWe have helped nearly 10,000 students in nearly 40 countries. We are a dedicated team who lead by example, as most of us are blind! Our unique, scientific method teaches blind people to see in new ways by activating the brain to gain images of the world through sound and touch - like lighting a match in the dark. We are known for our No Limits attitude, as we do not settle for the minimum requirements of functioning, but instead challenge ourselves and our students to reach beyond their limits. Our students understand that they can direct their own lives rich with quality, promise, and as much excitement and intrigue as they could wish for. By our approach, blind people can grow from being passive recipients, often marginalized and restricted, to active contributors free to achieve a quality of life of their own choosing. Through your generous support, we help more blind children and adults globally to improve their quality of life, to challenge poverty and social isolation, and to find freedom to realize their dreams.\u201d\nhttp://www.worldaccessfortheblind.org/\n\"Friggin...butterfly wannabes...\"\n**This is the current/up to date version.

Now Founder and Creative Director at The Deep End Games, Bill spends his days finding new ways to creep people out, much to the dismay of his small children.\nAmanda Gardner - A life-long gamer, Amanda has been fully-immersed in the geek lifestyle for as long as she can remember. Amanda is excited to bring to you the story of Cassie and the estate at Echo Bluff, and has enjoyed transitioning from writing urban fantasy novels to writing video games.

She graduated from Champlain College a year ago, and has been doing freelance art since then. She's pretty new to the industry, but she loves her work and is excited to learn.

His independent games have received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts and been exhibited at museums, festivals, and once, memorably, at a Wu-Tang concert.

But we need your help to see Perception through to completion.

Many of us have worked together and are expert with Unreal. Long story short, this is not our first rodeo.\n \nThat said, no project is risk free and there are no guarantees in life. While we have worked together before, there are risks to working with such a small team. For all the creative freedom and empowerment that offers, it also presents a unique challenge. Resources are far more precious. If one of us were to be temporarily non-active for whatever reason, that could have a big impact on our schedule. We\u2019re also aware of the fact that communication is critical. Which is why we\u2019ve structured the company the way we have: as flat as possible.\n \nIn terms of timing: The game is currently targeted for June 2016. We are committed to that date, but it is equally important to deliver a game that meets the expectations of our fans so although we take both responsibilities very seriously so there might be a bit of a margin in the release date. Especially if we hit stretch goals.\n \nWe have carefully budgeted and planned this project and we pride ourselves on being brutally honest with ourselves.

Our project combines charming pixel art with arcade-like gameplay, plunging the player into dangerous environments abundant with fantastical monsters, exciting treasure, and gigantic, fearsome bosses. We're so close to a closed BETA - we just need a little push to get us there!\nWho are we? I'm Chance, the lead designer, and this is my second large project after developing a graphical tabletop for the past four years. Our lead programmer is Leonardo, a swell guy that's been programming since he was ten years old and is currently studying Computer Science and Aeronautics. Sato is the lead artist and the guy behind all of the art on this page.\nEnemies encountered are fine-tuned to give an exciting PvE experience, from man-eating plants that burrow deep underground and emerge under the player, to pesky shapeshifters that copy the player's spells. In addition to this, we're also offering competitive PvP: you can take on players in MOBA-like death matches, battle for territory in guild raids, or duke it out in old-fashioned duels to the death that your friends can spectate in - and even bet gold on!\nPlayers battling it out in one of several PvP modes!\nYou'll travel through a colorful world as you collect crafting ingredients to unlock more powerful gear, help establish your guild against the competition, and upgrade your abilities for devastating effects. You're a young adventurer tasked with exploring the vast nation of Avalon, through regions inspired by various cultures-- Medieval Europe, Feudal Japan, and Norse. \nCustomize your character with dozens of planned spell trees available!\nWe're essentially taking everything we'd love to see in a MMORPG and blending it together in a polished game: pixel art, action-packed gameplay, an entertaining narrative, intense dungeons, great PvP, and a focus on crafting. If like us you've ever wanted a Zelda-like MMORPG experience, then we'll need your support to finish... and to take things a step further! \nA sampling of the cast in Severed World... valiant paladins, cursed immortals, wacky priestesses, and even a rival that you'll battle multiple times!\nYou'll face off against characters from classical storybooks.\nDozens of dungeons to explore and conquer.\nAllies will be gained along the way, both players and NPCs.\nExplore the many dungeons of Severed World: carve through hoards of enemies while avoiding dastardly traps. All content is replayable, and you can even ramp up the difficulty for another run... alongside the rewards! Can you take on the extreme mode solo or will you seek the aid of a party?\nEach enemy is designed to be unique in its own right... whether it's a swarm of mutated, poisonous rats or a titanic, roaming blob of slime that's attacking a nearby town. Defeating our AI will require well timed shield blocks, maneuvers, and impressively executed attack combinations.\nGo face to face with other players in a MOBA-mode. Teams of five go up against each other, taking out the opposing side's minions and towers.\nConquer contestable castles on the map. Guilds wage war for territory in sieges that anyone can get involved in. Emerging victorious in a siege will grant a guild 'fame' that they can use to customize and upgrade their store's equipment. Owning territory also grants passive bonuses to all guild members within the region.\nAchieve a ranking in the scoreboard and climb the ladder for item rewards! Not only will you have a ranking, but you'll be given a shiny boon so others know that you're one of the best as well.\nA rich story narrative in an open-world, with seven towns full of interactive NPCs that offer fun, engaging quests. Take companions with you during your missions, and even upgrade them by offering gifts.\nFour classes to choose from. Be an Assassin, a Summoner, an Enchanter, or a Kickstarter-exclusive Berserker.\nThe assassin, summoner, and enchanter. Attack from the shadows, conjure divine beasts to aid you, or protect yourself and allies with rune-charged spellcasting!\nAn open-ended, non-linear spell system. Once you've acquired the first spell, all others in the tree become available and you can upgrade as desired. Spells will evolve both visually and in power as improved, with up to three major upgrades!\nA variety of upgradeable mounts. Used for fast travel and taking out stray critters, feeding your mount will increase their stats and unlock new abilities. We'll also have mini-games for them in the future (racing!) and customizable aesthetics.\nSupport for Mobile devices, meaning you can play on your Smartphone or iPad!\nWe've spent the last six months working on this project non-stop. Within that time, we've built a game... one that's in need of further improvements and polish, mind, but nonetheless a MMORPG that can handle hundreds of players while boasting a range of features. Whether it's crafting, buying equipment in the store, or partying up and heading into a dangerous dungeon, the majority has been programmed. Here's a breakdown of where we're at right now:\nAs shown, what's left to do is mostly adding more content: quests, crafting recipes, spells, and items. So, we're preparing to BETA test! That's where you come in, potential pledger. Within two months we're going to be holding BETA sessions, directly communicating with our players, and gearing up for a private, 24/7 server... all by the end of the summer.\nThe Game - \u00a310 ($15)\nFull access to Severed World upon release. No monthly fees. As a Kickstarter backer, you'll be able to play start from finish for life, including any future expansions. Playable platforms include: Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, and Mobile Devices. All copies will be DRM-free and/or Steam keys (if we get green-lighted!). \nEarly Bird - \u00a320 ($30)\nInstant access to the private BETA as soon as we go live within the next few months. You'll be granted a membership within our private forums where you can take part in scheduled test sessions and offer suggestions so that we can make this project the most fun it can be together. \nTo show our gratitude for your support, any characters you create will spawn with the Master Orb, a shapeshifting sphere of pure, destructive mana that can take on a variety of forms: daggers, staves, swords, and even a bow! It's completely Kickstarter exclusive, meaning that only yourself and the other backers will be able to use this weapon.\nYou'll also be given an extra copy of the game! Maybe you have a friend in mind that'd be interested in playing with you?\nAnd last but not least, a digital copy of our soundtrack... engineered by the guys over at CCH Audio.\nContent Galore - \u00a330 ($45)\nIn addition to everything else, you'll also be given three content rewards. Just like the Master Orb, these rewards are completely Kickstarter exclusive. \nThe Berserker, a class augmented by their anger. They have a rage meter beneath the mana display that increases whenever they deal damage or they're hit. Hitting space will activate a 'berserk' mode that sharply increases their strength while slowly draining the rage gauge.\nDemon's Bane, a full set of powerful armor that grants boons when fighting demonic beasts. It's color customizable! Pink, gold, blue, green-- something else? Go for it.\nWyvern Mount, a smaller cousin to the fire-drakes, yet just as ferocious. They're found within the caves of Spiral Mountain and they're near impossible to tame but are said to be incredibly loyal if the hero is worthy. A highly prized steed. \nNPC Designer - \u00a360 ($90)\nYou'll add your very own animated NPC into the game! Yourself, a friend, or something entirely different? Provide a reference image, describe the area you'd like as well as the dialogue, the type of NPC (maybe an alchemist or a tailor?) and then we'll handle the rest.\nEnemy Designer - \u00a3150 ($225)\nFrom its aesthetics to how it functions, you'll be able to craft your very own fantasy monster! Maybe a werewolf stalking the night or an ancient golem that has to be taken apart piece by piece? We'll work directly with you to ensure that your critter is the most fun it can be.\nThis also includes an extra three copies of the game.\nQuestline Designer - \u00a3300 ($450)\nA series of quests with at least one boss fight along the way! From start to finish, you'll help us with the direction of the scripts, the loot acquired, and the objectives of the quests. We'll be looking for creative events that are entertaining and a roller-coaster of a ride!\nThis also includes an extra five copies of the game.\nBecome a God - \u00a3800 ($1200)\nThroughout the country of Avalon there are various shrines devoted to the spirits of the world, guarded by divine magic. Adventurers that dare embark to commune with the gods are put through difficult trials... pitted against dark beasts that test their strength and willpower. Satisfying the spirit of the shrine by emerging victorious results in a boon, such as a rare, valuable relic or the god's blessing.\nAlong with the main rewards in every other tier, you'll help design a truly epic dungeon! Its puzzles, which monsters it features, mid-bosses and the final one, all crafted by your own hands. \nWhile our goal of \u00a310'000 ($15'000) is enough to fund the project's development and see a release, there's definitely room to make Severed World a grander experience. The more funding we receive the more content the game will have, in the form of items, areas, quests, and dungeons. Along with a general increase in the size of world as we hit our goals, we'll be including the following...\nEndless Dungeon - \u00a315'000 ($22.5k)\nA massive, ever expanding dimension formed by the wizards of old, stretching without end and featuring some of the strangest, most dangerous creatures in existence. It will be a procedurally generated survival mode that will include dozens of monsters unique to it in a hellish sci-fi themed environment. Players will compete against each other to see who can survive the longest and achieve the highest score.\nPlayer Housing - \u00a320'000 ($30k)\nEvery player will be able to acquire their own personal space that they can kit out with furniture and decor! Their achievements will also show up as trophies on a customizable cabinet. \nMonster Ranch - \u00a325'000 ($37.5k)\nAs mentioned in the features, we'll be offering a variety of mounts... but with more funding, we could take it a step further. The Monster Ranch will be where you deposit your pets, as well as a hub for sport, including mini-games such as races and jousting! You'll also be able to buy armor and other goodies for them here.\nArt Book - \u00a330'000 ($45k)\nAt around 25 pages of goodness, this art book will feature digitally drawn profiles of our characters, areas, monsters, and lore. We'll be shipping out a high quality physical copy to all 'NPC Designer' backers and above for free if we manage to reach this funding goal, as well as offering it to all backers at a discounted cost.\nOuterlands - \u00a340'000 ($60k)\nThere's an ongoing war for resources. Private guilds battle over highly prized mining areas. In the outerlands, the wild west of Severed World, anything goes. It's a sandbox area, where players can build and destroy in a chaotic, ever-changing landscape that revolves around securing territory as a guild, building a fortress, and surviving incoming raiders. \n From day one, we've been entirely self-funded. $20'000 of our own money has been used to pay the way for the project thus far. We're asking for less than that so we can continue doing what we love: working on an MMORPG that meshes pixel art, great gameplay, and multi-player fun. If we're funded, we'll continue the routine of working on this game non-stop, and the backers will be able to see the progress in bi-weekly updates, test sessions, and live streams.\nWith your support, BETA testing will be under-way in the coming months and a public release soon after! Your generous pledges will go towards: the development of code, paying artists and sound designers, polish and improvement, and the legal costs.\nIf you have any further questions, we'll be happy to answer!

With video game development in particular, there's a potential for missing deadlines. While we won't be putting an official date on the release, we will be working on the game at maximum output without fail, until we reach there.

Today we had a celebration yoga class for our 1 year anniversary at our Little Organics shop and Renata and Hunter came in wearing our Radiance yellow nursing mama. I loved how it looked on her and how good her neckline looked!

But I grinned and said to her, it pushes me to work harder! Being a mum is super busy and juggling entrepreneurial dreams is another thing! \nWithout a higher goal, I'll probably sit back and clap my hands that mummies are looking and liking my tops enough to buy. Giving myself a goal means I need to put myself out there and promote promote promote!
