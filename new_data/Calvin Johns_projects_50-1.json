[{"backer": "Calvin Johns", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Glory is a dry erase fantasy adventure for 1-4 players that plays in 60-90 minutes. Both sides of your hero board, and every card in the game is dry erasable. On them you will find check boxes to track all sorts of things throughout your game.\nYour playing area will expand as you collect coinage, information, goods, abilities, and fate. As your adventure takes you back and forth across the kingdom, you will collect points of glory by defeating monsters and helping towns. Earn 20 glory to win. Along the way, your improving glory score will lead to greater personal power.\nEach turn you will roll & move,  add modifiers from cards, choose direction, and potentially expend health to march. Turns are snappy, until someone takes a battle.\nThere are several decks and types of locations. But when you land on a battle or lair space, the rules shift to dice fighting. \nAs you gain glory it progressively becomes harder to gain more. Ergo, you must push yourself to face ever greater challenges. Near the end of the game, players may choose to fight monsters to the death in order to catch up or secure a victory. Is it better to sit back and stay safe, or put everything on the line?\nGlory: First Edition runs a 7.8 on boardgamegeek.com with 104 ratings:\nThe best light weight game on the market in my view. Fast paced, wonderful presentation, balanced and always a fun game.\n-Slimeman, 44 games rated\n\nSimple rules, very easy to learn, and a ton of fun to play. There are many paths to victory, so no two sessions are the same\u2026\n-raitoning, 82 games rated\n\nFantastic game with great replay value and love the option of 1 player scenarios as well. Every piece in the box is high quality and hasn't let me down : )\n-00Bogey, 26 games rated\n\nFun light game. Material quality is amazing.\n-HerbinLegend, 68 games rated\nSolo play uses the same mechanics as multiplayer, but the win condition changes to a race against the fate deck. Each hero has a different scenario to solve with 12 fate cards, drawn once every second turn. Fate spaces become hazards therefore, and 20 glory does not win you the game (but still improves your resources). \n\nFor the adventurer, trouble is coming from the north. Goods normally bought at the castle are in the south-west lair. A dancing danger is available to the south east. Two quests are known. If you visit the both the west and east towns, you gain a coin. But will these benefits help, or are they bait, wasting your precious time? No guts, no glory- but just as true: to the rash, death. You must find the right balance of preparation and boldness, logistics and direct conflict.\n Two Add-Ons are available: \nDragon Shine cards ($12 USD) and\nPVC map ($30 USD).\nYou can buy these items together by choosing the Deluxe Pledge, saving 14%.\nAll shipping charged after the campaign in USD", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe manufacturing process has already begun: we started a pre-order campaign in Dec 2020 for first edition owners.

A galactic age.\nAn age of bounty hunters, vagrants and bleeding-heart outlaws.\nThis is the NEW REBEL ERA, and the only thing worth a damn is the sweat off your back, the bullet in your chamber and the fuel in your tank. The galaxy is a lawless expanse, known as the FRONTIER GALAXY, and you are an INTERSTELLAR OUTLAW. Together with YOUR SHIP and YOUR CREW you have to eke out a living in the Frontier Galaxy, and chase down the intergalactic dream of freedom and success.\nORBITAL BLUES is a new lo-fi space western roleplaying game from SoulMuppet Publishing, written by Sam Sleney & Zachary Cox.  A roleplaying love-letter to off-beat sci-fi, vintage music, and cooperative old-school styled roleplay, Orbital Blues allows you to play out rules-light tabletop adventures in the style of space westerns such as Cowboy Bebop, Firefly and Guardians of the Galaxy.\nStepping into the shoes of Interstellar Outlaws, players band together to form Crews, and navigate a hard-going, gig-economy living on the fringes of a space-faring society.\nDeveloped on the critically acclaimed rules-lite system of Best Left Buried, Orbital Blues uses a simple D6 based system with 3 basic stats - MUSCLE, GRIT, and SAVVY - to handle rolls and uncertainty - putting the narrative and relationships of the player characters at the heart of play without the baggage of hefty mechanics, classes or roles. \nIn addition to the three core stats, characters also have GAMBITS, and TROUBLES. Gambits are a measure of a character's special talents or unique abilities, whilst Troubles track the heartbreaks, set-backs and blues that Interstellar Outlaws gather around them on their adventures in a difficult universe.  With these simple values and a wealth of gambits and troubles in the core book, players can build a wide variety of unique, storied characters to explore the Frontier Galaxy. \nWorking together, Crews generate a scrappy ship to call home, and must balance their Credits & Debts  in order to stay afloat. Whether it's knowing how they'll pay for a bowl of bell peppers and beef, or where they'll find another clip for their 9mm, the session-by-session play of Orbital Blues is driven by  the rollercoaster lives of Interstellar Outlaws and the work they have to constantly seek out.\nWhether it's hauling salvage across back-water systems or getting boots on the ground sniffing out the Frontier Galaxy's most dangerous bounties, the core book of Orbital Blues is brimming with generators, adventure hooks, play prompts and even a sand-box setting for storytellers to get memorable campaigns going, whilst player characters contend with their own interpersonal relationships and troubles. \n\nOrbital Blues is a 120-Page Trade 6\"x9\"Hardback Book,  with writing and creative direction from Sam Sleney and Zachary Cox, furnished with stunning art from Josh Clark and layout work from Lone Archivist. Edited by Jared Sinclair, Orbital Blues is tight, stylish roleplaying package for all your lo-fi, sci-fi needs. \nWe're printing Orbital Blues with two alternative covers; the standard Day cover, saturated with the big blue sky and the desert dust,  and a Kickstarter-exclusive night-mode cover for those who like to keep their book collections subtle and sophisticated. \nDay Cover\n*WIP - As a Kickstarter Exclusive we really want this one to shine...\nWe use a size slightly larger than A5, Trade (6\" x 9\") across all of our books, to help us stuff more goodness into each page. The hardcover books are planned to be offset, allowing us to feature higher-quality paper, smyth-sewn bindings and all kinds of bells, whistles and ribbons with additional funding.\nThe internals of the book are being beautifully laid out by Lone Archivist, incorporating art, text and tables seamlessly into visually stunning and easy to navigate pages and spreads.\nSpread pages from Crew Ship Generation.\nA spread from The Sutler System, a sandbox adventure included in the core book.\nAs for shipping physical books,  US Distribution will be handled via Exalted Funeral, and the UK & RoW distribution will be handled in house by the SoulMuppet Publishing team. If the campaign is successful and exceeds expectations, we've got specialist fulfilment contractors in place to help fulfil and navigate shipping.\n For backers who pledge for the PDF version, we\u2019ve successfully distributed files via DriveThruRPG and Kickstarter previously and are confident we can do it again.\n\nThis campaign aims to fulfil orders for a print-run of Orbital Blues. At the time of writing, the manuscript is finished, gone through extensive playtesting with a public playtest beta, and is currently being laid out - we're just looking to get it finalised and printed in the quality it deserves, and into your hands. We have pledges for the core book at .PDF and Physical Hardback tiers to deliver on this plan.  \nFollowers of SoulMuppet Publishing know the work and care that's been put into our flagship game, Best Left Buried. With Orbital Blues, we're looking to do the same for sci-fi roleplaying as we did for dark fantasy roleplaying with BLB. We want to make a modern, robust,  and affordable game with a lifetime of support and releases.  Once this Kickstarter funds, we'll immediately start enacting plans to give this game the same longevity, support and accessibility that Best Left Buried enjoys.\nTo stay true to the vintage music roots that inspired the game, we've also collaborated with musician and tabletop writer Chris Bissette to create a  cassette tape LP of music from the universe of Orbital Blues, with Chris performing as the fictional band The Deltas. The tape comes beautifully packaged in a crimson red rave case with an small adventure on the case insert. You can pick the tape up with your book in our Bounty Hunter pledge.\nIf you're eager to dive into our visions and the sounds of Orbital Blues, Creative Director Sam has compiled a living playlist of music, containing tracks and artists that inspired the writing, creation and atmosphere of Orbital Blues.\n Music has been a huge influence in the writing of Orbital Blues, and Sam has curated this playlist to reflect the sounds and styles that have imbued the project with so much life. We have no affiliation with any of the artists in this playlist (though if anyone knows anyone, hook us up... - S) and it's purely a curation of tracks that inspired the making of the book. You can listen and follow on spotify here, and you can expect updates to the playlist whenever we have pen to paper in the future.\n\nWith Orbital Blues already sitting pretty as a completed product, and now funded, the only way is up. We're looking to support Orbital Blues as a flagship game here at SoulMuppet Publishing, and we know the best way to do that is with more adventures and expansions to the core book. Along with additional art and higher production values, each incremental amount raised for this campaign after we hit goal will fund further material from guest writers. Depending on how far we go after funding, we'll also look at adding additional tiers with extra merch. Keep an eye on the tracker below!\nOnwards and upwards, and as we approach the final 24 hours of this campaign, we're setting our sights on one last stretch goal - an upgrade to the cassettes that so many of you have pledged for. How much can you upgrade a 60 year-old storage medium, we hear you wonder. Well, at 700% funding we'll be;\nAdding Limited Edition Orbital Blues Guitar Picks to each Cassette\nPutting more content on the inlays\nAdding an A6 Tri-fold Scenario to every Cassette\nWe're looking into ensuring the Cassettes are of the highest quality, so even if you don't have a tape player, they will still make for stylish display pieces in their own right. Currently we're looking at BandCDs to fulfil the cassette prints, and you can see a portfolio of their work below - we're confident the Orbital Blues Cassette will be a gorgeous compliment to an already stunning game.\n\nUpon reaching \u00a360,000, we're proud to announce we'll be putting this additional funding towards adding the talented Basheer Ghouse to our roster of contributing writers on Orbital Blues, with one last job...\n The job was simple. Run the briefcase to the Rock of Tariq, make sure no-one opens it, and get the sort of pay-out that crews retire on. The journey wasn't exactly safe, but for that sort of money, who cares?\nYet when you arrived at the Rock, you found your employer dead and no-one able to pay you.\nNow half a dozen factions want the cargo, and most of them are willing to kill to get it. Now you're in a race against time. Figure out what's going on, offload your cargo, and get out of there. Or else you'll join the growing list of bodies on the infamous Rock of Tariq.\nBasheer  (@BasheerGhouse) is a writer and cultural consultant based out of San Jose, California. In addition to work for companies like Kobold Press and Rowan, Rook, and Deckard, he's independently published RPGs that range from absurdist comedy to collaborative horror. His contributions can be found in products like Alien Archive 4, Warlock Grimoire 2, and Spire: Shadow Operations, and his personal work can be found at his itch.io page.\nFor us, Basheer is delivering a pulp pressure cooker of an adventure, where Interstellar Outlaw Crews will find themselves pitted against dangerous opponents in a high-risk, high-stakes, and high-reward play of intrigue and action.\nIn reaching 50k, we're confident in announcing that a set 4 Orbital Blues dice will now be included with all Interstellar Kingpin pledges. This will not increase the price on that pledge.\nWe'll have some proofs of the dice with us within the week, but rest assured, they're just as glossy and polished as the rest of the project.\nIf you want to pick up these dice outside of the Interstellar Kingpin pledge, they'll be available in the post-campaign pledge manager for add-ons.\nUpon hitting \u00a345,000 in funding, we've added Giuliano Roverato (@KnightRamen) to our ever-growing team of contributing writers! Giuliano is a Brazilian narrative designer that lives for good food, tough choices and exploring weird dungeons forgotten on the corners of our reality. Best known for the culinary adventure, Bakto\u2019s Terrifying Cuisine, he is wondering if the post-fantasy RPG Brave Zenith will ever see the light of day. Oh, and he really wants to write a bossanova inspired adventure for Orbital Blues too, so let's hear about what he has in store for us!\n\"I want to see the golden shores of my old home, feel its warm sands on my feet, hear the bittersweet melodies, the ones sang to me in bedtime stories by sobbing workers. Day and night the people of Tradis station toil away, forced to clean the planet-side wasteland that the corp calls the \u201cfuture of living.\u201d\nWe are tired, angry and dying. We have nostalgia for a home that is unknown to us. This is not a strike. This a call for help. Bring us home, outlaws. Chega de Saudade.\"\n\nIn Giuliano's stirring exploration of themes of home, nostalgia, place and being, Interstellar Outlaw Crews will visit Tradis station and discover the meaning of Saudade, know the plight of its workers, and be tempted by corporate money beyond their wildest dreams. Here, you can\u2019t save everyone.\n\nThought-provoking and emotive, Giuliano's pitch is one we're incredibly excited for, and we're thrilled to have him onboard.\n Music is a key part of Orbital Blues, and we want to make sure that comes across in a full and proper way. At 400% funding, we've commissioned Chris to further extend the EP Cassette by a third, adding 3 all-new, original tracks to the runtime on both the cassette itself, and in the MP3 collection. These tracks will be perfect for use as background in your games, as atmospheric cornerstones or rip-roaring soundtracks to the adventures of Interstellar Outlaws.\nAt \u00a335,000, we added the work of Tom Mecredy to Orbital Blues' roster of adventures, providing an open, sandbox-styled storyteller's toolkit adventure for your games of Orbital Blues.\nPlaceholder!\n You'll have seen Hagstrom's glossy ads, with their smiling, weather-beaten workers mopping their brows, or relaxing in sleek habitation units, surrounded by their enthusiastic families. You'll have also heard the rumours that Hagstrom's workers are actually indentured to the company, forced to pay off their passage with hard graft. Wollaston's Hold is only a jump away - spool up the drive, and find out the truth.\nAll That Glitters pitches your outlaws into a system full of trouble - a corporate cold war is about to turn hot, revolutionary workers are amassing arms to throw off their oppressive masters, and an ambitious pirate queen is looking to pull off an audacious bullion heist. Keep a hand on your gun, don't trust anyone, and you might just make it out in one piece.\n\nTom Mecredy (@TomMecredy) is a writer and game designer based in the north of England, drawing upon his passion for history and Cold War espionage thrillers to weave tangled conspiracies and revolutions across the stars.  Tom's recent work includes High Speed Low Drag, an introspective, solo-play experience about going to war and the effects it has on soldiers, and Condotto, a Forged in the Dark game about running a company of mercenaries in 14th century Italy.\nAll That Glitters adds a true sandbox experience to Orbital Blues' adventure roster, with a variety of Factions, NPCs and jobs for crews to engage with - it's a style of play that fans of games such as Blades in the Dark will be familiar with, and we're super excited to see it added it to the ever-growing library of supplemental content storytellers can utilise for Orbital Blues.\nUpon reaching \u00a330,000, we added Momatoes to our writing team! Momatoes (@momatoes) is a Filipina game and graphic designer who has written RPGs about memory, legacy, and the dear price wizards pay for their ambition. Her biggest project, ARC, is a rules-light, tension-heavy RPG that\u2019s coming to Kickstarter in 2021 and is one of Dicebreaker\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d upcoming RPGs. For her stretch goal, Momatoes plans on writing a confounding yet compelling mystery wrapped around a deeply human heart. Not a literal heart, though\u2026 unless\u2026? \nPlaceholder!\n Alexin Arius was a pioneer, an eccentric inventor who built wondrous automatons and augments. Now, decades after their disappearance, a desperate sheriff hires a crew of Interstellar Outlaws for what looks to be a straightforward bounty: track Alexin in a promising new location, the long-forgotten Everjoy space station and amusement park.\nBut not all is what it seems, and the supposedly abandoned Everjoy is steeped in endless mystery. Rust and decay run rampant - but why does the jingle still play over the stale air? No customer had set foot in its towering rides or souvenir shops for years - but why do the animatronic mascots still greet you with a smile? And the wide-eyed children who watch you from edges and corners - who are they, and what secrets lurk in the utopia they\u2019ve built?\nVisit Everjoy now, where the good times must never end.\n\nMomatoes' EVERJOY adventure will now be available in .PDF, and will be distributed, fully illustrated, along with Sinta Posadas' A STARBORN RESISTANCE, once the core book has shipped, ensuring that everyone will have a nice shiny core book to run their adventures with! We can't wait to see what Momatoes has in store for us, and what else the future may bring for Orbital Blues!\nWe've received nothing but kind words and praise for our art direction, so as such we're taking the leap to collect all the creative energies that have made this project a reality, with Wayward Stars: The Art of Orbital Blues. A coffee table art book in miniature (we're looking at 6\" x 9\" A5 horizontal) Wayward Stars will delve into the artistic process, world-building and step-by-step explorations of how a tabletop game's art is made, with words from Josh Clark.\nPlaceholder!\nA deep-dive into the worldbuilding of Orbital Blues.\nWayward Stars will be available as an add-on, or available in the WAYWARD STAR, SPACE COWBOY 2 or INTERSTELLAR KINGPIN pledge levels, and physical copies of Wayward Stars will ship alongside core books in August 2021.\nPostcards from the Frontier Galaxy were our first stretch goal,  available from \u00a315,000. These will be included free at all pledges levels of Space Cowboy and above. We're polling 12 pieces of art to decide 3 final pieces, and Bounty Hunter pledges will receive a collection of all 3. Interstellar Outlaw pledges will get 2 of the postcards, and Space Cowboy pledges will receive one.  These Print Postcards will add no additional costs to pledges or shipping. \nAt \u00a320,000 we added the talented Sinta Posadas to our writing team! Sin Posadas (@diwataMANILA) is a game designer and illustrator obsessed with the galaxy and all of its possible tragedies that lie in wait, just out of reach. \nSin has pitched us an adventure called A STARBORN RESISTANCE, which we'll be releasing in .PDF form.\nPlaceholder Cover.\nVaris X-0 was once a gleaming jewel in the crown of the Wings of Valor Confederacy. The Confederacy constructed \"Harvester Homes\" of the Scintilla Commune, a string of asteroid belts fitted onto an intra-atmospheric nuclear power harvester, home to any colonist willing to risk their necks for the promise of cheap lodging and a regular wage.  \nAfter a cheaper extraction method was found a few million light years away, the Confederacy abandoned the system, leaving the Harvester Homes to rust. These days, it's just a few Interstellar Outlaws trying to keep the place afloat: salvaging equipment, finding food and power, fighting off bandits and worse. In this delapidated backwater, communities need help to keep things afloat. But what happens when a representative of the Confederacy returns, promising to restore glory to the Scintilla? At what cost? To what end for the Confederacy? And what's in it for you?\n\nUpon reaching \u00a320,000 in funding, A Starborn Resistance began development, and will release as a .PDF adventure shortly after the release of the physical Orbital Blues core rulebook in August 2021. Should we reach levels of funding to commission a several contributing writers, we'll compile their works into a compilation for physical release later in the year.\n\nOrbital Blues is a SoulMuppet Publishing Production, but it has been brought about by a crack-team of independent talent to make something fresh & exciting. Here's the run-down on who's who.\n\nSam Sleney (@samsleney) is a freelance writer, and Creative Director for First Falling Leaf Publishing. Orbital Blues is Sam's manuscript and creative vision, born out of a lifetime love of space westerns, and being raised on the records of Bruce Springsteen in lieu of a father figure.  Together with artistic realisations from Josh Clark and the mechanical mind of Zachary Cox, Sam has fused the team's talent into the Interstellar Blues Explosion that is Orbital Blues. \n\nJosh Clark (@tinywoodsman) is an artist and creator who has worked on everything from album covers to business cards and video games to podcast art. His work can be seen in First Falling Leaf's \"Sins: Dead City \", From Sorrow To Serenity's \"Trifecta EP Project\" and in the worldbuilding booklet \"The Quiet Future\". He can be found at TinyWoodsman. As our lead artist, Josh brought the world & creative vision of Orbital Blues to life from the Day 1, and made the project what it is today. \n\nZachary Cox (@JellyMuppet) is the Managing Partner of SoulMuppet Publishing, dabbling in everything from printing, distribution, management and social media. The original creator of Best Left Buried, Zach has contributed to the mechanical writing and masterminded improvements on Best Left Buried's engine for Orbital Blues, adapting the original SRD and mechanics to perfectly accompany lo-fi, space western roleplay.\nJared Sinclair (@infinite_mao) is an editor and sometime writer of games and games-related material. His work as a writer includes Anti-Sisyphus, What's So Cool About Outer Space?, Prismot!, and The Vanilla Game. He also runs Spear Witch, an independent online bookstore specializing in small-creator game books and zines. As our editor, Jared cut the manuscript of Orbital Blues into shape, making it into a lean, cohesive and accessible book that cuts right to the heart of thematic play. \n\nLone Archivist (@LoneArchivist) is a game and graphic designer based out of Southern California. His work includes writing and design for a handful of third-party modules for games such as Mothership and Best Left Buried as well as several self-published system-agnostic game supplements. When not working on games he can be found crate-digging for a new Jazz record or adding yet another book to the TBR list. Lone is currently hard at working coalescing the manuscript, art and style of Orbital Blues into a tight, stylish and striking print. \n\nChris Bissette (@Pangalactic) is a Manchester-based game designer and musician. His game The Wretched - along with its original soundtrack - was selected as one of Tabletop Gaming Magazine's Best Games of 2020 and has spawned hundreds of games using its Wretched & Alone engine. Chris is performing as the fictional band The Deltas on their debut Cassette LP, Orbital Blues, which you can pick up alongside the core rulebook as a keynote piece. You can find Chris' music, games, and more at LootTheRoom. \n\nSin is the designer of the Planted RPG series, a small collection of tabletop rpgs where you play as sentient plants defending your homes from evil bugs. Their other works include explorations into your deepest fears in the Deep, Deep River, fanciful food trips in Lutong Banwa, and playing out the dramatics of being agents of a Tower racing against the Apocalypse in Navathem's End. They're currently working to complete Navathem's End after it was successfully funded as part of the recently concluded #OurShores Kickstarter campaign. You can find their other melancholic games here, on their itch.io page. Sin will be writing A Starborn Resistance, an adventure for Orbital Blues achieved as a stretch goal. \n\nMomatoes (@momatoes) is a Filipina game and graphic designer who has written RPGs about memory, legacy, and the dear price wizards pay for their ambition. Her biggest project, ARC, is a rules-light, tension-heavy RPG that\u2019s coming to Kickstarter in 2021 and is one of Dicebreaker\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d upcoming RPGs.  Momatoes will be writing EVERYJOY, an Orbital Blues adventure that we unlocked as a stretch goal.\n\nOrbital Blues began life as an internal passion project, that snowballed into release through enthusiasm and available connections in lockdown. We're looking to diversify the team for Orbital Blues with immediate stretch goals for writers and contributors from a greater wealth of backgrounds than the core team, and will be adding such individuals here once we've hired them at competitive rates. If you're interested in writing for Orbital Blues, get in touch here, with writing samples, pitches or portfolios.\n\nWe've had a few people now from various parts of the world asking for more detailed shipping information so they can make an informed decision about pledging. When you take Brexit, the global pandemic and shipping delays, and add them to the fact SoulMuppet Publishing only has experience in smaller scale print-runs from calmer times, it's been hard to make estimated guesses on the prices of shipping for a project that's shaping up to be this successful. However, we've gone away, done our homework, made some enquiries and ran some numbers, and below are our current shipping estimates.\nWe'll update this image where it appears on the main campaign body actively whenever anything changes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our book already being in final stages of completion and this Kickstarter serving as a means of production, we don't have any concerns for the completion of this project. As we already navigated the fulfilments in previous campaigns such as Best Left Buried: Deeper and Stygian Library, we also don't have any concerns regarding deliveries and distributions.

Your best friend is Lindsey Lacrosse and you get into all sorts of scraps together. But what will happen when you learn Lindsey has a crush on Ryan Rugby, just like you do? And can it be true that Taylor Tug O\u2019War has it in for you ever since you stole his act at the Talent Show? Anyway, you can\u2019t worry about that now, Camilla Croquet has challenged you to a showdown after school! You\u2019ve got to play this off just right if you want to keep up your ultra-cool but likeable reputation and make it to the Paris Olympics after you graduate.\nThe Game\nPreparing for Paris is a game of personified sports as teenagers at Olympic Academy all vying trying to graduate top of the class to become part of the Paris Olympic Games. It is a game of drama, hijinks and wild fun.\nWhat story will you tell at Olympic Academy?\nPlay as one of 5 available discontinued sports, each with their own strengths, quirks and flaws. Choose from Cricket, Croquet, Lacrosse, Rugby and Tug O\u2019War!\n  Play a series of minigames that you choose - from the first day of school, through the lunch room and detention, all the way to prom and graduation.\n  Ask provocative questions and build scenes with your fellow players during each minigame. Then roll to discover your outcome; anything from total success to hilarious failure!\n  Accrue Chums, Cred and Connections to see who\u2019s going to Paris after Graduation Day!\n  No Game Master or Facilitator required, and no preparation in advance either, making it quick and easy to get this game to the table.\n  Play the whole story in just one or two sittings, perfect for oneshots and highly replayable for fun time and again!\n  And even more content if we hit our stretch goals!\nThe Goods\nAfter we score a goal with this Kickstarter, you will receive a 40 page PDF with 5 character playbooks, beautifully laid out by Maria Mison. Both the game text and playbooks have been edited from version 1.0 to create an easier and more intuitive play experience. An example of play has also been included to help you jump into the game right away!\nFirst draft of a front cover, NOT FINAL\nSample layout by Maria, NOT FINAL, but still looks so cool right!?\nYou can see more of Maria\u2019s work here!\nNerd in Chief\n Hi! I\u2019m Logan Timmins, a transgender, Australian tabletop gaming nerd. I have been playing and running tabletop games of all sorts for years, and also publishing my own on my itch store. I have 12 games of all genres and types under my belt, and I'm excited to bring another fun and unique game to you! I like to make games that empower the players to tell meaningful and memorable stories, and I have grown a lot as a designer since publishing my first game.\nYou can find more of my tabletop games here: https://breathingstories.itch.io/\nYou can also hear me talk about my game design process on Yes Indie'd Pod and on my Twitter.\nI want to thank Christopher W Reynolds of ninjaHELL! Productions and Okashicon for running the game design contest this game was originally written for.\nI am proud to say Preparing for Paris was a finalist in this contest, with a final placing of third! \nA bronze medal, in Olympic terms!\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nPreparing for Paris is currently available on my itch as a PDF but I want to make it more beautiful for the people who are loving it and will love it in the future. I need your help to make this game the best it can be! I want you to have this fun, drama-filled game as enjoyable to look at as it is to play.\nThe majority of funds raised will go to paying Maria for her work, with the remaining covering Kickstarter fees and some 'just in case' funds.\nThe System\nPreparing for Paris is heavily inspired by Powered by the Apocalypse games, as well as the Firebrands Framework by Meguey and Vincent Baker. No facilitator or Game Master (GM) is required, just you and 2-4 friends! P4P also requires no preparation beforehand, you can just read the rules and dive right in.\nWhat it borrows from PbtA is the degrees of success. This makes rolls and consequences more interesting and gives players more of a choice in how their character is affected by circumstances beyond a mere 'you succeed' or 'you lose'. During each minigame, after setting the scene, you will roll 2 six-sided dice and add your relevant stat (either Fame, Fortune or Fans). Add it all together to see how well you do, and narrate on your own terms how it all turns out.\nLearn more about PbtA here and find the original PbtA game Apocalypse World here!\nWhat is borrowed from Firebrands is the use of minigames and poignant questions to drive the story telling. During the game, players will choose minigames to play (anything from 'Go Viral' and 'Throw a Party' to 'Class' and 'Detention') and ask questions of fellow players that create drama, tension, and close relationships.\nPlay continues through the various minigames until the climax at Senior Prom, it will surely be a night to remember\u2026\nFind the original Firebrands game Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands here.\nStretch Goals\n$1,000 - New Character Option! - UNLOCKED! Introducing Fire Hockey, the most overlooked of the 4 Hockey siblings. (**Fire Hockey is originally called Pelota Purepecha and is from Native Mexican culture. As such I will be hiring a sensitivity reader from Salt and Sage Books to ensure the character options are not harmful in any way.)\n$1,500 - Pay bump! - UNLOCKED! Both Maria and I will get a pay rise to help us continue creating things we love and enjoy. Support your indies!\n$2,000 - New Character Option! - UNLOCKED Check out the new kid on the block called ESports. Seems different to the rest, and some wonder if Olympic Academy is even the place for them...\n$2,500 - Form-Fillable Character Playbooks and a New Monitor! - UNLOCKED This epic stretch goal will unlock 2 awesome things! Firstly, I will be able to hire excellent graphic designer and tabletop game creator Vee Hendro to make the character playbooks form-fillable! This will allow users to edit the playbooks on their laptop or other compatible devices, so no need to print them out or take notes on a separate document! Everyone who backed at a level at which to receive the Preparing for Paris PDF (or higher) will receive these form-fillable playbooks.\nSecondly this stretch goal will allow me (Logan) to buy a monitor to expand my workspace. As I've continued to create games, work on projects, and be on streams it has become more and more necessary to have a second screen. If we hit this goal I will be able to buy a new monitor and even pay for shipping!\n$3,000 - More Minigames! At this extremely excellent stretch goal, I will be able to hire 3 indie tabletop game designers to write one brand new minigame each! I'm so excited to work with these awesome folks and pay forward the support you've shown me. Each designer will be paid $0.20AUD/word or $100AUD, whichever is higher. Our wonderful guest designers will be an awesome team of Aussies; Mitchell Salmon, Pidj Sorensen and Steve Dee!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPreparing for Paris is already a finished and playable game and has been playtested multiple times with different groups.\nThis is my first Kickstarter, but not my first game.

We were left with only our sun, our small cluster of planets, and a new, twisted moon. Something, birthed from the sky-eater, fell to our planet and began to twist and warp it.\nIt was the end of our world before anyone living now can remember.\nMany generations later, the remnants of our people wander the twisted land and fight the bioluminescent night-crawling creatures as they search the ruins of our castles and cities for ancient magic and technology to help us survive. The brave and hopeful of us work to keep our pocket-sized towns together and alive.\nNow, so many years after our stars were devoured, you head into the world with a gun at your side.\nI hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.\nWith your friend, a gun, at your side...\nGUN&SLINGER is an RPG about a weapon and a wanderer. A Maestro and two players (Gun and Slinger) set out into a dead planet mutated by a god's forgotten child and hunt strange bounties, investigate the world, and unlock hidden powers. During play, they seek to learn the nature of what\u2019s hunting the Slinger, figure out why the Gun is sentient, and discover how the world died.\nKey Features:\nTell the story of a post-magic world and the people working together to survive.\nExplore the nature of a twisted reality and a force that hunts the players.\nUse Two different playstyles for the Gun and the Slinger with unique capabilities and mechanics.\nAnswer Questions & Prompts at the table to establish a bespoke setting to adventure in.\nYou can be a magical, sentient gun.\n Rewards: \n $12 gets you the final full-color PDF.\n $20 gets you the completed full-color paperback & a digital copy of the PDF.\n $100 gets you all of the above AND an exciting, secret note in your book.\n All backers get their names put in a Special Thanks section in the book.\n All physical tiers get a sticker included in their order!\nbook mockup, final cover may vary. cover art by Sadia Bies\n GUN&SLINGER in podcasts! \nI\u2019ve had the absolute pleasure of guesting on a few awesome podcasts to talk about and play GUN&SLINGER! If you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for a fix of G&S, or some extra info on the design, then check these out!\n Party of One with Jeff Stormer\n Game Closet with Taylor LaBresh\n Rollin\u2019 Bones with Ryan Howard\nGive \u2018em a listen and share with your friends!\nIn GUN&SLINGER, the player-characters are bound together by fate, promises, and magic. One of them fills the role of the Slinger, the other embodies the Gun.\nA Slinger that\u2019s hunted by evil\nThe Slinger is a wanderer, looking for something in this twisted world. They\u2019ve been touched by the Twist and can pull on it for power. They must be careful, though- if they pull on the Twist too much, they\u2019ll lose themselves in it.\nBeing marked, they are hunted by something- a strange, horrifying creature of the Twist\u2019s design. During setup and through play, you decide as a table what this creature is and bring it into scenes using the Maestro\u2019s moves.\nA Gun that\u2019s more than a Gun\nThe Gun may live in a shell of cold steel, but they were not always this way. During setup and through play, you learn about the Gun\u2019s past and how they became trapped in this new body of violence.\nThe Gun may not have arms or legs, but that doesn\u2019t make them unable to affect the world around them. The Gun can use their connection with the remaining elements of Magic in the world to, well, do magic! The runes engraved on their body shape the form of their connection and, in turn, their spells. They can also reach into an ethereal plane of magic that resides alongside the physical realm to move and manipulate things.\nA sample of the Gun\u2019s character sheet\nEach player in GUN&SLINGER interacts with the mechanics differently, all the way down to their stats. Take a look at the section of the Gun\u2019s sheet above. The three starting stats are intentionally a little bit vague for a couple of reasons.\n G&S encourages players to be flexible with stat definitions. The way you approach a situation should dictate what stat it uses, and vise-versa. The Gun could attempt to intimidate people with any of these stats, it\u2019s just up to you to decide how that looks!\n G&S also allows players to, as they progress, create their own stats. In one playtest, a player gave their Slinger the Stat \u201cThe Bigger I Am\u201d and used it as an opposite to \u201cLight On My Toes\u201d. Any time they did something bull-headed or with a physical presence, they\u2019d use this new Stat and force their way through.\nThe way the stats are named in G&S gives you quite a bit of insight into the character they portray all while setting a tone and giving flexibility. You\u2019ve got a 2 in \u201cI've Been Around\u201d. What\u2019s that mean to you? Do you know about the local flora? Can you navigate easily to places you've never been to? That\u2019s up to you, Slinger.\nIn GUN&SLINGER, all conflict is resolved using a deck of playing cards. When a player wants to do something under pressure or with an uncertain outcome, The Maestro presents them with how difficult it'll be to do, and the players need to figure out how best to overcome the challenge.\nIn order to solve the problems they face on their quest to help fix their broken world, they\u2019ll need to tap into the cards they have (through imaginative game-mechanical twists on Go Fish and Blackjack), their stats, and any other tools they happen to have at their disposal.\nAs you venture through the world, tackle problems, and fight monsters, you\u2019ll get to change your stats and rework the game into something that\u2019s truly your own. \nGUN&SLINGER comes with a unique post-post apocalypse setting replete with room to be shaped into something special as your group plays through it. Elements are defined to a certain extent, then ways for you to create specifics or changes are outlined and some examples are given.\nIt\u2019s a world of hope and struggle, mutated by the forgotten child of an unknowable god that ate the stars, leaving behind only your sun, some neighboring planets, and a new moon of strange energy that never leaves the sky. There are aesthetic elements and keystones provided in the book, and some facts about the nature of things like The Twist and Magic are established, then everyone playing is given some prompts and free reign over making this setting something all their own.\nOne playtest took place in a desert land with demons, industry, and gold being key aesthetics. Another was in rolling planes with a never-ending storm, strange new flora, and magic soaking into the planet through the rain.\nA sample of these setting elements: The Twist is a force that mutates the planet for unknown reasons.\nThe Maestro controls the world and works with the players to bring it life. They create challenges, intrigue, and consequences for the players based on their actions. They have the use of a very unique and powerful threat in the form of two Joker cards that can bring an intense sense of pressure and immediacy to any situation. Finally, they also interact with the Go Fish and Pairs mechanics differently and have a unique list of Moves they can make whenever they\u2019re able to afford the cost.\nThere are systems currently in the works to allow GUN&SLINGER to be played without a Maestro.\nCalling The Thing That Hunts using Joker cards\nThe Maestro\u2019s Face Moves\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI want GUN&SLINGER to be the best thing it can be. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on the game, and I want to turn it into a physical thing with a level of quality and production that I feel it deserves. I\u2019m here on Kickstarter with this project to raise the money to pay a fantastic team the money they deserve so we can make something kick-ass.\nOur goals & challenges\nOur goal with this Kickstarter is to raise $4,350 to give the product a final physical form, complete with graphic design and art. The final product will be a 40+-page full-color paperback, with professionally-done layout and visceral artwork.\nHere is our estimated budget for creating GUN&SLINGER.\n $1,450 for writing, game design, sensitivity consulting, and editing.\n $1,800 for layout and art (lots of art!)\n $300 for printing from Mixam Press.\n $350 as a just-in-case cash reserve.\n $450 for Kickstarter\u2019s fees and credit card processing.\nThis brings us to $4,350 needed to make this book a reality.\nThe Team\nNevyn Holmes is a game designer based out of central Texas.

She is excited to help bring the world of GUN&SLINGER to life and inspire players to forge their own paths through its scarred and twisted landscape.\nJamila R. Nedjadi is a game creator and Reiki-Shaman. If they were a magical and sentient weapon, they would scream charming obscenities to keep your spirits up and attack people with tapioca pearls.

[Instagram]\nStretch Goals\nAt $6,350, Viditya Voleti will be writing a new playset, SWORD&BEARER, that will include a new setting, setup section, two new characters, and art by Nadhir Nor!\nHere's the pitch:\nSWORD&BEARER is set within a massive city that shares aesthetics with idealistic European and South-Asian architecture. In this world, magic is relatively commonplace and used in daily life. There\u2019s been an industrial revolution, and many things are powered by a mix of coal and magical energy harnessed from the world. Patrols and the army make use of firearms, and artful melee weapons have become a thing of decoration.\nThe Twist in this setting has taken its place among the ruling classes of the city, driving them to control and capitalize on its people by making them just comfortable enough to be complacent. It is a caste-based capitalistic society where the upper echelons have been infiltrated and manipulated by Magic\u2019s hungry and self-driven sibling, the Twist.\nViditya Voleti (Twitter, Itch). Viditya is a QPoC game designer and writer who loves exploring the medium in several avenues! A true goblin of the community, he wears different hats from making games, consulting, Twitter worldbuilding, streaming live design nights, reading and reviewing games, and really anything he decides will be fun! All of this gets collected on his Patreon.\nNadhir Nor is an illustrator from Malaysia. From folkloric visuals for musicians to cheesy queer romance tucked between his art books, he's very interested in seeing how the modern society can navigate between what's mundane and magical.\nAt $7,250, Adira Slattery will be writing an alternate character for the GUN, the DEMON, to be included in the final book, with fresh art by Josef Rahaman and a sigil by Ezra Rose!\nHere's the pitch:\nTHE DEMON is an optional playbook replacing either the GUN or the SWORD as a companion. Instead of existing as an object, the Demon lives within the arm of the SLINGER or the BEARER. It only remembers how to cause pain, and it doesn't want to let go. \nAdira Slattery is a trans Jewish game designer, poet, and podcast human. Her work spans comedy, horror, and intimacy. Adira has designed a number of amazing projects, and her work in very thoughtful spaces of game design will be sure to make THE DEMON a powerhouse of a character option.\nJosef Rahaman is a concept artist from Arizona with a major passion for games & the creativity that births them. Throughout attaining a degree in Digital Culture, he jumped at every opportunity to expand his expertise knowledge of creative processes.  He aims to imbue that spirit of ingenuity into everything he does with the hope that it will inspire joy and creativity in others. His work and flexibility of styles is a perfect fit to bring THE DEMON to life!\nEzra Rose is an illustrator, zinester & multi-disciplinary creator living on a small farm in Western Massachusetts with queer chosen family.

It'll include everything from the way the math works out in the system, why decisions were made, and guidance on important aspects of the system.\nThis will not only make it easier for those interested to make things for or with the GUN&SLINGER framework, but it'll make the reasoning behind some design decisions plain & clear, so future designs will be built from a better understanding!\nAt $22,000 raised, Pam Punzalan will be writing MECH&PILOT with art by Gio Manning!\n Here's the pitch:\nPlay as a PILOT who has found that their survival now depends on the miraculous technology of a Mech. Play as a MECH excavated from the remnants of a strange past civilization, who reached for the PILOT in its desperation and now finds itself uncovering its memories through experiencing the world with the Pilot. \nExplore a fantasy-like world with fragments of highly advanced magitech societies born from space ships scattering its surface. Some large factions powered by these fragments exist and struggle to keep the rest of the world ignorant of the legacies they are meant to inherit. Mobile Aberrant Geoanimus, corrupted mecha obsessed with non-corrupted mecha and their pilots, wander the lands, corrupting everything they touch.\nPam Punzalan is a queer woman from the Philippines. Her works explore queerness, emotion, memories, violence, reclamation, rebellion, and identity. She's published her own work (Sundo, Asian Acceptance, a lot of micro RPGs), collaborated with others (Maharlika, several Zinequest 2020 entries) and is on a number of major projects (Sina Una, Ancestry & Culture, Five Torches Deep, Spire, Rookwood).\nMisael \"Gio\" Manning is a Filipino Canadian concept artist and illustrator.

I do!\u2019 \nPeter Pan - J.M. Barrie \nExperiencing visions of a mythical land throughout your childhood, you are suddenly transported to the Inspirisles, a kingdom ruled by the fey. Responsible for a pact made long ago by your ancestors, you must now earn Belief and the respect of their gods or find yourself trapped there forever.\nINSPIRISLES is a completely original tabletop RPG aimed at teenagers. It will promote empathy, life skills and deaf awareness with an emphasis on teamwork and creativity.\nPlay as teens gifted extraordinary powers. \nMeet famous characters and fearsome monsters from Celtic folklore. \nWork together to heal a crumbling land and restore a fractured kingdom. \nLearn British/American Sign Language as you cast spells and solve puzzles. \nBecome apprentices to the gods.\nOffer Belief to earn your tickets home. \n\nThis project came about after running my teen Dungeons & Dragons group Hatchlings for over a year. I wanted to create something for them. Something they could have a hand in building. And something I could take beyond the group to use in schools and communities as a workshop model. Inspirisles is the result of this, a game for young players that reflects my interest in folklore and my ongoing work with the deaf community.\nThough Inspirisles is aimed at children, it can be enjoyed equally by adults and we are especially encouraging parents, educators and tabletop beginners to invest in our game. Many of us have fond memories of 80s fantasy classics such as The NeverEnding Story & Labyrinth. Inspirisles aims to capture some of that nostalgic magic and transport its older participants back to a more carefree and imaginative time. \nStandard & Limited Edition book mock-ups\nA5 premium-colour hardback with over 150 pages of material, including...\nHistory of the islands and their Friends. \nCreating your Foundling character.\nCollection of spell, ability & item cards and the tools to invent your own. \nA host of worldbuilding ideas & mechanics to breathe life into your quests, including using the arts in roleplaying, creating challenging environmental puzzles, alternative ways to earn Belief, rules for Inspired apprenticeships, exploration, downtime & Doom.\nScriv\u2019s Tour: Follow the famous bard as she journals the key locations & personalities you will encounter during your adventures.\nScriv\u2019s Story: Fiction retelling the moment our bard met Athelyn for the first time (Limited Edition only).\nMenagerie of monsters from Celtic folklore & the tools to invent your own. \nStarter adventure: \u2018Duster Trials\u2019. \nStunning art from cover to cover, including maps for locations and encounters. \nTwo page spread of Josh Somerville\u2019s spectacular knot art (Limited Edition only).\nDyslexia friendly fonts throughout to prioritise accessibility. \nHandouts: Blank character sheet, Shaping alphabet (BSL & ASL), milestone certificates & Grail template.\n* terms in bold explored below.\nPage sample by Anna Urbanek of Double Proficiency\nBelief is the keystone of the Inspirisles. The energy binding all things. In its absence, the land and its children would fade from life and from memory. \nIf Belief were to run dry, it would have terrible repercussions. Imagine something calamitous like Earth\u2019s polar caps suddenly melting or electricity disappearing from the globe overnight. \nThough Belief is generated through such things as exploration, the arts, work and even battle, these pale in comparison to the amount collected from human children. \nAs children believe in magic less and less, the inhabitants of the Inspirisles must come up with new and increasingly creative ways to convince them otherwise.\nBelief gathered from Earth is taken to the World Tree and released over its roots. This energy then spreads throughout the land, healing the foundations of the islands.\nShaping\nA place where the gods walk freely, where dragons are hunted for hoarding Belief, where a war rages between Friends, where reforging an ancient sword can reforge a kingdom, where sign language is used to cast spells, where there is no death, only Disbelief, and where heroes rise and fall together. \nIt is also a setting to reflect the struggles of our own world. You\u2019ll find environmental calamity, political greed and social injustice to name but a few. Making Inspirisles relatable to our future generations was an ambition from the very start. However, we would never want to push an agenda, so building a platform for whichever stories need to be told has been our sole responsibility. \nHibernation\nOur system and its mechanics are entirely built around the theme of Belief. Players must work together to collect this wondrous commodity, reaching the heights before deciding whether to stay and enjoy the renown or return home and reunite with their true families.\nMoving away from systems found in many popular tabletop RPGs, Inspirisles is largely aimed at young adults and does away with traditional mechanics such as racial bonuses, class systems, ponderous combat and even death.\nThough our players should expect an open, sandbox experience, it\u2019s nice to have an overall goal in mind. As such, the concept of healing the land as a team for rewards and progression is at the heart of Inspirisles.\nAs with any roleplaying game, Inspirisles will throw challenges at its players. As well as social and environmental encounters, Foundlings (players) will inevitably come across familiar monsters of Celtic legend, such as the Questing Beast who will stalk them across the land. Within the book, you\u2019ll also discover many nasties of our own invention and the tools to invent your own.\nDon\u2019t go it alone!\nAttributes\nFoundlings will have six attributes: sword, shield, speed, smarts, social & survival. When facing obstacles, they can lay down up to three cards representing spells, abilities or items. These cards display unique properties that will have an impact on their attribute bonus. Players then roll 2d6, adding the attribute bonus plus any additions from the cards. If the obstacle they are facing is truly perilous, they may turn to their Grail Pool as a last resort, a resource only carried by Foundlings.\nSample obstacle resolution\nObstacles can include social interactions, puzzles, environmental challenges and battle. Whether the obstacle is resolved through roleplay or combat, if it requires a check, it is always contested between player and Grail Guide (Game Master). \nWith every failed encounter and instead of suffering injury or death, Foundlings will instead experience Disbelief. If too much Disbelief is accumulated as a group, players must pull together to reduce it using the Belief they may be saving for a rank or new cards. This balancing act encourages empathy between participants, but also prevents Doom from affecting the islands.\nQuesting Beast\nGuinevere & Arthur, our Grail Guide choices\nOur version of a Game Master is called the Grail Guide (GG). A participating adult or teenager will take on the role of GG and become the spirit of King Arthur Pendragon or Queen Guinevere. It will be their task to guide the players on their journey, making decisions on the rules, lending voice to the citizens and fangs to the denizens, and encouraging everyone to work together, share the limelight and have fun.\nAs the GG, you also have the unique opportunity to gift your players their Grail Pool, a set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 & d20). Foundlings are the only beings able to carry this water poured from the Holy Grail. Even a sip will offer them an edge when facing the greatest of challenges and most dangerous of foes.\nTalking of the Grail, with the book will be a template for the holy vessel that GG\u2019s can cutout before sessions. This prop is then placed in the centre of the playing space and can be flipped whenever a player finds a theme or scenario too difficult. The GG can then move on swiftly without disrupting the overall session.\nSafety tool\nIt is also the responsibility of the GG to add tension and peril to the experience. If their players accumulate too much Disbelief, they can consult a Doom chart. This will change the Inspirisles in dramatic ways, such as causing a volcano to erupt, introducing the Questing Beast to hunt Foundlings, having Excalibur seized by an enemy or building a troll bridge on the outskirts of a city. \nSpelunking\nAs a player, you take on the role of Foundling, a human teen drawn by fate to the islands. Instead of selecting a race or class, Foundlings are trained by one of eight fey clans, otherwise known as Friends. The Knockers, Glow, Wyrmbitten, Capra, Piskies, Giantheld and Bucca populate distinct locations from city to forest, tin mine to tundra. Seven of these races work tirelessly to restore Belief and prevent the collapse of the Inspirisles. Whilst the eighth, an exiled people known as Glimmers refuse to help, sheltered far beneath the surface where the cracks go unseen and the tremors unfelt. \nKnocker\nAs a Foundling, once Belief is gathered, it can be used in 3 distinct ways...\n Pilgrimage to Avalon where the World Tree sits. Belief is offered to its roots in exchange for training.\n Patronage to the Inspired. Belief is offered in exchange for spells.\n Provide for the community they were embraced by. Belief is offered in exchange for items.\nRegardless of how Foundlings offer Belief, they will earn the favour of the ruling houses and feel their reputation and power grow. \nFoundling sheet B&W\nThe Inspired are the closest thing the islands have to deities. Their influence can be felt across the kingdom at all times and ultimately players will need to impress them if they are to return home.\nAs well as being great teachers of magic in the form of Shaping, they have trades in their homelands, allowing Foundling players to become apprentices and earn Belief through hard work and dedication.\n Kilna of the Fire has his forge.\n Egrain of the Earth has her vinyard.\n Athelyn of the Water has their bath house.\n Vorm of the Air has his skyship.\nKilna at his forge\nTravelling via All\u2019s Well, a mysterious portal leading to the British Isles, on their 15th birthdays, the brightest and bravest Foundlings are sent Earthwards to collect Belief. These elite are known as Dusters.\nWith the help of a Wellwisher, a common mammal transformed by Athelyn to be more like you and I, Dusters will be guided to a child without Belief, a teenager struggling to feel magic in their life.\nPlayers will then roll a six-sided Dusting Dice (d6), revealing the target child\u2019s particular sensitivity. 1: Fear 2: Joy 3: Wonder 4: Help 5: Story and (6: Other - determined by GG). Through roleplaying this sensitivity, Foundlings must convince the child that magic exists before collecting their Belief to take back.\nWellwisher\nAs well as speaking the common tongue for the sake of interactions with humankind, the fey use a form of sign language they believe communicates right to the heart. \nThe technique is known as Shaping, a term derived from the hand and finger movements used and a deeper meaning of shaping the world around them. Spells are solely expressed through Shaping, with gestures building energy before being released from the fingertips.\nSpells are taught only by the Inspired. Only they know the deeper intricacies of the language necessary to harness magic.\nThough optional, we are introducing British Sign Language (BSL) and Sign Supported English (SSE) into our game. We are using it as part of the spellcasting process and to solve some of the setting\u2019s most challenging puzzles, encouraging our young players to learn the alphabet and more as they play. \nWhen you back our core book, whether digitally or physically, you will gain access to a video workshop on the art of Shaping produced by our friends in the deaf community. Whilst not a comprehensive introduction to British Sign (see Stretch Goals), it will teach participants enough to encourage them to pursue the language beyond the game. \nThe core book will also come with an American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet sheet. The video tutorial unlocks through a stretch goal.\nMilestone certificate\nPersonal thank you via social media: acknowledgement of your support via the platform of your choosing.

He earned a creative writing Masters degree and went on to try out the life of a novelist. Rich, however, is a born socialite and before long was craving collaboration. He returned to playing Dungeons & Dragons a decade ago after a hiatus of 30 years and is now DMing for groups of teens and adults. With Inspirisles, he has the opportunity to work with creatives he admires in the community, honour a decade working with the deaf and fulfil a dream of producing something his daughters will be proud of.\nKathryn Oxenham (@Kessa_Brae) got lured into D&D by her husband Rich and has never looked back. A born geek, she attended a theatre school for ten years as a child and found that this helped with her crippling shyness. Hatchlings and Inspirisles were very much Rich\u2019s baby until she finally could no longer take an evening of gaming (Sims or Stardew Valley) interrupted and became his sounding board, editor and anchor when his flights of imagination bordered on the absurd. Kathryn works with vulnerable deaf adults, finds it incredibly rewarding and has loved the opportunity to achieve level two in BSL. In her spare time she enjoys baking, writing fan fiction, gaming, D&D and acting as referee to her young daughters.\nLiam Hocking (@LiamHocking1) is a designer for Inspirisles with a fervent interest in promoting inclusion within education for teens and young adults.

Liam is now a principle educator who works closely with young people experiencing a range of vulnerability issues. He is constantly searching for new ways to improve learning environments and researching ways to incorporate roleplaying and gamification within academia for young adults.\nOur website", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhilst we are furiously dedicated to the project, we all have commitments outside of INSPIRISLES. If we run into any unforeseen issues, I have a talented and dedicated community to call upon for help. \n\nThis is our first time using DriveThruRPG and though it is a tried and tested process for many independent creators, there is still uncertainty there. However, because of their print-on-demand structure, only books purchased by backers are ever printed.\n\nThough our stretch goals are not unrealistic, if we don\u2019t unlock the 7k tier, we won\u2019t be able to produce (at least initially) an American version of the core book. This would be a disappointment for our US backers and could turn some away.\n\nIdeally, we wish to hire a layout designer for the core book (Anna Urbanek of Double Proficiency), but if we do not significantly surpass our funding goal, we will need time to learn Affinity Publisher.

Many generations ago, the forerunners abandoned the rings and left behind the current inhabitants. The rodents of the Great Tree have built a life and home but are in need of new resources to continue to grow and prosper. \nRailroads extend to the outposts and airship ports to assist with exploration. The residents of the Great Tree live in a time of adventure and exploration, but also a time of danger. The forerunners did not just leave behind the rodents, but their way of controlling them as well. As the rodents move out into the ring to find the ruined forerunner outposts, they are met with the many threats left behind by the forerunners. \nTake on the adventure and exploration! Defend the realm from ancient threats. Join us and enjoy Brass Rings. \nBrass Rings is a small tabletop RPG meant to fit in a pocket. The purpose of this is to give away at gaming conventions and other events to engage people and remind them of us after they have left our table. \nWe won't be selling this game after the Kickstarter, it will only be available through Kickstarter and events.\nThe gameplay is narrative-driven with a small dice system used to decide the test. With a handful of dice tosses you can determine the fate of the rings of Saturn. \nBrass Rings will be distributed via 2 PDF\u2019s. One will be printable on 1, 8.5x11 sheet of paper (print to the edge of the page capability is necessary to get the proper formatting). The other will be formatted to fit the screen of a smartphone and be read easily. \n\nBut wait, you say 8.5x11, that doesn\u2019t fit in my pocket! Well not only are you getting a new RPG but a craft project as well. Once the PDF is printed (front and back) you can then fold it into a pamphlet so it fits in your pocket. The folded book will be about the size of a standard US playing card. \nFirst, we thought it would be fun if a bunch of people were at an event and could sit around between events and pull this out of their pocket to play. The learning curve is nearly non-existent and the game can be learned to play in less than 5 minutes. Character generation takes about 2-5 min for first-time players as well. In less than 10 minutes, the group can be on their fist adventure on the rings of Saturn.  \nThe other reason we are doing this is to help build a community of players. The more people with access to light entry-level games, the more people who can grow to enjoy our wonderful hobby. We are hoping to interact with you here to build games that everybody can play and that can be shared easily.\nWe can't make games without you. Well, we can, but they look really sad sitting on the bookshelf not being played. We like to be engaging and have conversations with you about the games we make and the games you play. We will be holding polls throughout the campaign to finalize some of this game, the adventure, and places within it. We can't wait to get your input and to enjoy this game with you.\nWhat will we do with the funds? We will mostly pay some artist and for some printing. Maybe buy a new strait cutter. Any excess funds will pay for trips to events to distribute the game to the masses!  \n Sign up for our newsletter to get updates and new content every month.  \nDue to its small form factor, there isn't much we can actually add to the physical copy of the game. However, we still have some more content to offer that we think will greatly improve your experience playing the game.\n$100\nThe voice actor for Dr. Crackers will reprise their role to bring you adventures. These adventures, or hooks, will work as a storytelling tool to help your Game Master make the world more immersive. These adventures will be intended to give the players an objective and to help build a narrative about the world of Brass Rings. If this goal is met, all of the \"audio log\" adventures will be available for free on YouTube at no extra cost to the GMs or Players. \n$150\nDr. Crackers Guide to the Rings of Saturn, a brand new pamphlet filled to the brim with adventures and world-building will be available to our backers. Since the game is designed to be a pocket-sized RPG, we thought about how we could possibly sweeten the deal even further. We already put as much game as possible on the pamphlet, so there isn't anything we can really add to it. Then it hit us, why not just release another pamphlet. If we can hit this goal of $150, we will design an additional pamphlet with more adventures, more story, and more locations to fill out the world of Brass Rings even further. Effectively, meeting this goal will literally double the size of the game.\n$200\nThe support from all of you has far exceeded anything we could have ever expected! If we can make this stretch goal, the money will go straight to our artists to make art for printable miniatures! The file for the printable miniatures will be available online for anyone to print, cut, and use for their adventures on the Rings of Saturn and beyond!\n$400\nAfter much consideration, and an unprecedented amount of support from all of you, we have decided that if we can hit $400 we can commission enough new art to make a zine sized 20-30 page game with black and white art. This game will be available for purchase after the kickstarter, but the PDF version of the game will be available to anyone who pledged at least $1 USD to the kickstarter. This means every person who chose the $1 buy-in for the PDF of the pamphlet will also get the PDF of the game should we meed the goal. If we hit this goal, we are looking at a higher pledge tier for people to pre-order a printed copy of the game. Until that happens, if you wan't the full game to happen, every dollar counts, and every little bit of feedback from all of you will help us bring this game to life!\n$400+\nWe don't have any more stretch goals to offer, but we do have more content we can offer! Any extra money pledged will go toward up-scaling our previous stretch goals. Specifically, we plan on scaling our $100 stretch goal up by getting more voice actors and making more characters for our \"audiohooks.\" We think having voice-acted \"audiohooks\" can add a layer of immersion to the game. We also believe it can extend the life of an RPG by giving the GM more hooks and adventures to work with. All of these \"audiohooks\" will be available for free on YouTube, and will expand on the universe of Brass Rings by bringing more characters and possibly even more locations to the rings of Saturn. Keep an eye on the Updates section of the Kickstarter, we will be posting our stretch goal progress there often!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have the core game running and tested.

This manual will dive you into a dark world full of terror and despair. The Undeads come back from the afterlife, and eternal beings crave the nullification of reality. You will face ancient horrors, but you will also come to know superstition and occultism, and you will learn to follow the Moon as the only guide in this nocturnal world.\nIn this ruthless setting, players will play night explorers, resilient survivors who adapted to the Lunar Age, an era where the sun is dead, and life still endures only thanks to the last Primordial beings.\nEmbrace the darkness!\n\u201cThou wilt tip the balance since, on thy conduct, fate lies for what is left of us all. Be steady in front of darkness, do not let thy heart cede, and may the Moon lead thee through the silent lands of the continent.\u201d\nNightfell will be published both in Italian and English.\n If the project is successful, we will consider localization in other languages!\nNightfell takes place in the Known Lands of I\u00f9rmen, during the dark times known as The Lunar Age.\nThe World you are going to face is cold and desolate. There are few inhabited settlements, and most races are now extinct. Nights are gloomy, but days show no sun nor Moon and are even more terrifying. Life in these lands persists only thanks to the faint breath of life left to the Primes, deities who are intrinsic to nature and still stand uncorrupted by the dark beings who have breached the Material Plane.\nThe prophecy of the Fourth Truth is now fulfilled, and the dark dimension of \u00c8nferun now corrupts the World. Adventurers in the World of I\u00f9rmen are usually those embracing the power of darkness to use it against the creatures of the night, or rising as a source of faith and hope for survivors. They will face a hostile environment and try not to let themselves be overwhelmed by entities that will try to enslave their spirit. Eventually, they will have to find a way to counter the destruction of reality.\nYou will face ancient deadly forests and grimdark forgotten territories.\nDuring your night travels in the land of I\u00f9rmen, you will find a lot of abandoned villages from the previous Era.\nThe Moon, called Mirithlen, is a goddess who bestowed her radiance on the pale satellite, lighting the nights up without any aid from the sun (the fallen god, Hollon). You will learn to fear and respect her since she will influence many aspects of your journey. She can give you power and courage, assist you in exorcisms, or you can invoke her name through Lunar Divination to ask her for a blessing. Beware, though, since such blessings can also benefit the monstrous creatures that await in the darkness. Some are even more ruthless during some Lunar Phases and appear only during other ones, giving life to a monster-hunting system hinged on the superstition that concerns them.\nLearn how to survive in a world populated by terrible creatures.\nThe use of magic has radically changed over the ages. In the Lunar Age, the sources of eldritch power by which spellcasters thrive are now corrupted by darkness, and usage of magic is now a dangerous practice. The arcane balances scholars of magic used to study are vanishing, and the real power of magic can quickly wear out the souls of practitioners.\nThe use of spells will cost you the very shards of your soul, making spellcasting a priceless resource. The greater your powers, the more dangerous to handle.\nDecades of darkness and death drew the Material Plane closer to the Black Reflection from a morphological and a climatic perspective. The sun no longer warms beaches, mountains, valleys, and green plains are infrequent. Most woods died or became spectral, cloaked by mist and silence. The presence of the last Primes still grants some life, the cultivation of the most resistant plants, and the persistence of some woods and meadows.\nEverything changed, and there is nothing more to smile about, if not the bright aurora that lights up the skies in those rare nights.\nNightfell is a brand new setting for 5th ed. We'll produce a Corebook and a Bestiary!\nAll mock-ups are temporary and the final product may undergo some changes.\nThe manuals will consist of about 200 pages each. A Bestiary with almost 100 new creatures, with monsters dedicated to lore and others inspired by Italian folklore, each and everyone painstakingly adjusted to fit the setting and its dreadful atmosphere. The corebook will contains rich original lore, entire chapters about the background and the history of I\u00f9rmen, religions, and cultures, and description of iconic places for your campaigns. Along with these contents, there will also be a broad study on ethnic groups, including new original alphabets.\nOne of the new alphabets in the book.\nThe Explored Lands of I\u00f9rmen. Dive into this decaying world!\nThe game will encompass several new, dark fantasy flavored playable races, along with new archetypes for the classes of the most famous role-playing game in the World, new backgrounds for your characters, and three new original classes!\nCreate characters who can face the horrors of Enferun!\nHere some of the new options:\n- Lunar Cultist: Soldiers devoted to the worship of Mirithlen, experts in Lunar Divination, and in averting the perils of the night. You will be able to choose which Lunar Phase to be bound to, to gain powerful gameplay benefits.\n- Master of Tradition: These scholars of the arcane and esotericism are masters of knowledge about creatures and legends, coming as invaluable members to parties of night adventurers.\n- Tefillin: Characters who wish to have a closer connection to the Dark World can choose to let themselves be possessed voluntarily by a ghost, becoming Tefillin. Learn how to use your ghost's powers to increase your abilities.\nThere will be also a lot of new archetypes for existing 5e classes.\nThe Nightfell manual comprehends a first \u201dCorebook\u201d, useful for players and masters. Also, we will present 80 new spells dedicated to moon magic, new items and relics are just waiting to be discovered and inspected in the search for their hidden power, and several new game mechanics that will make Nightfell a one of its kind supplement!\nLots of unique items and relics are there to be found in your adventures.\nHere some of the new mechanics:\n Grim Weapons: as you bring down creatures of the night, your weapons absorb their dark essence. When a weapon reaches its Grim Threshold, it will become formidable in fighting abominable creatures, yet a heavy burden to carry, slowly wearing out your soul.\nYour weapons will deteriorate and acquire a will of their own. Grim Weapons are deadly to the creatures of the night, but they are not for anyone to wield.\n Soul Points: In addition to Hit Points, your characters will also have some degree of spiritual sanity to keep in check. When the horrors become too many to bear, when the strain of the night and the assaults of dark enemies will drop your Soul Points to 0, you will be easy prey to shadows and wraiths trying to take over your own body.\n   Influence of the Moon: learn to practice Lunar Divination and learn about the many ways in which the Lunar Phases will affect your game, starting from the mood and powers of your characters, up to the peculiar characteristics of some creatures.\nNew POSSESSED condition for characters and NPCs.\n You can listen an exhaustive interview with Andrea Back, our Game Designer, talking about lore and our New Mechanics here:\n https://comicsclericsandcontrollers.podbean.com/e/s35e5-asking-about-nightfell-with-andrea/?fbclid=IwAR1X5FeSxOHlg3l5_oSd7KB5jsYguzBYzVlUKCSq-PVqNE4lK85j_QwMhto \nHere are some additions to the product:\n  We'll also produce a Deluxe Edition: The Tome of Shadows!\nThe Tome of Shadows will gather together the Nightfell Corebook and Bestiary, a massive 400+ pages book with a black faux leather cover, black foil design, and black book edges.\nEmbrace the Darkness with Nightfell Tome of Shadows!\n- We have dedicated a stretch goal to the production of the lunar dice. This d8 can be used in your sessions to determine the moon phase, practice the Divination, or even in the creation phase of the character when choosing the birth moon!\nWe are ambitious.

We work hard to keep these costs as low as possible.\nAn add-on is an optional item that can be added to a Kickstarter pledge without changing pledge levels. Please note that if you select some add-ons starting from a PDF-only pledge, you'll be charged for shipping fees.\nIn general, you should be able to select an add-on by doing the following:\n 1. Click the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\n 2. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on(s).\n 3. Save your pledge. Do not change the tier that you originally pledged at.\nYou will choose your add-ons in the pledge manager after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. You will also be able to change your selection later in the pledge manager. You will receive a BackerKit survey to your Kickstarter mail that will introduce you to the pledge manager.\nThe Funding Goal of the Campaign intents to cover the production costs, including (mainly) illustrations, graphics, game design, translations, and printing.\nWe decided to use any other funds to improve your gaming experience, upgrading the contents, and creating new adventures!

Despite societal backlash and anti-Chinese laws, they have turned a profit and their quality of life has recently improved.\nNight, however, brings a new terror.\nPlayers take on the roles of members of the Chinese family (mostly from Guangdong province), spanning three generations, who face threats of jiangshi (hopping vampires) at night and racism by day. It has players balancing the responsibility of maintaining their family business with protecting themselves and their community from the dreaded Jiangshi. This is primarily a game about storytelling. Combat is limited, but horror, drama and sometimes comedy are the primary vehicles for driving the game forward.\nJiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall is a tabletop roleplaying game which combines elements of RPGs with those of traditional board games. The game can be played as a \"mini-series\" or a one-shot.\nEach game takes place over a number of days (usually five), alternating between day and night scenes where the roleplaying scenes take place.  Day and night have different threats - in the daytime, the restaurant may experience racism or gang violence, while in the night time, Jiangshi are seeking warm bodies. During the day characters complete assigned restaurant tasks in order to keep the family business running. \nEvery morning, the Game Moderator deals out a tableau of Restaurant cards that the family will need to complete before diners start to arrive. Each Restaurant card needs from 1 hour to 3 hours to complete. Usually, the oldest member of the family takes charge and starts delegating the tasks to specific players. Each player uses their Resilience slots to complete tasks, indicated by the time and energy they have available to do it.\nOnce the tasks have been completed to the best of the family\u2019s abilities, the GM takes any Restaurant cards that were left undone and places them on the central Restaurant board, rotating them such that the consequences face the players and cover the restaurant\u2019s slots.\nRestaurant Board\nPrior to starting the morning scenes, the first thing each character must do is see how they\u2019re feeling from the trials and tribulations of the previous day. Each player rolls 1D4 and receives that many Mung cards from the GM which represent the dreams and nightmares of the characters. \nSome of the Mung cards are in color which represent good dreams. Other Mung are in black and white, which represents bad dreams. When a player receives a bad Mung card, they place it in one of the card slots on their Character sheet, covering a trait (Item, Skill, Facet, etc.), in numerical order. While covered, a trait cannot be used. To rid themselves of a bad Mung, a character needs to talk about the bad Mung card with another player character during the afternoon or evening scenes. Once they\u2019ve talked about it, they can discard the card.\nArtwork by Sadia Bies\nAfter receiving their Mung cards, players take turns explaining their dreams to each other and the GM. \nDescribe the dream or nightmare based on the image on the cards\nWhat are these visions like and what do they mean, if anything?\nOn subsequent mornings, any remaining Mung cards from previous rounds are kept as recurring nightmares that continue to plague the player character. They will roll the 1D4 as usual for more Mung cards, but instead of adding that number of cards to their character sheet, the result indicates the maximum number of Mung cards that the player character has to deal with this day.\nCharacter Sheet\nThe Character Sheet has several details about the player character that a player can fill out. During the game, Resilience slots may get covered up by Mung cards or Jiangshi cards. A character takes a Jiangshi card when they take stress or physical damage. When a Resilience slot gets covered by a Jiangshi card or a Mung card, that detail about the PC gets removed from play until they are healed. If a PC gets a Jiangshi card on a slot that already has a Mung card, they will remove the Mung card and replace it with the new Jiangshi card.\nOnce they have all 8 slots filled with Jiangshi cards, the player will then become a Jiangshi and they would flip over all the Jiangshi cards to reveal their new Skills. Though this fate can be terrifying, these cards can be healed and removed through game play. \nArtwork by Steven Wu\nPlayers can create Spirit Papers by taking a slip of paper and writing a short phrase or sentence on it that captures how the family of characters stays strong and together. Spirit Papers can only be used once during the night time phases.\nThe GM must count to ten in secret while the family is thinking of their word or sentence. If the time expires and the family has not yet agreed upon what to write on the Spirit Paper, the Spirit Paper will not work.\nIf the Spirit Paper works (i.e. a meaningful phrase or sentence was written with the 10-second time limit), the Jiangshi has been immobilized and players can move onto healing their family member or evading the Jiangshi they\u2019re faced with.\nThe whole group of non-GM players starts with a Family pool of six eight-sided dice (6D8) on the first day. As they progress through the days, player characters start feeling the stress the hauntings levy on the family, reducing their pool of dice available. These dice are used to overcome challenges, or to help council and care for the emotional health of the family, removing Mung cards from their character sheets.\nWhen a player is determining the outcome of a challenge they are engaged with, they roll all the dice in the Family pool at once and take the highest single value from one of the dice that they rolled as their outcome. Once per scene, a character can use one of their skills to reroll the dice pool to try to achieve a better result. \nTo determine the highest single value from a roll, complete the following steps:\n Clean house! Check for 4\u2019s in the pool: For every die that is showing a 4 in the pool, cancel out a die from the pool that is showing the highest value in the pool along with the die showing the 4, placing them back on the Day/Night Tracker.\n   Check for highest valued D8 in pool: The higher the die roll, the better the outcome.\nMing is rolling the Family pool to cook a feast for visiting dignitaries on Day 1. Ming\u2019s first roll results in the following: 1 2 2 3 4 4 - their highest result is a 2 as the two 4s cancel out the 3 and one of the 2s, respectively! Wanting to impress their guests, Ming uses their Cooking Skill and rerolls the Family pool, ending up with the following result: 1 3 3 4 7 8. Their highest result is 7 because the 8 is cancelled out by the 4. Wiping their brow, Ming's character breathes a sigh of relief and serves a gorgeous noodle dish to the members of the San Francisco city council.\nArtwork by Steven Wu\n\nThis game rewards player characters for failing, because it makes for a more interesting story! When a failure happens, the player who rolled receives an Individual die. The GM will also give player characters a die towards their Individual Pool when something occurs that makes their character happy or hopeful towards their Hopes and Dreams (labeled on their character sheet).\nWhile the main use of Individual dice is to assist other players, a player character may add any number of their Individual dice to their own Challenge rolls. If they do this, ALL of the dice they use in this way are returned to the GM once the Challenge roll is resolved.\nPlaying a Chinese Character\nThis game isn\u2019t just for Asian-Americans - this game can be played by anyone! Just remember that the topics deal with some very real history and politics (Jiangshi aside).\n\nHere are some tips on how to play:\nAvoid using accents\nAvoid exoticizing the culture - mysticism sometimes paints a culture in a very flat and two-dimensional way, so try to stay away from fortune cookies\nTreating the characters with respect is very important, so try to stay away from stereotypes. Not every Asian knows kung-fu, for example. In fact, Martial Arts is a Skill that only some player characters might have chosen for their character sheet.\nDo a little bit of research before playing. You don\u2019t have to have a degree in Asian studies, but just know what you\u2019re getting into.

With each one we have learned more about the industry and best practices. We are entering this project with the project almost completely designed, and developed, with only our final quantities left to nail down before sending to production. With the things we learned from previous projects, we are confident we can handle this project. Game and a Curry brings a wealth of knowledge to this partnership as well, and we know we'll be able to make this project as good as it can possibly be.\n\nQ: How much of the books are already finished?\nA: The game is pretty much complete and ready to send to production. The text potentially added by stretch goals is not written yet, but the writers will be able to complete their portions quickly.

We\u2019ve made our best projections and those shipping fees will be collected through Backer Kit. Once that money is in hand, we\u2019ll send the items, even it we end up eating a cost increase.

Presented exclusively as a deluxe format oversized hardcover, it's a dark, atmospheric tale set at the dawn of the Ottoman Empire -- a rich, grisly world of dazzling arts and brutal massacres, opulent palaces and bloodthirsty kings. \nDRAGON tells the story of Adil, a fallen old Muslim warrior, and Marjorie, a zealous young Christian nun, two scarred heroes who must overcome inherited bigotries and mutual distrust to hunt a demonic creature that wears the skin of a prince -- Vlad the Impaler, known to history as Dracula. \nA NOTE FROM AUTHOR SALADIN AHMED\nI can't tell you how excited I am about this! \nDRAGON is the Dracula story I've wanted to tell for years, full of everything that matters to me -- horrific creatures, rich history, wildly different characters coming together to confront evil. It's a story centered on the sorts of heroes that are usually pushed to the margins -- heroes who must reach across gulfs of culture and faith to face down the world's most terrifying monster.  \nCertain stories scream for certain artists, and as soon as this tale began to form in my head, I knew I wanted Dave Acosta to draw it. The way he goes from period details through pulp horror and classic comic influences is just breathtaking. He's outdoing himself with DRAGON, bringing to life Ottoman palaces and haunted forests in a way that will completely immerse the reader.  \nWhat you see here is just a taste, and I can't wait for you to experience his art -- along with Chris O'Halloran's dazzling colors and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou's brilliant letters and design -- on massive, gorgeously printed pages. \nA STUNNING BOOK, A SIMPLE CAMPAIGN\nFor years readers have been asking me to launch an original story on Kickstarter, and I've finally taken the plunge! DRAGON is a story that demands total control by the creative team and begs to be rendered as a beautiful physical object. And Kickstarter is the ideal  way to maintain that control and get such an object directly into fans' hands.\nThis will be a lavish book, published as a Kickstarter exclusive. An oversized, slipcovered deluxe format hardcover printed on high quality paper and crammed with extras from creators' notes to concept art to script and pencil pages.\nThere are currently no plans to release DRAGON in trade paperback or digital. For now, this special event hardcover is the only way to experience the story! \nWe're offering a discounted early bird reward tier for those who support the project in the first 24 hours, but our campaign for DRAGON is deliberately very straightforward, with no bells and whistles. It's all about making a jaw-dropping book that showcases an intense story, and getting that book straight to readers.\nOUR TEAM  \nSALADIN AHMED won the 2017 Eisner Award for Best New Series alongside Christian Ward for Black Bolt. His short fiction has been anthologized by George RR Martin and performed by LeVar Burton. His novel Throne of the Crescent Moon was nominated for the Hugo Award and was cited in the Dungeons and Dragons Player\u2019s Handbook. Abbott, his creator owned comic with Sami Kivela, was nominated for the Bram Stoker award. Saladin currently writes Miles Morales: Spider-Man and The Magnificent Ms. Marvel for Marvel Comics. \nDAVE ACOSTA is a sequential artist from Metro Detroit, known mostly for his work on Elvira: Mistress Of The Dark for Dynamite. Dave has also illustrated Vampirella, The Shadow, Doc Savage, and the serial killer-thriller Twelve Devils Dancing.\nCHRIS O'HALLORAN is a colorist from Cork, Ireland. He colors Ice Cream Man from Image and has worked on books for Marvel, Dark Horse, Boom, Dynamite and others.\nHASSAN OTSMANE-ELHAOU is a comics letterer, half from Algeria and half from England. He's lettered cool comics like Red Sonja, X-O Manowar, and Protector. He's also the voice behind Strip Panel Naked, and editor of the Eisner-winning PanelxPanel magazine.\nNATE COSBY is an editor and writer, that's worked on Thor The Mighty Avenger, Red Sonja, Jim Henson's The Storyteller, World War Hulk, Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, James Bond, The Wonderful World Of Oz, Flash Gordon and sooooooooo many more. \n**A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ON SHIPPING**\nShipping fees are not included in your pledge.

The book includes 10 technological levels and 20 thematic modules that can be combined in many unique ways, with each combination creating a different ruleset. This allows the rules to be tailored to the world in which the players want to immerse themselves.\nFrom cowboys to spies, Roman gladiators to mecha pilots, elven knights to vampires, private investigators to galactic rulers, the book provides everything needed for your game. It allows you to play in any historical era or the worlds of your favorite books, movies, series, or video games. It can also easily be customized for use with any \"system-agnostic\" settings you own.\nPLAY\n\nThe BYTE Roleplaying Game is a passion project that has been in the making for the past 8 years, with many tweaks and revisions during that time. It is a wide-ranging book that takes inspiration from all sorts of entertainment media to offer a comprehensive resource to players. It has been playtested extensively by veteran players with over 25 years in the hobby.\nYeraksys: Dying World\u2014one of the original BYTE RPG settings\nBesides the ruleset itself, the BYTE Roleplaying Game also involves the development of 7 original settings. One of these\u2014No Coin for Charon, an open world, \"hex crawl\", sandbox style, modern zombie apocalypse mini-setting\u2014will be included as an appendix in the rulebook. The other 6 settings are planned for release in the coming years.\nNo Coin for Charon\u2014a mini-setting included with the BYTE RPG Rulebook\nEach rule and item within the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook was designed and written in such a way to allow players to assess instantly which technological level, and which of the 7 original settings, it is applicable to. Each section of the book will be color-coded, and icons will be assigned to each chapter and element which link them to the pertinent worlds and eras.\nAs all the necessary rules will be compiled in the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook, the setting books will focus solely on the lore (history, geography, cultures, factions, people, artifacts, etc.) and practical tables to generate thematic events and elements on the fly, assisting players to tell unique and evolving stories customized to each world.\nAshes of the Heavens\u2014one of the two settings that may be unlocked as Stretch Goal rewards\nTo tie it all together, the BYTE Roleplaying Game uses an easy to grasp action resolution mechanism. Each character has attributes (such as Dexterity or Presence, with values ranging from 1 to 5) and skills (such as Piloting or Leadership, with values from 0 to 5). When a test is required, the player rolls a number of eight-sided dice equal to the relevant attribute and compares the number on each die to the pertinent skill, aiming to roll lower than or equal to that skill's value. Rolled eights count as zeros and thus are always considered successes, but each seven cancels out a success. If at least one roll remains successful, the character achieves a favorable outcome for the attempted action. \nNo other kind of dice besides eight-sided ones are used in the game and there are many design decisions in place to make the game fast and exciting, from trying to pilot a starfighter to ruling a kingdom.\nDo you want to know a bit more about the campaign settings with the BYTE Roleplaying Game?

Nevertheless, as first-time creators, we took great care in choosing to launch the campaign only when we were absolutely sure we could deliver it. We are very close to the finishing line. The text is already in place, fully written and edited. Layout is already paid for, and most of the art is already done. Funds are needed only for a final proofreading pass and additional art. Physical copies of the book will be printed and delivered directly to backers by DriveThruRPG, a leading company in the market with more than 15 years of experience. As we, the creators, won't have to deal with printers, warehouses and shipping partners, and considering that the book is practically done, risks of this project are minimal. The main challenge is having the remaining art, layout and proofreading done in time. For that, we are giving ourselves plenty of time to have the required printing test so that vouchers for the physical copies may be delivered to backers in time with the PDF version in

The peaceful state of the world is threatened when a mysterious poison known as The False Gold finds its way into the veins of the world's Monsters, causing terrible, maddening Wounds, which drive these incredible beings into uncontrollable rages. The once unbreakable bond of harmony and respect between Humans and Monsters is on the brink of collapse, and it's up to you and your allies to set things right.\nYou play as Monster Care Specialists, elite vets equipped with the knowledge to heal any wound, given enough time and preparation. In the game, you travel this amazing Miyazaki-esque world, going from town to town in hopes of finding Monsters infected with The False Gold, diagnosing their illnesses, crafting cures, and healing their minds and bodies of the strange, magical Wounds which drive them to destruction. To do this, you'll solve local problems, investigate the land and its mysteries, and apply the skills, abilities, and knowledge you'll build up throughout play.\nMechanically, Monster Care Squad utilizes a narrative first system influenced by games such as Rhapsody of Blood, Ryuutama, and Ironsworn. Most rolls are handled by two six-sided dice, and the game is designed to be easy to learn while providing opportunities for deep and evocative storytelling; tools to build incredible and unique characters without the limitations of playbooks, and powerful GM mechanics to plan the perfect session, or create one on the fly.\nEvery adventure in Monster Care Squad follows three phases of play - first a Diagnosis phase, where your party arrives in town, assesses the situation, asks questions, and solves minor problems around the town in exchange for information and leads. Once you've figured out what's wrong with the Monster, then begins the Synthesis phase, where brewing the cures and salves, preparing spells, and making plans is the name of the game. Finally, once everything is in place, the Symbiosis phase has the team face off against this incredible, wounded Godling, attempting to cure its wounds and restore its enraged mind.\nDo a good job, and the Monster may even grant you a portion of its power in the form of magical Monster Gifts as thanks for your aid.\nHelping you through all this are a number of mechanics that put a strong emphasis on collaboration, gentleness, hope, and mutual support - both between the party members, and the party and the GM. Aces are bits of knowledge, special equipment, and abilities you gain through play that you can spend for bonuses on your dice.  Specialties are natural talents and training that your heroes can always succeed at, and the special Mentor system allows the GM to get in on the action, support their party and go on adventures with them. You'll need all these and more to bring peace to the poisoned Monsters and restore balance to the world of Ald-Amura!\n We think that Monster Care Squad is a hell of a rad game, but you don't have to take our word for it. We've set up a preview kit right here that shows off an early form of the game you can check out to get an idea of how it works! \nWant to hear how the system works in play?

A heck of a haul!\nDue to popular demand, we have a print edition now! $60 gets you the hardcover book, produced to the highest quality. This will also include digital download codes for all of the above!\nShipping for the print edition will be handled by our post-campaign page via JetBacker. Based on a few estimates, the average international shipping cost will be around $35. it's a little cheaper to some places (Canada is around $25), and a little more expensive elsewhere (Australia and Europe closer to $40). Domestic shipping is going to be roughly $5.\nIf that's not enough for you, we have an add-on you can add to your pledge. The Monster Care Squad Soundtrack by Jan Martin in exclusive vinyl format. Custom, limited print artwork that you won't see anywhere but on this record, and a specialist, hand made, lo-fi quality, this beautiful relic can be added to any tier simply by adding $60 to your current pledge.\nCheck out Jan's music here!\nImage for promotional purposes only.

Our artist Leafie is bringing both barrels into this project and blasting everyone into the sun with her talent, and I know why you're all here - those pretty pictures, right?\nHere's the deal, if we raise $8500, Leafie will be able to produce the artbook of her dreams, full of the art of Ald-Amura, as well as her own personal work, and every single one of our backers will get a PDF of that for free. Free! - UNLOCKED!\nUp next, at $9500, the ineffable Jan will be recording a 10 track OST that'll be included in every order.

Once you're inside it, it is the world. Something drives the borders of The City ever-onward, crawling towards the horizon. Urban sprawl made real. Neighborhoods appear and disappear overnight, the city is filled to brim with no shortage of interesting characters, cultures...and monsters. That's where you come in, Slayer.\nSlayers is a tabletop RPG of mercenaries and monster hunters for hire. Known by locals as Slayers, players wander a haunted city, cursed long ago to expand towards the horizon forever. Slayers help clean out the monsters that infest the alleyways and shadows, and those that the city seems to be manifesting on its own. \nIt's slay or be slain. Better get to work, Slayer. \nThe Highlights\nA beautiful full color, digest size (A5), hardcover book \n Asymmetrical combat mechanics for each class. No two players will do the same thing in combat, down to how they roll the dice!\nExplore a world that is ever-shifting. While the foundation is given to you in the book, you as a table will build The City together over time.\nWith a game built on making every creature and character unique, you have the ability to hack and create new classes, monsters, and experiences easily. Less time worrying about stat blocks, and more time jumping into the Hunt.\nWhat's Included\nInside the book, you'll find:\n Complete rules for playing Slayers\n 4 classes of monster hunter\nSetting information to start unraveling the mysteries of the haunted city, and how to make it your own\nGM advice on running the game, dealing with asymmetry and balance, and creating Hunts for your players\nAn example Hunt, and two example districts with plot hooks to get your campaign started\n Over 20 monsters for your table to start hunting\nIn addition, thanks to stretch goals, the book will also include:\nEven more monsters\nMonster art\nArt of some of the districts of The City\nA guest adventure, written by Nevyn Holmes\nA guest adventure, written by Banana Chan\nRewards\n$1: You want to support Slayers and help make it become a reality. Thank you!\n$10: The PDF version of the game. This will be made available as soon as it has been sent to the printers, and will be fulfilled using itch.io.\n$15: Slayers, printed as a full color, hardcover book, plus the PDF copy!\n$25: You get the Slayers book and PDF, plus you get my previous game, Score, which was recently nominated for an ENnie for best writing! Save on shipping and get both games at the same time.\n$100: Sure you want to play the game, but what about building it? The City is unique and takes many forms. Backers at this tier get the Slayers PDF and book, as well as the Score PDF and zine, AND will also help design a district for the setting which will be included in the game! Space in the book is limited, and so there will only be five openings for this tier.\nPlaying the Game\nDuring a session, Slayers will go hunting a new monster that lurks somewhere in The City. Each district of The City brings about unique challenges, different factions to work for and against, and of course, monsters to hunt. During play the Slayers will prepare, investigate, and ultimately hunt their target. \nIt won't be easy though. The City itself is dangerous and unpredictable. The factions within the walls are just as likely to stab you in the back as they are to lend you a helping hand. Even if the Slayers can navigate the twisting City, they'll need to fight a monster or two along the way.\nThe System\nSlayers uses a fast paced and rules-lite system, that allows the players to make tactical choices in combat, while keep the action moving forward. The game runs on a simple dice pool system, where any roll of a 4+ is a success. Players will roll different sized dice to represent their level of expertise in both combat and other monster hunting skills.\n You can see a great read through of the of the current rules by Arvid (@breakdown707) on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpD6OTDDTJk \nAsymmetry\nSlayers was born from my desire to have classes in an RPG feel different from one another during play. If a wizard is conjuring the power of raw elements while a fighter is swinging a battleaxe, and they're both just rolling a d20 and adding a modifier, are they really that different?\nI don't think so, and so I infused Slayers with asymmetry in how each class approaches combat. While the entire game runs on the rule of 4+ as a success, how each class gets that 4+ is very different. In the game there are four different classes of Slayer you can choose from.\nThe Blade\nThe Blade is an expert fighter who carves their way across the battlefield with graceful lethality. Moving at a near supernatural speed, Blades are able to hit their foes again and again, tearing them to shreds before they even have a chance to react. To capture this feeling of fast-hitting sword fighting, the Blade uses an exploding dice mechanic to create combos of hits against their foes. \nThe Gunslinger\nWhile most wield blades or flintlock pistols and rifles into battle, the Gunslinger has access to an incredibly rare weapon: the six-shooter revolver. These weapons are specially crafted, and each Gunslinger has a special connection with their six-shooter as they tinker and customize it to their liking. 'Slingers in combat focus on resource management, deciding when to pick up a fistful of bullets to put down a monster, and when they have a chance to reload those metal monster killers.\nThe Arcanist\nThe Arcanist is a spell casting Slayer, whose power comes from a source that is slowly destroying them. The Arcanist\u2019s mind and body are taxed as the corruption from their power source drains them. The more they cast their spells without care, the more that corruption will create chaos in their plans. Arcanists use a push your luck mechanic, because they can freely boost the power and effectiveness of their spells, but with possible dire consequences.\nThe Tactician\nTacticians read a battlefield like a scholar reads a book. They use their expertise in tactics and leadership to coordinate the efforts of Slayers. While their fighting days may be behind them, or never really began, the Tactician ensures that their allies move strategically while their enemies falter. Unlike any of their fellow Slayers, Tacticians are terrible in combat if they have to participate. Instead, Tacticians generate a large pool of rolled dice at the start of combat, and use that them to replace dice rolled by friend and foe alike.\nThe City\nThe setting of Slayers is The City, a literal urban sprawl that lost its name after centuries of constant expansion. Something drives The City ever towards the horizon, swallowing up towns, terrain, and anything else unlucky enough to get in its way. What is causing this cursed expansion? Play to find out.\nNo two groups will have the same experience with The City. You are given the tools to create, change, and define the setting in whatever way best suits your table. In a city that is infinitely expanding, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination!\nThe City\nWhere Are the Funds Going?\nFunding will primarily be going to three sources:\n1. Art. Justin Benford has already done a great job with the character art for the book, which you can see all over this page. Phil Stone will be doing illustrations for the monsters of The City. \n2. Layout. Francita Soto is all lined up to make this book look REALLY nice. She will also be doing custom character sheets. You can check out her portfolio at: https://www.behance.net/francitasoto \n3. Guest Authors. Nevyn Holmes and Banana Chan will each be writing their own adventure to be included in the book. You can learn more about them and their other projects below!\n4. Printing & Distribution. I really want to get a great quality print of this game, and so funding will go into not only getting copies for all of the backers, but high quality prints. I will be using Mixam for the printing.\nAny extra will help offset Kickstarter's fees, mailing supplies, and other miscellaneous costs.\nStretch Goals\n All stretch goals have been reached!\nUNLOCKED - More Art. Let's bring The City and the monsters inside to life.\nUNLOCKED - Even More Art and Monsters. Can you really have enough monsters to hunt? I don't think so.\nUNLOCKED - SO MUCH ART. Let's fill this book with cool art.\nUNLOCKED - Hardcover Upgrade. All printed copies of Slayers will be upgraded from paperback to hardcover!\nUNLOCKED - New Hunt. Nevyn Holmes will write another Hunt to go in the book, letting your group hit the table running and jump right into an adventure!\nHere's the pitch:\nThe Slayers have heard rumor of a strange string of killings in the Revulsion District, known for being a place of the strange and uncanny horrors that otherwise hide beyond sight in The City.  The Cult of The Disjointed Hand has been channeling a ritual to bring an agent of their god to The City. Doing so will evolve their long-term shadow-war with The Sigil of Valiance (a group just as twisted and corrupt) into something more explosive, with the aim to destroy them and take their territory. The Slayers must stop this summoning, as it will surely bring more destruction to The City than The Cult of The Disjointed Hand is predicting.\nUNLOCKED - New Hunt. Banana will write a Hunt to go into the book, bringing the total number of adventures for your group to 3!\nHere's the pitch:\nThe beautiful and sunny district of Opaline is where people come to make it big in their careers. Actors and bards swam here in the hopes of becoming superstars, without realizing the dangers that lurk beneath\u2014a cult of Doctors that collect the living for their organs and flesh, to summon the great God, Devastation.\nMeet the Team\nSpencer Campbell (Game Design & Writing) is an indie tabletop RPG designer out of Chicago.

Even still, there are always risks and challenges to consider. To help mitigate those risks, 90% of the game is already written, so there won't be major delays because of development. I have already spoken with my artists and designer about possibly adding more work to the book if we reach our stretch goals, and we have realistic deadlines laid out. \n\nThe biggest risk is that this will be my first time running a campaign that will support international shipping. Given the current situation our planet is facing, there is always the possibility of delays or mistakes made during shipping, and I will work quickly to resolve them.

This allows a Squidmar Miniatures brush to hold more paint in its bristles without losing its point, and lends it the stability and elasticity needed to make the brush feel properly responsive to your movements. Additionally, this design allows you to use a larger brush than you might have normally to accomplish even finer details! The Tobolski Kolinsky hair is compared to Synthetics well rounded and great at keeping its original shape. Giving you a longer working time during paint jobs and lasts you longer keeping the tip pristine even after working on big projects for longer times.\nSquidmar Brushes - Size Comparison - Equivalent of approximately 00-2 (differs from brand to brand)\nOur basic brush set contains four Squidmar Miniatures brushes, ranging from XS to L. We chose these four because we feel they represent the most common, and best suited, brush sizes for miniature painting. In addition to our basic set, however, we've also designed a tiny brush, for the finest of details, and an XL brush for heavy duty paint jobs! Armed with a full set of Squidmar Miniatures brushes, you'll be ready to take on any painting project! No wargaming army is too massive, no immaculately detailed display miniature too exquisite!\nThe brushes, from Tiny to Extra Large!\nWow, those are some cool ferrules!\nNot only are the brushes wider, so are the handles! They are designed for comfort and ergonomics, adapted to the anatomy of the human hand.  The handles of Squidmar Miniatures brushes are therefore thicker and slightly triangular. This allows the brush to rest naturally in your hand, which lets you relax and focus on painting without risking the dreaded \u201cpainter\u2019s cramp\u201d. Oh, and did we mention the fancy gold ferrule? We thought it\u2019d look cooler that way.\nYour brushes are the safest when they're guarded by an antediluvian squid-being!\nOur brushes ship in a sleek cylindrical storage case. The bottom of the case is lined with a dense storage foam to stick the brushes into. This allows a Squidmar Miniatures brush to rest standing up, and avoids having any pressure placed on the bristles themselves. An open storage case additionally serves as a handy paintbrush stand while sitting at your workstation, your entire collection standing at attention! Handy, right?\nCool and practical in equal measure!\n\nNot only are we Kickstarting world-class paintbrushes, we're also introducing a line of exquisite miniature busts, custom sculpted for our campaign! Each bust is incredibly detailed, imaginatively designed, and bursting with character - sculpted by such renowned artists as Joaqin Palacios and Leonardo Escobar Quintero! There are 5 of these resin cast miniatures in total at 1/10 scale, ranging from 6.5 centimeters to as large as 10 centimeters. The retail cost of these never-before seen miniatures will range from 45\u20ac to 55\u20ac, but all will be exclusively available for 40\u20ac each through this Kickstarter, or even cheaper when purchased in a bundle!\nThese fantastic miniature busts are specifically designed to help you become a better painter, sculpted to enable you to practice (and master!) painting everything from warm, rugged skin to cold, gleaming metal! Don't worry, though, we're here to guide you through it. Each bust is accompanied by a YouTube video painting guide where expert painters demonstrate advanced techniques, made simple!\nSquidmar's Boxart of Illonth\nArmau Lazaro work in progress of Zion & Dea\nMagic in the making!\nThe Squidmar Miniatures paintbrushes are hand-crafted to exacting specifications by experienced professionals, using only the highest quality materials and the finest Kolinsky Sable hair. The union of comfort and practicality in each brush is perfect for experienced painters working to master their craft, beginners who are brand new to miniature painting, and everyone in between! \nThis Kickstarter is a great opportunity to not only grab a set of fantastic paintbrushes but a set of beautiful miniature busts as well! These finely detailed miniature busts, bursting with character, will allow you to grow and develop as a painter. We'll be with you throughout your journey through our custom painting tutorials, where we'll do our best to guide you through a variety of advanced techniques.  \nFinally, a heartfelt thank you from our entire campaign for taking the time to read this, and we hope you pledge a contribution, no matter how small. Join us in our quest for the miniature paintbrush of our dreams!\n\nWhen our Kickstarter campaign has reached its end, you will have the option to add some additional products to your pledge through our pledge manager CrowdOx, such as stickers, Kickstarter exclusive t-shirts, miniature plinths, and brush soap! You can also add additional brushes and busts, if you want more of all that good stuff, and if you change your mind you can also increase your pledge level here on Kickstarter. You\u00b4ll then get too choose your addons at CrowdOx after the Kickstarter has ended.\nHere are some of the great and talented artists that have been helping us out, stress testing and trying out the brushes to make sure the quality is as great as promised!

If any problems should arise with your shipment, do not hesitate to contact us at Sales@squidmar.com! All reports are individually processed by the staff of Fantasia North. \n\nBecause of these possible inconveniences and problems, communication is key. This is doubly true in the chaos of Covid-19.

These additional products include, amongst other things, single brushes, brush soap, exclusive t-shirts and display plinths for your miniatures. Increasing your pledge, adding additional products, or both, will incur no additional fees or processing costs. \n\nREFUND POLICY \n\nYou are entitled to a full refund, including any fees, within 14 days of the end of the Kickstarter campaign, no questions asked. After that date we have no way to refund any processing or Kickstarter fees, but we can still refund the cost of the product. If, however, the brushes or busts are already being processed for shipping, or have already been shipped, we can unfortunately not refund the payment. If a product is lost in shipping, or cannot be delivered to you at all, we will fully refund the purchase, fees and all.\n\nThis project is based on Swedish currency, SEK, and all purchases or refunds applicable are processed in SEK. All refunds are processed through Fantasia North, and refund inquiries are to be directed to the Sales@squidmar.com email address. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf you do not accept the terms and conditions found below, please do not contribute to our Kickstarter campaign.

THANK ALL OF YOU SO MUCH.\nTHE PROJECT\nThe Bone Herder is an Afropunk/Afrofuturistic fantasy horror comic that puts black characters at the center of the story. Often people of color are left out of fantasy worlds or forced into stereotypical roles. I'm not alone in my desire to see settings that extend beyond the familiarity of typical western stories. This project originated from Gail Simone's Comic School, which gave me the confidence to go forward with my idea. \nTHE SQUAD\nOpe, I am Zaire Lanier and I am a writer and narrative designer from the Midwest and I am the writer for The Bone Herder. The sequential artist is Tumo Mere from Botswana and the concept artist is Morgan Madeline. Morgan and Tumo are known for their work in the amazing SWORDSFALL UNIVERSE and more! Sam Willoughby came on to do additional art! Gary Kings and his sister, Harriet did the trailer and music respectively. Please give everyone follows and support!\nZaire: https://twitter.com/Zlanier21     \nTumo: https://twitter.com/ItsTumo  \nMorgan: https://twitter.com/mormadillus\nSam: https://twitter.com/SamRWilloughby   \nGary: https://twitter.com/GaryJKings      \nHarriet: https://twitter.com/Harriet_FerretE                                             \nTHE STORY\nEvery generation, a child is chosen to travel from village to village punishing wrong doers, by flaying their bones and burying them. Cass is the first to break the tradition, but in doing so breaks an ancient pact with the Flesh Folk. \nPreliminary sketch of the first page - Tumo Mere\nColored and Lettered First Page by Tumo Mere\nTHE WORLD \nThe Bone Herder takes place in the mythical country of Koatrom and is inspired by pre-colonial Africa and Afropunk aesthetics. Why Afropunk? It is a battle cry against the norm and a baseline for something different. It isn't easily defined. Fantasy has been built on the shoulders of the Western ideals. While I enjoy it, it does have its issues, prejudices, and hurtful stereotypes. \nThis is why  I am creating the world of The Bone Herder. It is for people, like me, that want to a reflection of themselves in the media they consume. My family tree and genealogy have no known origin. Africa is the framework for my existence and I feel an attachment and at times even a hole for a motherland I never knew. I imagine worlds and stories they might have once been a part of many, many years ago.  \nI based the world around ancient African cities like Carthage and Kush. The ancient cities of Africa are a rich and diverse world. I have created my own mythos surrounding the mysterious and ancient Flesh Folk. \nWhile this story is a fantasy horror comic, I want to portray a strong and loving Black family. Cass's family will come strongly into play and we will see the impact that they have on her personhood as the story progresses. \nTHE DUO\nAnallelli Yosi - Cass's mentor and teacher. Analleli hates what she does, but knows it is necessary. She acts out of a sense of duty.\nAnalleli Concept Art - Morgan Thomas\nAnalleli by Tumo Mere\nCass Ilondyri - The forced apprentice to Analleli. She's vowed vengeance against her mentor and wants to end the practice. \nOlder Cass by Tumo Mere\nCass Concept Art by Morgan\nThe Rewards\nLogo Pin\nCass Button by Morgan\nAnalleli Button by Morgan\n11x17 Print by Sam\nTHE SCRIPT\nI wanted to show you guys a couple pages of the script :)\nPage 1 of Script by Zaire\nPage 2 of Script by Zaire\n THE BUDGET\nART \nAbout half of the funds are going directly to the artists. A lot of Kickstarter comics are already finished, but this isn't the case with Bone Herder. This is helping fund production of the comic, which goes towards myself, Tumo and Morgan, as well as Gary and his sister, who did the trailer and music. We all have already put in so much work and our skills deserve to be properly compensated.\nI believe very strongly in paying artist fair rates for their time and skills. I saved and paid out of pocket for a first page and some concept art. They both believed in the script and decided to come on board for the project. I am trying to pay as close to professional rates as possible. Passion does not pay bills, as nice as that would be\nPRINTING AND SHIPPING\nThe rest of the money goes towards printing, getting books bound, posters, etc. \nThe Promise\nWe will be transparent with every step along the way. I promise to treat this comic and work respectfully. I wrote The Bone Herder with people like me in mind, who want to see more diverse characters and stories in comics. Fantasy has always catered to a Western bent. I want to help change that. I modeled the world partially off of ancient African cities like Carthage, Kush, and places that Africa influenced. The ancient world was more colorful than we were taught. \nI am excited about what I have put together with my team. I hope that you are too and that I will see you at the finish line!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter. I believe in the concept, but I haven't ever planned a project of this size before. My name isn't out there a ton, but there has been a lot of interest in the comic. \n\nI believe that my main risk would be attempting to large a scope for my first project. To mitigate this risk, I have been consulting friends and professionals that have run other successful Kickstarters. This ensures that I stay grounded. My artist are being paid through the Kickstarter and I want to make sure that they are able to be paid fairly on time. The rest of the money will be going towards shipping and production costs.\n\nMy challenges are mainly keeping an open line of communication with the team since we are working remotely. We have daily checkins and keep each other encouraged and on track.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Small Bones - Credited Backer", "descp": "Just feel like being supportive?

When I finally broke into freelance illustration, I wanted  to give back to the industry in a meaningful way.\nI've been asking creators what type of stock art is missing in the industry. The response has been overwhelmingly clear. This project is to fill those gaps for you.\nThis project will be a collection of 75 to 100 stock illustrations with a Modern, Sci-Fi, or Lovecraft theme. There will be a total of SEVEN categories of artwork:\nFONTS - ONE font for each of the Modern, Sci-Fi, and Lovecraft Themes.\nFULL PAGE / COVER ART - THREE vertical full page illustrations designed to also be usable as cover art. Each illustration will be divided into foreground, middle, and background images.\nVEHICLES - FIVE images of various modes of transportation. These will include up to 3 variants each with a minimum of 12 total variants.*\nSCENES - SEVEN half page illustrations of action or display of skill. Like the full page art, these will be broken into foreground, middle, and background images. Each image will include up to 3 variants with a minimum of 15 total variants.*\nEFFECTS - NINE images of various effects such as explosions, weather, gunshots, and more. These will be accompanied by an appropriate text effect such as: BOOM, ZAP, CRACK, etc.\nCHARACTERS - ELEVEN characters and creatures posed to be used in a scene. Each of these will include up to 3 variants with a minimum of 24 total characters or creatures.*\nITEMS - THIRTEEN illustrations of various items and equipment.

Therefore, there are portions of artwork you're not seeing when viewing the images below. It's all to give you more options and customization.
