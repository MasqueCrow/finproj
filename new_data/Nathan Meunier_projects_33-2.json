[{"backer": "Nathan Meunier", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Our intrepid author Paige Turner is back!  In Paperback Adventures, you get to play as the protagonist in one of Paige's wild brainstorming sessions. Conquer a menagerie of pulp novel characters in this solo deckbuilding word game.\nJust like in the original game Paperback\u2014and its follow up, Hardback\u2014you will build your own deck of cards throughout the game, and those cards will have letters to help you spell words every turn. But in Paperback Adventures, instead of testing your wordsmithing wit against other players, you will use your words to defeat a series of AI enemies in \"roguelike\" fashion.\nPaperback Adventures is a solo-focused game. It was designed from the ground up as a strategic, highly-replayable solo word game. There are also additional gameplay variants for cooperative play between two players.\nHere are the stretch goals we've unlocked!\nCommunity Stretch Goals\nPart of what makes Kickstarter great is the opportunity to hear what matters most to backers. Here are some of the additions and changes we\u2019ve made thanks to our backers\u2019 feedback.\nAs the game developed and grew, we wanted every character to have their own cards and unique styles of play, but with the Fowers Games history of small box games we also wanted to keep an affordable price point for the game. So we decided on a modular system that lets you play the game whether you buy one character or several.\nHere's what the Paperback Adventures core box contains:\nRulebook\nEnemy Tray with Tokens (designed by Game Trayz\u2122)\n12 Enemy Cards\n12 Reward Cards\n7 Penalty Cards\n7 Enemy Vowel and \"?\" Cards\n26 Item Cards\n26 McGuffin Cards\n7 Penalty Card Sleeves\nAs long as you have at least one character box, the core box contains everything else you need to play the game. The core box also has space to store the bonus content from each of your character boxes (note: not all content from those boxes), allowing you to set up a new game more quickly.\nSo what comes in a character box? Each protagonist in Paperback Adventures plays distinctly, with different core items, starting items, and a unique 10-card starting deck. Additionally, every protagonist has their own growth deck of 50 cards that offers different paths and playstyles every game session.\nBut a character box doesn't only provide new content when you choose that character. Inside each character box you'll also find a few new enemies and a few new bonus items and McGuffins that go into your core box and add additional content no matter which character you pick for a given game.\nEach character box has bonus enemies, items, and double-sided McGuffins (like this one!)\nThe more character boxes you add, the more variety and wacky combinations you get. \nHere's what comes in each character box:\nCharacter Tray with Tokens (designed by Game Trayz\u2122)\nCharacter Card\n6 Enemy Cards\n6 Reward Cards\n60 Letter Cards\n6 Core Item Cards\n4 Bonus Item Cards\n4 Bonus McGuffin Cards\n60 Letter Card Sleeves\nThe protagonists are not only unique from a gameplay standpoint, they also come from wildly different genres and have their own graphical style and artistic design. Here are the playable characters in Paperback Adventures:\nOur final character is a Pirate\u2014he is currently awaiting a proper name to be voted on by the backers!\nWord-heavy playstyle\nBarrage cards get bonuses for longer words\nCan drain the enemy's life!\nCan copy the effect of an item\u2014effectively using it twice\nCrew cards come back from the fatigue pile\nTry out the Tabletop Simulator demo on Steam!\nIn a single game of Paperback Adventures, your protagonist will face off against nine randomized enemies of escalating difficulty.  To make matters worse, your health total persists from enemy to enemy. Luckily for you, each enemy also offers randomized rewards to help you power up quickly to meet the challenge. \nYou'll need to beat each enemy one by one by spelling words with the cards in your hand. Each card has symbols that either damage the enemy, block the enemy's incoming damage to you, or provide you with mana so you can use your items. You'll also be able to activate the unique ability of one of your cards.\nThe game is divided in a trilogy structure, where you'll battle two normal enemies and a boss for each \"book\" in the trilogy. You can stop a game session after completing one book (~45 min) or even after any enemy through a \"save game\" feature that will keep your current deck, items, and rewards separate in the game's box. To beat the game, you'll need to defeat all nine enemies in the trilogy.\nOne goal from the outset of this game's design was to find ways to streamline the typical deckbuilding roguelike experience found in digital games for tabletop play. Two essential systems deliver the gameplay variation and combos needed for the genre while keeping player upkeep at a minimum: the splay system and the hex and boon counter system.\nYour word is ready\u2014which way will you splay?\n When you spell words each turn in Paperback Adventures, you'll need to also choose which way to splay your word, so that only one edge of each card is showing except for the top card. The only card ability visible will be on the top card, and that's the ability you activate. Here's an example of how it works:\nWhen you splay left, you count all the icons on the left edge of each card. The top card is the last letter of the word.\nWhen you splay right you count all the icons on the right edge of each card. The top card is the first letter of the word.\nThe splay system forces you to make tough choices\u2014do you want more blocks or more hits this turn? Or maybe which card is your top card matters most. To make that decision even tougher (and to keep every battle moving), the top card also gets fatigued for the rest of the battle. You'll get it back for the next enemy, though!\nHex and boon counters allow protagonists and enemies to support a wide range of playstyles without adding too many rules and overhead for players to track. Hex counters affect the character they are on negatively, while boon counters affect the character they are on positively. So these counters are always contextual--one enemy's hex counters might cause accelerating damage, while another enemy's hex counters limit your card draw.\nHere is a link to the current working rulebook for Paperback Adventures\nWe know that some players will want a tougher challenge, especially after completing a few runs. So we\u2019ll be including a system called Plot Twists.\nEvery Plot Twist comes with two distinct challenges, one on top and one on bottom, for the entirety of your run. Here is one condition card unlocked earlier in the campaign:\nEach challenge has a difficulty number assigned to it, with \u201c1\u201d being the lowest difficulty. Before starting a run, you can choose an overall challenge level for your run and then mix and match challenges from the various Plot Twists until the collective difficulty numbers add up to your desired challenge level. This way, you can experience brand new challenge combinations while also making the game better fit your experience and skill level.\nYou can splay the Plot Twists underneath your player tray, showing only the new rules from your chosen challenges so that you can quickly reference them. Those rules will stay the same throughout your run.\nWhile Paperback Adventures was designed from the start as a solo experience, we also knew that people would enjoy playing it with others. We\u2019ve been playtesting and working behind the scenes to bring some two player variants to the table that not only open up a seat for an additional player but also open up new ways to approach the game.\nTwo-Headed Giant\nThis cooperative mode really leans into the idea of co-op play. The two players must work in tandem using the same character, deck, and token tracker. But here\u2019s the kicker: you split your starting items and McGuffins between the two of you. Additionally, you alternate taking turns, which means your items and McGuffins are only available half the time. Anytime you gain an item or McGuffin, you both gain one!\nA lot of the fun in this variant comes from working together to find the best words and setting each other up for big turns. Don\u2019t just take our word for it though; check out this gameplay video where we show off the mode over a couple different enemy fights.\nDouble Trouble\nIn the Double Trouble mode, each player has their own character to play! They team up against a pair of enemies, but they must coordinate their attacks and share certain resources\u2014like the wild card!  (To make this possible, one enemy uses the tray from the unused character.)\n Paperback Playthrough with Aaron of GameEnthus and designer Skye Larsen\nPlaythrough from a Live Stream with Ruel Gaviola on Tabletop Tonight\nBook 2 Gameplay from a Live Stream with Richmond of BramBeard Gaming\nJason Perez with One Stop Co-op Shop\nYou won't get too far in a roguelike without sweet loot. Reward cards for each enemy will give you two options to choose from. You have to choose which set of loot is more important to keep progressing.\nItems provide powerful effects that can be used once per turn, but you'll need mana to activate most of them.  \nExamples of a McGuffin and item with completed art\nMcGuffins are always double-sided, and you'll get to choose which McGuffin will help you more. These powerups provide modest effects, but don't require mana for use. Find the right ones for some spectacular combos!\nEvery character letter card is also upgradeable. When a reward says you upgrade a card, flip the card over and put it back in its sleeve. Some card upgrades add extra icons to the card, while others improve or even alter the card ability.\n\n Shipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager after the campaign.  We ship customs friendly.\n Tim Fowers, co-designer, has piloted many successful games including Burgle Bros, Fugitive, and Paperback \n Skye Larsen, co-designer, has finally justified his Creative Writing degree (sort of)\n Jeff Krause, development, worked with Tim on Sabotage and Burgle Bros 2 \n Ryan Goldsberry, illustrator, helps bring all of Tim's games to life\n Noah Adelman, product design, has designed components and storage solutions for many successful games through his company Game Trayz\u2122\n We'd also like to thank Andrew Colin Beck for our logo design, Nate Stebbing for the animation work in our Kickstarter video, and Fernando Cunha for our gameplay animations on this page.\nWe will use a pledge manager to help our backers get their copy of Paperback Adventures as quickly as possible.

Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

The player places their resistance agents on spaces around town to achieve their goals - blowing up trains, publishing underground newspapers - but at the same time Milice collaborators and Wehrmacht soldiers patrol the area. Agents who can't make it back to the safe house at the end of the day are arrested, and never seen again.\nWith this new edition, we've added some new components to include some more difficult 3-star missions, some new spare rooms and resources, and made some tweaks to the rules & original components to improve clarity and gameplay.\nFor previous backers/customers who got the 1st edition, we have the option on this campaign to order the new components to add to your original game (Backer Level \"Maquis - New Content\").

This deck represents where the Milice patrols will occur during each day.\n\nThe player will choose a location to send their first worker and assign one of their pawns there. They then draw a patrol card, and place a Milice pawn if able. This continues until all of the available worker pawns and Milice pawns are placed. If the Milice find your worker during patrol, they will be arrested!\nYour diligent workers are then free to perform their duties, working toward your two goals.

We feel the second edition is the perfect opportunity to make these adjustments that we overlooked during the lead up to the first Kickstarter. After a lot of deliberation between Jake (the designer) and the rest of the SRG team, we've decided to adjust the day tracker on the main board. As the game morphed from Jake's original print & play (PnP) design to the first edition, the day tracker became a little confusing. In the PnP and first editions, the day track marks \"completed days\". This wasn't an issue for any of the original PnP missions, but some of the newer ones require you to complete objectives on or before certain days.

These three words best describe SK\u00dcLLBOX. Take on the role of sentient, punk skulls who need to use psychotic traps and weird contraband to keep wanna-be heroes from taking their stuff.\nSK\u00dcLLBOX is a punk rock-inspired 62-page zine that contains an entire rules-lite game designed to bring fun and absurd stories to your table. It has a unique engine at its core that can be learned in just a couple of minutes, requires only six-sided dice, and is designed to be played as a fun one-shot or a short yet absurd campaign.\nFor those afraid of a Kickstarter who\u2019ll never deliver, fear no more! SK\u00dcLLBOX is already written, all the art is done, and the layout is well underway. Once this campaign ends, it\u2019ll only be a matter of ironing out some bugs, getting the zines printed, and shipping them out!\nSK\u00dcLLBOX uses a custom-made system with only three abilities: COOL, MOSH, and WEIRD. A skull rolls a number of d6 equal to their ability, succeeding if at least one die is a 5 or higher. Each skull also has its own BOX \u2014 a unique, strange apparatus that gives the skull weird powers to use to bash or ensorcell raiders. There are six total, from the fire-starting Tinderbox to the rockstar Bonebox Musician!\nA session of SK\u00dcLLBOX includes three or more raids. These are organized by the legendary musician-turned-tyrant, Saint-Queen Sophronia. Under her employ are screamo berserkers, warlocks who sold their soul to the ESTABLISHMENT, cubed slimes who don\u2019t know any better, and things so terrifyingly powerful that the skulls will need more than just magyk boxes to bring them down.\nThat\u2019s where the traps come in. SK\u00dcLLBOX features 8 psychotic and weird traps that skulls can build to keep raiders out. Each trap comes with its own story prompt \u2014 a short explanation of a scene that has to be roleplayed out in order for the trap to be used. In SK\u00dcLLBOX you\u2019ll be figuring out the recipe needed to summon C\u2019thulu\u2019s own knife-wielding tentacles while persuading starved cannibals to take their revenge on the heroes that exiled them. And if you roll bonus successes when setting a trap up, you can spend them on bizarre modifications for your delectable torture devices.\nNo skull should go into battle with only a couple of advantages. Here are some more chaotic toys that you\u2019ll be deploying in the fight against good:\nFields of magyk coffee-shrooms; a perfect boost for when things get dangerous!\n  Weaponized contraband that can be found only on the black market.\n  The legendary GOLDEN APPLE OF DISCORD, which doubles as a lifeline and your secret weapon!\n This 40-page zine has the following specifications, for your viewing pleasure:\n45+ unique pieces of art, all by the visionary Gospo\n  Perfect binding to lay flat our gorgeous spread pages\n  6 unique boxes for skulls to play as\n  8 psychotic traps for skulls to build\n  11 unique raiders, from the shroom-awakened psionic Lurk to the majestic and regal Irish Elk\n  4 pieces of magical contraband for the skulls to use\n  Lore fit for insane cartoons\n Every single piece of art in SK\u00dcLLBOX is drawn by the same visionary: GOSPO. The whacky-yet-punk skulls were designed for his son, as were the raiders facing off against them. His black and white illustrations shaped not only the foundation of SK\u00dcLLBOX, but defined its flavor, atmosphere, and game mechanics too.\nWe also created a Spotify Playlist so that you can get the vibe of the SK\u00dcLLBOX world.\n  Either use the link above or open the app on your smartphone, click search and scan this:\nIf you want to learn more about what we\u2019ll be doing, make sure to follow our social media links below:\nDiscord\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYoutube\nReddit\nWebsite\nSHIPPING RATES\nApproximated estimates\nUnited States - $7\nEU (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden) - $19\nNorway/Switzerland - $34\nCanada - $12\nAUS - $13\nNew Zealand - $14\nChina/Macao/Hong Kong - $12\nRest of Asia (Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam) - $20\n\nDISTRIBUTION \nHere's the order of events after we fund.\n+ Send the files to the printer.\n+ Get back our proof.\n+ IF everything checks out, we begin the printing process!

Queercore gets a down-to-details firsthand account of the movement explored through the people that lived it\u2014from punk's early queer elements, to the moments Toronto kids decided they needed to create a scene that didn\u2019t exist, to the infiltration of the mainstream by Pansy Division, and the emergence of riot grrrl as a sister movement\u2014as well as the clothes, zines, art, film, and music that made this movement an exciting in-your-face middle finger to complacent gay and straight society.

The whole book works like a giant jigsaw puzzle that never offers a final or complete picture but at least scatters the  pieces around to allow the reader to assemble some truly exciting scenarios. This is very possibly the best and only way that subcultural histories should emerge\u2014namely as incomplete and incoherent, as a magnificent poly vocal roar, as sound, fury, rebel yells and screams. This does not just capture queer punk, it is queer punk.\u201d \u2014Jack Halberstam, author of The Queer Art of Failure and In A Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Lives\n\u201cQueercore: How To Punk a Revolution delivers a deeply invested history of the forgotten roots of queercore. While to some, punk was inherently gay as fuck\u2014the actual queer revolution came few and  far between bands, scenes, and eras whose intersections were small, yet wildly significant. With voices ranging from Penny Arcade to Brontez Purnell, we hear a vast history from around the globe; echoing everything queer, dirty, and true.\u201d \u2014Cristy C. Road, frontwoman of Choked Up and author of Spit and Passion and Next World Tarot\n\u201cQueercore is the unrelenting polyrhythm of a culture, chanted in varied waves of sensation, by some of its most essential voices. Zigzagging through generations of nostalgia and controversy faster than their own power chords, this is not just a record of queercore (the movement), but a theoretical discussion about the  intersectional ideology of \u2018Queer,\u2019 as well as \u2018Punk\u2019 itself. Reading\u2014not watching or listening to\u2014this book gave me the absolutely necessary opportunity to reinvigorate my own punk, both as performance art and radical protest. This unflinching oral history of how a subculture begins and survives, tenaciously layered in the present, is a bridge over the gap, that I for one, have been waiting for.\u201d \u2014JD Samson, musician, producer, songwriter and DJ (Le Tigre/MEN)\n\nSample writing from G.B. Jones\n\"We really started in the anarchist community. We didn\u2019t really start in the gay community. We were trading with anarchist zines, and meeting anarchists from the States, and that was really our milieu\u2014the punk scene, the post-punk scene, experimental filmmakers and artists. So we met all these people when we were touring and we\u2019d show our films, and that\u2019s how it started spreading. We\u2019d take the zines with us when we traveled; we were kind of like this traveling circus, y\u2019know\u2014here\u2019s the band!, and here\u2019s the zine!, and here\u2019s the movies! It was very much like the Exploding Plastic Inevitable. And I think that\u2019s how it spread so quickly, because people were encountering it so many different levels.\"\nJust a few images* from the book\n*Images will be black and white\nAbout the Contributors\nLiam Warfield is a writer, editor, and educator living in Chicago.\nWalter Crasshole is a journalist in Berlin and English-language editor for the city's 40-year running queer magazine Siegess\u00e4ule.

Your patrons are rowdy  and rude, but they are the only ones around. Your goal is to fill your inn with enough patrons to keep the debt collectors at bay, but to do so  you must manage some painfully particular, peculiar patrons.\nIn The Ugly Gryphon Inn, you\u2019ll be tasked with managing your patrons\u2019 various needs to ensure they all get a good night\u2019s rest. Each turn, you\u2019ll send one drowsy patron up to their room, then check to make sure all your patrons are sleeping soundly. If something\u2019s irking them, they might raise a fuss, so keep an eye on what they need as you go. Afterwards, you\u2019ll usher in more guests and keep an eye on the bar to make sure there\u2019s no trouble. There\u2019s never a moment to rest in The Ugly Gryphon Inn!\nA quick note on our Simply Solo line\nWe kicked off our Simply Solo line in May of 2020 with Food Chain Island. Ugly Gryphon Inn is the second in the series. Each game is designed by Scott Almes and focuses on games that are one player only, light on rules and big on replayability. \nAnd now, a look at Ugly Gryphon Inn\nThe Ugly Gryphon Inn offers the kinds of brain-stretching puzzle that Scott Almes brought to our first Simply Solo title, Food Chain Island. While they\u2019re both easy to dive into and endlessly replayable, here the focus is on managing each patron\u2019s needs while preparing for the next round of requests. \nCarefully booking your guests in the right order is key to success, as each patron\u2019s frustrations can have consequences for the sleepers below them. All the while, though, you\u2019ll have to expect the unexpected to make sure each new guest is comfortable. With a horde of disgruntled customers on their way, you\u2019ll have to be clever to run The Ugly Gryphon Inn.\n\nSimply shuffle the deck of patron cards and place them in a face-down stack in front of you. Draw 4 cards and arrange them in a face-up row in front of you. These patrons are considered to be at the bar.\nThe game takes place in a series of turns until you\u2019ve played all the cards from the deck and your hand. Each turn has the following flow:\nPhase I: Patron goes to sleep\nOne of the patrons at the bar are ready for bed. Select a card from the bar area and place it at the top of the inn. The inn is a single vertical line of cards, with each card being a floor.\nI choose to move the Sleepy Summoner into the Inn.\nCheck Rooms for Phase I irks. \nStarting with the Patron you just placed, you check each patron card from top to bottom. You check the statement on their card to see what will irk them and cause them to leave. If the conditions are met, then apply the effects on their card. \n\nPhase II: New Patron(s) Arrives\nAdds one more patron to the bar until you have 4. If there are no cards left in the draw deck, then this is the final round.\nI draw the Charitable Giant and add it to the Bar.\nCheck for Quirks\nEvaluate the quirk icons in the bar. If there are 3 or more of the same type of quirk, then you irk all the Inn patrons that are sensitive to that bad effect! \nIn the Bar there are 3 Fighting icons, which means anyone in the Inn that is irked by Fighting will trigger their effect.\nSince the Sleepy Summoner is not irked by fighting, her effect does not trigger. She'll stay in the Inn!\nGame End\nAfter you\u2019ve run out of cards in the deck, then count how many patrons you have in the inn. If you have 7 or more patrons in the inn - you\u2019ve won! If you have less than 7 or if at any point 8 patrons are in the discard pile, then you have lost the game.\n\nTry the game yourself! Download the preview PNP today at PNPArcade.com:\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/ugly-gryphon-inn-kickstarter-preview\n\nAnd Purple Moose Plays did a full playthrough video. Check it out below:\n\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Ugly Gryphon Inn: More Patrons.\n\nYou\u2019ve finally cleared out the bar and sent everyone off to bed...but what\u2019s that sound? A knock at the door, at this hour? Why, it\u2019s just what you need: MORE patrons jostling for a spot at your inn! It\u2019s gonna be a long night...\nThese expansion cards are shuffled into the starting deck, adding to the available Patrons found in the base game. You\u2019ll need to manage these new needy customers more carefully, as your inn will require one more contented patron to be considered successful.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign. \n\n\nAs you may have noticed, we have a second expansion available! Here's a little more info on Ugly Gryphon Inn: Local Dragons:\n\nYou\u2019ve handled plenty of rowdy customers in your time, from monks and mages to giants and goblins, but there\u2019s one thing you\u2019ve never faced: the mighty Dragon. Now your humble inn has drawn the attention of an ancient wyrm. Pay close attention to who leaves and who stays: if your departing Patrons irritate the lurking Dragon, all your hard work is sure to go up in flames!\n\n\nEach game using the Local Dragons expansion adds 1 of 3 possible Dragons to your Inn. As Patrons leave, check their symbols to see whether they provoke the Dragon. If the Dragon is sufficiently provoked -- two matching symbols accumulated -- you\u2019ll lose the game.\nYou may have also noticed a new Food Chain Island expansion, Lost Beasts. This is the next in our line of expansions and is due to release in the next month or so here. It'll be initially available on our site for sale in small numbers, but if you are a Food Chain Island fan and want to combine it with your Kickstarter rewards to save a few dollars, we made a reward level here.  \nWe are waiting to see if Kickstarter approves any on-site add-ons for this campaign (it's still in a beta / invite only process), for the time being if you want to add more wallet games from our library (and we have a whole bunch!), we will do that in a different way.\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"1220impatient\" to get 15% off of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"1220international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier, which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nScott Almes is best known for the Tiny Epic series by Gamelyn Games. He's gone even bigger with Heroes of Land, Air and Sea and with our Simply Solo line he's going even smaller. We first met in 2012 when Scott designed a game for our Storyteller Cards, and in 2020 we released Food Chain Island. Looking forward to more games in the Simply Solo line (and we might even tease the next one here in the updates).\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,  promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every  month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level  above.)\n\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations  of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge until Feb 2021.\n\nThen, we are starting up a new year long game in March. It's called Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection, you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your adventures.\n\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\n\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).  The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Dragons expansion here).\n\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Ugly Gryphon Inn!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Your objective as a deep-sea researcher is to guide your sub through fathoms of water, descending to the Trench floor, to find mysterious and amazing sea creatures.\nWill you become a renowned research scientist, or will you fall victim to the creatures that lurk beneath the surface?\nINTRODUCTION\nThe goal of The Mariana Trench is to score the most research points by researching deep-sea creatures and the floor of the trench. The game is played in alternating turns until your submarines run out of oxygen. \nMOVEMENT\nMovement from one card to the next represents a distance of 1000 Fathoms. At launch your sub can move up to 2000 fathoms (2 cards) on your turn. \nCOLLECTING RESEARCH AND UPGRADES\nWhen researching the water column, reveal the (research) card next to your sub. Each card displays a deep-sea creature and a submarine upgrade. \nYou may:\n\u2022 Collect the deep-sea creature, or\n\u2022 Upgrade your Submarine\nIf you do not collect the creature or upgrade your sub then leave the card face-up, where either player may collect it on a future turn.\nIf you have hold capacity you may tuck the research card under your sub (to the right), so that the class and size of the creature shows.\nIf you do not collect the sea creature then you can upgrade your sub. Tuck the card under your sub (to the left) so that the upgrade is showing. You cannot take the same upgrade twice.\nYour sub starts with a small hold, which can carry one small creature. To collect large creatures you must upgrade your hold first.  \n\nTHE TRENCH FLOOR\nEach time your sub reaches the trench floor you can conduct valuable scientific research. Take 1 research token from the supply and place it on your submarine. Your sub can only carry one research token at a time. The token is offloaded as soon as you surface beside the research vessel.  Research tokens are worth 2RP at the end of the game.\nRETURNING TO THE RESEARCH SHIP\nWhen your sub surfaces, all the creatures and tokens are offloaded to the research vessel. At the end of the game points are scored for different sets of creatures\nAnd there is more\u2026.\nOK, so we have the game, the expansion, and the play mat, we have a few awesome stretch goals to come too\u2026. But what else?\nOver the past three years I have been hugely fortunate to work in the board game industry, I\u2019ve had games published, I\u2019ve worked as an illustrator and designer on many fantastic and exciting games. \nBut now is the time, the time for me to develop the games I\u2019d like to play, the games I think you would like, games I'm passionate about which I'm itching to throw my creativity and time into. By backing this project, you are giving me the opportunity to exclusively make the absolute best games I can for you.\nWith two more amazing games in the pipeline for next year, I am massively excited for the future, I've got some amazing stuff to share. So, it\u2019s not all about buying this game, it\u2019s about investing in creative freedom and being part of an exciting journey and some amazing new games.\nTris Rossin.\nOwner of Bright Light Games.\n The cost of shipping will be charged after the campaign has ended in the pledge manager.

Each of you has chosen a unique method of dealing with a particularly nasty bit of chaos that has been summoned, and the friendly wager at hand will be won by the player whose approach proves most effective.  \nThe Science and S\u00e9ance Society offers totally asymmetric gameplay in a tight, two player game.

We are only printing copies for the campaign and do not intend to sell it widely afterwards.\n\u00b7 The Science and S\u00e9ance Society is thoroughly developed. It has been rules tested and played at events like Unpub and regular NYC playtest events.\n\u00b7 The Science and S\u00e9ance Society is fun! If you like two player games, or asymmetric games, or just love clever card and dice games, The Science and S\u00e9ance Society belongs on your shelf.\n\u00b7 The Science and S\u00e9ance Society will not exist without this campaign. Your support means it, and future games from us, actually exist.\n\u00b7 The money earned is being spent responsibly to pay for manufacturing and Kickstarter fees. Any profit beyond that goes toward covering the cost of our labor as all other parties involved in the creation of this project have already been paid.\n\u00b7 Note: The number of pledges for this campaign are unlimited. However, since we are a small two-person studio doing fulfillment ourselves, we are capping each pledge level so that we can provide accurate and conservative delivery times. As one pledge level fills up, we will open a new one. These pledge levels are IDENTICAL other than which batch they will be shipped in. \nWe at New Mill Industries will not be using Stretch Goals and our reasoning is simple.\nWe design each game holistically. Every game we offer you is feature complete and needs no additional content to feel that way. Our goal is to provide a product with great components, clean design, thoroughly tested mechanisms, and the best possible price. Stretch Goals are often antithetical to this goal. They can indicate a game that purposefully had content removed just to create Stretch Goals or it creates additional design and testing overhead that delays the final product from getting to you, the backer.While we would love to offer stretch goals that upgrade component quality for everyone, the scale at which we intend to print and the print-on-demand model makes these types of goals not feasible. \nNew Mill Industries is a passion project for us, not our career. We are a two-person design studio and independent publisher who makes games because we love making games.\n\n In the United States, we will be sending the games in USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Small Boxes. They fit like a glove. We're charging $8 for shipping up-front and hoping that USPS doesn't change its rates over the next month.  We're estimating shipping to be $20 for the 5-pack level. \nFor Canadian and other international backers, we're setting the shipping cost to $20 and $25 respectively. We'll be using First Class mail rather than Priority Mail, so they may take a bit longer to get to you, but Priority gets extremely expensive for international shipments. We're planning on sending them as \"gift\" to avoid extra duties and import fees. As the rewards are technically not purchases from a store, we feel pretty good that we'd be in the clear here. We'll even gift-wrap them. The 5-pack level will also be available for all non-US countries at $30.\n\n We plan on printing only a few hundred games, which means we do not benefit from economies of scale, cannot partner with international distributors, and cannot assume the costs if things go wrong for international backers. We will also be hand-assembling your games so they will not be shrink-wrapped. While we would love to say that this is exclusively because it is more environmentally friendly, it also just isn't feasible for a company of our size.\nNew Mill Industries will be producing small print runs of games that feature clean design and quirky themes without all of the excesses of the modern board game publishing industry.\nDaniel Newman is the designer of Dead Man's Cabal, Ahead in the Clouds, Feat On The Ground, and Rolled West. Daniel worked as an architectural model maker for a while but has been doing the stay-at-home dad thing for the last couple of years, as well as helping out with the NYC Playtest group. Daniel does the graphic design and pre-production work for New Mill Industries.\nThe self-proclaimed Purple People Meeter of the Warm Fuzzies Tribe, Tony Miller is the designer of Kabuto Sumo and one half of the design team of Fire in the Library.

It has been nominated for the Golden Geek Awards for Best Card Game and Best Solo Game, was voted #31 in the 1-Player Guild's People Choice Top 200 Solo Games, and has received the Dice Tower's Seal of Excellence.\nIt's been a wild ride.\nIt's gone on to have multiple sold out printings, and is currently available in many languages from our publishing partners from all over the world. Once again, a very special game and we are really excited to expand on it. \nAnd now, a look at Agropolis\nIn Agropolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new farm from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. \nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.\n\nIn this game, you will try to keep Pig Pens adjacent to your longest road, align your Orchards into specific polyomino shapes, and keep your Cornfields on the corners of the map.\nBut  not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they  also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\n\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be  exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique  combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.\n\nA look at half of the scoring conditions in Agropolis\nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing countryside, trying to score as many points as possible.\nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.\nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap and each road will cost you points in the end.\nNew to Agropolis are the three types of livestock pens, each in two different configurations.\nAnd finally there's the Feed Fee: a fun (and optional) new way to raise the goal just a little bit, making for a tougher game.\nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.\nCan you meet the demands of the farmers, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate agricultural wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\n\nDownload the preview PNP today at PNPArcade.com!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/agropolis\nWe'll start with a little coverage of the original game, Sprawlopolis. It's been out for 2 years now and has slowly built up a stable of great reviews and video content. Here are a few of note:\nAnd now for Agropolis. \nhttps://whatsericplaying.com/2020/09/28/agropolis/\nhttps://www.dastardlydesignco.com/post/agropolis-dastardly-review-135\nhttp://www.purplephoenixgames.com/agropolis-preview/\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Combopolis. \n\nUse this expansion to create the perfect mix of city and farm zones in a single game. It adds 6 cards with scoring conditions relying on both Sprawlopolis and Agropolis, along with a few really interesting new rules (you'll draw one card from each game, choose one to play, and then discard the other). It unlocks an exciting world of new combinations!\nFor a look at the Combo game in action, here's How Lou Sees It, starting at 13:44. Feel free to watch the whole video as well. :)\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\nWe usually handle add-ons exclusively through our website, buttonshygames.com, but since Kickstarter has implemented a new add-on system, we are trying it out. \nIf you want to add any of the following to your rewards here, you can do it right in your Kickstarter pledge. It will ask you when checking out if you would like to add any items. Note: This is all new, so we're really just trying it for the first time. \nAgropolis Button (Pinback)\nAgropolis Button (Snapback)\nAn additional copy of Agropolis\nThe Button Shy Game Haul Bag\nA quick description of each is below.\nIf you want to add more wallet games from our library (and we have a whole bunch!), we will do that in a different way. \nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\n US Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0920impatient\" to get 15% off   of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as soon  as  everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will also  receive free shipping.\n US Backers only - to order games that ship along with your rewards - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0920us\" to get free shipping   on your extra games. These games will all ship together with your  Kickstarter rewards.\n International Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0920international\" to get free  shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this offer is 3  wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including anything that you  order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games (and 3 expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier, which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will all ship together with  your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME that we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level above.)\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the combo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Agropolis!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to our updated schedule.

It is a card game for 2-5 players and takes around 20 minutes to play (30 minutes if you're new!). You can find more information on our BGG site.\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the cuteness of the plants - get ready for the countless strategies that await you on Plantopia. The game is designed by internationally acclaimed board game designer Daryl Chow (Overbooked, The Artemis Project, Remember Our Trip, Ramen Ink etc), whose designs revolve around a framework of simple rules to bring you a wealth of interesting choices.   \nThe Garden City Seed Pack is only in bloom for these 25 days, and will never be in season again! Not even in your Flower Leaf Garden Stores! \nPlantopia is designed with both the casual gamer and hardcore strategist in mind. The simple and intuitive rules make it accessible for all, and friends and families will have a fun and fruitful time in Plantopia. Its fast playing time and high gardener count also makes it a great game to bring to your friends' greenhouses.\nBut at its core, it is a tableau-building and hand-management game where you will have to synergize the abilities of all your plants to do well. Kind of like a much cuter Race for the Galaxy with lots more plants!\nThe game is designed to have little to no downtime, yet the unique Weather mechanic brings players together - ignore rival gardens at your folly! You'll need to keep an eye on your fellow gardeners to claim the title of Champion Gardener for yourself.\nCapitalize upon the immediate powers of the Baby Plants while harnessing the scoring combos of the Treevolved Plants. Will you go for the fast-growing Flowers, the card-drawing Cacti, or the weather-controlling Trees? Or a combination of all of the above?

Your goal is to influence the wildlife - and arrange their meals - so there is only one animal left!\nFood Chain Island is the next Button Shy Wallet Game, and the first in what we are calling our simply solo series. These are games that are one player only, light on rules, and big on replayability.  \nLet's get into what makes Food Chain Island so awesome!\nStart by shuffling the cards and making a 4X4 grid island of animals with the sea animals off to the side.  \nOn a turn, you must move one land animal one space in one of the four cardinal directions so it\u2019s placed over another animal that is 1-3 numbers lower in value. In this way, you can move the \u20188\u2019 animal over a 7, 6 or 5. \nWhen you do this, place the card on top of the lower card. This how an animal eats another animal.\nWhen cards are stacked on one another, they are considered to be the number on the top. The stack of cards now moves as one.\nWhen you move a card to eat another, you activate the ability on the card that just ate another. This special effect is mandatory and must be applied. In some cases, the ability will benefit you, and in others it will make the game harder.\nThe sea animals are there to help you out. At any time you may discard a sea animal and perform its special ability. Once a sea animal is used, it is discarded. \nThe game ends when only one animal remains or if you are unable to eat an adjacent animal. \nIf you only have one animal left, congratulations! You are an Ecological Expert.\nIf you have two animals left, nice job! You are an Accidental Matchmaker.\nIf you have three animals left, you just made it through! You are still an Island Intern. \nOtherwise, if you have 4+ animals, you have lost the game and need to keep trying.\nFurther Challenges\nTo make the game more difficult, randomly remove one or both of the sea animals. In addition, you can explore these alternate card layouts.\nYou can print and play the game today! The black and white version, along with unedited prototype rules is available at PNP Arcade.\nLINK: https://www.pnparcade.com/products/food-chain-island-kickstarter-preview\nFor a complete playthrough, check out Matt Upton's video below: \nMore to come as we update this image. :)\nAlso available here is Food Chain Island: Tough Skies, a three card expansion that will make your games just a little more challenging. At the beginning of the game, shuffle and place one card face-up into the play area. Do not use the others. During the game, you must activate, resolve and discard the air animal. The air animal must be resolved before the end of the game. For an additional challenge, use 2 or all 3 air animals.\n\n...\n-What's Eric Playing\nFULL REVIEW: https://whatsericplaying.com/2020/05/25/food-chain-island/\n-Hey Meepling\nFULL REVIEW: http://meepling.com/2020/05/22/food-chain-island-review-eat-your-way-to-the-top/\n-The Cardboard Hoard\nFULL REVIEW: https://www.punchboardmedia.com/home/2020/5/25/the-cardboard-hoard-initial-thoughts-on-food-chain-island\n-Boards and Bees\nFULL REVIEW: https://boardsandbees.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/0961/\n\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Friendly Waters, a 3 card expansion of additional sea animals to help you along the way. You can shuffle these in with the sea animals in the base game, then draw 2 for a normal difficulty, and draw less for an additional challenge.\nWe have a whole bunch of games in our library.\nIf you want to add more games to your order, you can do one of two things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0520impatient\" to get 15% off of your order.

These games will all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nA few notable games available in our library are Tussie Mussie, Sprawlopolis and Circle The Wagons.\nScott Almes is best known for the Tiny Epic series by Gamelyn Games. He's gone even bigger with Heroes of Land, Air and Sea and this time he's going even smaller. We first met in 2012 when Scott designed a game for our Storyteller Cards, and we've been looking for a chance to work together since.\nAnnie Wilkinson was born in Saskatchewan, Canada in 1966 to a family that encouraged artistic pursuits of all kinds -  including writing, drawing, photography and  music. This is our first time working together and it was a wonderful experience. I couldn't imagine a more perfect style for the game. More of Annie's work can be seen at http://www.advocate-art.com/annie-wilkinson\nGraphic Design by Jason Greeno\nRules Editing by Michael Lee\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,  promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level, that's where the members back the projects).\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's launching very soon, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. We have a Sprawlopolis expansion coming in the next few months, and we're working on many more.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the solo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Food Chain Island!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

We've also upped our staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our staff is also minimized at this time, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to our updated schedule.

These mercenaries and peddlers of rodent disposal now stand on the precipice of fame and glory, all they have to do is their job, right?\nOBJECTIVE\nThe Ratcatchers objective: To rid the city of as many rats as possible on their way to gathering as much Magical Cheese as possible.\nWIN - The RATCATCHER is victorious if you achieve any one of the following criteria;\n\u2022 The Ratcatcher collects 10 Magic Cheese or The Ratcatcher slays the Nemesis Rat\nLOSE - The Ratcatcher is defeated if the Rats achieve one of the following criteria;\n\u2022 The Rats consume 10 Magic Cheese or The Ratcatcher is reduced to 0 wounds\n\nThe Ratcatcher (Player) Turn: \nDuring your Ratcatchers turn, they\u2019re seeking to vanquish rats & gather Magical Cheese. This can be done using the various skills and actions listed on the Character Board.   \nMagic Cheese Tokens\nUnlock/Upgrade:\nOnce the Ratcatcher can successfully gather some Magical Cheese then the fun of upgrading and customising your Ratcatcher can begin.  \nBy assigning a Magic Cheese you may unlock a chosen ability. Once active place the maximum number of the relevant tokens on the Character Board.\n The Rats (AI) Turn: \nDependent on the type of Rat, the rats will either seek out the Magical Cheese or attack the Ratcatcher. White rats as the most numerous, and though simple in appearance their strength becomes apparent when they swarm towards pieces of cheese. Brown rats are vicious and ill tempered, set on attacking any who come close these rodents must be disposed of carefully. Black rats, are the breeders and with them comes even more rats. Each time a black rat is placed, additional rats are immediately placed. In addition to that each spawn phase Black rats count as a Spawn Point for even more rats! \nPeculiar Rats: \nThe Magic Cheese can have wonderful and miraculous effects, this effect is not limited to humanity only. The rats are eating the cheese and it has had some peculiar effects on them.\nThe Peculiar rats imbue the power of the magic cheese forming a nasty mini boss style adversary that will complicate the Ratcatcher's quest but also offers a variety of tempting rewards should the Ratcatcher be bold enough to catch one. \nNemesis Rats:\nNemesis Rats are true horrors of their species. The Magical Cheese has twisted their mind and body, into something spawned from the most terrible of nightmares. As catalysts of the Rat infection, destroying them is the of the utmost importance and seems the only logical path to freeing the kingdom.\nEach Nemesis on top of having their own unique abilities, also has a varied Rat tracker. As the Rats collect Magic Cheese, this tracker will gain momentum, modifying the common rats, spawning Peculair rats and triggering the spawning of the Nemesis Rat. This makes each variant Nemesis a unique challenge.  \nExpanding the Township:  \nTownship Cards - Tarot Sized Cards\nThe sprawling streets of Brie are the battle zone of The Ratcatcher. Filled with twists and turns it will require a keen eye to find the cheese & tactical choices to stay a head of the rat horde.  \nIf there are fewer than two Magic Cheese tokens in the city, then a mandatory Explore Action is undertaken. This will expand the city using additional township cards. Each new Township card will also add more cheese, opportunities to refill/recuperate & of course, more rats. \n\n WHY PLEDGE NOW:\nAs with most projects using crowdfunding, The Ratcatcher solo adventure board game will not possible to publish without the financial commitment of backers. There are not only many costs to cover, but also the unpredictability of the market as well as gauging demand are all reasons Platypus Industries has come seeking funding via Kickstarter.\nSubsidised shipping\nContribute the games content \nUnlock amazing via stretch goals such as extra content and quality upgrades for everyone!\nAllow the Ratcatcher product line to get a strong start. There are plenty of plans for continued support & expansions, but only if the core set is funded.\nRetailer Only\n\nKeep track of the Ratcatcher's progress using Kicktraq\nAussie games design company set on creating top quality products that are unique, interesting & challenging.  \nThis is the first project to be launched by the company, but not our first game & definitely not our last. \nMatthew Aslin is the one-man show behind The Ratcatcher, Solo Adventure. He dwells in Melbourne, this is the first solo project but as with Platypus Industries it's unlikely to be his last.\n\nBusiness Partners.\nWe are very lucky to be pairing with some amazing and very experienced companies to help us deliver our product in a way that is both high quality, swift & professional. \nFulfilment: QML, Aetherworks, Logistico & VFI \nManufacturing: HJM (China)\nPledge Manager:  \nFAQ - Gameplay: \n Solo mode only: Yes, that's right. This game is for one player only. During this Kickstarter campaign there are no plans for any changes regarding this matter. Although that is not to say future expansions will adhere to this ethos.\n Alternative Languages Rules:  Currently we have a Spanish fan made rulebook. At his time I am open to establishing French & German fan based rulebooks at this stage. These will be community based rulebooks. Dependent on demand we may seek professional translation to be available with the games commercial release. \nCOMMUNITY TRANSLATIONS\n ITALIAN: A small group of Italian backers have started working on translation of the rulebook. If you're keen on helping out, head over to the BGG forum: ITALIAN TRANSLATION\n   FRENCH: It looks like there may be a solution for a French translation in the near future but in the mean time, French fans, can we get a forum going for this?  FRENCH TRANSLATION\n   GERMAN: A small group of German backers have started working on translation of the rulebook. If you're keen on helping out, head over to the BGG forum: GERMAN TRANSLATION\n  FAQ - Pledging:\n Late Pledges: We will be partnering with Gamefound to assist with late Pledges, note that Late/Pledges & pre-orders will NOT have subsided shipping included. By backing at any level you will qualify for Free/subsided shipping should you choose to upgrade your pledge during the pledge manager.\n Stretch Goals: All Stretch goals unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign will be included FREE of charge in every copy of The Ratcatcher. Also where applicable, stretch goals will also be added to the Print and Play pledge level.  \n Multiple copies of the game: There are two options for the purchase of multiple copies, either by pledging at any level a backer will have access to the post campaign Pledge Manager (Gamefound.com), this will allow the backer to add additional copies of the game, shipping will be calculated & charged as a bundle (so you should save a bit of money). Alternatively if you have a few fellow gamers there is the Horde pledge, which will give you a discount as well as discount shipping. Just because it's a solo game dosen't mean we can be social ;) \nFAQ - Shipping:\n What is Subsidised shipping?: This is me covering a portion of the total shipping costs. Platypus Industries will pay $10 AUD of the total shipping cost. This is a little thank you for supporting us during the Kickstarter campaign. \n Shipping black zones: Sadly as much as it pains us to to say. There are certain locations around the world that we will NOT be able to deliver our product. We are sorry if this causes any inconvenience, but we encourage all affected to contact their local FLGS as they may find Distribution/alternative routes to obtain copies.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorld economics: firstly, we are not economists. Global economics are alway fluctuating and global event particularly around the global pandemic are making it extremely difficult to predict the condition of the market short or long term. We are well aware of this and will endeavour to work through and communicate any events or situations that effect the delivery of this game. \n\nManufacturing: Communication and detailed specification have been provided to a handful of manufacturers as to get a comprehensive quote and product outline. Discussion regarding samples and proofing are already underway. We are confident moving forward into the manufacturing process for this product. \n\nShipping/fulfilment: One of the most unpredictable facets of Kickstarter delivery. We will endeavour to keep everything manageable but there are plenty of elements that will be out of our control.

On the third time, the game begins.\nPlayers shoot tokens from their camp into their opponent\u2019s camp. Tokens are shot by pulling them against the bungee cord and releasing. Only one token may be shot by each player at a time.\nThe round ends once one player clears all tokens from their side of the board. The gate must be entirely clear (no token may be halfway through the gate).\nRead The Rules\nClick here to view a PDF of the current draft of Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare rules!\nIn the times before The Divide, the inhabitants of The Veiled Forest existed harmoniously. The seasons came and went each year, and there was peace among all creatures that made these woodlands their home.\nOne morning, at the very edge of the winter solstice's arrival, all of this changed.\nAs the sun began to shed its light on the forest, the animals living within it stirred and noticed a peculiar change to their home.\nWhere there was once a small grove of trees in the middle of The Veiled Forest, there now was a massive clearing - a meadow that stretched a mile long, causing a dramatic break in the thick foliage that covered the ground just hours earlier. In the center of this meadow stood a sprawling structure: a mysterious wall separating what was now the two sides of The Veiled Forest. And in the middle of the wall stood a lone gate.\nUnable to resist exploring this strange new addition to the land, the creatures stepped through the gate and were immediately met with a blast of ice cold air all around - a much harsher environment from the gentle breeze that they'd just left on the other side.\nUpon closer inspection, the creatures came to realize that on one side of the wall, The Veiled Forest was still experiencing the season of autumn - while on the other side, winter had already permeated the landscape.\nBefore they could make sense of this jarring new reality, the creatures heard movement coming toward them, from each of the two sides of The Veiled Forest. The sounds of rustling trees and the ground being trampled beneath countless animals became louder and louder. Then, out of each side of the woods and into the meadow burst two armies - each army made up of the creatures that resided in that half of the forest when the wall arrived.\nThese two factions hurtled toward the center of the wall, seemingly being drawn to it by a force outside of themselves. It was clear that each faction had simply one goal: to pass through the gate.\nThe cause of this odd, overnight transformation - now called The Divide - is unknown. Perhaps some answers will be uncovered by the inhabitants of the woodland one day. Until then, each year marking the day of The Divide, the two factions of creatures assemble in the center of The Veiled Forest. They continue to do so to battle for the chance to pass through the gate and overtake the opposing faction, in the hopes that by doing so the seasons - and their home - will return to as they once were. \nThey may be adorable, but don't let their cuddly appearance fool you.\nWhile they don't fall under any particular class or hero designation, Rabbits make up the majority of creatures in most battles and, depending on your playing style, can pack a mighty punch.\nLarger than any other hero, the Brute class is determined to use its size to its advantage.\nEasily send opposing forces back through to their camp in any head on collision - but be warned, fitting through the gate doesn't come as easily to these heroes.\nSmaller than all other heroes, the Stealth class is capable of easily maneuvering past foes and traveling to the opponent's camp without getting caught up in the gate.\nBe careful not to underestimate the importance of agility in this battle.\nWith so much action taking place at the gate, the Aerial class has a different plan of attack...\nWhy go through the gate when you can soar over it?\nThe only class that takes the field is Rabbits. Classic Mode is a perfect introduction to Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare, and can be enjoyed by beginners, purists, and seasoned players alike.\nIn between rounds, Rabbit tokens are returned to their camps, and the next round begins. The game ends once a player wins 2 rounds.\nPlayers pledge their allegiance to either the Autumn or Winter faction.\nEach player selects one Hero class from their faction to use for the first round. Once both players have chosen their first Heroes, players reveal their selections and place the designated number of Rabbit tokens and Hero tokens in their camp.\nIn between rounds, all tokens are cleared from the board. Each player selects a new, previously unused Hero class from their faction to use before the round begins. Players reveal their new hero selections, and place the designated number of tokens in their camp before the next round begins.\nLaunching each class of Heroes and Rabbits is simple and can be picked up by anyone in seconds. All tokens may only be launched using the bungee in each camp. \nSettling into your preferred style and becoming familiar with the nuances of that method may take time, but the incremental improvements players will achieve with practice will result in a noticeable edge over less experienced opponents. \nThere's simply one edition of Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare. \nEach copy will include:\n1 x Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare Game Board\n16 x Rabbit tokens\n4 x Brute tokens\n16 x Stealth tokens\n8 x Aerial tokens\n6 x Hero Cards\n1 x Canvas Storage Bag (For Components)\nStretch Goals\nWe want to be clear that our highest priority is to make and ship the highest quality version of Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare within our estimated timeline. Therefore, we are focusing all of our efforts on achieving that goal and are limiting the stretch goals through the duration of this project.\nWe're happy to let you know that we're discussing the possibility of printing the game's logo along with Milo (our sugar glider hero from the Winter Faction) and Elyse (our bat hero from the Autumn Faction) on the canvas storage bag.\nOne of the most effective ways to get the word out is for as many backers as possible to reach out to your favorite writers, blogs, news sites, etc. that you go to for Kickstarter and/or gaming news.\nOnce you've reached out to your favorite site to let them know about Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare, just go here and click \"I got the word out!\"\nThe second way we're asking you to help out in growing our community is by heading over to our Facebook announcement post for the game and clicking \"share\" (in addition to liking the post).

Due to challenges we faced at the time with finding a longterm viable manufacturing solution for the game, Storm the Gate only saw one production run. We quickly sold out of stock on our site, and Storm the Gate was no longer available.\nSince then, we\u2019ve received more emails than we can recall that have asked when Storm the Gate would be made again. It's taken years for us to find a team that we trusted with making the game at a level of quality that meets our incredibly high standards, and in the meantime, we've had a blast modifying the design and building out the new world that Woodland Warfare exists in.\nWith the launch of Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare, we are beyond excited to finally be able to bring back a refined version, with more features and depth than the original.\nThe Antsy Army \ud83d\udc1c is a special group within the Antsy Labs community that has agreed to receive infrequent SMS messages and be the first in the world to find out when we launch a new product (including any further expansions to Fidget Factory). You'll also be included in special promotions and events that are exclusive to the Antsy Army.\nWhen the Antsy Army receives an SMS message, each \ud83d\udc1c will have the option to tap the included link and share the news on their social platforms.\nBy being a part of the Antsy Army, you're a part of a team that can make a huge impact in getting the word out and achieving something that can only be done by a larger community.\nEssentially:\n\ud83d\udc1c + \ud83c\udf43 = \ud83d\udeab\n\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c + \ud83c\udf43 = \ud83d\ude03\nWant to join the Antsy Army \ud83d\udc1c?\nJust text ANTSY to 900900\nTerms and Privacy Policy can be found here.\nYou may receive up to 4 msgs/mo.

When someone is about to go home, and I say \"How about a game of X before you leave?\" They smile and sit down. They can't resist because they know:\nThe game is fast (like 10 minutes to play)\nIt's quick to teach (like get started in 30 seconds)\nThere will be tension and exciting moments\nIt ends the night on a satisfying note of getting in one more quality game\nThis game series exists because I want there to be more games like that. We've focused on easy to teach before, but these are SUPER easy to teach.\nBut there is enough strategy that after the game your mind will wander back to a couple of key turns, and you'll wonder if you should have played just a little bit differently.\nAnd they have those turns...\nThat turn in GPS where the spinner lands on the spot that helps you but not your opponents. \nThat turn in Sequoia where you have to decide if it is worth fighting for the best spot or better to grab multiple spots where there is less competition. \nThat turn in Mountain Goats when you bump the leader off the mountain right before they win. \nAnd Holy Toledo, these games are just $15 each. \nThese games were designed for adult gamers, but they are playable with the whole family, including kids as young as 5 with some coaching.  They're also great options when your non-gamer friends ask to play a game, and you want something that you can teach and start playing quickly.\nIn Mountain Goats you work to move your goats to the top of 6 different mountains where they can score points as long as they stay there. You can share spaces with other goats on the way up, but there is only room for one goat at the top of each mountain. If someone else's goat moves to the mountain top, they will kick you off and you'll have to start your trek over.\nIt's a game about timing. You need to not just get to the top of the mountain, but get there when no one else is in position to knock you off.\nIt's a game about keeping your eye on your opponents. Maximizing your score, but also making sure you don't let anyone else score too much.\nThere is the fun chance to knock each other off the mountain. But it doesn't feel too mean because you can only knock back goats that are in a scoring position, and it isn't a huge setback. It is just a normal part of the cycle of the game.\nRead a draft version of the full rulebook for Mountain Goats. \n\n\nIn Sequoia you are trying to grow the tallest trees in 11 different forests. After your 10 turns, if you have the tallest tree, then you get the victory points from that forest. Second place gets a small consolation prize.\nEach turn, you get to grow two of your trees. Which trees you choose will determine if you win or lose. Do you keep fighting in a forest with competition, or start growing your tree somewhere else? You'll have to wrestle with the dice to grow the tree you want.\nSequoia is a game of choosing your battles.\nThe dice will always give you choices, but they will be hard choices.\nTies in each forest are decided by extra tie-breaker rounds that can lead to epic finishes.\nRead a draft version of the full rulebook for Sequoia.\n\nYou're launching GPS satellites into space. They need to orbit the earth in the correct order. But your launch windows are limited. You can only launch satellites where the spinner points each turn. It is your job to pick the best satellite for each launch to get your birds in order before your opponents.\nGPS is a game about how fun it is to spin that spinner. And it is a very satisfying spin.\nIt is a game about rooting for the rocket to land on your number.\nGPS is a game about putting yourself in a position where the spinner is most likely to help you.\n Read a draft version of the full rulebook for GPS.\nYou won't be paying for any extra air in your boxes. The games set up big, but they store small. There will always be room to shove one of these into your game bag.\nIt is a little bit shorter and a little bit wider than a box that holds two decks of cards side by side. It is also about twice as thick so the lid will stay in place much better.\n1. For the purpose of shipping, the 3 small games pack (GPS + Sequoia + Mountain Goats) will count as just one game.\n2. DO NOT manually increase your pledge amount to cover the shipping cost. It will make both our lives much more complicated when it is time to complete the pledge manager.\n3. If you want to pledge for additional games we publish, just manually increase the amount you are pledging. $15 for GPS, Mountain Goats, or Sequoia. $39 for the small games three pack. $34 for On Tour Europe and USA, QE, Bites, or Loot of Lima.\n4. Shipping prices will be the same during the pledge manager and you will be able to add more games then at the \"additional game\" shipping price.  \n5. The price of GPS, Mountain Goats, and Sequoia will probably be higher in the pledge manager. We want to offer Kickstarter backers the best possible price.\n6. Instead of offering a discount for buying a full case of games, we have steeply discounted the shipping rates for buying additional games. This way you can order the exact number of games your group needs.\n7. This campaign is Canadian, EU, UK, and USA, and Australian friendly.\n8. There are two main reasons the Canadian and European shipping costs more than US shipping. Since we ship fewer games to these fulfillment centers, it costs us more per game to get them there. And, we have to pay taxes when we bring the games into these regions so that you don't have to pay any taxes when they are delivered to you.\nEmail help@boardgametables.com if you want to carry one of these games in your Friendly Local Game Store, if you want to offer them through distribution, or if you would like to localize them for your country.\nChad is the owner of BoardGameTables.com and the designer of Sequoia.  Here are some games he loves that aren't getting talked about enough: Blockers, Capital Lux, Factory Funner, The King is Dead, Nations, Greed, Prospectus, Haggis, and Startups.\nKaty has to answer all your support emails and messages. So please be nice to her. With a wide range of gaming tastes she can be found playing Lisboa one night and a Harry Potter RPG the next. But it gets a little weird when she role-plays as a wizard during the game of Lisboa.\nAnca is the co-artist and graphic designer for On Tour, QE, Bites, and Loot of Lima. She has a poster featured in the Board Game Geek Artist series. Her husband and baby girl are always involved in the projects, from mandatory play testing and prototyping, to artistic suggestions. \nDaniel Profiri is the co-artist for this series. Whenever he's not illustrating board games, he's drawing photorealistic portraits and working on interior design projects. \nStefan Risthaus is the designer of Mountain Goats. He lives in Northern Germany and likes playing and developing games with history as a theme, but also quick fillers and family games. His wife also designs games and is the first and most important play testing person for his games.\nHartmut Kommerell is the designer of GPS. He has forgotten a lot of the math theory he once studied, but still uses the skills to design games and to puzzle around at work. With a 6-headed family, he can always test games with players of any age.\nEstimated delivery January 2021. Our normal math would project a November delivery. We added a couple of extra months because there is a lot of uncertainty right now, and shipping in November/December can add extra delays as everyone else is trying to get stuff in by Christmas.\nAs with all our Kickstarters, we will fully refund your pledge at any time before we ship the game to you. For any reason. No limits. No restrictions.\nRight now some people have some understandable concerns about the health of the economy and small businesses. It is our policy and will continue to be our policy to always keep enough cash on hand to fulfill (produce and ship) all outstanding Kickstarter commitments and preorders.\nThis is a short campaign, so don't delay.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEverything feels a little riskier than it did a month ago.

This offer is only for Kickstarter backers, so don't miss out! \nWatch the Runthrough in the How to Play Section\nEveryone knows Tumble Town deserves to be the best town in the West - so it needs a mayor to match! The Tumble Townspeople are hosting a competition to turn the town tootin\u2019 and boomin\u2019! It\u2019s up to you to impress them with your construction and planning skills!\nIn Tumble Town players are rolling dice, constructing buildings, and competing to make the best town in the West.\n Dice Manipulation & Engine Building: Each building you construct gives you more powers and options. Certain buildings can let you manipulate the dice, making it easier to continue constructing! Other buildings can generate dice or give extra scoring objectives. \n Spatial Puzzle: Place your constructed buildings along Main Street to create your town. The townspeople want a specific look for the town and if you meet their requirements, you'll gain even more votes from the townspeople!\n Added Scoring Conditions: Construct the right buildings and you can gain more scoring conditions as the game progresses! These can include the size of your constructed buildings, the animals and plants near your constructed buildings, or even the types  of buildings constructed by your neighbors. \nCan you build the best town in the West?\n            ULTRA EDITION TIER WOODEN BOX\nUltra Edition Wooden Box Design is Not Finished. Final Version May Look Different.\n Below is a How to Play video:\nRahdo does a Runthrough below: \nTumble Town Overview\nIn Tumble Town, you are a mayor trying to best meet the needs of the townspeople by constructing the buildings they desire. Your goal is to have satisfied the townspeople by the time the building materials run out. You make the townspeople happy by constructing buildings, placing the constructed buildings on Main Street in the best formation, and making the townspeople care about other aspects of their town, like the cacti and windmills. \nEach building plan requires certain building materials (die colors) and has restrictions on what die values are needed. \nEach turn goes through a series of four phases: \n1. Claim (take a card)\n2. Take Dice + Roll\n3. Construct + Use Powers\n4. Place + Discard Extra Dice\nClaim a Building Plan\nYou can choose any of the 12 available building plans. You might choose a building plan based on the materials you currently have to build, the benefit that the building gives you when you construct it, the point value, or for the icon it has. \nTake Dice and Roll\nYou may now take the dice shown on the stack of the cards in the row of the  building plan you choose. \nConstruct and Use Powers\nNow that you have dice and a building plan, you can construct a building! You may use any of the powers from either your constructed buildings or your horse to help you manipulate your dice into what the building plan requires. \nPlace and Discard Extra Dice\nOnce you construct your building, it's time to place the building on Main Street. You can gain points by matching the criteria on Main Street and you can also get points by making alleys between buildings. \nYou may only carry over dice that fit into your Storehouse to your next turn, so if you have more than six, you must choose some to discard back into the supply. \nGame End\nPlayers take turns until the Dice Supply runs out. Once two of the supplies get below two dice, the game end is triggered and all players take an equal amount of turns. \nScores are tallied and Horses revealed; the player with the most points wins! \nSolo Game\nIf playing the game solo, you simply choose an Outlaw to play against and start the game! The Outlaw has quick turns and makes the game a race to get the best building materials. There's three difficulties of Outlaw to try and outwit and only the best of the best can win against the Outlaw!\nThe Solo Missions will give you a point goal and an objective and if you meet it, you move on to the next one. The goals get progressively more difficult as the game goes on. \n Solo Playthrough:\n Rules and Print and Play\nThe rules are here (the rules are not complete nor do they have graphic design):  Rules Link \nThe rules are planned to be translated into French and Italian.

It will be hard to get after the KS ends, as we won't order many extra! \nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Tumble Town is that even if Tumble Town funds, we currently don't know if Tumble Town will go into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out, as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.\n Kickstarter Limited \u2013 Tumble Town might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions. This is especially true for the playmat! \n Help Us Improve Tumble Town \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the game for everyone!\n Discounted \u2013 After the campaign, we will sell the extra copies at a higher cost.\n EU Friendly \u2013 copies will be sent from inside the EU so backers won't have to pay VAT taxes. \nMost importantly, without you, Tumble Town would not get created.\nTumble Town is a game we truly love and want to share with the world. We've worked on this game for years to make it perfect for you. Tumble Town ties together engine building with spatial puzzles to create a truly unique gaming experience. We love playing and know you will, as well.\nWe really appreciate your support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Tumble Town to retailers during the campaign. Back the project at the retailer level for $50, and we'll contact you closer to when we ship out rewards to get a count of games that you wish to get! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nShipping is free for retailers in the US, $10 for the EU, $25 for retailers outside the US and EU. \nSocial Goals\nHelp us reach five out of the seven social goals, and we'll add a Best Mayor (name subject to change) card to the game! If we meet all seven goals, we'll include a special promo card in the game, as well!\n Here's the links: BGG Page (Sign in to your account, then click the heart button), Facebook, Facebook post, Twitter, Twitter tweet, Instagram, Subreddit, Youtube Channel, and Facebook Group.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends. This ensures you get charged the shipping you deserve. No more, no less.\nBy doing this, we are able to factor in your pledge tier, add-ons, and all fancy things that may occur during the campaign. However, we can offer estimated shipping costs. Below is estimated pricing for one copy of the game.\n100 dice actually weighs a lot! And shipping is based on weight, unfortunately, so shipping costs are a bit more than our usual for this reason.  \nPlease keep in mind these are estimates and there can be slight variations from country to country. Also, the more items you purchase, the more shipping will cost. If you have any questions, please email us at contact@weirdgiraffegames.com.\n*We are currently not planning to ship to the following areas: Mexico, Brazil, and Russia.\nWe are currently considering the UK to be within the EU at this time. We know that shipping will change for the UK in 2021, but the ways that that will change are not currently known. Also, we're hoping to ship in 2020 so that is hopefully not an issue! The estimates on the tier levels include buffer months in case several things go wrong, but that may not be the case. \nTo order a second copy of Tumble Town, add an additional $29 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost.\nWe are happy to discuss group orders, but these need to be handled on a country-by-country basis. Please send us a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nTumble Town is the sixth project by Weird Giraffe Games.\nWeird Giraffe Games was founded to create games that are easy to learn and play, but layered with strategy.\nThe Tumble Town team is made of the following people:\n We're looking forward to talking to you throughout this Kickstarter and after!

Help the Bone Collector, a half-blind monk, by exhuming graves and arranging the skulls inside the crypt.\nYou are novice monks, competing to create the best arrangement of skulls. Dig up graves from the graveyard to reveal cards, take cards into your hand to collect skulls, and arrange the cards from your hand into a stack. Whoever better honors the deceased\u2019s last wishes will score more points. The Bone Collector will then declare one player's stack as the most exceptional.\nSkulls of Sedlec is a 2-3 player game (with expansions supporting 1 and 4 players), designed by Dustin Dobson with art by Marty Cobb. It was a runner up in Button Shy's 18 Card Challenge to design a game based on a real-life location.\nFor a complete gameplay overview, check out Dustin's video below: \nTo try the game for yourself, the preview PNP (low color, unedited rules) is available now at PNPArcade.com. A small solo preview is there as well. Check it out here: https://www.pnparcade.com/products/skulls-of-sedlec-preview\nAnd if you haven't heard of us before, here are a few quick notes about Button Shy:\nWe're a small, family based company, with a few helping hands and a great group of designers and artists.\nWe release a new wallet game every month. This is game #61!\nOur wallet games are packaged in a small vinyl wallet for maximum portability.\nEach game is hand assembled and mailed from our little workspace in New Jersey.\nEnough of what we say about the game, how about some reviews? Here are some links to reviews of Skulls of Sedlec (with some solo reviews in there as well).\nhttps://geekdad.com/2020/03/kickstarter-tabletop-alert-skulls-of-sedlec/\nhttps://whatsericplaying.com/2020/03/09/skulls-of-sedlec/\nhttps://openseatgaming.com/2020/03/13/kickstarter-preview-skulls-of-sedlec/\nhttps://boardsandbees.wordpress.com/2020/03/11/0939/\nhttp://www.purplephoenixgames.com/skulls-of-sedlec-preview/\nhttps://www.dastardlydesignco.com/post/skulls-of-sedlec-dastardly-review-130\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2384509/solo-gaming-skulls-sedlec-meeple-myself-and-i-revi\n\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is the Monstrance expansion. This expansion adds solo play to the game and will retail for $4 after the campaign. \nThe Bone Monstrance is one of the ornate sculptures that decorate the inside of the Sedlec Ossuary. As a monk, you will toil away at exhuming graves and arranging skulls into stacks. As an artist though, you will need to be very creative to sculpt a truly original piece that will please the royal family!\n\nThis solo expansion celebrates these works of art by allowing you to create six unique features alongside a standard, pyramid-shaped stack of skulls. Each play session adds a condition that will make this undertaking a challenge for even the sharpest skull-stacker!  \nBefore we look at the rewards, here's a quick introduction to Skulls of Sedlec: Executioners. It's a 6-card expansion that shuffles into the game, adds the ability to play with a 4th player and is fully compatible with the the solo expansion, Skulls of Sedlec: Monstrance, as well.\nIn life, the Executioner's duty was to protect society by by delivering the death sentence of the condemned. In death, Executioners wish to be surrounded by their handiwork, the abundant skulls of Criminals that they undid. \nThis 6-card expansion to Skulls of Sedlec adds a new type of skull: The deadly Executioner. Punish your opponents and score big by attaching Executioners to groups of Criminals.  Adding in the expansion is easy, just shuffle in the expansion cards to the base game and play. \nAnd now onto the rewards!\n\nWe have a whole bunch of games in our library. \nIf you want to add more games to your order, you can do one of two things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0320impatient\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as soon as  everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will also receive free shipping.\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship along with your rewards - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0320us\" to get free shipping  on your extra games. These games will all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and  place an order using the coupon code \"0320international\" to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games (and 3 expansions) will end up bumping into the next shipping tier, which can be as much as $10 on international orders. These games will all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nA few notable games available in our library are Tussie Mussie, Sprawlopolis and Circle The Wagons.\nDustin Dobson has been fascinated with games for as long as he can remember. As a designer, he\u2019s passionate about crafting fun and memorable experiences that connect people, art, and interactive stories together. With a longtime career as a video game artist and producer, he\u2019s proud to have shipped over a dozen titles, including 2018\u2019s game of the year, God of War.\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every  month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level, that's where the members back the projects).\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's launching very soon, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. We have a Sprawlopolis expansion coming in the next few months, and we're working on many more.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the solo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\n\nThank you for checking out Skulls of Sedlec!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Four new mint making companies have noticed the profit potential of Mintopia City and have moved in, in an attempt to dominate the market and make all of the money. Players will take the role of one of four mint making companies and assert their influence over various locations in Mintopia City to secure their loyalties and earn the market share.\nMint Control is designed to provide a small footprint introduction experience to the Area Control and Action Selection genres of gaming that is fun and rewarding for new and seasoned gamers alike.\nSet Up\nShuffle the Location Cards, and randomly add Locations to the game area until there are at least 5 Influence Token spaces per player.\n                            (10 for 2 players, 15 for 3 players and 20 for 4 players.)\nPut the remaining Location cards to the side, they will not be used in this game. Place the 5 Action tiles near the Location cards, this is the Selection Pool.\nPlace the Mint Tokens near the Location Cards. This forms the Mint Supply, each player then takes 2 Mints from the Supply as their starting currency.\nEach player selects a color and takes the 5 Influence Tokens for that color.\nThe player with the freshest breath starts the game with the Starting Player Token.\nGameplay\nEach round, the starting player will select one of the available Action tiles and place it in front of them. They will then perform that Action, followed by the Perk in its entirety.\nThen in clockwise order around the table, each other player will perform that same Action (but not the perk) until each player has had the option to perform the Action if able.\nAfter every player has had the option to perform the action chosen by the starting player, the next player in clockwise order will choose one of the remaining available Action Tiles. This process continues until each player has selected one Action tile.\nAfter the final Action has been fully processed, if there are not enough remaining Action tiles for each player to choose from the remaining cards, return all of the chosen Action tiles to the selection pool, so that all Action tiles are available in the next round.\nFinally, the Starting Player token passes to the next player in clockwise order, and a new round begins.\nAction Tiles\nWhen an action is selected by a player, that player performs both the Action and Perk. Then clockwise around the table each other player performs only the Action.\nInfluence\nThe Influence Action allows players to pay Mints to add an Influence Token to an open Influence space. The Perk for selecting this Action reduces the cost to Influence a Location by 1, to a minimum of 0.\nEarn\nThe Earn Action gives players Mints to spend on future turns. The Perk for selecting this Action is to gain an additional Mint.\nPresence\nThe Presence Action grants each player the Presence bonus for each Location where they have Influence. The Perk for this Action is gain the eviction bonus from a Location that the player controls.\nOust\nThe Oust Action gains each player one Mint, similar to Earn. However, the perk for Oust is to spend 1 Mint to remove any 1 Influence Token from a Location. Then an additional 3 Mints can be spent to remove a second Influence token from a Location. The second token has no additional restrictions, it can be on the same or a different Location, and the same or a different player.\nScavenge\nThe Scavenge Action does not provide an Action for all players, only the player that selected it. That player can choose to gain 1 Mint from the Supply, or steal 1 Mint from another player.\nWin/Lose Conditions \nThe game ends at the end of the Action in which at least one player has all 5 of their influence tokens on Locations.\nPlayers gain points for each Location they control. The player with the most points, wins!\nIn the event of a tie, the player with the most Mints left over wins.\nThen, the tied player that has the most Influence placed on locations wins.\nThen, the tied player whose age is closest to 42 wins.\nPLAYTHROUGH\nYou are my biggest advocates and I need you to shout from the rooftops so this project can succeed the best it can.

If you're a retailer, please email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nThe Mint Series was born of the 2017 BoardGameGeek Mint Tin Challenge where designer Justin Blaske submitted Mint Works, the Minty Fresh Worker Placement Game. Following the contest, he brought Mint Works to Kickstarter where it funded on Day 1 and went on to become an evergreen product, selling over 30,000 copies -- and it's still reprinting! His second design, Mint Delivery, the Minty Fresh Pick Up and Deliver Game, was a huge Kickstarter success, funding in the first hour, raising almost $200,000, and expanding into the French market. Most recently, Mint Cooperative funded over $100,000 and gained partners around the world: the Mint Series has fresh new versions in French, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese.\nThe Mint Universe has become its own licensed IP and we are having more and more industry designers submit designs to join our series. Our vision is to make singular modern board game mechanisms approachable by designing games that are simple to play, easy to teach, and a quick play time.\nThe Mint Series follows the narrative of Mort, introduced in the first game. After much success launching his mint-making company, Mort branched out and provided mints to surrounding towns and regions. Unfortunately, villains from the Dominion of Halitosis  grew jealous of his success, and the Mint Cooperative was launched to protect the citizens of Mintopia from the threat of periodontal peril. With peace restored and the villains defeated, Mort now finds himself threatened by other mint magnates trying to steal his success!  It has been exciting to see characters and locations evolve to have more personality through the games' progression, and it is thrilling to continue the saga in this exciting title.\nQuackalope's storytelling expertly explains how the world of Mintopia unfolded and dive into the characters we are falling in love with.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith an established Mint Series, we've learned a lot about the game making process, from start to finish.

We've also built relationships that help us choose reliable partners for each stage of our process.\n\nThat said, this is still a production and things can fall behind or get off track, which could lead to delivery delays. While we don't anticipate any problems that would through us off track, it's always possible.

If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store's email address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 6 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nGreat news: shipping costs are FLAT, regardless of which tier you pick!\nShipping costs are not included in the Kickstarter pledge, but we have put together this handy guide for shipping estimates. We charge these costs in the Pledge Manager in addition to the Kickstarter pledge. These estimates are the maximum we will charge you for shipping.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, China, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia) \n A prediction of the timeline:\n During the campaign: Submit final files necessary to create pre-production copies.\n 27 Feb: Kickstarter campaign completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development.\n Early March: Kickstarter Survey sent 1-3 days after the Kickstarter Campaign ends\n Early March: Submit (final) files to the manufacturer\n Mid-March: Pledge Manager opens \n Early April: Pledge manager closes\n Late March: Final Manufacturing begins\n Late May: Manufacturing ends\n Early June: Shipping from China begins\n Mid-July: Arrives in ports\n August: Fulfilment commences\n September: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nThe reason we are sending out KS surveys BEFORE the pledge manager is that it will allow us to gather all the requested number of games to calculate how many we need for the final print run.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in August-September - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nCONVENTION SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at conventions. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games.

Use BOLD MANEUVERS to reach your opponent\u2019s side of the table! Deploy literal CUTTING EDGE WEAPONRY to CRUSH THEIR TANKS and STEAMROLL THEIR DREAMS of victory! BLOW AWAY the competition with SPECIAL CARDS; no two games will be the same!\nIT\u2019S ALL IN THE CARDS: everything you need to CUT DOWN THE COMPETITION is right here in the KnifeTank deck! Play 1-on-1, or team up with a friend for FOUR PLAYER ACTION! Select your tank, choose your strategy, slice your way to victory!\nHow it's played!\n(the full rules are available for download here)\nPlayers start each game by picking their favorite KnifeTank cards and placing them on opposing sides of a table. Some tanks, like the Chaos and Classic tank, are more balanced, while others may have faster treads, but shorter reach. Pick the style that's fun for you. \nEach player has a hand of five action cards, which consist of 3 different types of actions: Move, Stab, or Special. There are no turns in KnifeTank, players choose an action card from their hand and simultaneously reveal it. All actions are then resolved.   \nMovement\nPlayers move their tanks by placing Movement cards on top of their KnifeTank card. These cards have symbols that indicate the direction and length your KnifeTank card will move. Players aren't allowed to measure Movement cards in advance.  \nHow to use a Movement Card\nStabbing\nOn their turn a player may choose to use a Stab card to attack the enemy. Like the movement cards, stab cards are selected in advance without any measuring on the table. Players line the knife card up with the appropriate symbol on their tank. Most cards can be swiveled in any direction, but some can only point forward or backwards. Once a card is laid down, check and see if any part of it overlays on your opponents tank card. If so, \"roll\" for damage using damage cards indicated in the corner.  \nA \"hit\" happens when your Knife Card overlaps your opponent's tank.\nDamage Cards\nWhenever a tank is hit, players \"roll\" for damage using the Damage cards. These cards have different numbers indicating how much damage might be done. Knife and Special cards will indicate which cards should be used when rolling for damage. If a card has a \"0 1 1\" marked on it, that means the attacker collects a two 1 point damage cards and a 0 card. That player is then allowed to shuffle these in any order they wish then have their opponent select one of the three Damage cards. If the player draws the 0, no damage is done, otherwise they take the damage indicated on the card, \"1\". Players keep track of their hit points by using the damage tracker. Each tank starts off with the hit points indicated on their tank card. When a tank reaches 0, that player loses. Tanks may never exceed 4 hit points.    \n\"Rolling\" for damage\nSpecial Cards\nMixed in with the Movement and Stab cards are a set of Special cards which can add a fun dexterity element to your game. These cards enable you to toss, drop, or flick cards across the table. One card even allows you to blow cards across the table! \n\"And ya know I flick like a missile strike, my precision got you all enraged\"\nSpecial cards add a fun element to the game\nStretch Goals\nI am dedicated to keeping this project on track, so I don't want to do anything that could cause a delay in shipping or disrupt the game's balance. That being said, I think there are a few cool things we can do if the project reaches these goals:\n500- add a \"Fish Tank\" card to the orders.\n1,000 backers- add one more tank and 5 new action cards (1 special, 1 knife, and 3 movement cards)\n1,500 backers- foil packaging and an upgraded box\nIf we reach these goals, I would try to work with my backers here on Kickstarter to collaboratively design these new cards. These new tanks and action cards would not only be made possible through this community, but would be based on feedback from comments and polls as well.  \nreviews\nRead Gareth Branwyn's in-depth review on BoingBoing.net\nLaughingSquid.com\nKickstarter United\nOn a personal note, this is my 10th Kickstarter project and I've backed over 600 other projects.

See below for the full box contents.\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is a stand-alone multi-player sequel to the original solitaire game Deep Space D-6.\nIn Deep Space D-6: Armada, you and up to 3 friends will work together to complete missions, fight enemy fleets in ship to ship combat, and ultimately defeat an evil federation. \nYou'll get stronger as the game progresses, building the perfect starship from over 50 station modules, hiring heroes from a pool of more than 30 unique units, and finding resources to help you dismantle your opposition. \nArmada is a complex and deep game made simple and intuitive through visual and user experience design. If you've played Deep Space D-6 before, you'll be immediately familiar with the mechanics of Armada. If you're new to the series- I hope you're ready for tough decisions and tactical planning! \nDeep Space D-6: Armada is played over a series of game rounds. Each round consists of three phases:\n\n1) Planning: Players perform actions to travel between planets and prepare for upcoming tasks such as upgrading their ships or hiring Heroic crew.\n2) Encounter: Players complete Away Missions or combat enemy fleets at their current location (together or alone).\n3) Resolution: Event and Threat Detected cards are drawn and hazard effects are resolved. \n Learn more about the game in upcoming updates:\nThe Starships (Update #2)\nStations Modules and Weapons (Update #4)\nCrew and Special Abilities (Update #6)\nTeam-Up encounters (Update #8)\nRule Book\nWant to know more? Check out the prototype rulebook. This is a work-in-progress rulebook and is subject to change. \n PHASE 1: Planning\nTravel, repair, upgrade ship, hire crew.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 2: Encounter\nShip-to-ship combat and Away Missions.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 3: Resolution \nDraw new event cards, spawn enemies, resolve hazard effects.\nPLAY\n\nCreating a science fiction world where the primary color wasn't black proved to be a large challenge. As a lover of classic science fiction, I was drawn to the bright colors and \"loudness\" of pulp era sci-fi. A true test of Armada's visual direction came from designing the board- or lack thereof. \nA space themed game without the empty blackness of space almost felt wrong, and for some people they probably won't be able to get over it! So Armada uses free floating planet tiles making whatever surface you play on the core color of the \"board\". Still want that dark sci-fi feel? Play on a neoprene star field map. Want to feel like you're floating in space? Try a glass table! \nFor the art, I've enlisted in the help of Gareth Davies. Gareth's unique art style creates a vibrant science fiction world while keeping things minimal and clean. \nFor the components themselves, I aimed for a classic board game look with a slight vintage feel. There are over 50 custom dice in this game!  We're taking advantage of new manufacturing technologies, but don't want to go overboard with component gimmicks. \nGet the full game as a $2 add-on!\nJUMPSHIP is a hidden identity party game for 5-10 players. You can get a copy of the mini-version for $2 with your Armada pledge. Just add $2 to you pledge. See the update for more info (Not available by itself. Limit 1 copy per copy of Armada).\nNo stretch goals. Tau Leader Games does not do Kickstarter exclusives. We fully develop our games and don't piece parts out to be added as stretch goals later.\nBut with your help and community feedback, I've been able to redesign and upgrade the shield and hull trackers! They look like this now:\nOther upgrades:\nA dedicated solo scenario meant for quicker play.\nCustom plastic insert for the hero dice.\nBlack Core cardstock on all cards.\nDrawstring bag for beacon tokens.\nPrinted player pawns (instead of stickers)\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager. Thanks to the funding progress of this campaign, I've been able to lower shipping rates.\nGames will be shipped though fulfillment partners primarily in Canada, China, the EU, the US, and Australia. This should reduce custom fees and VAT. Shipping rates are partially subsidized. \nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge. You may add up to 2 additional copies by adding $48 for each additional game to your pledge. There will be no extra shipping charge for extra copies. \nFor larger orders (cases of 6+) or retailer pledges, please inquire by sending a message to the creator.\nTabletop games are becoming more and more popular every year. We as consumers (and designers too!) employ platitudes and conjecture comparing the increased complexity and immersion of board games to the capabilities of video games. If we are to make these comparisons, we must also recognize the dangers of any consumer-focused game mediums. Publishers have a responsibility to be morally accountable for any practices that manipulate fans, deceive consumers, or incite misbehavior among those that partake in our hobby. Deceptive pricing schemes, endless boxes of collectible miniatures, nickel & dime expansion structures, undisclosed kickbacks, even player toxicity- these are just a few areas of growing concern within the emerging tabletop industry. Please take a moment to consider how your purchasing habits and use of games reflect on the industry, whether it is my games or someone else's. \nNever forget that tabletop games are a place for communion, self-expression, can have positive effects on our health and mind, and can lead to wonderful careers and societal impact. As an independent publisher I'm committed to creating games that respect players, and delivering them with practices that are healthy for the community. \nHave fun and play nice. \nJoin the Armada today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is my most ambitious and largest game to date. Though the game is already designed, we continue to balance and add new features. There is also a non-trivial amount of art assets to be completed. These things will take time. \n\nThis will be my 6th Kickstarter game project. I've been all over the place- let me tell you. From last-second funding escapades to projects far exceeding my own projections and everything in between. This means I've also seen failures and made mistakes. I've been late to hit deadlines. I've been unresponsive when I needed communication the most. I take full responsibility for my actions and hope people will be fair in judgement and understanding. I am fully aware that being an individual does not necessitate leniency in a market full of large companies and publishers with impressive capabilities. Let's just do our best to be reasonable and keep the spirit of independent self-publishing alive!\n\nTauLeaderGames has a 100% delivery rate but every project still has inherent risks. October 2020 is my best estimate for a project of this scope based on my past experience. While this timeframe includes room for errors and overages, it doesn't encapsulate every possible obstacle.

We have another set of three fun and engaging pocket-sized games for you, each with all the rules printed on a folding box to allow you to bring game night with you almost anywhere! All three games make up the third wave in our F.L.O.A.T. series. It is our goal to release card games that are Fun, Lively, Original, Approachable, and Tiny. These games could find a home on a lunch table or gaming table, at game night or at date night (maybe check with your partner first on that one).\nEach game contains 18 cards and a folding \"hook box\" that has the rules printed directly on the inside. The cards and boxes are made of 320 gsm black-core card stock (sturdier than stock for Magic: The Gathering) with a protective UV coating as well. Keep scrolling for info on each game, reviews, how to play videos and more. We hope you join us on this campaign and look forward to making these titles a reality!\nClick the image above to read the full rules!\n We start off with the Winner of The Game Crafters' Hook Box Game Challenge, Cards of Olympus! \nCards of Olympus is an 18 card deck builder/manipulator; that's right deck building in just 18 cards! Players take on the role of Gods looking to take the charge of the throne of Olympus by building a powerful alliance of Gods and Heroes. Cards are double sided and split top and bottom with each card featuring a Mortal, Hero, God, and Monster. All cards are shared, with players gaining resources and abilities from the half of the cards that faces them. Acquire Tribute and Drachma to use special powers, guide your mortals and heroes to godhood, or add new cards to the deck an insure you gaining an additional leg up on the competition. Any upgrade in your characters helps your future hands but negatively impacts your opponent's; keep a close eye on each others' moves to make sure you come out on top!\nWith amazing artwork by the immensely talented Beth Sobel, this game begs to be played anywhere you take it!\n\"...a clever way to make a small, deck builder card game. Hopefully you can check it out and get it to your table.\"- Brody Sheard, Meeple Mountain\nClick the image to view the Rules and Free B&W PnP\nIn A Wizard's Shelf, players seek to prove they are the most esteemed wizard in the land by filling their shelves with similar types of ingredients and completing spells. Players draft cards from center stacks in an attempt to build out their shelf tableau and unlock new scoring mechanics. Players can also use abilities from spells to change up the game and their collection of ingredients.\nWhen all the cards are drafted players tally up points based on their unlocked scoring and adjacent similar ingredients. Players also lose points if they match up items of the same color.\n\"All in all, I think this is another solid entry in the wallet [hook box] game line, and if you\u2019re looking for a title that will challenge you a bit spatially and you\u2019re into a bit of magic, you might want to check out A Wizard\u2019s Shelf!

All game cards serve a dual purpose, acting as both the planets for scoring and the rocket fuel used to reach the planets.\nOn a turn players will draft cards from a central tableau or combine cards from their hands to reach exact target rocket fuel numbers to either land on or orbit a planet in the tableau. To score a planet, a player will discard cards from their hand and multiply the rocket fuel values together to hit the aforementioned target number. Some cards can also be discarded in order to add or subtract from the fuel value.\n\"I thought this was cool. Its basically an 18-card SciFi Point Salad. You're trying to land on a planet (or orbit it) for varying scores & cards double as both rocket fuel and victory points.\" Glenn Flaherty, Boardgames and Bourbon (Via Twitter)\nA Note on Stretch Goals: In previous campaigns we've had a few promo cards that could be unlocked via stretch goals. This time around we wanted to backers to know exactly what they are getting when they back the game and be sure they are receiving the 100% intended experience of each pocket sized adventure. Anything added in or adjusted with the games will be done so organically and because it is for the betterment of the base game experience.\n Below are some quick overview GIFs of the gameplay for each game.

Because we are printing in the US we had avoided those delays. Now, however, with the virus growing in the US, we're getting hit with some delays. Our games had been back on track to ship in March but right now I have some conservative estimates from the printer that they will ship in May.

FLOAT Series Wave 3!"}}, {"backer": "Nathan Meunier", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Spire's End is a solo and cooperative card game that hearkens back to the game books of the '80s with enemy encounters, interactive story-driven scenarios, and high-end art and design.  It's a unique gaming experience without a lot of baggage. Simple set-up, intuitive rules and minimal components. No DM, no bookkeeping or character sheet. Just you, an oversized deck of cards, dice and cube markers.\nMy influences for this game are rooted in the nostagia of my childhood. D&D, Planet of the Apes, Land of the Lost, Heavy Metal Magazine, Zork, and Monkey Island, to name a few.\n\nIt's the grisly tale of a strange tower that emerges in the heart of a bustling Viking city. The townsfolk have vanished. It\u2019s up to you to mount a rescue and unravel the mystery. \nYou move through the game like a book. But in this case, it's a stack of ominous cards. Flip them over, make difficult choices and let the story unfold. \n\nYou have an Ally Deck with 6 adventurers (6 chances) to face the countless dangers of the spire. From this deck you will randomly pick 2 starting Allies. But be warned, your path is paved in blood. If they die, and they will you will randomly select another Ally to take their place.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a six-chapter adventure, each of which includes a major encounter, loot, choices, dice chucking and more! It will require both skill and luck. \nThe hook is simple. In combat you perform actions at a cost. That cost is your character's hit points. Every action is a risk. To execute stronger attacks you will need to spend more hit points, which in turn leaves you weak and vulnerable. This makes for tense, close, ruthless battles.\nPlease note: This is a simplistic look at some basics in combat. There are many exciting variables to actions and their outcomes detailed in the instructions deck. Check out Kickbacks, Status Effects, Rest meters and more!\nEnemies will fight in a similar fashion, with a few exceptions. They don't spend Hit Points and their actions are determined by the Action Deck.\nEach enemy you will face has different hooks and mechanics to make them interesting. Some have story branches that trigger in the midst of battle.\n\n\nWhat would an adventure be without pesky trash mobs getting in your way? You can't head out on your first quest without clearing rats out of a cellar, right?\n\nMy goal was to make this game with as few components as possible without taking away from the gaming experience. It's a clean minimalistic approach to an in-depth and engrossing adventure.\nThe focus has always been the story deck. The heart of the game. It represents the spire, and each card is a layer you uncover during your descent. \nFrom the very start I wanted ENORMOUS PLAYING CARDS. These are custom 6.5 x 3.5 inch cards. They are about the same size as an iPhone X and they're glorious. Here's what's in the box. \n\n\n\nThis is not a randomly generated gaming experience. The concept here is to experience a specific storyline with multiple chapter branches and endings. Your choices, enemy encounters and items you discover will influence the overall narrative. There are multiple endings to uncover, some more unpleasant than others.\n\n\n\nHere is a look at the current Card Progression Tree for Chapters 1 and 2 to help illustrate the branching paths. Each square is a card. Black = Story Card, Red = Item Card, Dark Red = Encounter. Your story can splinter out in many different directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the complexities of the project I want to be transparent with the progress made and what's left to do.\n\nGreg is an Art Director and Graphic Designer currently residing in Los Angeles, CA. In his free time he's pumping whatever pop culture he can into his veins..or dreaming up new encounters for Spire's End!\n\nBenjamin is a Digital Artist from Berlin, Germany currently working as a freelance concept artist and illustrator. These days he uses every available minute for art and game design.\nErica is co-owner of Oaktown Spice Shop in Oakland, CA. Before starting a retail business with her husband, she was a journalist. She loves to cook and drink wine.\nChristian is co-owner of Hop Merchants Bottle Shop & Taproom, a craft beer bar in North Hollywood, CA.  He's a writer, a gamer and horror film fanatic.\n\n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign has ended. \nThe shipping rates listed below are conservative estimates NOT the official costs. Please note that these estimates are based on the core game. Any Stretch Goals unlocked during the campaign may change the weight and the size of the game, which could influence the final shipping cost. I will work to secure the best prices possible and attempt to lower these costs in proportion to the success of the campaign.\nBackers outside the countries listed above may be responsible for their own customs fees and any additional charges if and when they occur. Please message me regarding countries not listed for more information.\nPlease not that Spire's End is a work in progress, product is still in development.\nWarning: This is a fantasy/horror game that contains violence and disturbing imagery. Ages 16 and up.\nThe incredible art by Benjamin Wieseman sets the mood. The game will contain over 40 original illustrations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first venture into the madness of crowdfunding and it\u2019s incredibly daunting. But with more than 15 years of graphic design and packaging experience, I am merely in a state of heightened panic.\n\nThis project, like many, started with very ambitious goals before it was wrangled into something reasonable for my first attempt. It began as a 12 chapter, 200 card epic. Due to the sheer scope of the game, production costs and the fact that I am just one person, the game is now 6 Chapters, with the hopes to continue later if successful.\n\nThe style guides and templates are set, and the writing for Chapters 1-6 are more than halfway there.\n\nMy aim is to keep things simple without compromising the game as much as possible. That being said, even with \u201csimple\u201d in mind I know that problems lurk around every corner. Game balancing and rewrites take time so I am giving myself a considerable amount of lead time to get this labor-intensive job done properly.\n\nNobody wants this game in their hands more than me. I dream about this thing. I spend my time in the shower planning the next encounter. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to get this out before the spire drags me down into the bowels of the underworld.

The royalty reign supreme, but alongside of their control are the plotting citizens, planning to get ahead using any means possible.\nHierarchy is an abstract game of order and power where players each take a random set of 7 cards and play them openly, until they cannot play any more. Cards must be played atop a card of a lesser value, unless either the last card or the new card change those rules. When the active player can no longer play a card, their opponent has won the game and has taken the seat of power away from their opponent. \nIf you haven't heard of us before, here are a few quick notes about Button Shy:\nWe're a small, family based company, with a few helping hands and a great group of designers and artists.\nWe release a new wallet game every month. This is game #56!\nOur wallet games are packaged in a small vinyl wallet for maximum portability.\nEach game is hand assembled and mailed from our little workspace in New Jersey.\nFor more information about our games, rules clarifications, or anything else really, join our wonderful community on Discord: https://discord.gg/pf9DPqs\nThe object of Hierarchy is to put your opponent in a position where they are unable to play a card. This might be as simple as them running out of cards - part of the disadvantage of going first in the game - or you invalidating all of their potential plays. Each player will get 7 cards, and whomever is dealt the Imposter will go first. Because the game is one of perfect information, you will always be able to see what tricks your opponent is capable of pulling off. The ability to evaluate both players' cards and to anticipate your opponent's reactions is a key to being successful.\n Each card in the game has a numerical value - the range across the 14 cards is 1-13 with one \"?\" value - and certain cards may also contain text stating a specific card they can be played onto. As a rule, you are trying to play a card with a higher value than the previous card played to the line. However, cards such as the Knight can break this rule, allowing this 6-value card to be played atop the 9-value Dragon card.  \nSeeing what cards your opponent has will allow you to plan accordingly, knowing whether they can counter your play. However, some of the stronger cards in the game have restrictions on when they can be played, so it is possible to position things to where they might be unable to play that key card from their hand.\nAll cards are identical on both sides other than color.\nHere's a little bit about each card.\n (1) The Assassin - Low in power, yet lethal to the unexpecting. \n (2) Leper - A plague to half the population and avoided by Royalty. \n (3) Serf - Easy to ignore but difficult to remove once it enters the fray. \n (4) The Tower - Strong protection from most losing situations but at a high cost. \n (5) Surgeon - Restores a played card to the hand of both players. \n (6) Knight - Unremarkable until tasked with facing down a dragon. \n (7) Usurper - Topples the mighty, toppled by the meek. \n (8) Sorcerer - Makes the text on cards vanish for a turn. \n (9) Dragon - Loves to find a Baroness in distress, yet mighty on its own. \n (10) Baroness - Good power but needs to appear early to make a difference. \n (11) High Priest - Impressive power but a challenge to get into play \n (12) Queen - Incredibly strong card but useless without a Baroness in play. \n (13) King - Strongest card but cannot impact the early game. \n (?) Imposter - A tricky shapeshifter that clones an opponent's played card.\nPlus 2 reference cards and 1 card to start the line of power.\nTo check out the prototype rules and black and white PNP - visit PNP Arcade:\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/hierarchy\n\"For such a compact and \u2018light\u2019 game, the strategy required for success  keeps the game extremely engaging.

This is another level that's good to grab while on Kickstarter, as we dedicate a small portion of the print  run to retail store sales. Grabbing them here will guarantee the availability. Retailers only! \nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Going forward, we're just going to give it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not: you are getting this expansion if you pledge here.\nThe Emissary expansion by Mike Mullins brings solo play to Hierarchy.\nTwo noble families have been fighting over the throne for years, and the people of the kingdom have suffered. You\u2019ve been sent to make sure there is an uneventful transition into a new age of peace. To be a successful Emissary, you must play all 14 cards.\nEmissary comes with 3 double sided Edict cards that give special abilities, as well as three alternate game cards (Impostor, Tower, and Surgeon) to swap in for solo play. \nAt any time, you may discard an Edict card to use its printed ability. You must be able to resolve the card in order to use it. For example, if there are no cards left in the deck, you cannot \u201cReturn a card to the bottom of the deck.\u201d\nIt also comes in three levels of difficulty. In the Standard and Expert difficulties, after you fully resolve the Edict, you must remove the bottom card in the line and place it on top of its deck, extending the length of the game.\nWhile it's not required, we also made a sweet playmat for solo play. If you like to go all out, the playmats are always really nice. \nWork in progress image\nWe have a lot of games in our collection.

As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every  month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level, that's where the members back our Kickstarter projects).\nOur 2019 $5 packages include an episode of Chain Mail, a card and dice driven, asymmetric dungeon crawler for 1-4 players. Each episode comes with a postcard map, dual monster card, and a new quest. After multiple months you can randomize these and/or attempt multiple quests in a campaign mode.\nIt also includes a copy (and a link to print more) of the next Tempus Quest pen and paper game where you use time instead of dice. The crew of the Tempus ship get into a new adventure each month.

Generally it's a micro-game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. \nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in  the Kickstarter campaigns.\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines. \n\nOur last two projects are Tussie Mussie and Seasons of Rice. Both are moving along according to schedule. Tussie Mussie is in and shipping as planned (starting in September) and will ship for the next 2-3 weeks. Seasons of Rice is partially here and will start shipping in October as planned.

It's full of pivots and surprises, special abilities and special traps. Plus, you can play as a fighting potato!\"\n- Isaac Shalev, designer of Seikatsu\n\"Dragon Bridge is a quintessential Keith Burgun game - a finely-tuned machine that generates a lot of interesting decisions  with an elegant economy of means.\"\n- Frank Lantz, Director at the NYU Game Center\n\"As a big fan of two player games and the designer's theory for elegant strategy game design, I'm very happy to add his first two player 'clockwork' game into my collection!\" - Miya, KBGames community member \nDragon Bridge is a quick, competitive 2-player card game. Players each control a wizard, moving up and down an 18 tile long grid, casting spells, gaining magic items and luring the dragon to one side or another. Players win either by knocking the other player into the dragon, or by escaping off the opposite side. This is complicated, because the Dragon sometimes switches sides. Players are simultaneously managing blasting the other wizard back, running towards the exit, collecting items, and trying to coax the Dragon in one direction or the other!\nThe strategic questions involve many things: Can I move to a Gem tile to collect a Gems? Should I use my Gems now to defend myself, or should I save up and buy an item? But the biggest and most central question is: when will the Dragon switch sides? Can I keep the Dragon near the opponent, while I escape? Or does the opponent know something I don't?\nWhile many games with this few cards are about card counting or deduction, Dragon Bridge feels like a larger strategy game, while fitting easily and comfortably in your pocket.\nBase Game Contents:\nColorful, clear rulebook\n16 Action Cards\n5 Wizards (learn more about them here)\n6 Green Gems\n5 Magic Items\n3 Bridge Cards\n1 Dragon Card\nSuper portable.\nFeatures:\nAn innovative ruleset that's easy to learn and difficult to master\n100% original art, characters and lore\u2014the first game in the Gem Wizards Universe!\nAsymmetric characters and randomly drawn items make each match different\nPlays like a bigger strategic game, but comes in a tiny box.\nThe game takes place on an 18-tile long \u201cbridge\u201d, with a Dragon on one end. You and the opponent each play a card from your hand each turn, either moving yourself away from the Dragon (usually!) or knocking the opponent toward the Dragon (also usually!).\nHere's a RUN card being played, which says \"MOVE 3\" on it\n I say \u201cusually\u201d because the objective is either to escape (to reach the non-Dragon end) OR to knock the opponent into the Dragon side, but every so often, the dragon actually switches the side that he\u2019s on!\nAction cards often have \u201cDragon Orbs\u201d on them, and when 7 or more Dragon Orbs have been played, the dragon switches sides, gaining a new power (as shown on the gif at the top of this page).\nSome cards allow you to reduce the number of Dragon Orbs that are down, delaying the Dragon from switching sides. Throughout the match, players will also gain magic items that can help give them an edge. There's a lot of mind games and using what you know about your hand to get the dragon to switch sides when you want it to. You\u2019ll have to play strategically and think tactically to come out on top. \nDragon Bridge is a game for 2 players that takes between 15-30 minutes to play. Recommended for ages 10+.\nTHOUGHTS FROM THE DESIGNER\nHi! I'm Keith Burgun, the game designer behind a indie videogames like Auro: A Monster-Bumping Adventure and 100 Rogues. I'm the author of two books on game design, the latest being Clockwork Game Design. I'm also the host of the Clockwork Game Design Podcast, which has had interviews from notable game designers like Raph Koster, Dan Cook, Naomi Clark, Greg Street, Tim Fowers, and many, many more.\nDragon Bridge was designed quite quickly, originally for a game jam, over the course of a few days. The original version worked surprisingly well, although this is less of a surprise when I remember that I've actually been trying to design this game for years. I've made countless prototypes of a long one-dimensional grid game, trying to find a way to make a tiny card game have huge depth. It finally came together this year and I'm really happy with how it has turned out.\nI wrote this article talking about cool design things about the game, so definitely check that out. Actually, you can read all the articles about the game on my site, here. There's a lot of really neat things about it: the Dragon Orbs system, the Green Gems as a basic resource, the way that character abilities all happen \"when you\" do other actions, and so on. One of the coolest things about it is the tiny Action Deck; because of the fact that it only has 16 cards in it, players are cycling through it quite quickly. This makes Dragon Bridge one of the least random card games I've ever played. I also love that you can carry around this tiny game about the size of a Poker deck in your pocket, and yet it's really a \"game you can live in\"\u2014it has the depth to withstand hundreds of hours of play, and the variety to keep things interesting. The expansion, \"A Bridge-Hacking Expansion\", brings even more depth to the game, with a bunch of new characters, magic items, and a new Bridge-Hacking mechanism.\nDOWNLOADS\nA rulebook plus print-and-play PDF is available here.\nTabletop simulator module is available here.\nCheck out this playtest with BrainGoodGames' designer, Brett Lowey - with the expansion, on Tabletop Simulator! \nSHIPPING\nThe game has FREE SHIPPING to the US, $3 shipping to Canada and $7 shipping to the EU/UK (or $5 for the first tier). Backers are responsible if there are any import fees involved. (I know the first reward just says \"Free shipping\" but it's free shipping to the US - sorry, I found this slight error after there were already some backers so I can't edit it!)\nLinks\nFollow me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.\nYou can learn more about Dragon Bridge at the official site. \nClick here to read all the articles on my site about the game.\nFollow me on Twitter here.\nChat with us and give feedback at our Discord channel.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I've published many video games before, this is my first published card game, and luckily I have a lot of resources and great people who are giving me lots of good advice on how to do it right.

With an open call for designers, we found a great creative team full of innovative and diverse ideas. We work iteratively off of creativity, which produced a great set of new and fresh games.\nWe are proud to bring you the ten unique and wonderful games that make up Dice & Ink: Volume I.\nJoey Schouten is our developer, and has likely played and studied more roll-and-write games than perhaps anyone on earth. He is currently completing his thesis on board game adaptations of video games as part of the MSc Game Studies, an interdisciplinary study that deals with game design for non-entertainment purposes (such as serious gaming, or educational games). His wide and deep knowledge of the roll and write genre, and an uncanny ability to give meaningful and actionable feedback to designers, make him the person to head up development and scouting for Inkwell Games.\nOdin Phong (sounds like pong) is our Head of Publishing and Logistics, a lifelong gamer with a background in sales, warehousing and management. He brings industry knowledge, entrepreneurial spirit, numbers knowhow, and a growing expertise in the retail games establishment to the team. His contacts in the industry, profit and loss focus, outside the box ideation, and a willingness to undertake the less flashy side of games publishing make him highly qualified to undertake the physical publishing, logistics, and business operations for Inkwell Games.\nCalvin Wong Tze Loon is our Rulebook Editor Extraordinaire. Loves the English language and often uses his acerbic wit to call out injustice. His acute command of the language, and a well honed narrative sense make him invaluable as an editor and fiction writer for our book. Calvin has worked on other great games such as Pasaraya: Supermarket Manager and Fire in the Library.\nToni Catino (Little Island Gift Shops) started designing games when she was in middle school, first with custom Pokemon cards, then with games based on her favorite books and subjects. She loves all things board games, card games, and miniatures, but might love the designing of them just a bit more. Her goal in creating games is always to make something fun, that people will enjoy and want to share with their friends and family, because that\u2019s what board games are for!\nJesse Catron (Coral Relief) is a lifelong boardgamer. His game Salmon Run was published in 2013 by Eagle Gryphon Games, after which he took a hiatus from game design upon the arrival of his 3 children. He lives with his family in Maryland and works as an Optometrist.\nRobin Gibson (Kuiper Kowboys) has been compulsively designing games since he was very young. At any time he has several dozen projects on the go tabletop and video games, but lately his attention has been focused on one-page solo games in the Legends of Dsyx and Paper Pinball series, and illustrating Chris Anderson's Tempus Quest. Robin's major creative influences are only the most obscure video games and cartoons. He's heard that television exists with real people in it, but has yet to see any evidence of this. Robin lives in British Columbia with his wife and a small bird. He works as an educational assistant and homeless support worker.\nRyan Hoye (Icy Dice) began unofficially designing board games 7 years ago when a multimedia art project morphed into a simultaneous movement electronic board game based on Pac-Man. He has officially been doing game design for about 3 years as a creative outlet to balance out a relatively uncreative full-time job. To help foster his design skills, Ryan joined the newly founded Kansas City Game Designers in January of 2016 where he has playtested other\u2019s works and has taken in feedback on his own creations.\nGrace Kendall (Celestial Stories) is a bit surprised to take on the mantle of game designer, but after two years of working on co-designs they\u2019re proud to introduce their first solo game to the world! This celestial storytelling game is a natural fit for Grace, who has been telling stories for years and is often found lurking in the woods (where the brightest stars live). Outside of board games, Grace is a dedicated member of the wizard rock community and spends a ridiculous amount of time writing sad songs about books. When not telling stories, Grace enjoys eating macaroni & cheese and being barefoot.\nNat Levan (PenSylvania) is an experienced game designer known for New Bedford and Nantucket from Dice Hate Me Games, and Supertall and Timestamp from Buttonshy Games, and the 2018 ION award winning American Steel. He loves designing and playing games about cities, history, and overlooked industries. He lives in the Philadelphia Suburbs with his wife, son, and cat, where he has been designing games since 2012.\nJoe Montgomery (Lost at Sea) is a game designer in Seattle who finds his design inspiration from some of the most fantastic and unexplained corners of the world. He loves strange games and is hopeful that his designs will be as thought-provoking as they are enjoyable. Joe is currently working on a card game about constructing massive concrete structures for infamous dictators and a tableau-building game of alien archaeology set in late 1980\u2019s Norway. For the last year and a half, Joe has been bringing these games to the weekly Seattle game designer meet-ups for some brutally honest feedback.\nSarah and Will Reed (Scrapyard Rollbot) are a husband and wife design team. They started getting into board game design when Will wanted to create a board game for Sarah\u2019s birthday. Given the fact he has a vision disability, it was a bit challenging to get the project done by himself. So instead of giving up, he decided it would be a lot of fun to have her involved in the process.That first game turned out to be a game called Scrapyard. More games, such as Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture and Project Dreamscape, followed. Now, years later, Will and Sarah are revisiting the Scrapyard theme for Scrapyard Rollbot.\nBehrooz \u2018Bez\u2019 Shahriari (Flowers over Towers) has been fascinated by games since her first memory: from Prince of Persia and Lode Runner on computers, to multi-day epic games of Risk and pencil/paper games played against classmates in school. In 2008, Bez found modern board games and within a few years had started designing tabletop games. In 2012, Bez moved to London and found a regular playtest group, which allowed for the iteration and continued design/development of her first mass-produced game. Yogi/In A Bind continues to sell well. However, Bez is most proud of her 2nd thing - a game system for which many games have been created and a community continues to develop. Bez continues to self-publish games and started pitching games to other companies in 2019.\nAlexander Shen (Islands of Atlantis) works as a Senior Technical Program Manager at one of those Silicon Valley companies where you have to circle around the parking lot for a space if you show up just a tad too late. In the more interesting parts of the day, he spends his time as an illustrator (IG: @shenbotdraws), maker (IG: @thealexandershen), and children\u2019s book author (IG: @sadiecatandmao).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any Kickstarter campaign, there are always complications.

In other words, it's pay-what-you-can. \n  A Vampire Night Bus cussing out local Unicorn Butt Cop propaganda\nEXPLORE THE UNIQUE WORLD OF THE TINGLEVERSE IN GLORIOUS FULL MOTION VIDEO. Using long-abandoned Full Motion Video (FMV) game techniques to emulate the singular style of Chuck Tingle\u2019s renowned stock-photo covers, the game not only looks like it was summoned directly from Chuck's imagination, it also evokes the joyful spirit of his stories that we love. That said, you don't have to know the Tingleverse to be a Buckaroo. Project Tingler is ultimately a story about positive sexuality, self-acceptance, love and personal growth. Like Doctor Tingle\u2019s (Ph.d in Sensual Massage from DeVry Institute) 4,000 word masterpieces, Project Tingler will be a brief but sexily refreshing respite, rather than an hours-long epic journey.\nNAVIGATE THE TINGLEVERSE in search of your cute son (name of Jon): Your cute son (name of Jon) is missing! To recover him, you\u2019ll have to dive deeper and deeper into the tangled, wrangled, hard-bodied web that is THE TINGLEVERSE! Explore a magical world rendered in glorious FMV (Full Motion Video)! Visit exotic and erotic locations like the desert! A bus depot! The beach! the void. Annnnnd\u2026.jail!\nHELP PROVE LOVE IS REAL for all who kiss through a variety of seduction minigames: As you journey to save your cute son (name of Jon), you\u2019ll come face to face to butt to mouth with a variety of down-on-their-love foes who seek to get in your way and muss up your hair. But are they enemies of you or enemies... of themselves? Help them figure their biz out by tingling their minds, bodies, and souls. \nGET TINGLED BY OUR CUSTOM SMUT! The very nature of the Tingleverse is The Rawest of Graphic Sensualities, but players who aren\u2019t down with visual depictions of sexual content needn\u2019t fear. While we're working with video and real actors (the cast will most certainly SURPRISE and AMAZE you), there won't be explicit footage of people taking a trip to bonetown. Our salacious scenes are literary in nature and read aloud by talented performers, intended to pound the most sexual of your organs...Your imagination.\nOur exquisitely handcrafted smut puts the anal in artisanal\nWe\u2019re also including a Kitten Mode, where sexual situations will be replaced by footage of kittens playing. If you wish, you may also engage Kitten Mode on its own, just to watch some kittens playing, because why not.\nCONFRONT THE ULTIMATE EVIL in The Tingleverse - The Dark Magician Ted Cobbler: Ted Cobbler, the *Dead Gobbler* (not his actual title) has spirited away your cute son (name of Jon) for reasons as inscrutable as they are unsettling. A virtuoso of Dark Magic\u2014indeed, a veritable Dark Magician\u2014Ted Cobbler has his fingers in many sinister stewpots. Take heed: despite the master-class glamour he casts to disguise it, all of Ted Cobbler\u2019s fingers are exactly the same length. You\u2019ll need to learn the true meaning of love to withstand his hideous, alluring powers, for Ted Cobbler claims that Love Is Not Real. \n  Chuck Tingle!

Zoe's core team includes Karla Pacheco (Inspector Pancakes; Dreadful Sirens; Marvel), Elby Teufel (hunktears.sexy), Seth Boyer (Welcome to Night Vale; Tiny Cartridge), and John Warren (The Sun at Night; Murder at Mystery Manor; Tumblewords).\nTo see some of us in action and better understand the story behind this game, check out this mini-documentary by Vice that followed us around for the early parts of development!\nOur core team is joined by a motley crew of actors and voice actors, including Anthony Carboni and Jim Sterling, with more to be announced as we go! \nYour support doesn\u2019t just bring The Gift of Tingle to True Buckaroos Around the World (though assuredly that would be reward enough); you can also get early beta access to the game, behind-the-scenes updates and exclusive Project Tingler rewards like having the butt-pounded star of an Original Chuck Tingle Story named after YOU! \nChoose a side; determine the game's ending\nOur first support level is not only a pledge to Prove Love Is Real, it is a vote where you determine a key element of the game itself! Will you join TEAM SPAGHETTI SWEETIES or do you choose THE CHOCOLATE MILK CUTIES???? This may be the most sexy and important decision of your life. \nEarly access to Project Tingler means you get the game before the public does. That's right, you get to prove love before the bucks and ladybucks who abstain from Kickstarting us in the butt. Backers can also get exclusive access to crude Photoshops, making-of clips, and general Tinglenanigans while the hard buds make Project Tingler.\nWe also have mugs and t-shirts.\n      If you're one of the few who decide to be extra nice, you can get a custom Chuck Tingle-style cover with your face on it! These items will be delivered digitally directly to backers AND will be hidden objects to find in the game itself. YOU'RE A COLLECTIBLE NOW, BUCKAROO. (Limit 69)\nWhat about the hardest buds who prove love with high rewards?? You could get a REAL PROP from the production of Project Tingler along with an attached card commemorating the occasion and describing the prop's use during production! Buttplug Bandolier? Executive dildo? Who knows what delights you'll pull from our exotic and sensual treasure box! (Limit 50)\n  For buckaroos who want to BE in Project Tingler, we have two limited reward tiers for you. You could be a HANDSOME LIVING OBJECT in Project Tingler! If you're one of the ten who do this good way, you simply need to send us footage of your face (don't worry - we'll work with you through the process). That's right, buds need not be in Los Angeles to become a living object! (Limit 10)\nFor buds in (or visiting) city name of Los Angeles, you could be one of the three who dons full UNICORN BUTT COP REGALIA in Project Tingler! There will be a production day between November 15 and December 15 (relatively flexible) where YOU can join the game buds for a day of fun and booty shorts. (Limit 3)\nFinally, buds who wish to truly know the way of love can be our highest reward bud and have the good Dr. Tingle himself name a protagonist after you in one of his Tingleverse adventures. This is a digital product and the three buds who do this way will need to understand they will be subjected to literary poundings in heart, brain, AND butt. Please understand. (Limit 3)\nProject Tingler has two main physical rewards \u2014 If you want extras you will have an opportunity to add a UNICORN BUTT COP T-SHIRT ($35 for U.S. orders, $45 for International - prices include shipping & handling) or a TRUE BUCKAROO MUG ($20 for U.S. orders, $30 for International) at the end of the Kickstarter campaign. \nWe don't have any. We have a specific vision in mind for the game, and overfunding will go to polishing & improving the game we already want to make. If we absolutely had to pick a stretch goal, it would be for 69,421 - thank you for not leaving the total as the sexweed number.\nChuck and the Project Tingler team want to make this game like the rest of Zoe's games - pay what you can. Crowdfunding gives us the freedom to make Project Tingler the loving gift to the internet we want it to be and provide voracious Tingle fans with early access to the game, special rewards, and an opportunity to be part of this Truly Magical Process.\nThe greatest funding requirement is the cost of filming the entire game as an FMV Adventure. Why are we going back to a decades-old form of game making that was hastily abandoned and literally no one asked for? Because we are dedicated to pouring our hearts into crafting ridiculously awesome things quite seriously, and FMV matches the stock photography style of Chuck's covers. We\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of our own money and countless hours (we\u2019re not joking. We\u2019re too sleepy to count anything right now) to develop a game that truly emulates the distinct feel of a Chuck Tingle novel.\nOver the last few months we\u2019ve experimented with production pipelines and the tech, and we\u2019ve done multiple shoots, so we know how to minimize risks and waste that can come from needing to re-shoot footage. We've prototyped out a level that meets our standards, because we didn\u2019t want to come to you before we\u2019d eliminated the biggest, girthiest risks in creating the game! Project Tingler has been hard in development for almost a year at this point, and we are well-equipped to handle the challenges that naturally arouse during the process, including ones that aren't exclusive to working in FMV.\nThe core team has shipped a combined 12 games in the past 5 years, and we're well-versed in how to finish a game and accurately budget (ignore what we just said about not being able to count).\nYour support helps us pound the world in the butt with the Gift of Project Tingle...for all Buckaroos Who Kiss The Sky.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nModern-day FMV games are relatively uncharted waters, but thankfully we're coming to you after almost a year of developing the game. Physical rewards will be created and shipped by Amplifier, a top printing and fulfillment company who\u2019ve worked with Nerdist, Geek and Sundry, and more. \n\nThe biggest \"risk\" might be the fact that it's comedy that deals with sexuality - only the most subjective thing we could choose to do. Everyone has a different sense of humor, but we hope that you've got a good feel for what ours is. In case a few things aren't clear, here's what we do think is funny\n\n-The human condition\n-The Bigfoot Pirate Ghost condition\n-Dogs (clothed)\n-Dogs (natural)\n-Unicorns that walk like men, yet are not bound by man\u2019s laws\n-The unexpected juxtaposition of disparate concepts (for instance: pirate, ghost, and bigfoot)\n-The absurd treated as the mundane\n-The mundane treated as the absurd\n-Dad jokes\n-Big Dogs (t-shirts) \n\nHere's what we DON'T think is funny:\n\n-The twenty Twitter accounts that pop up immediately after a current event happens like Left Shark or Ken Bone\n-Racism (stop it)\n-Sexism (stop it)\n-Any other mean-spirited shit where the punchline is punching down\n-The basic concept of people of the same gender being in love and/or having sex with each other. We all take this one very seriously, and it's extremely important us, as we've only got like...one token straight person on the team. You know, just to keep it interesting.\n-That dream you had once where Kevin from Accounting made this face at you, and you were like \"whaaat\", and- I guess you had to be there.\n-People who don't read past the title of a Chuck Tingle book to discover the unironic beauty and joy he brings us.\n\nAlso my cat sits on my keyboard a lot which is a real difficulty and I want you to know that.

The game takes a few minutes to learn, it's kid-friendly, and each round takes about 20 minutes to play.\n(Stretch Goals here!)\n    THE ORIGIN STORY\n                                   I\u2019ve always wanted to make a card game. A few years ago, I started working on a game based on my comic, The Oatmeal, where you connect heads, torsos, arms, and legs to create a variety of monsters based on characters from my comic, such as the Bear-O-Dactyl. The original version of this game was doodled onto paper cutouts, and had no functioning game mechanic other than \u201cbuild funny-looking things.\u201d \nThe very first version of the Oatmeal card game.\nTwo years ago I met Elan Lee, and he showed me a prototype of a game called \u201cBombSquad,\u201d which we renamed to Exploding Kittens. After Exploding Kittens launched, my creature-building game got put on hold.\nAfter the dust from Exploding Kittens eventually settled, I asked Elan to help with the design of my monster-building game. I didn\u2019t want this to be one of those games where you're trying to \"out-comedy\" one another; I wanted it to be more of a deck-building game, such as Dominion or Hearthstone, but without all the complexity. I wanted a monster-building game you could easily play at a party.\n Up until this point, my version of the game had a big problem:  when you played, you were on autopilot. You had no decisions to make and usually one correct action to perform on every turn.  Elan has been designing physical and digital games for most of his career (he invented the genre of alternate reality games, and was formerly the creative director of the Xbox), so he put his gargantuan puzzle-solving brain to work and added a layer of much-needed complexity to the game.  He tinkered a bunch and established the basic rules of conflict, construction, and the escalation mechanic that would define the core gameplay. The tricky part was keeping this simple enough to be a party game, but complicated enough to allow for depth and strategy. It\u2019s easy to fall into two bad categories when designing tabletop games: either they\u2019re easy to learn but completely random, or they\u2019re very strategic but mind-numbingly boring. You have to walk a very thin line between the two. I think with Bears vs Babies we did that.\nOur battle-hardened \"Sharpie Deck\"\nAfter months of pestering everyone we knew to play the game with us and tweaking the rules bit by bit, we finally got it to the point where our friends pestered us to play, instead of vice versa. And that eventually brought us here, to Kickstarter, where we\u2019re now pestering the whole internet to play with us.\nAnd so here we are. \nLet the bear hugs and baby burping begin.\n-Matt and Elan\n----------\n   ----------\n                                                                                 Press Inquiries\nEmail: info@bearsvsbabies.com\n----------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRemember that one time two years ago when we built Exploding Kittens and shipped everything we promised to you ON TIME?\n\nSeems like a pretty keen idea to try that again.

Meet Russian Subway Dogs, a fast-paced action-arcade game inspired by the real-life stray dogs of the Moscow Metro. We have done extensive, totally legal research in order to fine-tune this chaotic simulation of what it's like to scavenge for food from Russian commuters. Surviving isn't easy when you are dodging volatile vodka, rival dogs, and the rare and dangerous Subway Bear!\nRussian Subway Dogs is already playable, super frantic, and fun. With your help we can make it bigger and better! We have some great rewards to thank you for backing us, and our talented team is raring to go!\nRussian Subway Dogs will be available through Steam and itch.io upon release, and we are aiming to launch simultaneously on Windows and Mac. \n  Levels inspired by the world-famous architecture of the Moscow subway system, rendered in meticulously detailed pixel art.\nMission mode filled with unique challenges from your kitty comrade the Proletaricat! \nAn extensive endless mode with online leaderboards. \nOver a dozen food and drink items to consume: gyros, burgers, cabbage, beets, herring, kvass, pigeon, pelmeni and more! \nDiverse subway wildlife including, rival dogs, poodles, rats, elk and bears!\nBomb your enemies with exploding vodka! \nSimple \"pick up and play\" gameplay with a deep scoring system to keep you coming back. \nSilky smooth 60fps gameplay. \nAdorable Russian puppers!\n  A round of Russian Subway Dogs is all about eating, eating eating! Consuming food both increases your score and keeps your stomach life bar full. \nScare up food by barking behind commuters, they'll throw whatever they're holding into the air.\n  Grab food before it hits the ground. Air food is both more filling and higher scoring. Avoid dropping your food and you'll rack up high scoring combos!\n  Watch out for passengers carrying vodka! It's no good for doggies and highly explosive.\n  Your barks can also deflect falling food or vodka. Well aimed vodka helps you get rid of rival dogs and wildlife and heats up your food. Hot food = more points and more filling meals!\n  Fail to eat enough or take too much damage and the round will end. Your doggie will have to head home to forage another day. \n  Unlike most score attack arcade games, Russian Subway Dogs is full of little touches of simulation, adding depth and emergent gameplay. Food can be warmed up with explosions to make it more filling. Hot food that isn't eaten quickly will burn away. Snowdrifts can be cleared away with vodka explosions but also melt faster if hit with hot food, cooling the food back down. Bears fatten up if overfed. Power-up items like coffee or kvass provide equally powerful upgrades to rival dogs who eat them. The more you play, the more of these touches you'll discover.\nAn angry bear burned by a vodka explosion eats a burger and fattens up.\n  The Moscow Metro does in fact have a population of stray dogs who commute each day in search of food. They've learned to identify specific stops, where they can find the best street food, and how to trick or surprise people into feeding them. There's even a statue at Mendeleevskaya station memorializing a famous stray, Malchik!\nphoto credit - englishrussia.com\nThe Moscow Metro has some of the most beautiful, unique stations in the world, making it a perfect setting to draw inspiration from. Originally built during the Soviet era around the concept of svetloe budushchee, \u201cA Radiant Future\u201d, these stations resemble palaces and art galleries with sculptures, stained glass windows, gilt framed paintings, and roman columns. We\u2019re working from hundreds of reference photos to accurately capture the spirit of each station in pixels, while adding a bit of fun canine content to the mix. Here are a few of the stations featured in the game!\n      Russian Subway Dogs started as a jam game created for the GDC Pirate Kart. This early gameplay sketch was very well received with coverage on Indiegames.com as well as several let\u2019s plays in both English and Russian and was chosen as an official selection for Fantastic Fest\u2019s Fantastic Arcade in Austin, Texas. \n  Inspired by this positive response we\u2019ve been improving Russian Subway Dogs by adding more detailed animations, revamped physics and 60fps gameplay, a deep combo system, new commuters, food types, bears, snowdrifts, and more!\nNow we\u2019re ready to take Russian Subway Dogs to the next level! We're packing it full of new content and gameplay modes, then releasing it commercially on Steam. With your help we can make canine magic happen!\n    Travel from station to station taking on missions from the Proletaricat, your feline commander. Missions include a specific combination of commuters and wildlife with a time / score goal you have to beat. However the real meat of the mission is a series of extra sub-challenges. These range from requiring deft hand-eye coordination to puzzling out deeper mechanics. For example:\nComplete the mission with a vegetarian diet.\nDon't let the poodles eat any food.\nGet a 6 x Tasty Kombo.\nEat six pigeons. \nComplete enough subchallenges and you\u2019ll open up the next station with a new set to solve! \n   We're adding a whole range of new commuters and wildlife to the mix. Flighty pigeons, stout babushkas wielding giant herring, annoying balalaika players, and irate subway elk are only a few of the upcoming additions!\n   Kvass, coffee, hot sauce and other new foods will provide game changing powerups not just for the player, but also any rival dogs who eat them. There\u2019s nothing more annoying than a toy poodle moving double-quick on a caffeine high stealing all your food, so make sure you grab any powerups before they do!\n  Arcade games are best when you can show off your skill and compete globally with other players so we're adding online leaderboards! For those looking for a solo challenge we're also including lots of interesting skill-based achievements to aim for.   \n  We're bringing the talented Peter Chapman on board to create a brand new original soundtrack. You may be familiar with his work on award winning games such as Guacamelee!, LittleBigPlanet Karting and Modnation Racers. He'll be producing his own unique electronic take on traditional Eastern European folk music for Russian Subway Dogs. Listen to the first track here!\n  We're adding a whole bunch of polish every step of the way. Improvements and additions like animated backgrounds, new sound effects, particle effects, play balancing, and more. We want to lavish as much love as we can on Russian Subway Dogs, adding all those little details that take a game from good to great! \n  We want Russian Subway Dogs to be enjoyed around the world so we'll be localizing it into as many languages as possible! \n  Want to play as a the Proletaricat? A goat? Cerberus the three headed hound of hell? Work together during the Kickstarter campaign to complete community backer missions and spread the word about Russian Subway Dogs. The more backer missions completed the more bonus characters we'll add to the game. \n            These community achievements are a fun way to stay involved after you back (or before!) and help us spread the word. The Proletaricat will be keeping track and updating the achievement board above throughout the campaign. Every time four achievements are completed she'll poll the community and you will get to pick which fantastical \"pup\" will be added to the game! \n Submit fan art, photos and videos to the Proletaricat by tweeting them at @spookysquid or spookysquidgames.tumblr.com or on the Russian Subway Dogs Facebook page at fb.com/russiansubwaydogs. We can only count submissions through those channels so be sure to send them our way!\nSpread this Proletaricat Propaganda on twitter: LINK\nSpread this Proletaricat Propaganda on tumblr: LINK\n  For our stretch goals we want to take our little pup hero outside the subway system for some historical and supernatural fun. These bonus levels take place between stations and break up the Proletaricat missions with new gameplay variants, enemies, and locations. \n    Just want the game? Back at this level and you\u2019ll get a Steam key for a digital copy of the game when it's finished. \nKeep in mind, you could back at the $25 level instead and start playing as soon as the Kickstarter ends!\n   For the music lovers!

The most recent addition to the team, artist Alina Sechkin, joined the company in 2015.\n   Pixel artist and game designer Miguel Sternberg is a veteran of Toronto\u2019s thriving indie game scene. In addition to co-founding Spooky Squid Games, he\u2019s a former co-founder of Capybara Games and The Hand Eye Society, a videogame arts and culture organization where he started Comics vs Games, a project encouraging collaboration between independent comic and game developers\nIn addition to co-creating They Bleed Pixels his game design credits include several smaller games including Night of the Cephalopods, Cephalopods Co-op Cottage Defence, Black Church Brigandage (with comic artist Andy Belanger) and The Night Balloonists (with programmer Andrij Pilkiw). \nA professional pixel artist for over a decade, his art has graced the back cover of Scott Pilgrim Gets it Together, the movie Crank and the web game Legends of Zork among others. \nBefore working in games he killed an old woman in Cube 2: Hypercube with time crystals, and animated reindeer mouths.\nAn alumni of Toronto's DMG program, Alina Sechkin's pixel art appears in Will O\u2019Neill's Actual Sunlight and Necrosoft's Playstation Vita game Oh, Deer! as well as at the DPAD2 game culture exhibition.

Of course the exact amount may change depending on what levels everyone backs at.\n4% [$2000] will go towards localization costs getting the game translated. \n63% [$31,500]  will go towards game production: art, code, sound and music. \n \n  Photo Credits\nTop illustration by Eric Kim with colours by Miguel Sternberg.\nPhotos of framed prints and I <3 They Bleed Pixels Collection by Paul Hillier Photography.  \nWe are grateful to the following photographers who have made their work available for use via Creative Commons licensing.

We will learn about how this festival came to be, and who keeps it alive in the face of many challenges. There we will also meet Chicago indies of all shapes and sizes, following some of them to the houses, offices and studios they call home. Bit Bash is the annual showcase for Chicago's indies, and will play a huge part in our entire series\nOur tour of Chicago will take us to many different places where we will meet many different types of people. All of whom make games. All of whom call \"The Indie City\" home.\nBit Bash\n\"Bit Bash might be the next great indie game festival.\" - Polygon\n\"It's an object lesson in how the experience and medium of gaming is constantly being reinterpreted and redefined, far away from the multimillion-dollar studio blockbusters that many reflexively think of as video games.\" - Chicago Reader\nYoung Horses (Octodad: Dadliest Catch)\n  \"The Young Horses were unofficially formed in March 2011 at the Game Developers Conference where they were nominated as a Student Showcase Winner for Octodad.

We also have a tentative distribution deal with a major digital media publisher. This is an outfit that loves what we're doing and wants to help share it. But we have to pay for the production ourselves, so we need your help!\n    Our budget for this series is simple, with layers.\nIt's going to cost us at least $32,200 to shoot and edit the four (and probably more) episodes. And that's not counting the money we've already spent. We wanted to get to Chicago in time for Bit Bash, even though this campaign couldn't be launched any sooner (long story). So I spent some of my own money and a little bit from outside investors on the principal shoot in Chicago. To finish the series and edit it, we need $32,000 more.\nHow did we get that number? It costs us approx. $1,000 per day in crew costs (I'm not getting paid) to shoot and edit a documentary. We're shooting this in five days and editing it in 20 (approx. 3 edit days per film\u2014not a lot). So $22,500 is our starting number.\nMusic will cost us $5,000. So now we're at $27,500.\nTravel will cost at least $4,700. So now we're at $32,200.\nSince things sometimes go wrong, we add in a contingency, bringing us to $38,640. \nAnd then we add in the fees Kickstarter charges, plus the costs to produce our rewards (estimated at $4,251) which brings us to $42,891.\nSo that's what we're asking for.\nAt $42,891 we will produce the full series with a crew of three; me and a videographer named Christian, and an audio guy named Austin. My videographer and audio will get paid, but I will not. And you will receive at least six episode of Stage of Development.\nSimple. Back us, we make the videos, you get to watch them. Done.\nIf you like this idea so much you think I also deserve to get paid for it (thank you), then if you unlock our first stretch goal that's what will happen.\nIf you like this idea so much you want more, unlocking our second stretch goal ensures we will produce at least two additional episodes. \nSimple, right? But layered. If we raise at least $42,891, we're making this series. Any more than that just helps us do it better.\nSome people look at video games and see a number: a score, or an amount of hours. Other people see pixels, triangles, colors. Still others see violence, fear.\nWhen I look at video games I see people. I see the people who made them. I see the people who marketed and packaged them. I see the person who had an idea one day about how to entertain or share an idea through a video game. And that makes me want to learn everything I can about those people, and share their stories with the world.\nYou can help me do that. By backing this project, you'll be supporting my documentary crew as we travel around the world to meet real game developers and learn about who they are, what drives them to make games, how they got started, and how they do what they do.\n    Filming with (clockwise, from left) Ian Horner, the Flying Saucer Crew, the Polygon crew.\nI've been a filmmaker for 30 years. \nI was a producer for TechTV's The Screen Savers. I was editor of The Escapist for six years, and during that time I won six Webby Awards. After that I helped co-found Polygon.com, where I produced the video series Human Angle.\nI even wrote a book about how video games are made, called \"How Video Games Are Made.\" \nI left Polygon in 2014 to work as an independent. Since then I've founded Flying Saucer Media, produced short documentaries for clients like Harmonix and Epic, and produced a short documentary about the charity Take This (which I also co-founded).\nI'm currently also shooting a feature-length documentary about Desert Bus for Hope.\n (Bit Bash photos by Andrew Ferguson.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs always, the biggest risks here are that planned participants will change their minds or get busy; or that something will break, we'll lose footage somehow, or otherwise need to spend money on something we hadn't expected to spend money on.\n\nThe first concern is mitigated by our traditional style of \"overshooting\". We always get more story than we need. Which often means we have to cut great stuff to meet targeted time limits. But that's actually great for this series, because it means we can tell the stories we find in as many episodes as we need. We will get the number of episodes we promised you, and probably more. \n\nThe second concern is mitigated by the \"contingency\" portion of our budget. I have managed productions of all kinds for over 20 years. Something would have to catastrophically fail in a bizarre and completely unforeseeable way for us to exceed both the primary budget and the contingency. And if something that weird and dire happens, we'll probably be too busy fighting off zombies or aliens to worry about it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Thank you!", "descp": "We will emblazon your name in the credits of every episode of the series, and in a special place of honor on our website.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2016"}], "stat": ["49 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "All of the films!

We estimate that it will take one year to complete the development of the game. If successfully funded, we aim to have the game completed, and all rewards fulfilled by November of 2017.\nAs with all of BUB's endeavors, this entire project exclusively involves the hard work, creativity, and talents of BUB, her Dude, and their friends. With your help, we believe we can create a truly unique and magical gaming experience.\nPlease read on to see what makes HELLO EARTH so special, and please consider helping us help BUB find the missing pieces to her space pod so that she can find her long lost friend Spooky...\n  Look, I'm going to be brutally honest with you... I can't do this alone. I need your help to find my space brother Spooky, and the only way to do that is to find the 8 missing pieces to my space pod. And the only way to do THAT is to make this elaborate video game. And the only way to do THAT is by successfully funding this project.\nYou're probably wondering how I got here and what this is all about. So before I get ahead of myself, let me give you a little backstory. \nAbout 6 years ago, I found Spooky as a helpless kitten in a whomblewomp tree on my home planet of Bub Ub Bub. That same night, he was plucked out of my bed by a large winged monstrosity. Without hesitation, I fired up my tricked out space pod and flew off into the great unknown to find Spooky, and bring him back home to cuddle again. \nBarely a lightyear into my adventure, I stumbled into danger when I found myself face-to-face with Pupilera, the Giant Space Eye. She's scarier than she sounds. But neither she, nor her infinite litter of Eyebabies were any match for my tricked out space pod, so I took her out, but the sheer force of her explosion hurtled me down to the planet below. And that's how I wound up on Earth.\nThere's no knowing how long I lay unconscious in the darkness. Then, suddenly, my eyes opened to find that I couldn't see a thing. As they adjusted, I found myself in a dark forest, my space pod nowhere to be seen. Helplessness and despair washed over me, but I did what any magical space cat would do - I engaged my third eye and followed my heart deep into the woods Before long, I came across the wreckage and noticed that my space pod was no longer tricked out. In fact, it was nothing more than a bare shell, missing all 8 Critical Pod Pieces: The Battery, Grappling Arm, Yogurt Cannon, Power Blaster, Tape Deck, Invisibility Cloak, Invincibility Drive, and most importantly, the Atmospheric Thruster, which is my ticket out of Earth's atmosphere.\nI knew that it was impossible for all 8 Pieces to just fall off (I installed them myself). Meaning someone or something must have taken them. So I pressed on. It wasn't long before I found myself face-to-face with with Rosco the Raccoon and his no-good fugitive family. \nSure enough, they had my stuff. \nWith nothing more than my bare tongue and laser-eyes, I was able to successfully retrieve my battery from the grip of Rosco's claws. But before I could say SQUONK, his rascally raccoon babies scurried away with the seven remaining Critical Pod Pieces, disappearing into the shadows of the forest.\nThe battery was all I needed to get my space pod fired up. Thankfully the navigation circuit was intact, the internet was working, and my space pod could take me to anywhere on Earth.\nAnd so here I am, sitting alone in my stripped down space pod in the middle of an unnamed forest, typing out this Kickstarter campaign on my ship's wi-fi, hoping that I can enlist the help of as many big-hearted humans as possible to fund this game so I can find the missing pieces, and go back into space to find my friend Spooky.  \nDon't believe my story? Well then check it out for yourself by downloading and playing the FREE DEMO. It's all there, it's all true, and I hope that once you see how badly I need your help, that you'll join me, and you'll get your friends to help out as well. We can do this together! We're coming Spooky!\nHello, it's me, BUB's dude. While BUB's story is mostly true, she left out a few important details in an effort to make it sound more impressive. The truth is that me and some gaming pals were out on a hike and stumbled across a strange critter (BUB) fumbling around with her weird little ship. After she told us her amazing and heartbreaking story, we decided to help her out by telling her about Kickstarter, and agreeing to do everything we could to help her find Spooky. Fortunately for BUB, we had the skills to make the video game she needed to find the pieces to her ship to leave the atmosphere to find Spooky, but we didn't have the funds or resources to get it done. So now we need your help to help us finish the story and get the game made. \nIn the meantime, you can experience first-hand BUB's adventures in the FREE DEMO of HELLO EARTH.\nExperience HELLO EARTH for yourself on your mobile device by downloading the free demo for Mac, Windows, iOs, or Android below:\nDownload for Apple HERE\nDownload for Android HERE\nDownload for Mac HERE\nDownload for Windows HERE\nPlease note that this demo is a work in progress! We've done everything we can to have something ready for you to play in time for the launch of this Kickstarter so that you can see how amazing the game will be if we get to finish it. The demo is still far from perfect: we are constantly working on it, improving it, and implementing fun and exciting features, challenges, and artwork. We'll be uploading regular updates during the campaign so you'll be able to see the game dramatically improve and expand through the process as we implement finer gameplay and functionality details that will ultimately make HELLO EARTH shine as bright as BUB's peepers.\nHELLO EARTH is a retro mobile game heavily influenced by the classics from the 80s and 90s, while implementing contemporary and unique concepts, gameplay, and design.\nThe game will alternate between two level types: a side-scrolling shooter level (controlling BUB's Space Pod) and classic platformer levels (controlling BUB herself). Each level has it's own set of controls and gameplay characteristics, so it's like having two games in one.\nWhile the demo is still a work in progress, we hope to have most, if not all of the gameplay features fully functioning before the Kickstarter is over. Here is a list of all of the features currently featured in the demo, plus ones you can expect in the final version, should this project get funded:\nBeautiful original graphics and animation\nParallaxing backgrounds\nUnique level design\nHuge variety of unique levels, bosses and enemies\nComplex gameplay and controls\nUnique storyline with twists and surprises\nItem Inventory: collect items to be used strategically throughout the game\nCompletely original 8-bit soundtrack\nTape Deck feature that allows you to select your favorite music from the game\nAbility to revisit and replay levels to further your progress and unlock achievements\nTruly innovative Easter Eggs throughout\nNot only do want to make an amazing game, we also want to make a difference.\nHi. It's me, BUB. I've done a lot of cool stuff in my life. From hosting my own talk show, to writing books, to making records, each of my projects has one important thing in common: benefitting Earth animals in need through awareness and fundraising. In the past 4+ years my dude and I have raised more than $400,000 for homeless pets, and even founded the first national fund for special needs pets, Lil BUB's Big FUND for the ASPCA. \nI place equal importance on charitable work as I do on creativity and engaging content. And for that reason, I am excited to announce that should we reach our funding goal, our team will make a personal contribution of $1 for every free download of the final version HELLO EARTH, up to $10,000, to Lil BUB's Big FUND for special needs pets.\nTo learn more about Lil BUB's Big FUND and the amazing work we've done, please visit http://www.lilbub.com/bigfund \nThe music in HELLO EARTH is one of many features that makes this game really stand out. If you've been following my adventures for a while, you are likely familiar with my debut album, \"Science & Magic\" which came out last year. And if you're familiar with the album, chances are you LOVE IT, because it's phenomenal. \nPart of the reason that album is so good is because I collaborated with my old friend Matt Tobey (my bubbysitter and \"Creative Vessel\"). And guess what? He's responsible for all of the original 8-bit music in HELLO EARTH as well! \nAs a hardcore video game fanatic and a musical wizard, he is able to compose video game music that can tug at your heartstrings or heighten the intensity of gameplay. Want to hear one of his hot jams while you continue to read? Here you go:\nOne of the unique features of the game is that you will be able to choose which songs you play along to by using the Tape Deck in my space pod for the shooter levels, or my Walkcat portable tape player for the platformer levels (this feature is not yet active in the demo, sorry!).\nAnd the very first stretch goal for this project is BUB's Extended Tape Library! If we reach this first stretch goal, Matt will compose an entire expanded collection of hidden bonus songs that can be discovered throughout the game in the form of cassette tapes. When you find a new tape, a new song will be added to your library.\nIn addition to creating the soundtrack to HELLO EARTH, Matt is also responsible for creating all of the 8 bit sound effects for the game. Every single laser, explosion, and squonk in the game has been exclusively created for this game by Matt in his bedroom.\n    In addition to helping the game get completed, there are many benefits to contributing to this campaign. As a backer of this Kickstarter project, you have the opportunity to get some truly amazing exclusive merchandise that can only be obtained here, as well as some pretty amazing experiences (like having me, BUB, over for dinner). Additionally, you will receive exclusive access to a version of the game that will only be available to Kickstarter backers, which will include all Stretch Goal Features for free (which would otherwise only be available as in-app purchases). Most importantly, you have the opportunity to dictate how amazing the game will be by helping us reach our stretch goals by providing input and ideas on our Developer Blog, and by inspiring us to make the best game possible.\nPlease read the different reward tiers carefully! There is A LOT of REALLY cool stuff, all of it exclusive to this Kickstarter, and lots of it is limited edition and will go fast. Rewards range from glow in the dark pins, to handmade pillows, to special versions of the game, to vinyl records of the game's soundtrack, to private hangouts with me, to playing the game as your own pet, to owning your own arcade version of HELLO EARTH!\nOne thing you can be sure of is that all of the merchandise we're offering in these rewards is of exceptionally fine quality. If you've ever shopped for BUB STUFF from my online store, you know that I don't believe in cheap, chintzy products. Almost everything we're offering is handmade right here in the USA by people that I know personally. It is of the finest quality, and it is made with love. You can rest assured that your items will be more amazing than you had imagined, and will be packed and shipped with care, as promised. \nPlease note that shipping to the continental US is included in each reward price, but there is an additional fee for international shipping. It's not that BUB doesn't love people everywhere, it's just that the cost of international shipping, especially on larger packages, is very expensive. Unfortunately the same goes for any reward tiers that involve travel and accommodations. If you are from another country and are interested in any of those reward tiers, please contact us to see how we can work something out!\nIf and when the Kickstarter campaign is fully funded, you will receive a backer's survey from us in which you will let us know what sizes, designs, etc you prefer for your rewards. Our goal is to fulfill most physical rewards in time the holidays this year, and expect them to ship in November or sooner. Some exceptions include: vinyl records (the music won't be done yet, and they take a long time to manufacture) and possibly some of the more exclusive rewards like the NES Cartridges and the Collector's Enamel Pin Set. \nIf you have any questions about the products, reward tiers, shipping, etc, please shoot us a message! You may also add any non-limited item to any pledge level. To do so, please carefully read the Add-Ons section below.\nAll physical and digital rewards are slated to ship once the game has completed, which will be in the fall of 2017. If possible, we will attempt to ship some physical rewards sooner than that, but we can't make any promises at this time.\n            (No physical rewards, but you can Add-On any non limited edition items!)\n                                        While we have done the best that we can to create a reward tier just for you, we realize that there's a good chance that you may want some very, very specific things. The Add-On feature allows you to add any non-limited edition item to any reward tier.\nThe way it works is relatively simple: select your reward level, add an additional contribution equal to the total of the items you'd like to add from the list below, and then send us a message here on Kickstarter specifying exactly which items you'd like to add.\nFor example, let's say that you want to get all three HELLO EARTH T-Shirts, but don't want everything in the Intergalactic BUB CLUB Membership ($250). In this case what you'd do is select the Exclusive BUB Tee Membership for $50, and then add another $40 to your pledge for the two additional shirts ($20/each). After you make the contribution you would just send us a message that says \"Hello BUB! I added another $40 to my contribution for 2 more t-shirts. Thanks!\" \nAnd then we would respond with something like this: \"Thanks for your support, Dr. Seuss! Your order is noted. If and when the project is funded, we'll send you a Project Survey in which you will provide us with your shipping address, and shirt size/design preferences.\"\nIf you're only interested in getting the cool physical items, you can support us at the $5 \"HELLO EARTH Supporter\" level, and then simply add-on the items you want from the list below.\nMake sense? I hope so!\nHere is a list of available Add-Ons, and their associated costs. Prices include shipping.\nSigned Picture Disc LP: $50 \nCollector's NES Cartridge with box and manual: $65 \nHELLO EARTH YOGA PANTS: $75 \nUltimate Collector's Enamel Pin Set: $150 \nTwo Tickets to the VIP Party at Logan Hardware in Chicago: $200\nBUB CLUB Embroidered Patch ($5)\nHELLO EARTH PDF Instruction Manual ($5)\nHELLO EARTH Soundtrack - Digital Download ($8)\nSparkling Glow-In-The-Dark Numbered Space Pod Pin ($12)\nExclusive BUB T-Shirt ($20)\nNEW! HELLO EARTH Socks (two different pairs, $25)\nHELLO EARTH Soundtrack - Color Vinyl and Download ($25)\nHandmade Large Double-Sided 3D Pillow ($40)\nWe may add more items and rewards as the Kickstarter progresses (socks? yoga pants? blankets?) so please check back for more STUFF.\nNaturally we need to take this one step at a time, but we've really got some cool stuff lined up in case we exceed our funding goal. While we've set our funding goal as a bare minimum to create a free, mind-blowing, ad-free mobile game, we also have a lot (A LOT) of really amazing bonus features that we're dying to add to the game. But as you can imagine, creating and incorporating them will require more time, money and resources, so we've added stretch goals to help us make them a reality.\nPlease note that any new stretch goal features that get funded will be FREE to all $15+ backers of the project, but will be only available as in-app purchases to anyone that downloads the game otherwise. So the more the Kickstarter community can raise, the more awesome free features you get.\nRead on below to see what we've got cooking.\n JUST ADDED 7/13:\nWe've moved the Desktop Version of the game up to the first stretch goal at $110,000. We understand that a lot of folks don't want to play this game on a phone, so if we reach this goal, everyone will be able to play it on their PC or Mac, and it will be totally free for all!\nThe very first stretch goal we've got lined up is BUB's Expanded Tape Collection. If we are able to reach our first stretch goal of $115,000, Matt Tobey will create a greatly expanded catalogue of original 8-bit music for the game, which can be obtained song by song by finding hidden cassette tapes throughout the game! Each new song that you find will be added to BUB's Tape Library, and can be selected during gameplay. You can expect some truly awesome jams, including 8-bit versions of songs from BUB's album \"Science & Magic\" and maybe even some 8 bit versions of your favorite hits.\n If we reach $120,000, we'll create a complete desktop PC version of the game AND Gamepad support for phones!\nThe second stretch goal we're hoping to reach is a pretty unique and exciting feature. Did you notice while playing the Forest Platformer Level in the demo that the level gradually turned from night to day? Pretty cool right?! Well the Internal Clock Time Sync feature will allow the game to sync to the clock on your mobile device, so that the look of the level will follow your actual time! So if you play at night, the game takes place at night. If you play at dawn, the game takes place at dawn. If you play through the night into the morning, the game will gradually transition from night to day. And as cool as that is, that barely touches on the incredible possibilities made possible with this feature. You will battle different creatures and enemies depending on what time of day you're playing (coyotes and moths at night, mosquitos and birds during the day), and there will be Easter Eggs planted throughout as well. For example, if you come back to the Circus entrance on level 5 at midnight, you can go up into space in a hot air balloon! The Time Sync feature is literally a game changer. Pun intended. \nIf we can make it $140,000, we'll port the game to WiiU. Let's make this happen! \n  Meet TEAM BUB! They are all really great guys, they are all my friends, and with your help, they are the ones that will make this game a reality. Check out their 8-bit bios below.\n  You might be wondering where all of this money would go, and rightly so. Below you will find a breakdown of how the funds will be allocated for the project. \nIt's important to understand that we are offering really well-made, high quality products in each of our reward tiers, and that the cost of manufacturing, packing, and shipping these items is quite expensive.\n(This outlines how our initial $100,000 goal will be distributed)\n  www.TheYetee.com\n  What makes Kickstarter so perfect for a project like this is not simply its ability to raise the money needed to get it done, but  its ability to build an enthusiastic and engaged community that plays a critical role in the final outcome of the project. This is not just my project, or the project of my dude and his friends. It's OUR project. And the more people that join our community and support the game, the more incredible the game becomes, and the more connected we all become. It's a win/win/win situation folks. Let's do this. \nGOOD JOB KICKSTARTER. \u2665", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHey, it's me, BUB's dude. As BUB's facilitator and champion, it's my duty to have to deal with challenges. If anybody knows what it's like to have to deal with unexpected risks and challenges, it's me. \n\nWhile we feel very confident that we will be able to complete the game within a year, we are also aware that it is a very time consuming process with any number of unexpected obstacles (we know this first-hand because we have spent the past few months working on the demo). With all of the stretch goals we hope to get funded comes the additional work of getting those stretch goals fulfilled. We have estimated the time and work that will go into fulfilling those goals to the best of our ability, but we also know that we can't always predict exactly how long it will take, or how difficult it will be to implement, or what kind of inevitable and unexpected obstacles might come up along the way.\n\nWith that said, we have an extraordinarily talented and hard-working team with years of experience, many resources, and the unflinching desire to always to our very best. We are prepared to hire on additional artists and programmers to help keep us on schedule to deliver our promise in a timely fashion.\n\nSome other potential setbacks, risks, and challenges could come up in the manufacturing and fulfillment of the physical items for each reward tier in the event that our project is wildly more successful than we were expecting. That's certainly a good problem to have, and with my experience in running and growing BUB's online store for the past four years, I feel very confident that we will easily be able to accommodate any number of pledges in the amount of time outlined in our campaign. We are very fortunate to have The Yetee handling our fulfillment for us, and they are not only a great bunch of folks, but they have tons of experience fulfilling large campaigns and gift boxes like Humble Bundle.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "HELLO EARTH Enthusiast", "descp": "Help BUB and her team reach their goal to make the most amazing mobile video game on the planet.\nINCLUDES:\nDownload of HELLO EARTH! when it's completed\nDemo and Campaign Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["309 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "BUB CLUB Supporter", "descp": "Become an Official BUB CLUB Member!

It has been used to make games like Hyper Light Drifter, Hotline Miami, Risk of Rain, Gunpoint, Undertale, and many, many more.\nAbout Me\nI love teaching people how to make games. I'm a top instructor on Udemy with over 20k students happily learning to make their own games and over 2100 perfect 5 star reviews.\nMy Udemy courses can be found here.\nReviews\nThe Course\nI\u2019m creating a new step-by-step video course about making a turn-based RPG using GameMaker Studio.\nCourse Benefits\nSave time by starting with everything you need\nHave fun as you make this beautiful, turn-based RPG\nBe confident as you master advanced GameMaker techniques\nFeatures\nAfter finishing this video course you will be able to:\n\nDesign tiled overworlds\nProgram a character that can easily navigate the overworld\nIncorporate complex in-game cutscenes with multi-page dialog boxes\nCreate beautiful room transitions\nControl turn-based battle mechanics\nManage character progression with level-up system\nAnd much more\nWho is this Course for?\nThe ideal student for this course is someone who has used GameMaker before but wants to learn more advanced techniques. This course is not for absolute beginners to GameMaker. If you haven\u2019t used GameMaker before, then check out my other courses first. This course is not easy. It will take a significant amount of work but it will also be fun.\n\nKickstarter?\nWhy am I here on Kickstarter when I have already created 3 successful courses without it?\n\nThis course is quite a bit larger in scope than my other courses. To help with the larger scope I\u2019ve hired Toby Dixon as a contract pixel artist. As you can see from the screenshots, his art is amazing! I\u2019ve been paying him using my business savings but I\u2019m running low. I will be using the funds donated via Kickstarter to continue paying Toby as he creates the different worlds and animates the many monsters.\n\nAlso, a Kickstarter allows me to create a more flexible pricing structure before the course is placed on Udemy (see pledge tiers).\n\n\nThanks\nThank you so much for your interest in my course!

Pledges Still Open Via PayPal!\nMiss out on the Kickstarter and still want to pledge? Head on over to our website and pledge via PayPal!\nFabular in the press and social media:\nWe're over 100% FUNDED! Stretch goals:\nWe've been Greenlit!\nCheck out our content updates that broaden the game universe:\nOriginal campaign follows: \nWebsite | Twitter | Facebook | Tumblr | IndieDB | Youtube\nFabular: Once upon a Spacetime is a 2D Action-RPG in Space with Roguelike influences, set in a medieval, folktale-inspired fantasy universe.\nAs a young knight, go on an adventure in a surreal, storybook-like galaxy in your trusty spaceship. You need to be skillful in battle, upgrade and manage your ship well, and make the right choices during encounters. Only then will you be able to defeat the dreadful League of Black Knights who terrorize the realm.\nFabular aims to combine the tactical depth of classic action-RPGs with the procedural generation and text-based events of modern rogue-likes, meanwhile immersing players in a never-before-seen universe of surreal retro-futurism.\nIn this artistic mashup of the Middle Ages, folktales and outer space, you take on a hero's journey as the King's youngest child. You explore the furthest corners of the Galaxy in your trusty spacecraft and engage other space-faring knights and creatures in battle using a unique, techno-fantasy themed skillset.\nFeatures\nTop-down, physics-based action combat with stylish real-time-lit pixel art visuals and smooth animation\nAn artistic vision of the Middle Ages infused with futuristic elements, as medieval knights clash in armoured spaceships\nDeep and atmospheric universe with dozens of procedurally generated out-of-this-world locations on an ever-changing starmap\nHundreds of randomly generated text based events featuring colorful characters, locations and items inspired by classical tales such as Seven-League Boots, Table-Be-Set, or the Puss in Boots\nMultiple playable ship types, upgrades, skills, items, loot and lots of unlockables providing plenty of replayability\nExplore a procedurally generated universe of hidden secrets and grave dangers by traveling on a node-based galactic starmap, where each place you visit yields a new special event or encounter. Decision making in these text-based illustrated events is key to your success in the game.\nPlan your exploration well and be mindful of your choices, because resources and friends are scarce in Fabular's deep space, and they can make or break your adventure. The adventure and exploration part of the game is influenced by modern day Rogue-like games such as FTL: Faster than Light and Hand of Fate.\nThe meat of the game is the battle phase, in which you have to control your spacecraft directly from a top-down view, and use the skills and equipment of your spaceship to overcome the enemy. Our aim with the combat system is to make it deep and challenging with large 'build' variety allowing both action and tactics lovers to equally enjoy the game.\nChoose your ship type, upgrade it towards your way of playing and equip the items that work best for you \u2013 then use your skills and wits to defeat the enemy. The battle portion of the game tries to capture and build upon the combat system in a timeless classic: the Star Control series.\nThe outcome of battles depend largely on the condition and equipment of your ship. There is only so far your action skills can take you, if you are not equipped for the situation, you will likely perish. After each battle you get some form of loot, (currency, resources or items) which you can use to upgrade your ship, buy and sell resources at shops you come by and equip different items.\nDifferent item and upgrade combinations work well for different purposes, and as you get more game-time under your belt, you will start to notice the combinations that work best for you. The management portion of the game draws inspiration from such classic Action-RPGs as Diablo 2 and Path of Exile.\nThe very first thing you do when you embark on your adventure is choose a spaceship from the Royal stock. Ship types in Fabular are similar to character classes in a traditional fantasy RPG. We have the archetype of the strong warrior, the agile thief and the intelligent mage translated into spaceships of medieval design. Upon starting a new game, the following three ship classes are available for the player to choose from, but after sinking some time into the game, additional ships may become unlockable:\nA Knight-class spacecraft and a Mercenary Captain NPC (illustration by Tom McDowell)\nThe Knight class focuses on Power, which makes the ship heavier than usual and provides greater armour and more damage with melee weapons. Due to the lack of capacity regeneration the Knight does best in the thick of the action with basic melee attacks, a shield and mostly passive skills. This is augmented by the fact that the Knight class ships can equip the biggest variety of melee weapon types.\n\nIf you like a slower paced game with a tanky main character and you don't like to use a ton of active abilities, then the Knight will serve you just perfect.\nThe Assassin-class spacecraft and the notorious headhunter: Masquerade\nThe assassin class feeds off the speed stat which allows this fighter to be extremely mobile with lightning fast attacks and skill cooldowns. It is able to wield the fastest attacking melee weapon type; daggers and can be upgraded to be a devastating long-range fighter as well. The assassins usually have a few tricks up their sleeves, such as self-concealment and incapacitation of enemy units.\nIf you love fast action, big damage numbers and to live on the edge, then take the Assassin out for a spin. Guaranteed to keep you entertained.\nA typical alchemist character and his vessel\n The Alchemist ship class is like a techno-mage; it stuns, electrocutes, burns and releases automatons to do its master\u2019s bidding like there's no tomorrow. With the biggest number of available active skill slots, it's arsenal is frightening. Increasing the Power stat allows the Alchemist to be more effective with skills and to quickly regain capacity that is spent on executing them. Getting hit in melee is not it's forte tho...\nChoose the Alchemist if you are a true tactician and you love to use many skills at once and abuse the synergies they provide. Play it like a piano\u2026\nThe Starmap\nThe Starmap is the strategic and exploration layer of the game. You jump from node to node consuming fuel in the process, which is a crucial resource and acts like food in a traditional Rogue-like game. Upon arriving at a new node, a text-based random event occurs in true FTL fashion. There it is decided if it boils down to the action combat phase, or if there is a solution without a fight.\nYour goal on the Starmap is to find and defeat the Black Knight of each Realm and liberate it from oppression. You rarely know what dangers await at an unexplored node, but the little baroque sea map-like illustrations help to indicate possible danger or a point of interest in the vicinity.\nWhere do we go now? - the Starmap\nRandom events\nIn Fabular, you can visit lots of interesting locations and have dialogue with a colorful cast of characters via the illustrated random events. Occurring on the Starmap and during battles as well, these encounters serve to open up new dimensions in the game\u2019s storyline. You can land on planets, visit a tavern, haggle with a shopkeeper and get advice from a hermit, all with the power of text, illustration and your imagination.\nAs you get more experienced with the game you learn the possible outcome of some of these encounters and you can use this knowledge as a strategic advantage in each of your runs. We plan to update the game regularly with new events after the release to keep it fresh.\n  A text-based random event \u2013 meeting the Lost Count\nAction Battles\nA hero\u2019s journey is inevitably hindered by conflicts and challenges. In Fabular, you resolve these mostly by the steel-on-steel method but there is a lot more to our battle system than that. The most influential thing that shapes your repertoire in combat is your ship selection, but the items you equip and your upgrades also play a huge part.\nCombat is mostly based on the timing of melee attacks, movement and blocking. Ranged and other special skills require different kinds of resources to be spent, so you will use them sparingly and with a tactical purpose. After you spend some time in the game and upgrade your ship and get better equipment, the frequency in which you use special skills may notably be increased.\nThe exact conditions awaiting you on the battlefield are shaped by your choices in the preceding text-based events, the general location of the jump-point your at, and the current difficulty level of the game. In the end you may succeed in battles by being skillful with neat reflexes, by being strategic with a deep understanding of game mechanics or by a mixture of both.\nAction battle montage\n  Items and equipment\nItems - together with the upgrade system - play a big part in defining your own \u2018build\u2019 in a given run. Each item you equip on your ship may give you passive bonuses, and also active skills that can be used on the battlefield. The number of equipable items are limited, so you have to find the right combination of passive and active items with the matching upgrades.\nBig part of the loot system are the so-called Fabular objects. These are our twist on classical folktale items such as Seven League Boots or Cat in the Sack. Each of these special objects are inspired by folk- and fairy tales, and they have several different uses in the game. You can equip them and gain unique skills or passives that dramatically alter your playstyle, you can consume them for a one-time greater effect, and you can even talk to some of the spirits living within them. Some Fabulars may even have an effect by simply having them in the ship\u2019s cargo hold...\nBrowsing through items on the inventory screen\nAs you progress in the game, you may gradually unlock the possibility of newer item types to drop for you when you gain loot, so over time your chances may improve to defeat the game.\nUpgrades\nEach ship class has their own upgrade tree where you can spend your hard earned currency (Stardust) to enhance, modify or unlock new ship functions. Most of the time these upgrades add new game mechanics or enhance existing ones, but they can provide passive stat increases as well.  \nChoosing what upgrade is best for your playstyle, finding out what works best with your current gear and skill setup, and deciding when to upgrade is crucial if you want to counterbalance the ever-growing number and difficulty of enemies during a run. Stardust is also used for buying and selling resources and items in shops, so you have to think twice before spending it on upgrades.\nActivating an upgrade\nEnvironment types\nEach Realm on the starmap has a \u2018biome\u2019 associated with it that determines the environment type for the majority of action battles that happen in that area. We plan to have around 15 of these unique environments, and 6 of them have already been implemented in the game prototype.\nThere will also be unique environment types for certain special events such as boss fights, and universal ones that can occur in more than one biome. Our vision for these space environments is to take familiar earth-like vistas and realize them in outer space in a fabulistic and painterly manner.\nEnvironmental variety\nForeground objects with realtime-lit pixelart\nMap hazards\nDepending on the current difficulty level and the Realm the player is in, there is always a chance that an encounter will contain a number of environmental hazards. The harder the difficulty, the more hazards can \u2018roll\u2019 on a given scene. These dangerous occurrences make life more miserable for all participants of the battle, and players have to be ready to counter them with clever playstyle or by equipping the right items.\nInfestation hazard - concept art\nInfestation: asteroids have a chance to contain an Asteroid Wurm that preys on nearby ships by unexpectedly bursting forward from beneath the surface  \nIon mist: clouds populate the top layer of the playing field covering your vision\nMeteor storm: small pebbles rain constantly dealing damage over time to everyone on the playing field  \nSolar breeze: constant wind-like gravity field pushing you from a set direction making navigation more difficult\nJet streams: small, curvy river-like wind tunnels manifesting at random locations that pull ships along their path\nVortex: enormous gravity field that constantly pulls everyone towards the middle of the playing field\nGeomagnetic storm: electromagnetic clouds form all over the field that confuse the controls of ships entering them\nIce storm: icy clouds form all over the field that slow down every ship inside them \nSolar flares: fiery flares burn through the playing field at random locations, you have to be clear of the hotspots in time\nDust Devils: small but strong whirlwinds travel around the map in an unpredictable fashion pushing ships around\nSeismic activity: normal asteroids have a chance to turn into volcanic ones that erupt and emit burning lava at regular intervals or explode into fiery bits when touched\nCommon Enemies\nYou\u2019ll meet a wide range of enemies during your journey through Fabular\u2019s Realms. Some are small, some are large, spaceships, monsters or even buildings will stand in your way. Common enemies tend to be small and medium sized and they have a limited skillset and functionality. But if you are not on your toes and don\u2019t study their behaviour they can be as deadly as a mini-boss.\nLancer - melee attacker with a long reach and a stunning charge\n\nArcher - elusive and lethal from long range\nSlicer - a vicious sawblade wanting to slice you up into a million pieces\nA few more examples of enemies in a concept state\nMini-bosses\nBoss fights usually require a completely different approach than normal enemies. Not only they are bigger and stronger opponents, but they need strategy, your full concentration and a lot of patience to figure out how they behave. They have complex movement and attack patterns and they may consist of bigger parts that can be destroyed individually, so you have to be really vigilant to defeat them.\nKroink - Marauder Warchief\nThe Warchief of the Umbra Clan, Kroink likes to be carried around so that he can enjoy the calibre of his plasma repeater while speeding in a frenzy. Two Slicers serve as his horses while he holds the reins in his fortified turret dispensing some mad Marauder justice.\n\nThe Warchief's chariot in action\nKroink, Marauder Warchief - concept\nDeep Space Fortress\nLegends say that the entrance to the 7th Realm is guarded by a giant Deep Space Fortress of once Royal origin. Who\u2019s operating it is unclear, and this colossal yet beautiful castle of destruction may hold additional surprises.\nDeep Space Fortress in action\nDeep Space fortress - concept art\n  The Black Knights\nThe Dreadful League of Black Knights consists of former Tournament winners who got so cocky with themselves that they thought they stood above everyone else. They sought out dark magicks to become even stronger but it has corrupted their souls and constantly drains their life force ever since. Now they are only alive by stealing energy from the Realms and usurping their inhabitants.\nThe Black Knights are the main bosses in the game. Each Realm contains one Knight that holds it in terror. You have to defeat all seven of them and free the Realms to find the Sun stolen from your Kingdom.\nThe Senator (Black Knight) and his Knight-class vessel\nThe Teuthon (Black Knight) and his Assassin-class vessel\n\nThe Scholar (Black Knight), his vessel and his ring of Acolytes\n  Once upon a Spacetime there was a kingdom ruled by an honest King in peace for a long long time. One day the dreadful League of Black Knights \u2013 who terrorize the realm as if they were a Seven-Headed Dragon \u2013 decided to steal and cage the Sun itself. And so the World was shrouded in darkness.\n\nThe King sent his army, his most loyal men and even his two older sons to reclaim the Sun, but none of them returned ever since. It is now down to his youngest to go across seven mythical Realms, defeat each Black Knight and restore equilibrium to the Kingdom.\nThe following tracks are the result of a more-than-a-year-long collaboration between us and talented composer Joe Domozi (planet4), who is a prominent underground figure of electronic music in Budapest.\n\nThe story and visual direction of Fabular combine interesting, almost contradictory themes together, such as the Middle Ages with futurism and fables with dark fantasy. We felt that by mixing medieval instruments with Joe\u2019s deep, richly detailed and glitchy compositions, we get a music style that fits this mashup perfectly.\nIn the following playlist you can listen to 3 tracks from the original soundtrack for the game. First the main theme, then a battle music for the Evermisty Forest environment combined with its ambient track, and lastly the game over tune.\n\n\nWe are Spiritus Games, an independent studio consisting of industry-veteran game developers with almost 15 years of experience developing various AAA titles including The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, Deathtrap and the Codename: Panzers series.\nWe are a passionate three-man team wanting to make something memorable with everything we've got. We believe in artistic intent, creating original content and having high standards. The three of us have been colleagues and friends for more than 10 years now and we\u2019ve always loved working with each other. We feel that this relationship and the creative freedom we gain by having our own company could lead to something special.\nThe Spiritus Games Team\nMilan Batowski (@Fabulargame) is a multi-talented designer who\u2019s created the original idea behind the game and he makes sure it comes to life in the best possible quality. His job description involves game design, pushing pixels, making effects and animation, balancing, scripting, writing, begging and probably selling his soul to the Devil. Whatever it takes...\n\nPeter Meszlenyi (portfolio) is a creator and builder of imaginary worlds. He also draws what he envisions on paper in meticulous detail, and as a result his universes start to take shape concept by concept. He is an artist with great academic knowledge and has a great desire to convey artistic intent in every one of his works. He has a special affection for historic architecture, the culture of chivalry and martial arts.\n\nZed Milner, a.k.a. Secretman. His identity and whereabouts are highly classified. All we can reveal is that he\u2019s a high profile code-assassin who\u2019s been operating in the videogames profession for more than 20 years now. His pragmatic approach and wide range of coding skills are augmented by a strong affinity towards game design, making him an ideal asset for an indie team.\nFreelance contributors\nJoe Domozi (soundcloud.com/planet4) is a prominent figure of the underground music scene in Budapest. His contemporary glitchy, textured sounds and dark vibes create a unique experience that is almost infinitely replayable without getting old. He is a good friend of ours and is very dedicated to Fabular\u2019s cause.\nWe have a tremendous drive to make this game happen. Over the last couple of years, this project has become the single most important thing in our lives (our combined four kids and three wives would grudgingly admit). We've worked on dozens of different projects before, but when you work for someone else, the fate of the game you\u2019re making is not in your hands. But this time it\u2019s different, and that\u2019s where you come into the picture, dear audience.\n\nBy trusting us with your funds you allow us to concentrate the whole of our creative energies and all of our time on this project so it can happen as soon as possible and with no compromises in quality. No more side-jobs, 100% Fabular.\nWorld building in progress\nWe need a little more than a year to finish this project with our current manpower and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve calculated our budget. Two team members live in Budapest which allows for reduced living costs and salaries on their part. Music and sound is very important for us, and it\u2019s something we\u2019d like to outsource to a contractor. We feel we can write the story and events in a high enough quality ourselves, but if we happen to exceed our funding goal then we'll definitely hire a professional writer as well. This would speed up the development process while also making the end-result better.\n\nBudget allocation\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLet\u2019s get this right out of the way: this project is quite ambitious, especially for a team of three. But we definitely feel we are up for the challenge. All of us have over a decade of experience making various sizes of games in a professional environment and have worked together for many years on a number of projects as team leads in our respective fields (design, art and code).\n\nIn the last two years we\u2019ve been working in our free time to establish the background universe for the game, which we feel is integral to its success. The basic characteristics are set in stone, so we can create new content such as locations, characters and stories very fast because we have guidelines to refer to. Very few question marks remain regarding world design and more than 150 pages of pen&paper concept art will attest to that.\n\nParallel to the universe building, we\u2019ve been busy creating a gameplay prototype as well to test the action battle phase of the game and the intended visual direction. This also helped us tremendously, because we\u2019ve been able to see with our own eyes what works and what doesn\u2019t. We are now confident that our game mechanics work very well and they provide for an entertaining and deeply layered game loop. Just as in the case of the universe, we have our solid guidelines regarding gameplay, and all that\u2019s left is to build content for it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Steam Page live, please wishlist Fabular!", "update_content": "Good news everyone, Fabular\u2019s official Steam Store page is now live here:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/645720/Fabular_Once_upon_a_Spacetime/\nWishlist us on Steam and help spread the word!\nWishlisting helps a lot with discoverability in the store so we\u2019d like to ask all of you to go ahead and on Steam.

Their next game, \"Steambirds\" could be the breakout they need. \nEpisode 02: FAMILY BUSINESS. John Romero created \"Doom\". Brenda Romero has worked for decades as a game developer. Now they're working with young Donovan on \"Gunman Taco Truck\" and helping others learn the joy of game making. This is the story of the Romero's \"Family Business\".\nAdditional episodes will include the stories of:\n  And if we're funded to our second stretch goal (way less than twice our original goal), we'll be able to make six more episodes \u2014 and you can help decide whose stories we tell next!\nSTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT is the next major webseries from my company, Flying Saucer Media. I've worked for 25 years in media production. I was the head writer and producer of TechTV's \"The Screen Savers\"; editor-in-chief of the six-time Webby Award winning escapistmagazine.com; co-founder of Polygon.com; and creator Polygon's \"Human Angle\" webseries, short documentaries about people in video games.\nSTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT is picking up where Human Angle left off, with an entirely new 6-episode series chronicling the real human stories of video games. And to ensure that no one can pull the plug, call the shots or change the course, I'm asking for your help to fund this series.\nProduction of STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT has already begun. I've spent my own money shooting the first two episodes of this series. And pre-production has begun on several additional episodes. \nSTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT will be six episodes. We're asking for your help to raise $192,105. That's a very precise figure, and one we're confident in. We're experienced video professionals with over 25 years experience making high-quality video. We know how much it costs, how hidden costs can stack up, and how to avoid surprises up-front. We've provided a detailed breakdown of why we're asking for what we're asking below. I think after reading and hearing more about what we're trying to accomplish you'll agree we're aiming for a reasonable goal.\nEach 7-10 minute episode of STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT tells a new story about an interesting, exceptional or revolutionary personality in the video game community. What is it like to be an indie developer working with a dozen other people around the world? What kind of child grows up raised by some of the most famous game developers in the world? How do you make a game better than your first game, when your first game was one of the best reviewed games out there? And what kind of person has millions of fans just for making videos on YouTube? STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT will answer all of these questions and more.\nThe first episode will publish the same day this Kickstarter closes, whether or not the series is funded. New episodes will then follow every month.\nAt Flying Saucer Media, we run very small crews. For STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, we'll be working with freelance contributors for almost every shoot, but the core team will be:\nProducing six, separate short documentary films covering subjects all over the world is no easy task. I know. I've done it before. I know exactly how much that will cost, how long it will take and (most importantly) how to do it right.\nI'm asking for a lot of money. I'm asking for a lot of trust. I hope you agree that telling these amazing stories is worth a little of both.\nCrew fees and travel are the biggest expenses. The second biggest expense is backer rewards, that's the stuff we're making and shipping to you for backing this project. I'm borrowing Robert Khoo's excellent analysis of how much that sort of thing costs. I also borrowed Robert's math on how much Kickstarter and credit card companies will charge me for the privilege of taking your money. It's a lot! \nStage of Development is going to cost us $138,650 to produce (rounded to the nearest dollar). That includes crew fees, travel, contingency (in case something breaks) and fees for music composition and licensing.\nAdding in the cost to produce the awesome backer rewards ($38,406.05) and the amount Kickstarter will charge to raise the remaining sum ($15,049.76) we get to $192,105.\nOr put another way:\nThe portion of this chart that looks like Pac-Man is how much we need in order to produce Stage of Development.\nThe rest is how much we need to spend in order to raise the amount we need to produce Stage of Development.\nThe first episode of Stage of Development will be available to backers as a digital download the same day this Kickstarter closes. No excuses.\nEpisode 1: September 16 (The day this Kickstarter closes)\nEpisodes 2-6: One per month, every month. \nThat's not bluster. The episode been shot and is currently in the final stages of post-production.\nWe are planning to publish additional episodes every 3-4 weeks. Right now we have all of the six episodes booked and scheduled for production and post-production.\nFancy pledge chart.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only serious risk is that someone's schedule might change, forcing us to adjust our production schedule, possibly costing us more or affecting the amount of time it will take to finish an episode.\n\nThis is the sort of thing where experience leads to a much lower risk. I've done this before. I've run into these issues. And I know how to work around them and plan a schedule and a budget keeping in mind that things may change.\n\nRealistically, there's a 100% chance that something will happen differently than we've planned it. But there's a statistically zero chance that a disruption will be so severe that it will impact our schedule or budget so severely that we can't adjust. \n\nI don't want to say \"never\" but I've been managing schedules and budgets for decades. Both \"Press Reset\" and \"Human Angle\" came in on time and under budget. As has every production I've ever been a part of. If STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT were to run over budget or take longer than I expected, it would be the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Russ Pitts\n2 created \u00b7 28 backed\nRuss Pitts is a veteran producer with experience in almost every entertainment medium.

Here, even the land is in conspiracy against you. To succeed they'll have to play a careful game or they'll be the next card to enter their opponent's hand.\n -This painting titled Paper Dolls is based on Where They Cremate the Roadkill. The original is available to one backer as a reward.-\nWhere They Cremate the Roadkill is treelike open world that branches gradually as the player progresses. Every decision carries with it a karmic pattern. A decision made in the early game shapes the later game in a butterfly effect... \n\nOvertime, the game spans three characters helplessly threaded together by a common crisis. Each segment is illustrated in a style exclusive to a character's perspective.  A choice made in the world of one character may echo back and influence the world of another character. \n\nOn the surface Where They Cremate the Roadkill plays fundamentally like an RPG that utilizes real-time action elements. Combat is, however, illegal and engaging in it carelessly may get you arrested, hunted or killed. Police may barricade save points and your home could be invaded by half-monster swat teams. Beating a fiend could bring their family to your door for revenge. Any of the few hundred characters can be destroyed any time. Therefore, timing is everything. \n\nSpells are acquired by assimilating others, rummaging through waste or pilfering the pockets of the slain. A few of these can be used in the typical fashion, most have other applications. Conjure schools of fish out of solid ground. Summon cats into the house of a person with allergies to defeat them. Turn bovines into burger meat with a flick of the wrist. Bring to life an army of inanimate objects. Create havoc by casting love spells on train commuters and turn someone's pet dog inside out.\nThe order in which you select targets determines which attacks you receive first. It's imperative the player chooses selectively to benefit from the maximum advantage.\n\nShould you not use a spell it atrophies and until you forget it altogether. Memory is a factor here. 'Use it or lose it' as the saying goes. \nSome fun additional details can be gleaned from this interview published by writer Chris Priestman.\n\nFeatures:\n- Hall of abberant primitive organisms.\n- Every NPC is a unique individual with their own look and behavior.\nOver 300 in all.\n- Detailed animated environments.\n- 3 worlds in a varied style.\n- Original Soundtrack of more than fifty songs.\n- A cinematic story told in hand-drawn motion frames and frequent animated interludes.\n- An open world that progresses based on your choices.\n- Spells that allow the player to transform enemies into flies and squash them or into livestock that they barn in their apartment.\n- Two years plus of dedicated development time.\n- Huge screen-size bosses\n- Hours of play.\n- Alien weather patterns that influence who's out and about.\n- A world without filler.

(\u25d5\u203f-)\n \nQ. What operating systems will this game play on?\n\nA. Both Windows and Mac. Woof.\n\nQ. Can you tell me what'll be included in the 'instructional art book'?\n\nA. Character bios, a bestiary and botanical, surprises,  tips and hints, developer journal, list of contributors, concept drawings, a map of the world and a mythic history of its origin.\n\nQ. What was the outcome of the Moments of Silence Kickstarter?\n\nA. Moments of Silence was successfully funded 2012 and was released on-time under the title Gingiva in 2013.\n\nQ. Will this game relate to Middens or Gingiva?\n\nA. This story takes place within its own continuity. That said, although there is no overt relation there is overlap along the fringe. \n\nQ. Tell me about the music.\nA. Composed of bi-neural-like beats the score resembles a field recording of an alien planet with hints of cartoon acapella. It sounds a little like shards of celestial crystals singing cybernetically in an interstellar amphitheater or the image-to-audio of yantric diagrams. \nThe trailer is accompanied by tracks derived from the soundtrack. \n\nQ. How will the credits sequence be run?\n\nA. Every backer is credited and all names will be animated in an intricate display. Those backers who were rewarded a creature based on their person will have their names displayed by their respective monster.  The top-tier backers will have their names animated in a special finale separate from the general name scroll. A star indicating the strength of your contribution appears alongside your chosen name.\n\nQ. Some rewards offer an NPC based on the backer. Can you explain this further?\n\nA. The NPC is entirely based on backer's feedback and approval.\nNot only does their input influence how the character looks...but it also influences how they behave, where they appear, whether they're friendly or aggressive and what kinds of attacks they have. Even what role they play in the story. In the credits sequence a name of your choice will appear next to the NPC shaped by your answers.\n\nQ. What will happen if the goal is met?\n\nA. A personalized letter of thank you will be sent to every single supporter. We'll bless our stars and allocate as much time as possible to realizing Where They Cremate the Roadkill. After maintaining a disciplined development schedule the game will be ready for release in the fall of 2015 and rewards distributed.\n\nQ. How will the funding be allocated?\n\nA. One tenth of the portion goes to Amazon and Kickstarter. Another remainder is spent producing, packaging and shipping rewards. What remains is commission for the artists and savings for audio/visual equipment and software.\n\nQ. Will I fund this game only to have it delayed indefinitely while you gamble away my savings in the city of lights and vice?\n\nA. Absolutely not. Promises will be kept and in fall 2015 Where They Cremate the Roadkill will be released. Any conceivable delay will precipitate in a small push-back. You won't have to buy a new calendar just to mark the date. \n\nQ. Is Where They Cremate the Roadkill going to be free on release?\n\nA. There\u2019ll be a free demo available to everyone. The full game will be available through purchase. Pledging through the Kickstarter will be the the most affordable way to acquire the game. Backers are receiving the game at a discounted rate in addition to the exclusive rewards.\n\nQ. For all the content mentioned 3,600 doesn't seem much compared to other games. Why this amount?\nA. Our funding goal is based only on what we need to get by. All artists involved in developing this game are in it for the joy of creating. The game is the end goal. Contributions are only a means to get there.\n\nSo please, kind sirs, help this game come to fruition with your support.\nWhere They Cremate the Roadkill Tarot Art Deck:\n Complimentary of some tier options are exclusive printable tarot decks based on the world of Where They Cremate the Roadkill.

To everyone who has pledged, tweeted, written about us, or told a friend: THANK YOU!\nIn Elegy for a Dead World, you travel to distant planets and create stories about the people who once lived there.\nThree portals have opened to uncharted worlds. Earth has sent a team of explorers to investigate them, but after an accident, you are the sole survivor. Your mission remains the same: survey these worlds and write the only accounts of them that outsiders will ever know.\nThe game is now in development, and will launch in the first quarter of 2015 for Windows, Mac, and Linux on Steam. Beta keys will go out as soon as the Kickstarter ends.\nIf you are unable to pledge on Kickstarter, or missed the Kickstarter period, you can still pledge and get most rewards here.\nWe created Elegy so that everyone can write. As you explore, the game helps you create the narrative. You begin on Shelley's World, now devoid of life. A bloated, red sun scorches a landscape of towers, sculptures, and cryptic machinery.\nAs you encounter these elements, Elegy will cue you with a series of writing prompts. Here, for instance, the game asks you to describe the landscape:\nThere are many stories to write and many places to visit, from the crumbling museum, stone faces, and sweltering plains of Shelley's World to the central planning station on Keats' World to the desiccated shores and frigid tundra of Byron's World.\nEach world offers multiple sets of prompts, each intended to inspire you to write a different story about it. Elegy might ask you to write a short story about an individual's final days, a song about resignation, or a poem about war. In the more advanced levels, you'll sometimes get new information halfway through your story which casts a new light on things and forces you to take your story in a different direction. We like to think of those as puzzles -- writing yourself out of a corner, so to speak.\nWhen you've completed your narrative, you have the option to share it with other players through Steam Workshop or reproduce it in digital and print media.\nShare your stories and read other players' stories.\nYou can read other players' works, browsing through the most-recent, the best-loved, and recently-trending stories. In our gameplay tests so far, players have expressed a variety of thoughts about what happened in each world -- the silhouette of what looks like a telescope to one player looks like a rocket ship to another, and a planet-destroying weapon to yet another.\nYou can also take screenshots of your story and upload them to a print-on-demand site like Blurb or Lulu, which will then send you a gorgeous, full-color, physical book:\nUse a print-on-demand site like Blurb or Lulu to turn your story into an actual book (additional charges apply).\nElegy began last year, as a collaboration between Dejobaan Games and Popcannibal.

It will be printed in full color, and filled with strategic maps, art, and real propaganda posters created by in-game factions to rally support for their cause. \n I've also hired a professional artist to create artistic representations of important battles when adequate images aren't available.

Now it's time to hear from the game. And I don't know anybody better suited to tell those stories with authority, humor, and respect than Andrew Groen.\" -- Logan Decker, former Editor in Chief of PC Gamer.\n\"I've never met a writer more fascinated with internet spaceship pilot shenanigans.\" -- Helicity Boson, internet space scoundrel.\nWhat is this book about?\nA History of the Great Empires of Eve Online is a history book about the epic tale of what's been happening for the last ten years in the sci-fi MMORPG, Eve Online. \nIt's a story about war and politics and betrayal and of course, internet spaceships. Beyond that, I've searched extensively and I believe this may be the first history book ever written about humans living in a digital world.\nEve's game world consists of nearly 8000 star systems for players to do just about anything they can think of, but the 3500 or so systems in the outer rim are unique in that they can be taken over by the players. To conquer these systems players form armies consisting of thousands of people. To control those systems they form governments, entire local economies, and regional alliances.  \nThere are dictators and deposed rulers, soldiers and generals, lies and propaganda, mercenaries and peacemakers, grand speeches and shady backroom deals. The book will focus on this portion of the game, known by the players as \"nullsec\" or \"0.0 space.\"\nThe full story of the untamed frontiers of Eve is one of the great mysteries in video game history and I'm committed to making it understandable and accessible to everyone whether you've never heard of Eve or if you're a hardcore player.\nThis book will take readers from the very first day the servers switched on to the formation of the first regional alliances, through the Great Wars of 2004, 2007, and 2008, and into the modern era of huge power blocs of coalitions. It's a journey through the politics, warfare, and culture that have shaped Eve into the game we read about in the headlines today.\nAbout Me\nMy name is Andrew Groen, and I've been a writer and reporter in the video game industry for over seven years. I've worked as a freelance reporter for WIRED and the Penny Arcade Report, and I've written dozens of features and reports for many different publications. My writing was also nominated for the 2012 Games Journalism Prize, and I was awarded \"Best News Reporting\" by Good Games Writing.\nI'm a casual Eve Online player, and have never had any biases or allegiances to any alliance, corporation, or group within Eve. I'm also not affiliated with CCP Games. I've spoken with CCP about this project just to make them aware of it, and we both agreed that CCP can't and shouldn't be involved in editing or approving the content of this book in any way. That said, CCP has been very supportive, and have offered to serve as a liaison to help me get in touch with difficult-to-contact sources.\nSome samples of my previous Eve Online reporting:\n-Baptism by Fire: How a nuclear scientist learned to command 150 ship fleets in Eve Online\n-The Machine War: How an Eve Online pirate inadvertently started a war for the purity of the game\nWhy am I writing this?\nFirst and foremost I'm writing this because it's an amazing story that deserves to be told in an accessible way.  \nI'm also writing this because this history has never been written down before. As time moves on, key players and memories of the early days of this universe have started to fade, and we risk losing the history of one of gaming's most unique communities who inhabit one of humanity's first true virtual worlds.\nAs much as I want this to be a great book for people to enjoy today, I also want it to serve as a time capsule for future generations to understand what life was like in one of the first virtual worlds. \nI'm writing this because there is simply no way for people to learn the history of Eve, and it's getting more difficult every day. You can spend weeks reading through the Eve wikis, but they are largely incomplete, filled with jargon, and often written by people who are obviously writing a slanted, one-sided version of history. In Eve as in the real world, history is written by the winner, and winners make terrible historians.\n What will funding go toward? \nI've worked on this in my spare time for the last six months gathering research materials and doing interviews to better understand Eve's history. Up until now it's been a labor of love, but now I need your help to get this book finished, printed, and distributed.\nAfter talking with printers, editors, and designers I determined that I'll need $12,500 to get this book finished and to print and ship 1000 copies which is the minimum count needed to secure a decent price-per-book from a printer. \nI only have two backer tiers because that helps keep the Kickstarter goal as low as possible, and also because it allows me to stay focused on creating a great history book. Too many goals can often lead to delays, cancellations, and a lack of focus on the original project.\nArt direction\nEve has a long history of co-opting old propaganda posters in their war campaigns to rally the troops and draw new recruits, and I have a personal love for Russian-style propaganda artwork. \nMy vision for the cover is based on this old poster featuring Joseph Stalin commanding WW2-era Russian forces into battle. I'm currently working with a designer to bring this image to life with an Eve spin.\nIn my vision of it there are mirror images on the front and back covers of famous Eve warlord rivals The Mittani and Sir Molle (in place of Stalin) commanding legions of starships to charge at one another. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeception: I've been warned by members of the Eve community that there are some who will attempt to deceive me into writing their own version of events to make their organizations look better. The Eve wikis are proof of this fact as they're often rife with hyper-partisan history. The only way to counteract this is through extensive reporting and interviewing. Only by getting multiple perspectives on situations can you dig through partisanship. I've dedicated myself to doing dozens of interviews to make sure all information is as balanced as possible.\n\nJargon: When discussing the high-level events of Eve it's easy to get bogged down in jargon that the average person - and even many committed Eve players - don't understand. Some accounts of Eve history are so riddled by jargon that they're illegible to anyone without years of in-game experience. In my work, I always place an emphasis on making sure everything is understandable for everyone without dumbing things down or making writing boring for experienced players. To that end, I'll be working with a team of editors from both Eve and non-Eve backgrounds to ensure I'm getting a variety of input before publication.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "Empires of EVE: Volume 2 Crosses $100,000", "update_content": "Hi everybody,  \n\nI wanted to let you know that the campaign for Empires of EVE: Volume 2 recently crossed an incredible $100,000 raised, and is now in its final week of funding. \nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sciencegroen/empires-of-eve-volume-ii\n\nSo if you'd like to join in for another strange and wonderful journey into EVE Online's history now is the time to hit that \"Back this project\" button."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "Empires of EVE: Volume 2 Kickstarter Approaching $100,000", "update_content": "Hey everybody, this is your bi-weekly reminder that the Kickstarter for Empires of EVE: Volume 2 is going on right now.

See the stretch goals section further down for more!\nOnce anyone has backed us at a given level, we're no longer permitted to change that level's rewards in our sidebar. However, we want to keep adding value and letting you easily see it. So Dave will be updating the graphic below as we go along. \n.\n   * SCROLL DOWN TO THE STRETCH GOAL SECTION BELOW TO LEARN MORE!\nWe\u2019ve all heard that there are no longer gatekeepers in traditional publishing. But that\u2019s only partly true, and not the most interesting part of the story.\nThere are more gatekeepers than ever, and publishing is changing, not dying. Artists who evolve with these shifts will be the most rewarded for learning to color outside the lines early.\nMaybe this should make things easy for a modern creator, but it doesn\u2019t. Too many would-be artists cling to the false belief that storytelling is something that\u2019s only understood by a relative few \u2014 a kind of Illuminati who are keeping those precious secrets to themselves.\nWe want to show writers, readers, and the world that \u201cstory\u201d is something that is already breathing inside you. Too many writers are afraid to tap their primal voice, falsely believing that there\u2019s magic in story that they can\u2019t access.\nBut it's just not true.\nThe truth is, you\u2019re walking around with that magic in you right now.\nWe Want to Take the Process of Writing Fiction Out of the Box and Show You Everything\nFiction Unboxed is an experiment in publishing. We\u2019re two full-time authors who want to prove that writing can be fun, and that well-told stories can come from a place of excitement and inspiration, rather than from the tortured soul of a \u201ctrue artist.\u201d\nWe believe in telling the stories we want to tell, regardless of genre. Tomorrow\u2019s most successful books (and movies) will be those that most effectively tap into what readers want most: ENTERTAINMENT.\nReaders want to think, feel, or escape, have fun, catch the scent of adventure and the thrill of the unknown. They don\u2019t care where that story came from, how long it took to write, or where you went to school. Readers care about the characters you create and the situations you put them in \u2014 the two things most in your control.\nIt\u2019s Time To Redefine How Stories Are Told\nWe\u2019re going to take an idea from concept to finished book (digital, print, and \u2014 hopefully \u2014 audiobook) in just 30 days. Last year, when we wrote and published over 1.5 million words (that's about one and a half times the length of the full Harry Potter series), we proved that storytelling could be fun for us and for our readers... and that good stories could, with practice, be told quickly.\nWe\u2019re not looking to win a Pulitzer with our stories. We\u2019re looking to win readers, and are doing exactly that one awesome story at a time. We want to show the world how we do what we do, in the hopes that we can fundamentally shift how writers approach the art of telling stories.\nLast year, to cleanse our palettes after all of that fiction, we wrote Write. Publish. Repeat: The No-Luck-Required Guide to Self Publishing Success \u2014 and the reaction to that book floored us.\nReaders were inspired all over the world. They loved Write. Publish. Repeat. (the book currently has over 300 5-star reviews!), but they wanted more. They emailed, sent Tweets, and called in to our top-rated Self Publishing Podcast, begging to know more about how we worked and how we were able to blend quantity with quality at the speed that we did.\nWe love doing things that have never been done. This time we\u2019d like to distill the entire process of making a book -- taking a story from concept to print (and ebook, of course) in 30 days -- so that storytellers and budding raconteurs around the world can see a story\u2019s birth from start to finish... over and over, if they want to.\nWe\u2019re going to start with nothing, then show the world how we do everything. We\u2019ll decide on our genre, pick a title, outline our plot, develop our characters, then write the book live while the world watches.\nFiction Unboxed will be a deeply personal project. Not only are we attempting to make a bold statement meant to trumpet loudly \u2014 a statement that encourages artists to boldly ship their art \u2014 but we\u2019re doing it in a way that's so transparent, it's basically naked.\nNothing Like This Has Ever Been Done\nWe\u2019re transparent on our podcast, sharing what works and what doesn\u2019t, almost in real time. Sometimes, that feels naked enough. But Fiction Unboxed will be like playing a show in Times Square in our birthday suits. Sink or swim, we\u2019ll step on stage, developing our ideas, querying participants, acting on their suggestions, and crafting a page-turning book that readers will want to devour and share with friends, with every word from first to last made public for our backers on the same day it\u2019s written.\nWhen the month is over, we\u2019ll have recorded every story meeting, collected every email, shared our rough, edited, and polished drafts as they were written, parried questions and answers with our audience, and shared our discussions about cover art, the book's marketing plan, and more. \nBUT, we need your help to do what\u2019s never been done, and could change how people think about (and approach) their writing.\nIf this campaign hits its minimum, we\u2019ll have the green light needed. If it doesn't fund, no backers will be charged and we\u2019ll go back to writing the books we\u2019ve planned for the rest of this year.\nAwesome Rewards!\nThank you for joining us!\nWe\u2019ve made it ABC-Easy to take part in Fiction Unboxed. The minimum backing accepted by Kickstarter is $1, so we\u2019ll start there. You helped to change the world with a story, and everyone will know it.\nWritten Transcripts: Everything that happens in Fiction Unboxed will be organized into a fantastic writer's reference manual. This massive volume (we think the print version might actually require TWO volumes!) will contain transcripts of all of our story meetings, every draft, all of our story-related emails, and transcripts of everything else that all-access participants will watch unfold live during Fiction Unboxed. After the live audience watches our story's 30-day birth, you'll receive this huge written version of the experience \u2014 essentially, a detailed record of everything we did in Fiction Unboxed to craft something (a story that will last forever) from nothing (not even an idea).\nThe novel we write during this project (title to be decided): We don\u2019t know the name of the novel we're going to write, any of the characters, or even the genre. But we do know it will be awesome, big, and impossible without you.\nAll-Access Pass to Fiction Unboxed: This is the one you really want! With an All-Access pass, you'll be able to watch everything as it happens every day. We\u2019re going to build a special website and post each day\u2019s new words (rough draft and subsequent edit) on the day they\u2019re written. You\u2019ll be able to see it all. We'll record all of our story meetings, where we hash out the plot and its twists and turns, and you'll see how \"making it up as you go along\" isn't a bad thing at all. You'll see all of our emails about the story, watch us solve problems, see Sean's outlining process ... EVERY LITTLE THING that goes into creating one of our novels.\nParticipation Pass to Fiction Unboxed: The only thing better than seeing our daily updates is being a part of them! You\u2019ll still see our story meetings, rough drafts and words as we finish. You'll still see the edits and meetings and eavesdrop on every discussion ... but at this level, you\u2019ll also be able to join in on the discussion, ask questions during our exclusive Q&As, and vote on things like story and genre before we get started. In other words, lower levels will watch a story be born, but with a Participation Pass, you will be PART of it.\nRealm & Sands and Collective Inkwell Mega Ebook bundles: These huge digital volumes contain over a million words of our published material to date!\nFan packages with our books in print (signed) and tee-shirts, shipped and sent to you.\nThe Story World Summit (2 different attendance options) in Austin, Texas with Sean, Johnny and (for one of the sessions!) Dave: Plan a book in our shared story world, side-by-side with us in a very, very small group for two full days! FULL DETAILS HERE: HTTP://SELFPUBLISHINGPODCAST.COM/SUMMIT\nAnd for a very small group, we'll edit your entire manuscript, create a customized marketing plan just for you, create your cover, and basically handle A to Z for you other than that pesky \"writing\" part!\nStretch Goals!\nWe hit our initial funding goal quickly thanks to our amazing community of backers. THANK YOU! \nBut we don't want to stop now that this train is rolling, so we've developed an amazing series of stretch goals. The more we fund, the more everyone wins. We won't reveal all of the goals just yet (as writers, we DO know the importance of building suspense!), but suffice to say some of the bigger goals down the road are doozies. \nMore funding will allow us to add some great rewards for all of you. We plan to STACK OUR REWARDS FOR BACKERS TO THE CEILING as Fiction Unboxed continues to fund. The more we win, the more you win, so please share this project and let the world know!\n$25,000 STRETCH GOAL: \u201cHow We Use Scrivener to Create Story Beats\" video series and Transcripts of Self-Publishing Podcast Episodes 1-25 \n** UNLOCKED! **\nScrivener is the writing software we use every day (you'll learn about it during Fiction Unboxed if you don't already know it), and perhaps more than anything, we've been asked to talk about how we use it.\nBut why stop there? The second most common thing we're asked about is how we use Story Beats -- a kind of loose outline that we use for every single book we create. (They're not rigid and restrictive, either, if you don't like the idea of being \"bound\" by your plot ahead of time. Our stories ALWAYS evolve from the beats.)\nThis goal will show you both of our most-requested topics: how we use Scrivener AND how we use them to create Story Beats. It will be added as a bonus to the rewards for all backers at the $39 level and above!\nIf you\u2019re podcast listener, you\u2019ve probably already heard me discussing the latest beats I\u2019ve been writing for the final Realm & Sands project we'll be writing before the Fiction Unboxed story gets started. As with all of our processes, beats get better by the project. Codenamed Axis, these beats are more thorough than our usual fare, and are probably the most detailed beats I\u2019ve written for Johnny since The Beam: Season One.\nI\u2019ll shoot a series of screencasts and take you on a guided tour of exactly how I use Scrivener for beats, so that you can see what Johnny sees before he starts writing. I\u2019ll be using Axis \u2014 a file so fresh that at the time of this update, Johnny\u2019s not even see it. I\u2019ll show you how I work with characters, locations, and story, and arrange everything so that all Johnny has to do when he hits the keyboard is write.\nAll transcripts, provided as a lightly edited and easily searchable ebook, will be added to the rewards for all backers at the $39 level and above.\nWe deliver a lot of information on the Self Publishing Podcast, but up until now there's been no easy way to search for the information you want or need. Would you like to hear Johnny describe his \"inability\" to write a second book before the light went on and he started writing like a machine? Do you want to hear why we changed our minds about using Amazon's KDP Select program? \nWell, good luck searching through all of those episodes. Without transcripts, you'd have to listen to or watch them all to find what you needed, but this stretch goal will finally get that wealth of discussion into a format where it's easy to sort through and simple to find.\nIn addition, we'll be adding non-ebook versions of the transcripts to our website, for use by the SPP community. \nLater goals will fund the rest of the transcripts -- millions of words' worth of real-world experience (as three careers developed and unfolded) at your fingertips!\n$35,000 STRETCH GOAL: A FREE Copy of Scrivener Writing Software For Everyone at the $89 Level and Above (and you can give it away to a friend if you already own Scrivener!)\n** UNLOCKED! **\nEvery backer at $89 or above will get a copy of the writing software Scrivener (a writer\u2019s best friend) for FREE.\n(If you already own Scrivener, you can give your free copy away to anyone you want!)\nWe use Scrivener for everything. From shorts and novellas, to serials, standalone books and series, to this update right now, Scrivener is our first, second and every choice after. It\u2019s how we work.\nLiterature & Latte, the developers of Scrivener are amazing people making remarkable software. We\u2019re lucky to have their support for this campaign, and grateful to YOU for making that happen.\n$50,000 STRETCH GOAL:\nShared Story World Templates!\n** UNLOCKED! **\nWhatever we\u2019re writing during June for Fiction Unboxed, we want to share that world with you. Because this is a highly collaborative project, so transparent it's practically a see-through project, we've already decided that the world will be open to everyone.\nWhen we reach $50,000, we will fully flesh out our world and create histories and timelines (just like we have for The Beam) and turn them into Scrivener Templates that everyone can share (remember, all Unboxers will get the software for FREE!)\nWe\u2019ll build the world, you\u2019ll get the history, politics, and locations, along with a primary cast of characters that have made the world what it is, and keep it alive and thriving \u2014 easy enough for you to access as a couple of clicks.\n$60,000 STRETCH GOAL:\n\"Learn Scrivener Fast\" training!\n** UNLOCKED! **\nThe Learn Scrivener Fast program is a really easy-to-use guide for getting up and running with Scrivener quickly. The straightforward course is built around short videos that teach you exactly one thing. Each lesson has a text explanation as well, along with actionable instructions. This is -- by far -- the best Scrivener training we've ever seen.\nThanks to the generosity of Joseph Michael, the author of Learn Scrivener Fast, all backers at the $89 will get the training course for free once we hit a new $60,000 stretch goal. You are already getting Scrivener and our beats series, and with this addition, you can learn simple tricks that will help you write more efficiently and publish more easily.\n$75,000 STRETCH GOAL:Daily email series to give you the best year of your writing life!\nIf we meet this goal, we will write an e-mail series with one short thing for you to read for 365 consecutive days, to make sure you have the best writing year of your life.\nThis email series will be added to every backer level!\n... AND MANY OTHER GREAT STRETCH GOALS TO FATTEN YOUR REWARDS PACKAGE! \nWe have a ton of great things planned, so keep coming back here to check on later goals as the project funds more and more!\nThe project begins almost immediately after the Kickstarter ends!\nWe\u2019re running this Kickstarter now, because it\u2019s the one available pocket in this year\u2019s schedule. Doing Fiction Unboxed now means that we won't be able to write Unicorn Apocalypse until next year (sorry Outlaws!) but we think that\u2019s a small sacrifice to capture the excitement, immediacy, and momentum required to change the way that writers approach story.\nOur campaign ends the final week of May, and we'll start our project first week in June. For you as a backer, that means NO WAITING!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe\u2019ve never run a Kickstarter before because we\u2019ve never had anything worthy. It doesn\u2019t make sense to ask our readers to fund books before they\u2019re written. Fiction Unboxed is different. It's something that\u2019s never been done, and worth your attention.\nWe\u2019ll be working 30 days in a row, letting the world peek over our shoulder at everything we do.\nWe\u2019ll be cramming multiple months of work into one, and plowing through weekends despite quiet protests from our patient wives so that we can show the world what is possible.\nPlease Be a Part of Tomorrow\u2019s Story\nThe future of story is changing. Preconceptions are being challenged, and answers will only arrive through innovative thought.\nYou are an artist staring at a canvas, and you can paint anything you want. Watching our unboxing will be like someone filling your canvas with color in real time with the hues already inside you.\nThank you for being part of the change.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any project, there are things that can go wrong. \n\nOn the creative side, it is possible that our story will fall apart, that we won't be able to met our deadlines, that our cover won't come together in place, or any one of a million unforeseen variables stops us from finishing our book in the first 30 days. \n\nThroughout our writing careers, we have always been up against deadlines, and are excellent at meeting them. In this case, it's part of the art. Our strong background and experience positions us to solve any challenges and deliver what we've promised.\n\nHowever, even if we run long and miss our 30-day deadline, this IS a \"warts and all\" experience. You WILL see our story be born, along with any mistakes we make on the way.\n\nIt is also highly unlikely, but still possible that not all three of the Self-Publishing Podcast guys would be able to make the in person story workshop in Austin. Things like health, family emergencies, transportation issues, acts of God, or anything that we have no way of anticipating could keep one of us from attending. However, Sean lives in Austin, and all three of us love our fans and can't wait to do this. \n\nAs with all Kickstarter projects, money will only be charged if Fiction Unboxed is fully funded.

She's also a hell of a writer.\nWith that many titles under her belt, you can see why she prefers to just be called a dilettante.\nThe one thing Helena is not, however, is a very good salesperson. Her business skills leave a lot to be desired in just about every way you can imagine. When I told her to submit her info to Kickstarter, she asked me what number to fax it to (and where she could buy a fax machine, and also... what's a fax machine?)\nThat's where I come in. My name is Jim Squires, and I'm Helena Hann-Basquiat's business partner, buddy, and all-around biggest fan. If you want to know why, just read the following excerpt from the book we're asking you to support, in which she explains the word dilettante far better than Webster's ever could:\nI am a dilettante, darlings, no doubt about it. But don\u2019t you dare call me that as an insult. No, I\u2019m taking the word back and re-branding it. I may not be a professional, but I am no wannabe, either. \nSee, dilettante is kind of the \u2018N\u2019 word for artistic types (the \u2018N\u2019 word being novice, of course \u2014 where did you think I was going with that? Did you think I was going to say neophyte?) as it is dismissive and insulting to those of us who delight in dabbling and experimentation, and brands us with a big scarlet letter that burns no less than the one dear Hester Prynne was forced to wear. Only the letter that we dilettantes are forced to wear screams Dabbler. As in, Not good enough. Of poor quality. The work of an admirer, as opposed to an artist. As if we have no respect for the craft. As if we seek validation by putting ourselves in the same category as someone more talented \u2014 and there are degrees of talent, no question. As if we don\u2019t take what we\u2019re doing seriously \u2014 as if we are not artists unless we are on television.\nWant more? You can read the following excerpts from the book at helenahb.com:\nCouche-Tard and the Jumping Asians\nCummerbund Bandersnatch and the Girl With the Wet Spot\nThe Good, The Bad, and The Hipster\nThe Return of the Barista With No Name\nAn Indecent Proposal\nBut rest assured, darlings, that whatever I do, I will do my best \u2014 I will continue to hone my craft, and I will refine my raw materials down to the purest form, and sand off the rough edges, and shake off the dross and separate the wheat from the chaff, and only present the finished works when they are, indeed, finished \u2014 or, if not finished, then I will present them as a curiosity of sorts \u2014 portrait of a spectacular failure.\nHelena's words are too damned good to not bring to a bigger audience, so with the debut of Memoirs of a Dilettante, I've pledged to help her get the word out in any way I can. And that means dreaming a bit bigger than what she had in mind.\nSo we need some money. From you. Pretty please.\nHelena's initial plans were to launch this as a small self-published e-book, promoted exclusively to her existing readership. After talking with me, that goal has changed. Her new goal -- the goal of this Kickstarter -- is to raise enough funds to do a small print run for a softcover release. If we can do this, we should be able to get the book into some indie-friendly bookshops, libraries, and bring it to small press expos, literary events, and self-publishing friendly gatherings like Word on the Street and Toronto Indie Arts Market.\nIt will also give us the physical copies we need to deliver the book to those who can help us spread the word best: reviewers.\nIn addition to this sometimes autobiographical, sometimes completely made-up book (which was built slowly in front of an audience as blog posts -- neat, right?), Helena also writes short horror fiction under the name Jessica B. Bell. Under this pseudonym, she was recently featured in Dagda Publishing's futuristic short fiction collection All Hail the New Flesh.\nHer contribution to All Hail the New Flesh, titled The Best Medicine, is among the rewards you can get for backing this project.\nIf we meet our goal, those who have pledged for an eBook will have it delivered before the end of March in EPUB, LIT and MOBI formats. Those who want a print edition will need to wait a little longer -- we're shooting for June -- but should be just as satisfied once they get it.\nIf you're looking for a little extra incentive, Helena will be offering a few rewards here that will remain exclusive to this Kickstarter project. Our cover artist, the legendary and talented fashion illustrator Ros Webb (whose work has appeared in Vogue, Marie Claire, and more) has created portraits of Helena and her niece that -- if you back at the right level -- you'll receive as frame-worthy postcards. (learn more about Ros Webb at roswebbart.com)\nPlus, if you order a print edition of the book, Helena will be happy to personalize it with a hand-written message that you won't find anywhere else.\nAnd yes -- as you've probably guessed from the title -- Helena is hard at work on Volume Two. If you back Volume One and love it as much as we do, be sure to keep an eye out for Helena's continuing adventures (many of which you can find at helenahb.com)!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're pleased to say that we've squared away just about every possible roadblock you can imagine.

AND THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS!\nDreadline is a high intensity, single player*, action role playing/real time strategy mashup. You control an unlikely and eclectic group of monsters killing the doomed during historically-inspired catastrophes.**\n* If we can raise enough money, we would love to add multiplayer!\n** Dreadline will be DRM-Free.\nDreadline is the kind of game you make when you don't have to convince anybody other than yourself that it's going to be awesome. A kid with a sheet over his head and a kitchen knife who thinks he's a ghost? What if he wore a backpack filled with a harvest of human hearts? His best friends consist of mummies, monsters, and a magical flying cube with incredible powers? Dreadline is mysterious, curious, cute, violent, and strange. We're following our instincts, not a spec developed by a team of marketing experts.\nThe game revolves around our main character, Ghost. He's an 8 year old boy with a bit of a troubled past. He was saved by a group of misfit monsters who were given a time machine by a highly educated alien from the future. What could go wrong?\nWe started out with one goal in mind... to take the RTS/RPG gameplay that you love, and make it way faster paced and frantic. You start each level by picking a team of 3 monsters to accompany Ghost as he \"visits\" calamities throughout time. (It would be far less civilized to kill people who weren't going to die anyway, no?) Each playable monster will have a unique and crazy skill set. We have a cool new interface for controlling your monsters (codenamed \"dreadlines!\"), an insanely competitive leaderboard system for keeping stats so you can compete with friends, and an awesome new game engine that makes the game look unlike anything else out there.\nWe are industry vets, but please don't hold that against us! We've worked on  dozens of games over the years, from first person shooters, to ARPGs, to the biggest music games ever made. (Freedom Force, Bioshock, Titan Quest, Rock Band, etc.) What we haven't had the opportunity to do is make a game that is truly our own. Unfortunately, so many of the best ideas we ever heard were left on the cutting room floor of AAA developer's offices. Those flashes of inspiration should add up to more. We have both the expertise to build this game, and the vision and creativity to make sure we don't get lost along the way.\nDreadline is the kind of project that we've always dreamed of making.\nWe have been toiling in obscurity for the better part of a year, shaking off the residue from our old day jobs, finding the right project, and getting it ready to present to the world. Our hard work has paid off. The response to what tidbits of the game we've shown to people has been fantastic. We've laid the groundwork for building an incredible, one-of-a-kind game that we couldn't be more excited to build.\nIt took quite a bit longer for us to get to this point than we anticipated. As the project developed, our vision for what it could be grew and grew. What was originally going to be our quick-turnaround/low-risk/easy-breezy/genre game evolved into a completely original game that is far more exciting, but also far more challenging to build. Now that we're ready to really get down to building this thing, we're out of cash. We have enough of it up and running to know that it's going to be ridiculously fun, and we can't wait to finish it.\nWe're fortunate to have arrived here at the perfect time. Kickstarter has proven that there is an amazing audience of people ready to support projects like ours. \nDreadline is currently slated to be an English-language, single-player, PC release that will be completed around August of 2013. The plan is to have 9 playable monsters and 7 calamities. We have estimated that it will cost us $167,000 (minus the take of Kickstarter, Amazon, and our prizes) to get Dreadline out the door. It's quite a bit less than what other game projects of this size have asked for since we've been self funding for over a year now.\nBut we would love to offer more. We want more monsters, more calamities, multiplayer monster fights, Mac port, iOS port, more languages, or anything else YOU may want. We don't want to put up a table of new features that could be rolled out yet, because we would first like to hear from people like you.\nPeople are clamoring for more Dreadline cartoons! We are planning on building animated cinematics very much like our teaser trailer for the game. Even a short and sloppy animation like that takes a serious amount of work. More money would mean that we can make more, better, and more ridiculous cartoons. \nEerie Canal is about creativity, independence, and innovation. We want to continue to make games that nobody else can.\nWe have built our entire game engine, entitled \"shoe_gazer\", from the ground up to make Dreadline. When we first started on the game, we weren't sure what we wanted it to look like. We just knew that we loved Steven's concept art, and after a while, decided that we should try to make our game look like his sketches. Having our own technology allows the game to look unlike anything else out there while also giving us the ability to add any of the ridiculous features we can dream up. Additionally, it supports all of the functionality you've come to love in other games (use of multiple cores, particle systems, cool physics, 2d/3d sounds, networking, etc.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideo game development is a risky process fraught with peril. Just think of how many AAA titles with huge budgets end up getting canned. (Steven and Bryn should know, they worked on a project for a few years at Irrational Games that never saw the light of day.)\n\nDreadline has a number of things going for it that will keep it from becoming just another forgotten game.\n\n1- All members of the team are game industry veterans. Bryn and Steven have been the lead programmer and lead artist on projects at Irrational Games, Harmonix, and Iron Lore Entertainment.\n\n2- Dreadline has been under development for over a year. Although we have a lot of work left to do, the game engine is up and running, and the game is playable. (Just look at the footage from the video!)\n\nHonestly, the main thing we are missing right now is funding. We have developed the title for as long as we could, and are now basically flat broke. Although we joked about it, we have actually put a very detailed plan/schedule into place and know exactly how much more money we need to finish Dreadline.

We launched our game on Kickstarter early in development because we wanted to involve you, the community, in the design of Deozoa. With over $13,000 raised and 300+ loyal backers, we think Kickstarter has been an incredible success in building a community. You have made some amazing suggestions that we feel will really make Deozoa a lot more fun to play! But those changes also drastically affect some of the design choices and funding estimates. With a new battle animation style, it now looks like we could complete Deozoa at a fraction of the initial estimate. Rather than immediately relaunch with this update, we have decided to step back and implement a lot of changes that have been suggested. Our goal is to get a functional prototype for you to mess around with before we attempt to kickstart this project again. Your input into this project has been immensely valuable, and we ask you to join the game development on the forums.\nRead more here...\n--------\n[PLEASE NOTE! The battle is still very much in progress. We are going to change them from the chibi style to a 2D pixel sprite style, more along the lines of Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics. Please scroll down to FAQs at the bottom of the page to read more.]\nDeozoa is a monster catching video game combining the rich storytelling of an RPG with the combat system of a turn based strategy. As you explore through the world you will discover and capture over 100 monsters called Deozoa. Unlike other monster games, your 11 playable human characters battle side by side with their Deozoa to fight their way to victory.\nRead more about how the Deozoa gameplay works...\nOur number one priority is to build an exciting, high quality RPG that is unique and fresh. Our game will boast:  \nOne time game purchase for all monsters, characters, and story. The game will be developed for iOS (iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch) and Android (phone and tablet), with an subsequent release to PC, Mac, Linux, and Ouya.\nDRM-free. When you buy the game, all of your data will belong to you. \nHelp shape the game: One thing we are excited about is making the game a little more community driven. We will have opportunities for you to share your monster creations and submit them to contests to get them included in the game. Ignis Studios will still have a final say on the game development because we want to create a consistent world and style, but we love hearing your ideas and are excited to build a place where we can share and build this together. \nCapture and befriend over 100 monsters: Each teammate can be assigned one Deozoa to fight with them on the battlefield. \nEvolve your Deozoa: Like animals that grow from baby to adult, all of our Deozoa will grow into a new form as they mature. There are typically two to three monsters per family.\nRecruit 10 characters to your team: As you progress through the story, you will encounter 10 available warriors looking for an adventure. Determine the best combination of abilities to give yourself an edge on the battlefield.\nLevel up and upgrade human classes: There are 10 classes of human warriors to battle, each with their own unique stats and strengths. As enemies get tougher and the heroes get stronger, every class can develop into an advanced form for stat boosts.\nUse the elements to your advantage: There are 12 elements that all Deozoa and attacks fall into. Every element will have strengths and weaknesses against other elements, making each battle unique and challenging.\nFight in a free-form battling system: Position 6 teammates with an open movement system unrestrained by a grid. The size of a unit can block enemies\u2019 movement to redirect their attacks, protect weaker units, and form a front line.\nRich RPG storyline: Unlike casual games, you will explore through a fun RPG story with an expected eight hours of gameplay in a single play through.\nWe have done a lot of work but we still have a long way to go. We have already designed over 50 monsters, developed the story, characters, and style of the world, but there is still a lot to do. We need to hire artists to help draw all the human characters, monsters, and backgrounds. We also have to develop the world\u2019s environment for battling, as well as animate over 100 monsters and 25 human characters.\nIf we make more than our goal, our first goal would be to make and animate more Deozoa. We would also love to include more side quests, art for upgraded human classes, high quality animated cutscenes to enrich the story, and original music composed by local Austin musicians.  \nKickstarter is an all or nothing effort. We need to hit our goal of $78,000 to make this dream a reality. But with your help, we believe that we can reach it.\nFor a $1 pledge, get access to a backer only forum for latest updates and for helping us come up with items, Deozoa names, stats, backstories, and more! There will also be a place for you to submit your own monster ideas, sketches, and fan art! If we update anything new, you'll be the first to know!\nFor $5, you get access to the forums plus three wallpapers for your desktop!\nFor $10, you all the above as well as three stickable stickers, in all their stickiness, to show your support for Deozoa.\nFor $15, you get the wallpapers, stickers, and the finished game with all 100+ unlocked monsters. The game will be released for iOS and Android, with a subsequent release to PC, Mac, Linux, and Ouya.\nFor $30, you get all of the above, plus three unlocked classes for your main character at the start of the game! The classes include a Pirate, Barbarian, and Assassin (unique to the main character only!). \nFor $50, you get all the above, plus one 18\" x 24\" limited edition poster of your choice, ready to be framed and hung in your room. Choose between the earth giant, Teraton, the water fighter, Bayatee, the plant snake, Sevour, or the fiery lion, Singa. As a bonus, you'll get a 5x8\" print of hipster Mustachio, aka Hipstachio!\nFor $55, you can get the strictly digital package. This includes the forum, wallpapers, game, classes, and exclusive Deozoa, Rayang and Luyin. This reward bundle is completely independent of the other reward levels and you will not get the stickers or the poster. But for those looking for all digital goods, this should meet that need!\nFor $75, you get everything above plus two exclusive Deozoa, released only to Kickstarter backers! Each time you start the game, Rayang, the light dragon, and Luyin, the shadow dragon, will be automatically added to your team!\nPlus, instead of getting one poster, you will get two of your choice!\nFor $80, you can get the strictly digital package + credits in the game. This includes the forum, wallpapers, game, classes, exclusive Deozoa, and credits. This reward bundle is completely independent of the other reward levels and you will not get the stickers or the poster. \nWhen you give $100, you will get all of the above, but instead of just one poster, you get all four! You will also get your name listed in the credits.\nFor $150, you get all the above, plus the opportunity to be a beta tester! Be one of the first ones to play the game and help us work out the bugs so we build the highest quality game we can! Please choose between being an iOS, Android, or Windows/Mac/Linux beta tester.\nFor $350 or above, you get all the above (except for the beta tester) and the chance to be a non-playable character! Submit your photo and our artist will draw you as a shop owner, barkeep, innkeeper, a townsperson, or an enemy boss! We get to decide who to place you as, but we will submit your sketch to you for approval before it goes into the game.\nFor $650 or more, you will receive everything above (except for the beta tester) plus 8\" x 12\" framed giclee cutscene, signed by the team to thank you for your contribution. Plus you will get an invitation to the launch party (Please add $30 for shipping outside the US & Canada. Must be able to travel to and provide own accommodation in Austin, TX.)\nFor $1,500 or more, you will get all the above, plus instead of becoming a non-playable character, you will be made into a playable main character. You send us a photo (or describe an awesome warrior idea) and let us know what class you want your character to be. We will send one sketch for your approval before finalizing the drawing. (Note: Custom classes will not apply to your character. We can implement your favorite colors and weapon, but we will not draw anything inappropriate.)\nFor $3,500 or more, you will get all the above (including the playable character instead of the NPC) plus you are named in game as an Associate Producer. Plus, we'll take you out to dinner in downtown Austin. An evening spent with us is time well spent. You know it's true. Or not. You don't know us yet. But we're cool. At least our dog thinks so. (Must be able to travel and provide own accommodation in Austin, TX.)\nFor $10,000, you will get all the above, plus you are named in game as the sole Executive Producer. In addition to all of that, we'll take you out to dinner in downtown Austin. Or we can go look at ducks. Lauren prefers the duck option, but it's your call.\nFor anyone who wants to give more than $10,000, please message us and we'll figure out an appropriately awesome reward for you! \nNote: For all those who give more than $150 and really want to be a beta tester, please contact us.\nFor more information, check out our website, www.Deozoa.com.\nLike us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter! \nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Lauren Ellis\nFirst created \u00b7 36 backed\nIgnis Studios, LLC, is an independent game company founded in 2012.

Tell us in the comments!\nAbout Golem\nGolem is a graphic novel created and written by Hilary Goldstein (that's me!) with art by Giovanni P. Timpano (G.I. Joe: Infection), colors by Laura Schumacher, and covers by Garry Brown (Incorruptible).\nMy goal is to use Kickstarter to complete all four issues and publish an exclusive 100-page version of the graphic novel only for backers. This version will have added content not available in other editions and backers will be the first to read this epic revenge tale.\nIf you'd like to help, please back this project and tell your friends and followers on Twitter and Facebook.\nThe Story\nThey framed her for the murder of the President, executed her husband in front of her, and nearly took the life of her infant son. Big mistake. Exiled from America, Danya Ben-El'azar and her six-year-old son Jonah have become the international mercenary team known only as Golem. With sword and pistol, mother and son travel the world hunting the people who ruined their lives.\nThere's a famous Jewish legend about a monster, called a golem, built from the clay of the Earth. Once a command is written on its forehead, it will stop at nothing to see it carried out. Danya adopts the spirit of the golem, and when she writes those Hebrew letters on her forehead, becomes an unstoppable monster. But when the costume is off and the letters are wiped away, she's burdened with feelings of inadequacy as a mother and the sense that she's trapped by her own hunger for revenge.\nThe story focuses on the relationship between Danya and her son, Jonah. Danya is overwhelmed by her singular obsession with revenge. Jonah doesn't have the same world view, doesn't feel that need to punish. This puts them at odds throughout the story as the opportunity arises to finally get vengeance, but at a great cost.\nWhere the Money Goes\nThe base goal of this Kickstarter is $8000, which covers the cost for the artist, colorist, and the covers. If we can manage that, we'll be able to produce all four issues and collect it into a trade. That's really just the beginning though, as there are other costs I'm currently going to take on with what little money I have in the bank (including printing costs). Every cent earned is going right back into this project.\nIf we reach our first goal, I'll be able to produce a print run of a Kickstarter exclusive edition of the 100-page TPB. If you back this project for $30 or more, you're guaranteeing yourself a copy of the book! If we get past $8k, I'll start laying out some stretch goals.\n\nFirst thing's first, though. We have to get to $8000. If this project doesn't reach $8k none of the money comes through and the comic book won't be finished. So please, help if you can.\nThank you for your help in making this comic book a reality!\nRewards\nHere's a cool reward all backers receive. You will have access to exclusive updates of layouts, pencils, inks and designs of new pages as the book is created beyond what will be shared with anyone else. You'll get insight into the creative process as well.\n\nPage 4 from layouts to colors.\nThe TPB is expected to be ready by April 2013 at the latest. Some rewards will be available and delivered before then. A few of the key rewards:\n$30 - Exclusive Kickstarter TPB (Plus eBook short story trilogy prequel)\nThis version is only available through Kickstarter and includes bonus material not in any future printing.\n$40 - Choice of Prints (Plus a copy of the TPB)\nAfter the Kickstarter is complete, you'll receive a survey to pick either the artist's print or a print of the cover.\n\nArt Print by Giovanni P. Timpano (Yes, it will be colored)\n\nCover print by Garry Brown\n$50 - Sketch from Me (Warning: I have no artistic talent)\nYour beautiful book will include a unique attempt at recreating a scene from Golem drawn by yours truly. I can't draw, so these will be epic! See the incredible example below!\n\n$60 - Sketch from Series Artist Giovanni P. Timpano (and the book too!)\nOr you can get a sketch from the artist, who actually knows what he's doing.\n\n$80 - Golem T-Shirt (Sizes S-XL), also available in all later tiers!\n$100 - Ultimate Combo Pack!\nCan't decide on one reward? The combo pack scores you pretty much everything below it. That's a signed copy of the TPB, author sketch, two art prints, the script book (all four issues + commentary!), PDF of the series, eBook short story prequel, and a guest appearance in one of my dreams.\n$400 - Original Notes (One backer only!)\nI change lots about my stories even as the art is coming in. Only one person will know the earlier versions of Golem with all of my notes. This includes colored notecards I used to order the plot. There's an entire issue in notecards that was scrapped. What happened in that issue? One way to find out.\n$1000 - Be a Victim\nDanya kills a lotta folks in this book. You could be one of them. That's right, your likeness will be put into the comic to die by Danya's hands. You'll get the original art for the page featuring your demise and get all kinds of other goodies (prints, script book, t-shirt, etc.).\nPreview", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "All Rewards Have Been Sent!", "update_content": "Before the holidays, I sent out the last of the physical rewards.
