Nothing will go to waste!\n--------------------------\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e | PORTFOLIO\nThree years ago, I made a pair of design-fiction short films about the future. You can watch them here:\nhttps://vimeo.com/8569187 \nhttps://vimeo.com/14294054 \nNow I\u2019m making a new film series set in Medellin, Colombia, to build on and extend those ideas. It will be an ambitious new vision of the future; instead of jetpacks, flying cars and robots, think smart cities, super-social media, and ubiquitous augmented reality. It will be a science fiction short for our time; introspective, critical, and beautifully designed.\nThe art books will be filled with production drawings like this\nWhat\u2019s it about? \nWorld-changing marvels to us, are only wallpaper to our children.\n- Bruce Sterling \nThe stories are about the realities we invent for ourselves. Each short will focus on a different character, and their perception of the city. Amongst the millions of overlapping fictions that make up augmented Medellin, we will follow: \nMarly, a local celebrity and fashion icon living through social media, who is about to face a very public betrayal. \nIn the Barrios we meet Emilio, a game-addicted labourer, breaking through the sea of profiles and statistics to find love in an unexpected place. \nDuring the final preparations for Medellin\u2019s famous Festival of Light, we will follow Juliana, a beleaguered corporate creative, who turns to God after a near death experience. \nAnd more!\nThe stories will all take place over the course of a single day, woven together with many other threads of narrative that will constantly reward the observant viewer. Themes of identity, control and delusion, will be set against a backdrop of balkanization, manipulative media channels, power struggles for data, and open-source rebellion. This is not an alien future, but rather one that is unnervingly familiar.\nThe films will be around five minutes each, and will be assembled at the end in a combined edit.\nSome designs for augmented profiles\nWhy am I doing it?\nWe shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.\n- Marshall McLuhan \nTechnology is playing an increasingly important part in our everyday lives. Most of the time though, we learn about technology from the people who are trying to sell it to us. I believe that it\u2019s important to be critical; to be aware of how these technologies could shape our future. The films will expose the amazing potential, but also the possibly dark future of some technologies, while presenting them in a way that everyone can understand. \nHow does this work? \nEverything is becoming science fiction. From the margins of an almost invisible literature has sprung the intact reality of the 20th century. \n - J.G. Ballard \nOne of the prints available in the ALTERNATE REALITY package. More choices to follow!\nHave a look at our amazing rewards! As a backer, you\u2019ll be kept up to date via a project blog, and have access to lots of bonus material from behind the scenes. \nWhat\u2019s the schedule? \nThis campaign will fund the first film, which is due to start production the moment we reach our target. I\u2019m planning to release the first film in both 2D and 3D in March, and most of the rewards will be sent out around that time too. The rest of the films will follow throughout 2014. \nCan we exceed the funding goal? \nYES! Extra money will go into funding the next films in the series. More films will also mean more rewards for every backer!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u00a325,000 might seem like a lot of money, but it's actually a shoestring budget considering the amount of time that will go into this project.

Somewhere down the line, I plan to raise additional funds by selling advertising space within the films.

MAI will provide an educational space to host workshops, lectures, residencies, and research.\n(Video directed and edited by Milica Zec)\nIf successful, this Kickstarter will cover the first phase of MAI's development: the design process. Your pledge will contribute to early MAI programming, office operations, and schematic designs of architectural elements, including building structure, lighting, acoustics, and AV. Given that MAI is the first of its kind, its early design phase demands an innovative approach. Leading this process are world-renowned architects Rem Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), whose unique vision will help MAI to create new ways for audiences and performers to interact.\nCurrent interior of 620 Columbia St., Hudson, NY\nIn total, $20 million is needed to complete renovations of the institute and begin operations. Marina has paid for phase zero of this development process. She purchased the building for $950,000 and donated it to the institute. She funded the budget of the MAI office for six months and commissioned the architectural concept. As of now, Marina has paid $1.5 million out of pocket towards the early stages of MAI. \nA single person, no matter how successful or passionate, cannot single-handedly fund and sustain a cultural institution of this size. She hopes that an equally passionate public will join her in contributing to phase one.\nWe aim to create a global community of collaborators and want you to be part of it. \nBy inviting the broader public to contribute to our early development, Kickstarter helps to affirm and build the engaged community necessary for sustaining MAI into the future. We have designed rewards that encourage backers to engage with time-based and immaterial works. With your contribution, you become a founder of the institute not only financially, but also conceptually, by partaking in the very experiences we hope to create.\nMarina with MAI Model \u00a9 OMA\nA primary aim of Kickstarter is also a major theme of Marina's forty-year career in performance art: to close the gap between artist and audience. Here, Marina and MAI can connect directly with the institute's future visitors, who can then share in the process of its creation.\nIf this initiative succeeds, backers will have helped to found both the largest cultural institution ever to get off the ground using Kickstarter, as well as the only project of its kind in the world.\nContributions to this project are 80% tax deductible due to MAI's non-profit 501(c)3 status.\nMarina Abramovic, The House With the Ocean View (2002). Duration: 12 days. Photo: Steven P. Harris, Courtesy Sean Kelly Gallery and Marina Abramovic Archives\nMarina Abramovic is a New York-based, Serbian-born performance artist who began her career in the early 1970s. Her four decades of work explore the relationship between performer and audience, the limits of the body, and the possibilities of the mind. During her most recent performance, \"The Artist Is Present\" (2010), Marina sat motionless in MoMA\u2019s atrium, offering her gaze to anyone willing to sit across from her. Over the course of three months, she stared into the eyes of more than 1,500 visitors.\n(Video directed and edited by Milica Zec)\nIt was during this 736-hour performance that Marina became aware of the public\u2019s immense desire to slow down and connect to themselves and to one another in a live setting. Long durational works facilitate this type of connection, but currently there is no space solely dedicated to them. MAI will be this space. \n(Video directed and edited by Noah Blumenson-Cook)\nMAI will be a platform for long durational work. A long durational work is any work (of performance art, dance, theater, film, music, opera, and others) whose performance exceeds six hours. The history of long durational works is varied and rich. Click here to read about some extraordinary works, including Christian Marclay's The Clock (24 hours), John Lennon and Yoko Ono's Bed-In (168 hours), John Cage's Organ2/ASLSP (As Slow aS Possible) (639 years), Michael Siffre's Biological Clock Experiments (5670 hours), Mata Amritanandamayi's hugs (32 million hugged), and Tehching Hsieh's One Year Performance series (1978-1999).\nIn order to fulfill its mission, MAI will:\nInvite artists to propose, present, and premiere long durational works of performance art, dance, theater, film, music, opera, and more. \nProvide space and other resources for art and science residencies to develop new and collaborative long durational projects. \nHost lectures, workshops, community outreach initiatives, public programs, and continuing education classes, as well as an extended library of time-based and immaterial works. \nInvite visitors to participate in the Abramovic Method, which will prepare them to experience long durational work.\n\n\n(Drawing by Cassandra Long)\nMarina will personally thank all those who contribute to the creation of MAI by hugging every backer of this Kickstarter at a live event called THE EMBRACE. This event will be held in two undisclosed locations, one in New York City and one in Europe, with exact dates and times to be announced. MAI Founders who are unable to attend these events will be offered a special reward in lieu of a hug from Marina.\nDigital MAI 8-bit Videogame by Pippin Barr\nPippin Barr is a video game designer who created the viral \"The Artist Is Present\" 8-bit video game. He\u2019s teamed up with us to create a game that serves as a digital tour of the institute as well as an entertaining and challenging experience. At this level, you'll receive early access to the digital institute, as well as three Abramovic Method games: rice counting exercise, stepping on grass, and complaining to a tree. To read a review of these games from Dirty Mag, click here. To play the entrance to digital MAI, click here! \n(Drawing by Cassandra Long)\nMarina will teach the Abramovic Method water drinking exercise via exclusive live stream. You, Marina, and the other backers at this level will then perform this exercise simultaneously. You may document your performance in any way you choose and opt to include this documentation in MAI digital archives! The goal of this reward is to create a large performance of slow, conscious water drinking that encourages both participants and passersby to slow down and exist more fully in the present.\n(Video directed by Noah Blumenson-Cook with music by Tristan Allen)\nThe Abramovic Method trains audience members with the skills to observe and perform long durational works. Through a series of exercises, participants are encouraged to become more aware of their mental and physical experiences in the current moment, increasing ability to feel their own presence and make empathic connection to others. These exercises come from a belief that everyone can benefit from being more present with themselves and others. Over the course of Marina's career, she has dedicated herself to creating and experimenting with these exercises, and institute is an environment where others can experiment as well. \n(Still from rice counting exercise animation created by Arianna Vairo)\n\nWe have partnered with a number of artists and collaborators to create a beautiful Kickstarter-exclusive DVD that includes the following: a series of short films of Marina demonstrating the exercises in nature, an animation of the rice counting exercise, five Abramovic Method games: rice counting exercise, stepping on grass, complaining to a tree, looking at the colors, and stopping the anger (created by Pippin Barr), rare workshop images from the archives, and a few special surprises.

If you back at this level, you\u2019ll receive pre-registration for a ride in the compatibility racer (a project by Lauren Silbert, Jennifer Silbert, Suzanne Dikker, Matthias Oostrik, and Oliver Hess). On top of that, you'll receive a package of digital materials that includes: long media clips of Marina\u2019s brain activity while performing in Measuring the Magic of Mutual Gaze (by Suzanne Dikker and Matthias Oostrik), scans of journals handwritten by Marina and other participants during the experiment, and a few neuroscience-related surprises!\nNote: The compatibility racer is currently a traveling installation. This reward pre-registers you for a ride in the compatibility racer at an as-yet undetermined location. Upon the hopeful opening of MAI, the racer will be installed in the institute's science chamber in Hudson, New York. \n\nJoin our mailing list and add us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

The traveling MAI Prototype and one-off events are no substitute for having a fully operational arts center. We face losing momentum for the project during the two years it will take to renovate and build the institute. We risk losing your patience while we wait to move into our home, but the mission is alive and active. \n\nTo keep MAI\u2019s heart beating while the architects, contractors, and construction crews work toward completing the building, there are plans for community outreach projects in Hudson, public long durational performances such as marathon readings and forums for supporters and critics alike to discuss the project as it evolves. Your feedback is more valuable than you know. Ongoing dialogue is a crucial part of the development of MAI.\n\nWell before construction is complete, Marina and a distinguished curatorial team will use their expertise to shape the highest quality of exhibition and program offerings. We hope to invite artists across disciplines present to and premiere long durational works. We have already reached out or plan to reach out to a variety of artists, including but not limited to Damien Jalet, Sidi Larbi, Lynsey Peisinger, Rebecca Davis, Paula Garcia, Ragnar Kjartansson, Leandro Erlich, Maria Jose Arjona, Davide Balliano, Nico Vascellari, and Lotte and Till Steinbrenner. MAI will also establish educational partnerships to expand the institute\u2019s potential.\n\nWith experimental art comes yet unknown logistical restrictions. As plans for the building are in development, MAI and OMA are working closely to design and build a facility that will establish a number of flexible layouts for performance and rehearsal spaces, giving artists the greatest possible freedom to produce groundbreaking new work. \n\nMAI is located in a small town, which limits access, and not everyone who wants to visit the institute will be able to. Paying for a train ticket, a flight if necessary, even the admission fee alone, may be unfeasible for some. To enable the most visitors to experience MAI firsthand, we aim to develop programs such as the following: \n- A membership program with discounts and exclusive offers. \n- Designated hours when MAI will not charge admission. \n- Working with local businesses and partnering with well-established institutions to implement programs which offset the cost of travel to and within Hudson. \n- Sponsoring visitors based on need and merit through grants and stipends whenever possible.\n\nMAI, a very small team, is also in the midst of a flurry of activity. Seeking government and foundation support, planning quality programming and exhibitions that are in line with our mission, expanding our audience, specifically youth audiences and those with less exposure to performance art, are just a few of our ongoing initiatives. \n\nWe ask for your patience while we personally handle reward fulfillment and deeply appreciate your support of for this project.

It will be an around-the-world journey retracing the path of his career through landmark world events as he developed into one of the preeminent photojournalists of our time.\nBut the film will also illustrate the lesser known, but equally important, impacts Chris had on the lives of those he photographed, impacts that extended well beyond the moments he captured on film.\nChris covered almost every major world conflict since the late 1990s. He was a two-time finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and recipient of numerous photojournalism honors, including the prestigious Robert Capa Gold Medal.\nFor his friends and the people he came into contact with during the course of his work, he was so much more than a list of accomplishments, and that\u2019s what this film is about. It is an exploration, led by me -- Chris\u2019s childhood best friend and fellow journalist Greg Campbell -- to learn about the man behind the lens.\nGreg Campbell and Chris Hondros \u00a9 Evan Eile\nI met Chris when we were freshmen in high school. I was with him when he took some of his first photos as a young novice -- and I worked with him in Libya when he took some of his last as a seasoned professional who was preparing to transition into a new phase of his life.\nGreg and Chris in Libya \u00a9Nicole Tung\nWhile the film will explore the thousands of photos taken throughout his career -- documenting conflicts from Afghanistan and Pakistan to Sierra Leone and Angola -- it will linger on landmark moments in his development as both a photographer and as a person. Traveling to Liberia, Iraq and Libya, viewers will learn about the little-known stories behind several of Chris's milestone photos, stories that are new and surprising even to people who were as close to him as I was.\nIt's one of the reasons I'm doing this film -- to better understand the experiences that made him who he was.\nThe film will combine never-before-seen archival footage; new material filmed on location in Liberia, Iraq and Libya; and a deep selection of the work that made Chris one of the most revered and renowned photojournalists of his time. The result will be a portrait seen from numerous perspectives -- through the eyes of his colleagues, his friends, and the subjects of his photos.\nThat\u2019s where this Kickstarter project comes in.\nYour generous tax deductible donations will allow our crew to travel to Liberia for the first leg of production, to revisit the Liberian civil war on the 10th anniversary of when Chris took one of his most iconic photos. The image of government soldier Joseph Duo exulting after firing a rocket propelled grenade at rebel soldiers threatening to overrun Monrovia was an instant masterpiece of photojournalism. It captured the conflicting emotions of warfare in singularly artistic fashion and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2003.\nJoseph Duo in the Liberian Civil War \u00a9 Chris Hondros/Getty Images\nWhat makes the photo truly special, however, is the story behind it, when Chris returned to Liberia to find the man in it. That meeting had a thorough and lasting impact on Duo\u2019s life, and it embodies the humanity that Chris brought to his life and to his work.\nJoseph Duo and Chris Hondros reunited in Liberia\nBehind-the-lens stories like this, which can be found throughout his career, compose the unique tapestry of Chris\u2019s life and they shed light on who he was as a person.\nThey deserve to be told.

On the plane I began casually reading about a place dubbed the \"Pompeii of the North\" -- the town of Heimaey in the Westman Islands off the south coast of the country that experienced a sudden devastating eruption one January morning in 1973. The townspeople, committed to staying on their land, managed to stop the flow of lava from destroying their small but essential harbor, and then proceeded to grab shovels and begin digging their homes out of the ash. The story became an overwhelming inspiration for the series of images I made during my artist residency, as I was in awe of the relationship Icelanders have with the landscape so much more powerful than themselves, and how they live beside it, proudly, and in spite of the elements, their identities being so truly tied to the earth. Each year we see natural disasters growing more and more common around the world, and it is the story of Heimaey that attests to the power of human committment and determination to survive despite the destruction.\nNow, two years later, I have been approached by a publisher to make a monograph out of the photographs that were made for the project, entitled As if it should have been a quarry after a line from the Robert Frost poem, 'Directive'. It has been a very exciting few months as I prepare my very first book! However, while the publishers are contributing a certain amount to the project, I must also contribute a certain amount of money for production costs, and the sum has proved a challenging one for me to come up with on my own as a young artist and photographer.\nThat's why I need your support. In exchange for some very special rewards your contribution will make the completion of this book a reality.  It will be sold worldwide, and will be featured in the DAP Artbook fall catalogue.

In 2011, over 1000 attendees packed into One Arm Red and the Underwater Lounge in DUMBO to enjoy even more live performance, music, film and panel discussions on critical issues related to remix, sampling and creative appropriation. \nIn 2012, we are proud to announce our partnership with the MAshRome Film Festival in Rome, Italy, who will be bringing an exciting project from 'across the pond' featuring an original film by renowned Italian filmmaker Roberta Torre, which will be live scored by Brooklyn-based sound artist, Adriano Clemente, using a gesture-based generative music technique he developed using Microsoft Kinect. \nOther confirmed features for the 2012 edition of RE/Mixed Media include:\n* A live musical collaboration between Tessa Lena (of Tessa Makes Love) and Ian MacDonald - founding member of the bands King Crimson and Foreigner.\n* \"Live Art\" performance by legendary comic book artist Robert Sikoryak\n* Keynote lecture by Eduardo Navas, one of the leading theorists in the field of remix culture, and author of the upcoming book, Remix Theory, The Aesthetics of Sampling.\n* A panel discussion on \"Remixing Fan Culture\" - curated by Adam Bernard and featuring several music industry professionals and surprise guests. \n* A rare musical performance by the Trachtenberg Family Slideshow Players.\n* A live discussion of \"Remix in Literature\" including several notable authors, journalists and literary critics. \n* A live DJ remix \"battle\" & dance party produced in conjunction with our partners at Brooklyn's BBOX Radio.  \nSome of our current and past collaborating artists and organizations have included Paul D.

Several times we came close to cancelling the event, but people stepped up, worked together, and we're actually gonna make the 3rd Annual RE/Mixed Media Festival happen.\nAfter the hurricane...\nHurricane Sandy, devastating to so many New Yorkers and people all along the East Coast, left its mark on the festival as well. We all feel very fortunate that none of our homes (or lives, for that matter) were taken - festival planning was brought to a virtual standstill due the lack of transportation and power throughout much of the city. The biggest impact we felt was in the damage sustained by our venue, the Brooklyn Lyceum. The storm left the venue with damage to their building, equipment and electrical system and left us wondering if a festival would be possible after all. However, we kept plugging away, and help came in a few ways. First, we were lucky enough to gain the assistance of master technician Gregg Bellon, who put together a plan to patch up the problems as much as possible, and get the festival more or less back on track. Our biggest godsend, however, were the folks over at , who came to the rescue by donating generators, projectors, sound equipment and cabling - so that we could build our own infrastructure from the ground up. I honestly cannot say enough about these good people, without whose generosity and kindness the festival would simply be unable to happen. The past few days, we've all be laboring away and living on a few hours of sleep or less.. and this morning we'll cross our fingers and see how it goes.

Living where I do, in Bushwick, I managed to get through the storm without a scratch, and without even losing power or the Internet. \nProducing an event like this is challenging even under the best conditions, and Sandy really threw a giant stone in our path that we just didn't see coming.  With the subway shut down, a shortage of gasoline, and half the city in darkness,  getting things in order these final days leading up to the 3rd Annual RE/Mixed Media Festival has been a bit of a nightmare.

ACRE investigates and institutes programs designed to help artists develop, present, and discuss their practices by providing forums for idea exchange, interdisciplinary collaboration, and experimental projects.\nACRE's yearlong programming starts with its Annual Summer Residency. The residency takes place each July and August in rural southwest Wisconsin. Residents have the opportunity to expand upon their individual practices and to take part in programming within a collaborative community. Throughout the rest of the year ACRE operates programming in Chicago designed to further support the artists who attend the residency. For more information please visit ACREresidency.org\nWHAT WE ARE RAISING FUNDS FOR: \nHelp us raise funds for our summer residency kitchen program! The ACRE kitchen strives to foster a kitchen that does much more than just feed people. We make great effort to support the local farms and producers in our area, avoiding big box stores and commercial food distributors in order to contribute to the local economy and lessen our environmental impact. This year we will be initiating efforts to grow our own food directly on site and improving upon the large outdoor kitchen and dining area that we built last year. This will include  building more counter space and purchasing industrial-grade equipment.\nFunds raised through kickstarter will enable us to continue to source locally and conscientiously and also allow us to explore the many fascinating aspects of food and eating. Our dedicated and experienced chefs create a menu each year that reflects their perspectives as artists, highlighting local foods, creating surprising pairings of flavors, experimenting with innovative recipes and techniques, and integrating programming into the ritual of eating. \nThis year the ACRE kitchen has invited artists and chefs to share their knowledge, interact with the residency community, and contribute to meals. Projects and artists reflecting on our own place in the history of food and dining or who approach cuisine and eating as an artform, political act, or transcendent experience have been invited to present lectures, lead workshops and prepare special meals. Additionally planned is a foraging walk wherein plants collected from the grounds will be used for a meal, an instructional chicken slaughter workshop, and a lecture on the cross section of food and erotica. We will need to provide the materials for all of these planned workshops and activities. \nTo finish off the kitchen program each year, the kitchen staff creates KADABRA, a cookbook that is inspired by the culinary and creative activities of the past summer. KADABRA is a reflection of the residency experience itself and the philosophy of community and creativity behind ACRE's mission.\nHelp ACRE continue to develop this unique aspect of its Artist Residency Program.\nTHANK YOU!\nREWARDS!!!!!!!\nKADABRA VOL II:\nA collection of 25 Recipe Cards documenting recipes from the 2011 ACRE kitchen with art work by ACRE residents, staff, and visiting artists.

These marks, sometimes invisible, are the historic markers of human life; they trigger narrative, memory and the intimate details of an individual's emotional and cultural legacy. I compile these photographs, together with the accounts they elicit, to trace a tiny part of our collective human story.\nI intend to start in a month long artist residency in Spain and to eventually make my way north towards the Arctic Circle.

Our world is an amalgamation of histories, memories and the perennial succession of overlapping narratives. From the scars we carry to the memory of a loved one's embrace, we come dressed in our experiences.\nI photograph people within their environment. I ask about physical recollection: where has the world touched you? Where has it left a profound memory?\nIn the case of Kensington, Philadelphia, for example, where the unemployment rate hovers at 50%, scars from street fights, jail, and preventable illnesses prevail. Whereas with college students, I collect tales of mischief, travel and first love.\nI also photograph the landscapes near where people live and work -- the in-between places -- as well as the detritus left behind there. This overlooked topography holds a luminous power all its own; it gives testament to transience and anonymity, a stark contrast to the very personal portraits I take of its inhabitants.\nTo me a scar is a map; a placeholder for the untellable.

This video project will explore, analyze and deconstruct some of the most common tropes and stereotypes of female characters in games.  The series will highlight the larger recurring patterns and conventions used within the gaming industry rather than just focusing on the worst offenders.  I\u2019m going to need your help to make it happen!\nAs a gamer, a pop culture critic and a fan, I\u2019m always working to balance my enjoyment of media while simultaneously being critical of problematic gender representations. With my video web series Feminist Frequency,  I look at the way women are portrayed in mass media and the impact they have on our culture and society.\nTHE PROJECT\nWith your help, I\u2019ll produce a 5-video series (now expanded to 12 videos) entitled Tropes vs Women in Video Games, exploring female character stereotypes throughout the history of the gaming industry.  This ambitious project will primarily focus on these reoccurring tropes: \nDamsel in Distress - Video #1\nThe Fighting F#@k Toy - Video #2\nThe Sexy Sidekick - Video #3\nThe Sexy Villainess - Video #4\nBackground Decoration - Video #5\n1st Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nVoodoo Priestess/Tribal Sorceress - Video #6\nWomen as Reward - Video #7\nMrs. Male Character - Video #8\nUnattractive Equals Evil - Video #9\nMan with Boobs - Video #10\nPositive Female Characters! - Video #11\n2nd Stretch Goal Achieved! \nLet's Bump up the Production Quality!\n3rd Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nTropes vs Women in Video Games Classroom Curriculum \nVideo #12 - Top 10 Most Common Defenses of Sexism in Games\nEach video will be between 10 and 20 minutes long and available online for free for everyone and anyone to watch, share and use.\nCreating these videos take a lot of time and money to produce. I will be researching and playing hundreds of titles from across the gaming industry (including some truly awful games that I wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone!). Your support will go towards production costs, equipment, games and downloadable content.\nPlease pledge any amount you can and become a backer of Feminist Frequency\u2019s Tropes vs Women in Video Games!\nFeminist Frequency is an ongoing web series of video commentaries focusing on representations of gender, race, class, sexuality and ability in pop culture. \nLast year I released a video series called Tropes vs Women analyzing female representations in the mainstream media.  This previous series was highly successful and shared all over the web.  Not only did it provide people the language to understand the media they were engaging with, but it's even served as a guide for some professional writers and media creators to actively avoid gendered character stereotypes and create more in-depth, and more engaging female characters.  \nHelp me create another successful video series that will contribute to and help amplify the existing conversations happening about female characters in games and maybe even get the attention of the gaming industry to start creating more interesting, engaging and complex female characters, that avoid the standard boring cliches.\nVisit FeministFrequency.com to see examples of my previous video work.\nKickstarter doesn't have subtitle integration with their videos so I've posted a full transcript of the video here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Free Classroom Curriculum is here!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nWe are thrilled to announce that an outstanding curriculum supporting the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games series is now available!
