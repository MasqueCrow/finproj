This will be arranged via the Pledge Manager, and more information will be posted soon.\nThe cost of shipping is not included in your pledge, and will be added after the conclusion of the campaign through the pledge manager.\nI will provide you all with full instructions when the time comes. I am still finalising the exact shipping costs, but to give you a rough idea here are a couple of preliminary estimates:\nTREASURE MAP: - \u00a30 unless used to purchase miniatures in the campaign.\nBOGLIN/OURK/BREWZERKER: \u00a34 to the UK, \u00a312 EU (Tracked Shipping) \u00a315 US (Tracked shipping), \u00a315 ROW (Tracked Shipping).\nDREAMEATER: \u00a35 to the UK, \u00a315 EU (Tracked Shipping) \u00a320 US (Tracked shipping), \u00a318 ROW (Tracked Shipping).\nThese estimates may increase if you purchase a large number of additional models on top of your core pledge. The final shipping costs are subject to change, and will be based on your location and specific rewards.\nIf you are backing from outside of the UK, please be aware of any import or customs fees your country will charge you. Warploque Miniatures is not a VAT registered business, and as such your country may charge you VAT on your shipment. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. My father is our resin caster, my mother is in charge of packing and shipment, and our metal caster is a tried and tested craftsman we have worked with for over five years.\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products all of the initial models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been cast, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in. I will be relying on Work in Progress sculpts and concept art for some of the stretch goals, but be assured that they will be completed and cast in a timely manner once the campaign has been funded.\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing an overly long list of stretch goals, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\n\nThis is the 10th Kickstarter that Warploque Miniatures has run, and we have a reputation amongst our community for not only delivering a high quality product, but delivering it on time.

Legendary Kingdoms is a gamebook campaign, where you lead a party of adventurers in a world that adapts to your actions. Venture into ancient ruins, pick a side and lead an army into battle, sail the high seas on your own warship, defeat tyrants or restore them to power. Along the way your party will increase in skill, wealth and renown, allowing them to take on more challenging adventures. Reach the heights of power and you may uncover a dreadful threat to the world itself and go on a mission that spans all six gamebooks in the series.\nSo is this a Solo Gamebook or an RPG?\nThe Legendary Kingdoms series has been designed to be played solo, as a choose your own adventure gamebook. However, as you lead a party of four adventurers on an epic journey in a truly sandbox world, we have had playthroughs where one person has acted as the GM (Narrator) and four friends have taken on a character each.\nIt works just as well being played online as it does around a table.\nPlaytesters and backers have commented on how good this book is for someone who would love to have a go at being a GM, but are daunted by the task. With simple combat rules and the turns already written out, where better to have your first go at being a GM, than in Legendary Kingdoms.\nFollow the link below and download a free sample and give it a go.\nWe are raising funds to produce the second book in the series, Book Two: Crown and Tower. Book One is already in print, and you can buy it here, or get it as part of a pledge bundle when you order Book Two. You can also play a fully illustrated free sample of book one here to experience a little of the gamebook adventure.\n\nIn total, Spidermind Games is planning to produce six titles in the legendary Kingdoms series. With your help we can bring book two, 'Crown & Tower' to life and begin work on the next in the series. It is our plan to release one title a year, completing the collection in 2025.\nYou can explore the world of Legendary Kingdoms in any order you choose. Each book is dedicated to a particular geographic area, but you can travel between books at will by walking or sailing off the edge of the map. Each book features dozens of quests and locations with an approximate 12+ hours of content in each.\nFeatures of Legendary Kingdoms\nA world that adapts to your choices. The book \u2018remembers\u2019 the friends you make and enemies you defeat. Slain kings will stay dead, and as you grow in fame people\u2019s reactions to you will also change.\nA changing world. Depending on your choices, new avenues of adventure, or new trouble, could await you in locations you have previously explored.\nA detailed world. From the lawless deserts of the Valley of Bones, to the feudal hierarchies of the Kingdom of Royce. Embrace the wild freedoms of the buccaneering Splintered Isles, or face morbid darkness in the forges of Drakehallow.  Be the first to map the unexplored Savage Lands, or dethrone a corrupt king in the ludicrously wealthy Duchy of Pendrilor. Multi-book spanning quests allow you to further your ambitions in distant courts, and make friends in foreign nations that might help you when you visit their homeland.\nParty based adventures. You are not alone, but can combine the skills of up to four different characters in your party.\nThe game can be played solo or in a group.  It also works online with one player acting as the reader!  A good lockdown game.\nCharacters that are grounded in the Legendary Kingdoms world. Each party member has ties to a different book in the series, and each has unresolved issues in their homeland. Characters can seek redemption, seize power, exact revenge or fall in love with other party members.\nFast paced but tactical personal combat.\nRaise an army and fight mass combat battles with thousands of soldiers on each side. Conquered one realm? Transfer troops from one book to another if you can capture city-ports with access to ships.\nSail the world on your own ship. Gather an armada and defeat powerful rulers with your own fleet of warships. Or peacefully trade goods between rich ports.\nPowerful magic unlocks secrets galore! Think you\u2019ve completely explored an area? Discover the Shadow Door spell and find hidden paths in old dungeons. Learn how to Teleport and access areas impossible to find without magic. Bypass a foe\u2019s defences by using Teleport Circle to appear inside their fortress, allowing you to rob them blind.\nForge magic items with magical weaves. Raise armies with gold bullion. Raid vaults to find treasures that provide great wealth and power.\nA globe-spanning mega plot. Concealed within the books are hints of a deadly and growing danger. When you hit the heights of power you might be able to unravel a conspiracy that threatens the very world itself.\n What are the reviewers saying...\nBecca Scott from Good Time Society tells you everything you need to know about Crown & Tower.\nDoug from 2+Tough takes us into the Arena at the beginning of his adventure.\n Joe, Hannah and Alex over at Roll for Review take a look at Crown & Tower and Joe is impressed...\nTodd from ClassicRolePlayer did a review and playthrough of book 1 a few weeks back.\nEach book in the Legendary Kingdom series covers a different geographic area on the world map. These region books each have a more detailed, zoomed-in version of the map. Every location on the map can be reached, either on foot, by sea or by magical transportation (if you possess such a power). You can go back and forth between books at will \u2013 just walk or sail off the edge of the map.\nBook 1: The Valley of Bones takes place in a desert wilderness where tyrant kings oppress the teeming masses in a land strewn with ancient artefacts and ruins. But their grip on power is fragile \u2026 and the citizenry are ripe for revolution. It is a land of blood and sand, where civilisation is rare and terrible beasts roam freely.\nBook 2: Crown and Tower takes place in the high-medieval realm of Longport Bay, torn apart by the struggle for power between two noble families. Baron Baldwin Dayne lies dying, and his children must grasp the mantle of power, or see their family destroyed forever. Ancient ruins await plunder and exploration, and savage armies hang on the borders, waiting for the county to weaken itself with its incessant warring. Glittering steel, the flash of long forgotten magics, and terrible monsters all wait to be found as you build your strength for the final confrontation.\nBook 3: Pirates of the Splintered Isles is set in a tropical paradise, where competition for spice has the great powers of the world vying for domination.\nBook 4: The Gilded Throne covers the duchy of Pendrilor, seat of the corrupt king of Royce. Wealth drips from its ports, but it is blind to an encroaching threat which could see it wiped from the globe!\nBook 5: The Savage Lands is set in an untamed wilderness, unmapped by civilised realms. A terrible secret lurks in its forgotten grottos and sky-touching mountains.\nBook 6: Drakehallow is a gas-powered hell of furnaces and sorcery. The population cram into over-packed, crumbling cities for fear of encountering the monstrous creations of their depraved industry. \nMore Art\nWe are commissioning 20 more pieces of art for the book including a more detailed pictorial journey through the city of Longport Bay.\n \u2018The Sonderleign Drops\u2019\nA brand new stand alone adventure.\n\u201cThere is something I desire, but it is located in a place my conventional agents will not go. Deep in the woods to the northwest are the Sonderleign Drops, the ruins of a fantastic underground city. Many have attempted to excavate and explore it in the past, but even the largest expeditions have failed.\u201d\nThis adventure is on top of a book, already with more that 900 references and will test your team but the rewards are well worth it.\u201d\nYet More Art\nTravelling the County of Longport Bay this art expansion creates more images of the rich and diverse land you are exploring.\n\n\u2018Missing, Presumed Dead\u2019\nA second brand new adventure takes your team on a mission to find an important officer of the crown who has gone missing. This particular man is a clerk at the seigneurial office. Its role is to determine which nobles own which piece of land, which family members are permitted to inherit titles, and what legal privileges the ownership of certain noble ranks grant in tax and trade law. It is pretty dry stuff, but the decisions of the seigneurial office can ruin lesser families or provoke war between greater ones.\nWhere is he and why did he suddenly disappear?\nProduction Upgrade\nCollectors Edition:-\nIt was suggested that we have dust covers for the collectors editions, so that these premium copies of the Legendary Kingdoms series can enjoy the same amazing cover art that the softbacks do. We loved the suggestion and so as soon as this stretch is hit we will include dust covers on all current and future current and future volumes of the LK Collectors Edition.\nSoftback Edition:-\nHaving spoken to the printers the book will now with thicker more sturdy paper but at no extra cost. This upgrade will extend the life of the book and give the pages a smoother feel and a crisper print.\n\u2018Maw of Abraxas\u2019\nYou are wandering the bleak Mawlands, an area of scrubland just north of the Salvar Rise, a chain of mountains that shields the county of Longport Bay from the Savage Lands to the south.\nThe area gets its name from the terrifying cave network known as the Maw of Abraxas, which plunges into the mountain foothills. It has a terrifying reputation as a place of death, although rumours persist of great treasures hidden away in its secret vaults.\nTempted?\nEven More Art\nGetting to know the characters more with extra art covering even more of the key moments in your adventures.\nBookmark Ribbon and a Character Sheet Upgrade\nAnother great suggestion from our backers is the very useful page holder ribbon and it would be our pleasure to be able to include this in every Collectors Edition copy.\nWe have also taken a look at the free character sheet everyone can download as a pdf and decided it need the same art upgrade as the maps. We will show off the new and improved version here on the updates when it has been complete.\nA Brand New Adventure, played live on our Facebook Group.\nPlay Legendary Kingdoms with players across the world on Facebook!  If this target is reached, Legendary Kingdoms author Oliver Hulme will create a unique adventure that will update on Facebook every week.  Players worldwide will help in designing party members, and will jointly decide what actions to take that week via Facebook polls.\nCreate your own characters or choose from six adventurers with their own deep backstory in the world, each of whom have personalised quests and interactions with the plot. Your characters can gain special powers, fall in love, seek revenge, become lords and ladies and encounter friends, family and enemies from their youths. Each of the six starting characters were brought up in a different part of the world, and all have their own special quests to resolve in their homeland.\n(or Nitty-gritty)\nLegendary Kingdoms uses a success-based dice system for skill checks and combat. Each party-member has a skill value in each of the five main skills of the game (Fighting, Stealth, Lore, Survival and Charisma). Each skill point allows you to roll a single die. Sar Jessica Dayne, for instance, has a Fighting skill of 5, which means she can roll 5 dice whenever she makes any Fighting skill checks. Your party will either make skill-checks individually, if they are separated, or as a team if more than one person can help with a check.\nYour skills can improve through experience or by finding special items. Find a steel longsword (Fighting +2) and you can improve your Fighting skill by 2, for instance. As you play, you will have to decide if you want your party-members to specialise in certain skills, or have them generally improve all their skills. Both ideas have merit. Specialisation is powerful when you are working as a team \u2026 but if your party has an argument or someone wanders off on their own, you might prefer it if everyone was equipped to handle everything. Just like real life, you won\u2019t always be able to count on your friends being around all the time!\nThe game keeps track of events through the use of codes. Save an old man and his family from the city guards and you might gain the code A15. Every so often, the book will ask you if you have a code. Having the code A15 will stop you from constantly encountering old men being hassled by the city guards every time you walk down the street!\nThe best way to see how the game works is by playing it. You can download the Kickstarter sample here.\nFree PDF Quickstart\nIf you have ever played Fighting Fantasy or Choose Your Own Adventure books, you have the basic idea of what a gamebook looks like. In terms of how it plays, it is quite similar structurally to Fabled Lands by Dave Morris & Jamie Thomson. That book series also featured a number of connected books that you could wander between at will. Long term, Legendary Kingdoms feels quite similar to Sorcery by Steve Jackson, in that it has a grand quest, sorcery is rare and powerful, and there is a final goal to achieve. There is also just a whiff of Way of the Tiger by Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson, mainly through Akihiro and his quest for enlightenment.\nLegendary Kingdoms itself is a zero to hero narrative. You begin as penniless slaves, and end the game becoming great generals who make or break the future of the world based on your actions. The main difference with games like Sorcery or Destiny Quest is that you decide the order you want to do it. There are many ways into the main super-plot of the books, and different parties will experience different routes in. Forgive us for being cryptic \u2026 but we don\u2019t want to ruin the plot!\nThat said, each book is also very self-contained. There are several dozen independent quests, one \u2018book quest\u2019 which involves the epic clash of armies, one character quest, where the history and goals of one of the pre-generated characters is explored in depth, and a number of minor party-member events. These minor events allow your party members to fall in love, become enemies, save each other\u2019s lives, or just give each other time to shine.\n\"I enjoyed the preview so much that I purchased the pdf of Book 1 to keep playing!\" \n- Emma\n\n\"Loving the sample book - really high quality while still retaining that \u2018retro\u2019 feel.\"\n- Simon\n\n\"I downloaded the demo and then played it.

By backing this project you are agreeing to have your card charged with the amount you pledge at the project end, which is Thursday 15th April.\nFollowing the end of the campaign, usually a few weeks later, we will send you a post campaign survey where you will confirm your pledge level (and get a chance to upgrade if you wish), give us your address details and settle the postage. If you have ordered both books in the softcover form, you will be given the option of splitting the postage and being sent book 1 straight away and then book 2 when production is complete (estimated to be September).\nThis process will have you making two payments, the first for the pledge, a charging process handled by Kickstarter which will happen on or around 15th April, and then the second for postage and any upgrades, which is handled by the company sending you the survey. For this campaign we will be using a company called Backer Kit.\nSo how do I make a pledge?\nAt the top of the campaign page you will see the green \u201cBack this project\u201d button. Alternatively, you can scroll down to select a reward tier.\nAfter selecting the tier you wish to pledge for, check the amount being pledged and select 'continue' to proceed.\nYou will then be taken through to the payments page where you\u2019ll be prompted to enter your payment details. To complete your pledge, click the green \u201cPledge\" button and you\u2019ll be all set!\nYou should receive a confirmation email to confirm that you are now a backer of the project. As long as we are successfully funded, your card will be charged when the campaign ends.\n\nMarketed & Promoted by  \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox, the tech marketing company behind many successful Kickstarters.

His Age of Reptiles graphic novels are universally acclaimed for their stunning depiction of dinosaurs and prehistory. With his work as a storyboard artist and character designer for films including Apollo 13, Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Incredibles, Men in Black, and Wall-e, Delgado is also one of Hollywood's leading conceptual designers. And his latest endeavor just might be his most ambitious creation to date.\nThe all-new illustrated novel DRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA, which features an original story and more than 20 lavish illustrations, reimagines Bram Stoker\u2019s classic vampire story like you've never seen it before.\n\u201cRicardo Delgado's reimagining of Dracula is strange and bold and brilliantly original. I love it and WOULD be stunned by it if it wasn't coming from Ricardo. But brilliant is pretty much what I've come to expect from him. Still... He may have surpassed his usual brilliance here.\u201d\n\u2014Mike Mignola, creator of Hellboy\nIn DRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA, the year is 1899. Young Solicitor Jonathan Harker braves ghosts, demons, living skeletons, and armies of rats\u2014all of which pale in comparison to his encounters with Dracula of Transylvania, the Son of Satan. The demonic, shapeshifting vampire imposes his wrath, malice and vengeance upon an England about to enter the Modern Era.\n\u201cRicardo Delgado does for vampires what he has done for dinosaurs! His elegant and bloody take on Stoker's classic tale is refreshingly original and scary.\u201d\n\u2014John Landis, Director of An American Werewolf in London and Thriller\n\nDRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA supports and builds upon Stoker\u2019s classic and haunting original story, but this is most certainly not your parents' Dracula. This personification of the Nosferatu king is dark and powerful, a malevolent antagonist who suffers no fools, accepts no failure and crushes anyone in his path. Dracula is vileness incarnate, a pure thing of Hell. He\u2019s spent the past thousand years putting sword to flesh and tearing at the tapestry of history as the son of Satan himself. Kings, Popes and armies fear Dracula. And so should you.\n\u201cDark and disturbing but so BEAUTIFUL. I am always mesmerized by his artwork, now after this, it\u2019ll be hard to sleep. Thanks Ricardo!\u201d\n\u2014Genndy Tartakovsky, creator of Primal and Samurai Jack\n\n\u201cRicardo Delgado breathes new life into the prince of the undead like he has done with every genre he has worked in!\u201d\n\u2014Geof Darrow, creator of Shaolin Cowboy, conceptual designer for The Matrix films\nDRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA is footnoted throughout with historical facts from the ancient to the modern world that bring texture to the sprawling and haunting adventure. Murder among English tombstones! Daring chases through the infamous underground Paris Ossuaries! A spectacular gladiatorial battle within Rome's Colosseum during the Witching Hour! And finally, a fever-pitch chase through Europe to the most terrifying place on earth: Castle Dracula.\nThe DRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA Kickstarter will have multiple tiers and rewards available for backers, including signed leather-bound hardcover copies of the book, limited edition prints, original sketches, and an exclusive clamshell/bookplate.\nDRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA is epic gothic storytelling with the pulse-pounding pace of the modern thriller, a cross between THE EXORCIST and the LORD OF THE RINGS. It is a brilliant and dark reimagining of the classic original story with a fascinating new perspective on one of literature\u2019s most feared characters.\nSigned Leather-Bound Edition\n\n\u201cDelgado\u2019s work always impresses. And the illustrations for his Dracula novel are yet another example of his fantastic design sense and his absolutely horrifically messed up imagination!\u201d\n\u2014Tim Miller, director of Deadpool and Terminator: Dark Fate\n\n\u201cIf you thought Ricardo Delgado was a great dinosaur artist... well, you're right\u2014he is! But with his Dracula book, Ricardo has outdone himself. He has dramatically risen to a new artistic plateau in a genre and territory previously unassociated with him. Dracula will long be remembered as a major marker in Delgado's impressive body of work as a graphic storytelling artist.\u201d\n\u2014William Stout, author of The New Dinosaurs\n\u201cStunning artwork and unforgettable prose. Delgado\u2019s book is a must-have for every Horror and vampire fan.\u201d\n\u2014Gary Rhodes, Ph.D, author of The Birth of the American Horror Film and writer/director of Lugosi: Hollywood\u2019s Dracula\n\n\u201cDelgado takes us on a wild ride as he skillfully introduces  the next generation of Vampire hunters in a style reminiscent of the original Dracula novel.\u201d\n\u2014Dacre Stoker, co-author of Dracula the Undead and Dracul and great-grand-nephew of Bram Stoker\nWriter & Artist Ricardo Delgado\n The Book\n*Final Art/Design May Change\nDelgado's Dracula of Transylvania is presented in two hardcover versions.

I am also a traditional sculptor, who pushes putty to create pieces for my tabletop fantasy game ArcWorlde: Second Edition, and my driving goal is to recreate the same hand-made, characterful feel with my digitally sculpted miniatures too!\nFor the first Digital Workshop: Printed Kickstarter, I am providing high quality 3D prints of the first 6 months of my digitally sculpted work - Goblins, Dwarves and Bullywugs.\nRather than being cast in resin or metal like other Warploque Miniatures releases, each Digital Workshop: Printed miniature is 3D printed.  These highly detailed resin prints are perfect for painting and table top gaming, as they are strong, flexible and take to paint wonderfully.\n\n\nAn example of our unpainted 3D printed miniatures\nAn example of one of our unpainted 3D printed miniatures\nThe cost of shipping is not included in your pledge, and will be added after the conclusion of the campaign through the pledge manager.\nI will provide you all with full instructions when the time comes. I am still finalising the exact shipping costs, but to give you a rough idea here are a couple of preliminary estimates:\nUK - \u00a34\nGermany - \u00a35\nRest of EU - \u00a310\nUS/Canada - \u00a310\nAustralia - \u00a310\nROW - \u00a310\nThese estimates may increase if you purchase a large number of additional models on top of your core pledge. The final shipping costs are subject to change, and will be based on your location and specific rewards.\nIf you would like to combine your shipping with friends to save on postage, please get in touch and we will be happy to arrange something for you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need printing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimize potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. \n\nThis is our first 3D printed Kickstarter, and as such there will be a lot to learn. I am working with experienced and extremely talented 3D printing specialists across the world to fulfil this project, with back-up options if there are unexpected delays\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products, all of the models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been printed, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in. \n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing an overly long list of stretch goals, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\n\nThis is the 9th Kickstarter that Warploque Miniatures has run, and we have a reputation amongst our community for not only delivering a high quality product, but delivering it on time.

In 2020, together we released dry brushes that helped new and advanced painters take their gaming miniatures to the next level! The combined 4,644 BACKERS most frequently asked question is \"Do you make smaller sizes?\" Well, NOW I DO. If you're ready to join the army of painters, hobbyists, gamers, crafters, terrain builders and artists you found the campaign you were looking for.\nGhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Paint Brush Set is the answer to the question \"will you make a size #000?\" Instead of a single new brush added to the mega popular Ghost Brush line I wanted to create a set that will be your go to when you need to conquer the smallest of details packed into the wonderful miniatures and models we paint today! You probably already know the feeling of using wonderful new paint brushes but I invite you to join the #GhostBrush community and crush your hobby painting goals!\n \"Art is never finished, only abandoned.\"  Leonardo da Vinci\n\nMy name is Jeff Beyer. We met the last two years when 4,644 Backers gave me their trust and support in helping bring the Ghost Miniature Paintbrushes to life! With online sales, retail shops, and the last two Kickstarter campaigns, thousands of people are painting with these brushes! You can find me on Youtube under the name RedBeardBoss and on Instagram @Sleepwalkair_brush and I love painting. These past years we showed the bigger companies we wanted quality miniature painting supplies at a fair price. I'm not interested in charging you to cover the bill so I can hire big name studio painters in an attempt to convince you these brushes will bring you 1st place golden trophies. I could send every hobby channel on Youtube a free set and pay them to tell you how great these are but I'm not going to do that either. All you have to do is read the comments from the last TWO campaigns and feel proud knowing you are helping build a community of painters and hobbyists who simply love putting paint on little plastic figures.\nPrecision\nWith your support, we will help thousands of new artists fall in love with miniature painting.\nThank you for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter and happy painting!\nI would like to introduce you to the GhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Miniature Paint Brush Set.\n\nThis new set of 9 ultra fine detail brushes includes 7 rounds, a flat, and a chisel shaped brush. These not only cover you for the smallest of miniature details but imagine the confidence in being able to choose the perfect shape and size for the task! This set is made with the same beloved white nylon hair of the other Ghost Paint Brushes. The birch wood handles of the new GhosTiny range are thicker and more comfortable to hold when you're focused on getting those tiny highlights in those hard to reach spaces.\nAccuracy\nUltra Fine Point\nDon't forget the original Ghost Brush Set\nOriginal 8 round Ghost Brushes and 2 Ghost Dry Brushes\nIf you need a set or two of the original Ghost Brushes I have included pledges just for you! I set out to design the Ghost Brush specifically to help people paint miniatures and people love them! The wide range of sizes were chosen to give you the flexibility to paint the tiniest buckle on your favorite character\u2019s shoe to the massive wings of a terrifying dragon! The white nylon hair holds a nice point compared to most synthetic brushes and is soft enough to achieve smooth blends. Finally, the birch wood handle gives you the feel of being an artist right in your hand. I want you to improve as a painter by having access to quality brushes that get the job done and don't break the bank!\nLet's Make The GHOST Dry Brush Size #0D!\n\nThe new Ghost Dry Brush #0D has already been designed, tested, and I can include once we reach $50,000. This goal may sound high but the last campaign was over triple this amount! This brush is small but packs quite a punch! It has has a thinner handle than the #1D and #2D in this range and is exactly what you asked for. A smaller Ghost Dry Brush! When the stretch goal of $50,000 is obliterated all eligible pledges will have this brush included!!!! The only 2 pledges not eligible will be the Classic Pledges.\n#2D, #1D, #0D\nSome minis are worth spilling paint for! But we won't be spilling any today!\nDesigner @polymorph_miniatures used his ungodly skill to help bring my concept for this amazing new add-on to life! The Necro Paint Pot Holder is the most entrancing way to hold your washes and paints during use to prevent accidentally spilling them. This diabolic creation is resin and will look truly wicked on your paint table. This is a perfect project for your new Ghost Dry Brushes and I can't wait to see how you all paint them to display in your hobby area\nNecro Paint Pot Holder\nFun to paint!\nDo you own a game store?\n\nDo you own a commission paint studio?\n\nDo you need a ton of paintbrushes?\nRetailer Display Rack\nThe retail pledge is for you! You will receive 5 GhosTiny Sets and a 100 Ghost Brushes and a display rack to entice customers! The display rack has 96 holes and I will include some signs with the rack! This pledge is also open for everyone who needs a lot of paintbrushes! If you own a retail store and your customers love these brushes I will be able to fulfill orders right away to keep your display rack full! Don't forget the retail pledges also receive stretch goals earned during the campaign!\nCare for your Ghost Brush\nThe Ghost white nylon hair not only looks great but will help you create better painting habits. Always remember to load the brush with paint only about half way to avoid getting paint in your ferrule. Getting paint inside the ferrule is the fastest way to ruin your brush.\n\nClean your brushes frequently with water and use brush soap after painting to make sure no paint residue is left inside the bristles. The white nylon hair will change color from use but it is good practice when cleaning your brushes to try and get them as clean as possible.\nAll paint brushes are designed to pull paint and this one is no different; however, as miniature painters, we tend to use a stabbing motion with our brushes to push paint into small details. This push motion causes the tip of your synthetic brushes to curl over time. To reduce this, use a pulling motion with your brushes as much as possible and if you absolutely need to push paint into a small area, make sure you use very gentle pressure.\nNEVER leave your Ghost Brush or any paintbrush sitting submerged in water! This will not only destroy your wonderful sharp tip, it will cause the wood handle to swell and ruin your whole brush. Seriously, stop dropping your brushes hair-down inside a water cup. Instead, swish the brush back and forth in the water to remove paint, then wipe on a towel to make sure no paint is left within the bristles.\nThese tips will help your new favorite paintbrush enjoy a longer life.\nGhost Brush Family Photo\nGhost Brush Classic Pledge\nIf you missed out on the first two campaigns these pledges are for YOU. These pledges are for the painter who wants the original sets of Ghost brushes but doesn't want the new GhosTiny set. An advantage of this pledge is the brushes are at a great price, ready to be shipped and will be sent out right away!

This project has almost no risk because I am willing to fully fund the manufacturer to get these brushes made. This is what allows me to keep the goal much lower than total cost of the project. To help ensure a better product and experience to all of my backers, I will double check quality control from the factory. Assuming everything goes smooth, I can begin shipping your orders in July.

Thanks to your overwhelming generosity,  Pine is funded and we met a few stretch goals, ensuring we'll be able to give this story the treatment it deserves! \nThe last 30 days have been amazing. So much so we ran out of superlatives a while ago! Tom and I are truly grateful to be backed by all of you.\nThank you again,\nTom & Najati\nPine is a story-driven game about loss and letting go, told from the perspective of a grieving woodworker. A blend of illustration, animation, music, and sound, Pine tells its story wordlessly through interactions that pull you into the woodworker's experience as he struggles to hold on to his past. \nThe woodworker came to illustrator Tom Booth in a moment of deep isolation following a tragic loss. Initially wary of sharing such a personal work, Tom was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from friends and fans after he posted the first image of the woodworker. Their own stories of loss let Tom know that he wasn't alone in grieving.\nWe created this campaign so we could tell the woodworker's story with the hope that it can be a reminder to anyone dealing with their own grief that they are not alone.\nPLAY\n\nWe come to Kickstarter to ask for your help in creating something truly meaningful and heartfelt. Thanks to your support, we get to tell the woodworker's story! Help us spread the word so we can make Pine even better by meeting some of our stretch goals! Thank you to all our backers that got us here, and thank you to everyone stopping by for getting us even further!\n\nNot quite a video game and not quite a graphic novel, Pine blends mediums to pull you into the woodworker's world.\nInteractive moments let you share the woodworker's struggles, turning Pine's animated scenes into personal experiences. \nThe sounds of the world and an original score will combine with Pine's visual and interactive moments to bring you deeper into the woodworker's journey. \nNorthwest Soundscapes (Skywalker Sound, Sucker Punch Productions) is helping with sound design, and the score will be written alongside the game. \nHere's a list of the updates that can't be reflected in the reward descriptions, as they get locked after someone chooses them.\nBecause you all met the early funding challenge, all backers will get the bonus landscape of the woodworker's valley as a high-res wallpaper for desktop and mobile!\nEveryone who was part of the first 80k will get the exclusive soundscape, too.\nThere will be a total of seven prints to choose from: five of Tom's classic illustrations of the woodworker and two new images exclusive to the Kickstarter. Check out Update #4 to see the five that have been revealed!\nThere are add-ons for print bundles, carving mini figures, and the STL of the woodworkers.\nSee the designs for the carving mini figures in Update #7.\nCheck out past updates to see what's been going on with the campaign. Help us make Pine even better by spreading the word and sharing Pine with friends and fans of graphic novels and games!\nTom drew the first illustration of the woodworker over a long night late in the winter of 2019. It was the most personal thing he'd ever drawn, and Tom almost didn't share the image. \nOriginal sketch of woodworker. February 2019\nWhen he did, the response was overwhelming. Despite being born from an extremely personal experience, the woodworker resonated deeply with Tom's audience.\nThere was an outpouring of support from his fans, many of them thanking him for sharing the image. Some were so inspired that they created truly spectacular 3D models, fan drawings, and actual wood carvings\u2014a few even got tattoos!  \nAs Tom posted more images, the woodworker found his way around the internet. From the front page of Reddit to My Modern Met, everywhere the woodworker went, people wanted to know more about him. It was clear that Tom had found a story that needed to be told.\nIn the spring of 2019 we started brainstorming how to tell this story in a special way. Inspired by titles like Florence and, later, If Found..., we thought a story-driven game would be perfect for Pine.  \nSample of thumbnail storyboards.\nSince then we've fleshed out the rest of the story, storyboarded it, built a few prototypes, worked up enough courage to quit our day jobs, founded a company, and made a lovely version of FreeCell to get some practice publishing mobile games. It's been a busy couple of years!\nPrototyping one of Pine's interactive scenes\nEven with all that done, the work is really just beginning. We think there's a little over a year of work left on Pine, full of drawing, animating, programming, composing music, putting it all together, and testing.\nThat's what the funding from this campaign will allow us to do.\n\nAt our lowest funding goal, Pine will be released on iOS and Android. Release on Steam and Switch are stretch goals. All backers that pledge $5 or more will be able to play Pine on the platform of their choice.\nWe don't want to be presumptuous about how this campaign will go, but we do want to make sure that whatever we raise past our goal will go towards making Pine even better. For more info on the project budget, see the section after the rewards.\n* See the note in \"Risks and challenges\" below about publishing to the Switch.\nWe hope the rewards convey how much your support means to us. Every pledge receives our deepest appreciation and we tried to make each reward a meaningful new way to experience Pine. \nLook below the reward tree for details on the limited rewards.\nThe Backer Forest is our way to say a special thank you to those who play a big role in bringing Pine to life. After finishing Pine, you'll be able to explore the forest and maybe find your name there, along with everyone else who made a sizable contribution to the campaign.\nWe've also added a few add-ons since launching the campaign! The second and third are only available with reward tiers that already have a physical component.\n Woodworker carving STL file: This is the 3D model of the woodworker by Ismael Nieto. We had a couple requests for this add-on so that backers with their own 3D printers could print their own woodworker. For personal use only, of course!\n Additional prints and print bundles: If you've been reading the updates you know that there are now going to be a total of 7 images to select from. These add-ons let you get all the prints you want with your pledge! \n Additional carving mini figures: Our backers in the US can also add an additional carving mini figure to their pledge.\nThese handsome prints will be equally at home in your game room or museum room. Choose from the seven print options or let us know if there's a different image you have in mind and we'll see what we can do!\nThese prints will be signed by Tom and include a personal thank you note from him and Najati. You'll also get thanked in the credits after the story.\nYou're right, that woodworker figure isn't painted ... yet! When we were initially brainstorming ideas for this Kickstarter, the one thing we knew right away was that this amazing figure by Ismael Nieto (@ismaflcl) had to be one of the rewards.\nWe decided to take it one step further by having Tom paint them, making it a truly exceptional keepsake. Like the signed print, you'll get a personal thank you note from Tom and Najati and thanked in the credits after the story.\nTom's artistic talents aren't limited to the tablet. On special occasions he takes brush to canvas and putting Pine on Kickstarter is a very special occasion, indeed!\nThose able to support at this level will get one of five original paintings of a scene exclusive to this reward. These will be gouache on cold pressed paper and will ship ready for display or framing as you see fit!\nOf course, these include a thank you note from Tom and Najati and your name in the credits after the story. And yes, Tom has a lot of painting in store if we get funded!\nAnyone able to contribute at this level will be key to making Pine a reality! Your name will appear alongside the team at the beginning of the story, either as an individual or as a group. \nIn addition to getting one of every print and mini figure, you'll also get to choose one of the other limited rewards, and will of course get a thank you note from Tom and Najati. \nWe'd also like to say thank you directly and learn about why supporting Pine meant so much to you. So, if you're interested, we'll arrange a time for a video call with you.\nThe 8.5x11\" prints will ship worldwide through Fulfillrite, with tracking where possible, and delivered with duties paid where possible. If you live outside the list of countries where that service is available, you will be responsible for additional costs such as taxes and duties. Please check the FAQ to see which countries include duties paid.\nThe rest of the rewards are things we'll be making or packing ourselves and are limited in number. Since we're a small team, they'll only be available for shipping to the United States, with the exception of the Associate Producer rewards, which we'll ship worldwide.\nWe already have partners set up for making the physical rewards. Because some of those rewards depend on art that hasn't been created yet (e.g. the exclusive images for the wallpaper pack and Art of Pine PDF), we'll be developing those pieces first so we can get reward production and delivery started as soon as possible. \nSoon after funding, we'll publish an anticipated delivery schedule for the rewards. We're hoping the 8.5x11\" prints will ship over the summer and we're targeting shipping everything else before the holidays season of 2021.\nIn the spirit of transparency and community, we want to give potential backers some insight into our approach to funding and budgeting. There aren't any lovely images in this section but it's important to us that those pledging understand how we're using their money to develop Pine.\nFirst and foremost, our primary goal is to develop a high-quality, engaging, meaningful story-driven game so that you can experience the woodworker's story.\nWhile we'd love to just work on Pine and release it when it's ready without worrying about money, Pine is too big of a project to whittle away at in the evening and on weekends.\nWe think we've got about 15 months of work to do and we need to hire some outside help. The Kickstarter funding goes primarily towards hiring that help and enabling us to spend the time doing the work.\nHere's how the basic budget breaks down. These are estimates, but should be close to how the money gets spent.\n Kickstarter fees: 8% - We wouldn't be here without them!\n Rewards and shipping: 10% - Making and shipping the rewards \n Legal, accounting, etc: 2% - All companies need a little of this stuff\n Taxes: 15% - An estimate, and perhaps a conservative one\n Sound and music: 15% - Producing SFX and the score\n Art and programming: 50% - Most of what Pine needs is time for Tom and Najati to work on it!\nIf we're lucky enough to achieve any of our stretch goals, funding them comes out of the art and programming portion of the budget.\nAt our lowest goal of $80k, this is a shoestring budget even for a small team. However, everyone is committed to the project and we think that's just enough money to make a great game. For anyone curious, the project needs to reach about $300,000 before Tom and Najati aren't spending their savings to develop Pine. Any money beyond that would be invested back into Made Up Games so we can make more games!\nSo that's how your pledges will help us make Pine and, again, we're grateful for every one. If you made it this far, thanks for sticking around through this really boring section about money!\n\nMade Up Games is Tom Booth and Najati Imam. We're both lifelong gamers and longtime friends. After some practice publishing games with Freecell Fable\u2014and with your help\u2014we're ready to take on Pine!\nTom\u2019s been drawing since childhood and has been a professional illustrator for about 10 years, including stints at Nickelodeon and Scholastic. He's illustrated and authored a number of children\u2019s books including Don't Blink! and This is Christmas. His Instagram audience and its love for the woodworker is a large part of what inspired us to start this campaign!\n\nNajati\u2019s been programming since he was a kid and has been doing so professionally for over 20 years. His experience runs the gamut from web front end, to embedded systems programming, to directing engineering departments. He\u2019s also been tinkering with game dev for as long as he\u2019s been able to type. \n\nAndy's an industry vet who records forests for fun. He's the perfect person to weave the sounds of the woodworker's valley into the storytelling. Owner of Northwest Soundscapes, he's done sound design work for Lucasfilm and Sucker Punch Productions, among others.\n\nAdam is one part programmer, one part actor, and one part team coach. He and Najati used to work together so when it was time to blend technology, feelings, and art we pulled him into the team to keep us focused and keep the quality high.\n\nTwo parting notes ...\nWe expect it's clear from the tone of the campaign that Pine attempts to explore a fairly serious topic. While we want it to be a story that most anyone will be able to relate to, and maybe even feel enriched by, it's not intended to be a children's story. Because there won't be anything graphic or violent in it, Pine may end up with an E rating. We added this note to make sure that parents don't mistakenly take that to mean that Pine is intended for children.\nAlso, Made Up Games does not condone carving things into trees\u2014please don't do that! In a lot of places it's illegal, but even more importantly it can be really bad for the tree. The woodworker's story is a fictional one and he would definitely take forest conservation very seriously if he were real.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk we foresee is whether we've estimated for enough time to live up to the high expectations we have for this project. We're confident in our ability to deliver, and we did our best to be reasonable with our estimates, but game development is a wily beast! We have contingency plans, but it would be na\u00efve to assume there won't be a few surprises along the way.\n\nSpeaking of surprises, there shouldn't be many for our backers as we're committed to being very transparent throughout the development of Pine. The dev updates will include progress on all fronts, from making and shipping the rewards to setbacks and successes during the development of Pine.\n\nRegarding publishing to the Switch: The barriers of entry to developing for the Nintendo Switch can be fairly high, with Nintendo controlling access to it tightly. If the project reaches that level of funding, we'll have resources available to tackle those challenges. Still, working with Nintendo is a considerable external dependency that we don't have complete control over.\n\nOur experience in fulfillment of physical goods is somewhat limited, but we've done our homework and think we've covered our bases there. We're confident in the partners we've selected to work with to produce the rewards and working with Fulfillrite removes all the risk around the shipping of the prints.\n\nWe're excited to bring Pine into the world. We're happy with the story we've written, our approach to telling it, and keen on our ability to execute. Risks exist, but we're ready to take on the challenges we face to make Pine a reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWhere possible, shipping materials will be recycled and/or recyclable.\nSomething else\nFor all tiers above $25, we\u2019ll plant a tree for every backer that supports the project.

Moving here exposed the Gnomes to new creatures, new tools and of course the magick that weaves through the Darkewood.

With your help in funding this project not only will we be able to answer some of these burning questions but we will also be able to bring a whole heap of brand new Northumbrian Tin Minis into production for general release next year. \nWe spent a fair amount of time considering how these gnomes fit into the world along with the rest of the Nightfolk and the Denizens of the Wood and so to help you bring a little bit more of that world to life they also come equipped with a small free digital adventure. Rumor has it that our author Ken became so engaged with the characters and lore that he built a whole campaign around it, which he may or may not have committed to paper - we shall have to see!\nWe have 8 Gnomes and 5 Toads as well as an epic Toad mounted Deathstealer, Several stretch goals which include Additional free Minis!\n\nWhat do you get out of this? Well, you can get all of those fantastic miniatures we just mentioned and some addons with a fantastic discount on the usual retail price and perhaps bag yourself some free stretch goals on top!  You also get to lend us a hand in shaping these characters and the lore that surrounds them. All Miniatures and Bases are supplied unpainted.\n\n\nThere are Three straightforward pledges to choose from an you can upgrade your pledge at any time:\n Surface Dweller - Pick out what you want from the Addons and then pledge the amount, you will be able to finalise your choices in the pledge manager.\n Gnomeward Bound - Get everything from the Gnomes and Toads packs along with the EPIC Death Stealer Gnome mounted on a Stygian Toad, a Northumbrian Tin presentation box and all unlocked stretch goals! \n There's no place like Gnome - Get two sets of the toad pack, The Gnome pack, The EPIC Death Stealer Gnome and Mount, The Gnome More MR Nice Guys Addon, a pack of Toadshrooms, a Northumbrian Tin presentation box and all unlocked stretch goals!\nIf you took part in our last project on Kickstarter you will already know how committed we are to delivering an outstanding product that exceeds your expectations, if you missed our last project and are joining in on this one, prepare to be pleasantly surprised!\n\nWe have prepared a number of stretch goals which if hit will be included for free in any of the qualifying pledges.

As soon as the Kickstarter funds are received the Miniatures can be put straight into production and then shipped shortly after the pledge manager is completed. Northumbrian Tin Soldier is already a successful manufacturer and online retailer of miniatures, we have many years of experience of designing, producing and shipping models all over the world. \n\nImpacts of Covid-19 on Production and Shipping - We were recently impacted quite heavily by the Coronavirus restrictions imposed in the UK earlier in the year. This led to unforseen delays in the fulfillment of our recent successful Kickstarter project \"The Curious Case of the Cats of Crumptown\" , however we adapted our delivery plans and learned a great deal about how to operate under very adverse conditions. Postal issues were solved by using Courier services at no additional costs to our backers , Stock was collected via our own transport and fullfillment was only delayed by a matter of weeks . As before all Miniatures will be produced in the UK which will mitigate any international production risks. We have extended the project delivery timescale by 2 months over what our estimates are of what is needed to allow for any unforseen changes in UK operations.\n\nIn the case of any delays caused by factors outside of our control you can expect to receive transparent and honest updates from us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nMetal miniatures can be used, re-used then used some more.

''Any other logical advice you can spare Hartigan?!'' Tulsa said sarcastically... '' I got plenty of bullets and know exactly where to put them...!'' \n\nWelcome everyone to the Kickstarter campaign for Cyber City. This campaign will focus on two brand new 75mm miniatures in the form of Tulsa and Hartigan and a 1/10th bust called Katana. Making an appearance also are the Slugger and Gunslinger busts and their 75mm miniatures versions. We also have their STL files available in one big pack! \nAll the figures in this campaign have been expertly sculpted by my good friend Daniel Ciorba and give off that cyberpunk feel we love. We hope you like what you see and help us get these into production.\n\nKatana\nFirst up is Katana, a 1/10th bust (roughly 85mm). She is an expert swordfighter who is just about unsheath her blade and do some serious damage! Below you see the box art painted by Sylvain Aubut and the first cast by Aur\u00e9lien Diot of Deep Space Factory Productions.\nTulsa & Hartigan\nThen we have the two 75mm miniatures. Experienced detectives who are the law and order of Cyber City! When I designed these two with Daniel I had them planned to be great on their own but also as a duo. You can place them back to back, loyal partners to the end. I think Daniel nailed it and they make a fine couple!\nHartigan\nTulsa\nAdd-ons\nAlso making a feature this campaign are the busts and 75mm miniatures versions of Slugger and Gunslinger. The busts have been out for a while now and the 75mm miniatures made a little appearance in the Studio X Kickstarter that ran earlier this year. They fit perfectly in this campaign though and haven't had much spotlight just yet so hence our decision to include them.\nAll sculpts by my good friend Daniel Ciorba! :D\nBelow are just the front angles of the miniatures and busts.

For all pledges it is \u20ac10,- which includes tracking & and insurance.\nWe have set the delivery date for March 2021 but depending on the number of casts we need, it might be sooner. Casting will begin once the campaign is over and only if we have funded.\nThe company who handles our shipping proved numerous times already that they do a good job. We have every faith we can deliver on time as we have become quite good at organizing and packing. We don't think there will be a delay in packages going out to backers but would just like to add that delays can happen. Once the shipping company has your parcels, it is out of our control. However we will do everything possible again to fulfill this Kickstarter on time.\nPackages can take anywhere from 4-28 (or sometimes even longer!) days to arrive. So please give it some time when we have announced that the packages have been shipped. Especially with the Covid-19, shipping times can be bit longer than usual. We ask for your understanding if this causes any delays.\nPlease note that we are not responsible for any customs or other fees that might occur. We do not ship to P.O. boxes!\nMiniatures come unpainted and need assembly and some cleaning. They are not toys and might take some expertise to put together.\nBrexit\nAs you may or may not know, The UK will leave the EU soon. As of yet, a deal for trade and import/export hasn't been made yet. We have no clue about what will happen but we will make sure we have some channels set up to aid us in delivering packages to our backers in the UK. Obviously we will keep you informed at all times. One thing is sure, you will get your pledges!!!\nSTL files\nThe STL files will be send out once the period for processing funds by Kickstarter is over and funds have been received in our bank account. This normally takes two to three weeks and we estimate that the files will be delivered early January at the latest.\nAs always there are a few people we would like to thank.

Anyaral is the setting for the fantasy skirmish game of Twilight, which I have been working on for over 20 years now. In this world, the diminutive Fubarnii have pulled themselves out of slavery and carved an Empire that spans the continent of Anyaral. That Empire is now threatened by their Delgon cousins, who have descended from their mountain strongholds led by their gods, the Enarii. \nI'll admit that I hadn't planned to launch this campaign until recently, but this year has been anything but predictable... Over the last few months (and years) I've been working on a large project to unleash the new Kedashi force on the world of Anyaral, but with everything that has been going on this year, it didn't feel like quite the right time to run such a big endeavour. However, alongside all the Kedashi planning I had a few little fun sculpting projects on the side. These were models I really wanted to sculpt, but I didn't quite have a plan for, so I've decided to take the opportunity to release those as a little pre-Christmas kickstarter!\nLet me introduce the three subjects of this little campaign, each of which has been given their own pledge level. You can of course add on extras if you don't want just one model.\nAlaim is one of the powerful Enarii who the Delgon invaders have embraced as their gods. Alaim however shunned godhood and instead became an outcast and fled to the southern lands of the Casanii. \nAlaim has chosen to follow the migratory life of the Casanii, renouncing claims of leadership and seeking to learn from these spiritual warriors. The Casanii tribes were unsure at first of this intruding giant, but the shamans communed with their spirits and saw the openness of Alaim's heart and the strength that might be added to their tribes. \nAlaim is cast in resin and provided unpainted with a 50mm plastic base.\nUnder the watchful eye of NuraSen Plutom, the Delgon have embraced the mechanical wonders that were once just toys for the engineers of the Empire. The KalMalog have become a regular sight in the ongoing war, but the larger designs have proven more difficult to mass produce. Only recently has this new variant been seen. These monstrosities wield a pair of derakar, using the might of the heavy engine to power both the mechanical legs and the guns. \nThe Heavy KalMalog is cast in resin and provided unpainted with a 50mm plastic base.\nThe skerrats make their homes throughout the continent of Anyaral. The Dhogu tribes train them, but they are seen as a nuisance across the rest of the Empire, raiding food supplies and damaging property. However, that doesn't stop the rare broodmothers from being highly sought after. Nearly all species of skerrat continue to grow throughout the sempa stage of their lifecycle, only slowing once they mature into kopa. It is rare, but some skerrats will live for many decades as sempa, raising vast broods of skerrats. These skerrat broodmothers are almost impossible to raise in captivity, but are highly valued creatures.

Although brave and determined, adventurers are only human! They are prone to the madness and pain the twisted dwellers of the dungeons will inflict upon them. Death can occur, but is not the worst fate: heroes can be driven mad and beyond help!\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nThe game is played in campaigns of 11 missions. To reach the Darkest Dungeon itself, players will undertake 3 missions per threat level and vanquish the boss. Then, they will be strong enough to face the horrors of the Darkest Dungeon! They may emerge victorious... if they dispatch the source of evil that plagues the land.\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nFor each hero, select 3 skills out of 7 before heading into your mission (and level the heroes up to gain access to more skills). In each room, pick the most suitable stance to best resolve the conflict! Then, on each turn, a player chooses two of the available actions of moving, interacting with the environment, changing their stance or using a skill (if eligible for their current stance). Triumph over encounters, resist rampant madness and emerge victorious before throwing yourself into another battle. Between missions, spend your time in the hamlet, visiting various buildings to find relief from the physical and mental trauma you\u2019ve just endured. Restore the hamlet to its former glory and it will reward you and help you to fulfill the ultimate goal.\nRPG-like heroes  \u2013 A robust level up system with a ton of customization for unique playable characters.\nStressful Affliction System \u2013 Heroes' personalities are paramount!

We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 and Reichbusters: Projekt Vril have been delivered. Super Fantasy Brawl is going to complete fulfillment by the end of the month. Solomon Kane, a big scope project, is at the printer and will be delivered in two waves. In specific wave 1 is in mass production now and the wave 2 moulds are also now being produced. Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters: East Quest has been printed and is going to ship this month.

They lived in huge sounders and held council with the other forest tribes. Now they are but a shadow of what they were, finding work where they can as bodyguards, pit-fighters and mercenaries.\nD\u00fcnnmere is an original fantasy setting inspired by dark folklore. It is filled with all manner of odd critters and characters, and with this Kickstarter I wanted to shed some light on a few of its inhabitants.\nThe Miniatures\nMy miniatures are sculpted digitally, then 3d printed and cast in high quality resin. The five main figures (Gl\u00f6mm the Collector, Gruntlac Gatecrusher, Gorgrot, Porgroth the Gluttonous and Olaug) come with 40mm round bases. \nMaggot and Rollo are available as add-ons and come with 25mm round bases.  To add them to your pledge simply add \u00a38 for each one you'd like and at the end of the Kickstarter you will be asked which add-ons you would like.\nThe three pigs each come with an alternative bare-head.\nThe miniatures are 28mm scale and are made to be compatible with ranges like Dungeons and Dragons, Age of Sigmar, Frostgrave and any other 28mm miniature based games.\nRollo the Masterful painted\nEvery miniature comes with an illustrated card, with some backstory about the character and signed by the artist.\nOne of the original ink drawings available in the Artisan Band tiers.\nShipping & Delivery\nOnce you have chosen your pledge, you will be asked to add on costs for shipping. Any pledge above Hermit will be tracked shipping and so will cost a bit extra. \nDelivery will be completed by March 2021 or possibly sooner.\nWhy back the Kickstarter?\nYou'll be helping me to develop and grow the dark folklore-inspired setting of D\u00fcnnmere further.\n You'll receive the miniatures at a reduced price (if you order any pledge higher than Hermit). \nOwn miniatures from the first casting. Each figure from the first casting is limited to 200 or 300 copies and the illustrated card will show which number from the casting that you have.\nYou'll receive the miniatures several months before they become available elsewhere.\nYou'll be supporting my tiny independent miniatures studio, and helping it to take its first steps.\nAbout\nHi, I\u2019m Jack Good and Monkstone Miniatures is my own little creation. I design, sculpt and illustrate each character, and am writing and developing the setting too.  As a child, I loved stories and films about fantasy worlds like Willow and the Dark Crystal, and they massively influenced my own drawings and stories. I collected Citadel miniatures too, and was always drawn to the smaller games like Mordheim and Warhammer Quest. \nI graduated from the Computer Visualisation and Animation degree at Bournemouth University in 2009 and have been lucky enough to have had an almost ten year career in the video game industry making art. Highlights of this include being on the four-person team that created the Bafta nominated \u2018Surgeon Simulator 2013\u2019 and leading the art on 'Worlds Adrift'.\nLast year I found myself once again being drawn back to painting minis, and realised I also wanted to sculpt my own characters and to create a world inspired by my loves of folklore, fantasy and history. My aim is to expand the setting of D\u00fcnnmere, and to eventually develop stories, games and rulesets to enable you to explore these lands for yourselves.\nMy focus right now though is on developing the highest quality 28mm resin miniatures for you to use in whatever fantasy setting you choose.\nThis is my first Kickstarter, and with your support it will hopefully be the first step in our journey together. I am hugely passionate about this project and have big plans for its future.\nI really appreciate your support\nThank you\n- Jack\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nMassive thanks to Eddie Fisher and the team at Zealot Miniatures for helping to bring my miniatures to life in such amazing detail.

At her feet, three cloth kittens scampered and played as she swept the floor, stoked the fire and straightened the furniture. They were to have visitors. Bundled out of the cottage by the old woman, the kittens darted through the rain and across the clearing to the shelter of the woodshed. A low mournful moan slid through the slatted wood of the shed. The kittens looked at each other, then bolted straight back to the house. Small pebble eyes watched them go.\u201d\nLeft at the Bottom of the Garden Chapter Two is a project to fund the production of nine high quality, lead-free metal miniatures, each depicting a lost toy. Following on from my previous Kickstarter, our intrepid lost toys have met a new group of toys deep in the forest: the old woman who lives in the woods, her various cloth cats, a toy robin and whatever it is she keeps in the woodshed. \nAs the owner and sculptor of Statuesque Miniatures, I've produced many miniatures over the years. However, the Left at the Bottom of the Garden toys are something quite different in style and purpose from my usual work and that's why I've again come to Kickstarter to help reach as many people as possible.  The first Left at the Bottom of the Garden Kickstarter (which I now call 'Chapter One') was successful and fulfilled on time. With your help, I can get production started and continue the tale of Olive, Clementine and Little Puss, and all the other toys they meet in the woods.\nThe Miniatures\nMeasuring approximately 13mm to 31mm tall, the Left at the Bottom of the Garden Chapter Two miniatures represent the household of the old woman who lives in the woods - mostly cloth cats. I sculpted the miniatures with tabletop gaming, painting and collecting in mind. In particular, I wanted them to be nice little objects in themselves, needing no glue, no assembly beyond normal casting clean-up, and no plastic bases. They have bold, chunky details meaning they can be easily painted or finished however you wish.\nAll photos show production castings of the miniatures (either painted or prepped and given a wash of oil paint to bring out the details), so if the Kickstarter is successful I'll be ready to start casting your miniatures immediately. There won't be any stretch goals or additional items added during the course of the campaign - I don't want anything to delay fulfilment.\nPlease note, due to their small size the Left at the Bottom of the Garden miniatures are not intended for small children.\nThe Pledges\nBelow you can see each of the pledge levels available. All miniatures are supplied in a bare metal state.\nChoose any set or sets of miniatures from the Add On list below. Simply pledge the total for those sets. Details of your choices will be taken after the campaign.\nThe complete set of nine Left at the Bottom of the Garden Chapter Two miniatures, cast in high quality, lead-free metal.\nAdditional sets of miniatures can also be chosen from the Add On list below. Simply add the total cost for those sets to the pledge level.

Simply add the total cost for those sets to the pledge level. Details of your choices will be taken after the campaign.\nAdd Ons\nThe following items can be added to any pledge for the amount indicated.

Full details of the shipping costs can be seen HERE on the Statuesque website but below is a summary:\n United Kingdom - \u00a32.70\n Europe - \u00a34.30 standard mail or \u00a310.85 tracked\n World Zone 1 - \u00a35.50 standard mail or \u00a310.65 tracked\n World Zone 2 (including Aus and NZ) - \u00a36.30 standard mail or \u00a311.45 tracked\n World Zone 3 (USA only) - \u00a35.55 standard mail or \u00a310.75 tracked\nPledges over \u00a350 will be sent by tracked mail (where available) for the standard mail shipping cost.\nPlease note, experience has taught me that it is best to send orders to certain counties only by International Tracked services (or if unavailable, International Signed) to ensure prompt delivery. All rewards sent to Russia (Europe shipping), Brazil and Canada (World Zone 1) will be sent by International Tracked mail only and charged appropriately, while rewards sent to Mexico (World Zone 1) will be sent by International Signed mail only and charged appropriately. No criticism of these countries is implied; I just want you to get your rewards as quickly as possible and I've found this to be the best way.\nShipping costs will be collected after the Kickstarter through the Statuesque Miniatures webshop: you will receive a discount coupon to the value of your pledge amount, you will then place an order for your chosen rewards, and upon entering your discount coupon code you will only pay for the shipping costs (and any additional items you may wish to purchase).\nIt is very important that you check your Kickstarter messages as that is where I will send your discount coupons and information regarding the payment of shipping costs. Please be sure that your Kickstarter account is linked to an email account you check regularly and turn on notifications for Kickstarter messages.\nShipping to the European Union\nPlease note that while the United Kingdom left the EU on the 31st of January 2020, during the Transition Period it remains in the EU Customs Union and the Single Market.\nThe Transition Period runs until the 31st of December 2020. As this Kickstarter will be fulfilled during the Transition Period, EU backers' rewards will not be subject to VAT, customs charges or handling fees on import into the EU. As such, this project is EU Friendly.\nI'll be posting more photos of the painted toys during the campaign, along with a tutorial on how I painted them.

The first player to have one of their souls reach the land of the living wins!\nWelcome to the journey from the world of the dead to the land of the living... \nWe have worked with a cultural consultant and a Mexican artist to really help bring Dia de Muertos to the table and embed the beauty and culture within the game. This has resulted in amazing components, such as our four gorgeous Dia de Muertos caskets, and the 3D nine-step staircase, showing the levels the souls travel on from the World of the Dead to the Land of the Living; as well as papel picado player boards, ofrenda tokens and custom calavera dice. All of these will be used by players as they add souls to the caskets, move the caskets towards the steps, and ascend the steps to the land of the living. Die of the Dead is fully playtested and print ready, so we will be able to get it in people's hands by Dia de Muertos 2021! \nFor full rules please check out our current rulebook here: Rules (prototype) . For a full overview please check out this fantastic Chits and Giggles video here\nThe goal for each player is to get a soul (represented by the dice) to the land of the living. Players do this by adding souls to the caskets, moving the caskets, and then transferring the souls from the casket to the steps.\nOn a player's turn they choose one of the four caskets. Each casket will do two things, depending upon its location. One will benefit the current player, the other will depend upon the shake of the casket, and could be good, or bad, for all players around the table. Some of the things the caskets allow players to do are:\nPlayers need to consider carefully which caskets they have souls in when deciding which action they wish to do that round, and how they can manoeuvre the caskets to help them win!\nIn addition, players can gain tokens representing the items from an ofrenda to help them. \nOfrenda tokens\nThese will give the player who uses them an edge, or let them change the rules in some way. \nEverything you see here\nWe're keeping things simple this Kickstarter- everyone who backs the game gets the best version of the game. No different tiers or having to buy expansions before trying out the game. \nIn order to make sure this game reaches people before Dia de Muertos 2021 we have chosen realistic stretch goals which won't need any additional playtesting, or add any cost to the shipping of the game.\nUnlocked: At \u00a39000 we will upgrade the box art so it looks even better by adding UV spot printing.\nUnlocked: At \u00a312000 we will upgrade from screen-printed custom dice to engraved custom dice.\nAnd that's it! Only two stretch goals might seem a small number, but the game is complete, and the last thing we want to do is unbalance it, or make it more expensive to ship. If we do end up far exceeding these then we will put any savings towards subsidising shipping rates even further.\nAt Radical 8 Games we understand that shipping can be a barrier to backing a game, especially considering the uncertainty around the world at the moment. Therefore we make this guarantee that, no matter what, for UK and US backers the cost of the game & shipping will be less than the MSRP. We would love to be able to offer this to everybody, but we cant guarantee this to be the case with the fees involved in other countries, although we will be offering as cost effective shipping as possible, including a subsidy from us to keep costs down.\nAll shipping will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign has ended. All UK, European, American, Canadian and Australian shipping will be done from within that region for friendly shipping.\nUpdate 1st September: We have a new fulfilment partner for customers in China and some other  regions. We can now offer estimated shipping to China for $9, and Japan,  South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan,  Thailand & Vietnam for $18.\n*Excluding Alaska and Hawaii.\n**For more information please just send us a message. \nFor Mexico we have chosen to take the steps to subsidise shipping further, we estimate this to be around \u00a313. Please see our most recent update for more on this.\nPlease check out some videos and thoughts on the game from other people!\nFor Chits & Giggles have a superb overview here: \nCard and Pixel have an excellent write up here: https://cardandpixel.tumblr.com/post/626960669850451969/die-of-the-dead-a-kickstarter-preview\nThe Dice Tower have a great in-depth overview here: \nTantrum House have done a wonderful preview in their own inimitable style (don't forget to check out their outtakes):  \n Board, Deck and Dice have a nice quick overview here: \nHere's an interview we did for Kicking Tables, discussing the game, from conception to production:  \n Update 10th September:\nAnother great preview, this time from the Hairy Game Lords:\nFinally Richard from We're Not Wizards has another excellent written preview:\nhttps://werenotwizards.blogspot.com/2020/09/die-of-dead-radical-8-games-kickstarter.html \nHere's a playthrough we recorded, we've edited out the setup and rules introduction, but hopefully it gives you a sense of how fun the game is (thanks to Nate and Angel for volunteering to be recorded playing)\nIn addition, if you're interested in reading about how the game was designed, and the thought that went into each part, you can check out our designer diaries on BoardGameGeek or our Website.\nA massive Thank You to everybody above for their efforts!\nOne thing we'd like to do is include all our backers in the choice of new colours for the Casket Boards. The current colours introduce the misconception that they are related to the token boards, because the colours match. To avoid this, and make the game even more colourful, we will be using four different colours for the casket boards. This is where you come in. Below we've got some examples of possible colours we could use for the casket boards: \nIf any of these strike your fancy, or if there are other colours you'd like to see, please let us know, either in the comments, or in our online poll! At the end of the campaign we will choose the four most popular contrasting colours. So just tell us your favourites, and together we'll make sure the game looks even more beautiful.\nIn addition, you can join us on Twitter or Facebook, using the buttons below:\nRadical 8 Games is an independent publisher based in York, UK. Our last Kickstarted game, Forks, was funded, manufactured and fulfilled all ahead of schedule in August 2019. Radical 8 Games is run by Mark, who pre-lockdown spent most his time at Beyond Monopoly! boardgame club playing Agricola when he wasn't playtesting Die of the Dead. Designer James Allen runs Leeds Playtesting with Playtest UK, and has worked hard not only on his own games, but improving games for all designers in the group. Rusembell is an exceptional artist from Mexico, and you can check out more of her amazing artwork here: https://www.deviantart.com/rusembell.\nThanks to the following: all our playtesters, everyone who supports Playtest UK, everyone at Beyond Monopoly (especially those who had to put up with Mark forcing people to play some of those early builds), the HGS boardgame club, Angel for the bread, Jason, Will & Sean for 'Wellbeing Wednesdays' and everyone who stopped by for a chat at Airecon or Virtual UKGE.\nAnd you, for supporting us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhilst this is our second Kickstarter, and we successfully fulfilled our first quickly and efficiently, there are two things which may crop up as challenges regarding this project, and it would be foolish to not acknowledge them: Brexit and Covid-19.\n\nIf a second wave of Covid-19 hits there will be two possible results. Either delays in manufacturing, or increased costs to shipping. What we can do about delays in manufacturing is very limited, and although we hope we have built in enough spare time to still meet the deadline of Dia de Muertos 2021, if there are delays we promise to keep everyone updated at least once every two weeks regarding them.\nIf there is an increased cost to shipping we will look to bear that burden ourselves. Again, all backers will be kept updated with anything that might happen regarding a second wave of Covid-19.\n\nBrexit is only of concern to UK backers- we will be using fulfilment centres in all parts of the world including the EU, so only UK backers would be affected by this. As we are expecting a significant number of backers to come from the UK, this shouldn't actually affect anybody too badly, as making sure games get here will be a priority. We are working with fulfilment centres in the UK, and will keep on talking to them about Brexit, especially as more is known. Again, the main issues will be increased shipping costs and possible delays, but as Radical 8 Games is based in the UK, we will be working overtime to make sure the games get here with minimum delays and will bear any additional costs.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nWe won't be using a plastic tray in Die of the Dead.

Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. My father is our resin caster, my mother is in charge of packing and shipment, and our metal caster is a tried and tested craftsman we have worked with for over four years.\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products, all of the initial models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been cast, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in. I will be relying on Work in Progress sculpts and concept art for some of the stretch goals, but be assured that they will be completed and cast in a timely manner once the campaign has been funded.\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing an overly long list of stretch goals, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe only use the best materials for our miniatures, which are sturdy and durable for extended gaming sessions.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nAll Warploque Miniatures products are manufactured locally in the UK by local craftsmen.\nSomething else\nAll Warploque Miniatures products are manufactured locally by local craftsmen.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "(1.1) TREASURE MAP", "descp": "The start of your adventures into ArcWorlde, or maybe a new path...\nJust fancy a particular model?

Having just joined the Wonderful Ones after finishing a year of comprehensive training, Earth Defense War III is his first experience in combat.\nThough technically still a rookie, he is extremely gifted, achieving a record score in both the written and field sections of the CENTINEL tactical examinations. Brimming with passion for justice, he takes a firm stance against those who threaten peace, but his by the books attitude and serious personality can occasionally rub people the wrong way. Sometimes Red's seriousness crosses the realm of reason, and those around him find getting through to him almost impossible. The opposite is rarer, though, as Red has an incredible memory, and never forgets something after being told.\nHis deep crimson CENTINEL-Suit boasts balance in all levels of performance, demonstrating diverse aptitude in any mission. The Vulcan Knuckles equipped to both his arms are capable of intense blows and machine-like accuracy, which can be even further increased in power via the \"Unite Hand\" Unite Morph technique.\n\nA Wonderful One whose cover occupation is as a detective for the Los Angeles Police Department. Though young, he has gained experience and success in a variety of missions: taking down warring mafia families, counter-terrorism, and even taking part in military operations.\nHaving a strong sense of identity, and a stronger dislike for authority, Blue is not the easiest Wonderful One to deal with in the organization; however, his ability to act quickly and make decisions in the blink of an eye has led to a chain of successful missions. Yet, despite these successes, his hot-headed personality has makes Blue prone lose himself in anger, peppering his record with a significant number of failures.\nBlue insists on making a scene for everyone to see, so in combat he acts arrogant, taunting the enemy, and is prone to posturing into different poses that might look \"cool.\" Unfortunately, reactions to his antics are conspicuous in their absence.\nPoor at teamwork and preferring to work alone, Blue does not actively try seek meaningful relationships with others. Instead, he accepts only those who are able to prove their skills, but this acceptance leads to a deep respect.\nHis weapon, the Valiantium Blade, is said to become sharper with every slice, forged with a special alloy able to cut through anything in the galaxy. His Unite Sword can deal lethal blows to even battleships.\nChose to be a Wonderful One due to his incredible skill with firearms and other ranged weapons, Wonder-Green is currently a mere middle school student. Yet, despite his youth, it is said that he can shoot through the hole of a donut a 100 kilometers away, while eating a donut himself.\nPossibly due to his privileged upbringing, he often seems to feel like the world revolves around him and is prone to ignoring the reality of his surroundings. He also unwittingly rude, leading to occasional clashes with Blue and Pink; clashes Green himself seems unbothered by. In fact, at least with Pink, he almost seems to enjoy being scolded.\nEven during the tensest of missions, he possesses a completely carefree nature; that is until something goes south, then he instantly breaks into panic. Far clumsier than most would ever suspect for a Wonderful One, the world prays that the care with which Green uses his rapid-fire proton gun Christine Daa\u00e9 is another, more careful, side of him that holds great pride in his position. (Or so the world hopes...)\nHe has developed a close friendship with Black, as both are similar in age and love video games, comics, cartoons, and general mischief-making. This mischief-making extends to his love of junk food, a forbidden fruit under his parents, but a near constant indulgence as Green partakes in missions far beyond their strict reach.\n\nChosen to go to the Olympics in gymnastics while still in high school, Wonder-Pink is by far the most flexible and agile of any Wonderful One. She matches this with an advanced proficiency in melee weaponry, specifically with her Beautiful Whip, knit from a next-gen stay-press alloy \"Belmont alloy,\" for which she is unrivaled.\nPink is known for her \"laissez-faire\" personality, behaving carefree and sunny during even the most severe missions, as if her duties were just another after school club; however, it is that relaxed attitude that, more often than not, spells disaster for the team. Exceedingly sensitive towards trends, she has decorated her issued weapon with a variety of accessories, and her tendency to prioritize fashion over the mission can occasionally give her superiors headaches. Nevertheless, Pink's excellent physical aptitude and peerless acrobatics have led the team to countless victories.\nExtremely emotional, she sometimes reveals her terrifying true colors when angered. Pink is especially sensitive to anything said by Green, and she will gladly turn her tormentor into her whipping boy when set off.\nPlus many many more heroes!\nIn The Wonderful 101: Remastered, you don\u2019t just control a single superhero. You control a whole team, united to face off against the forces of evil. As you travel around the city, you\u2019ll rescue civilians, who will then join your cause, bolstering your ranks.\nThe Wonderful Ones have more than just numbers on their side. To solve puzzles and smash evil, the Wonderful Ones can perform a \u201cUnite Morph\u201d, combining together to create fists, swords, bridges and other incredible constructs.\nTogether with Wonder Red, Wonder Blue, and the rest of the Wonderful Ones, it\u2019s time to save Blossom City, and the rest of the world!\nThe most powerful tool for the Wonderful Ones is the incredible Unite Morph. By combining together, the Wonderful Ones can turn into a variety of awesome shapes, from whips to swords to giant fists.\nIn-game, players draw specific shapes on the battlefield with the control stick, and the Unite Morph initiates!\nUnite Morphing isn\u2019t just for combat, though! The Wonderful Ones can use their powers for traversal as well, whether it\u2019s a faraway ladder or a precarious rope bridge, there\u2019s nowhere The Wonderful 100 can\u2019t reach!\nUnite Hand\nPLAY\n\nThe famous fist of justice used by Wonder Red, Unite Hand is the Wonderful Ones\u2019 most basic Unite Morph. Used to pummel, smash and brutalize foes, the Unite Hand can also be used to rotate cogs and empty gacha monsters of their contents.\nUnite Sword\nPLAY\n\nWhile not as strong as the Unite Hand, the Unite Sword has a longer reach, and is sharp enough to cut through chains. As an added bonus, the Unite Sword\u2019s pristine broad side can also reflect lasers back at enemies.\nUnite Gun\nPLAY\n\nWhile the Unite Gun isn\u2019t one of the strongest Unite Morphs in the Wonderful Ones' arsenal, it really shines in long distance situations. The gun can hit both enemies and environmental objects, allowing the Wonderful Ones to defeat distant foes or solve otherwise inaccessible puzzles. \nUnite Whip\nPLAY\n\nThe Unite Whip is a Unite Morph created from combining with a flexible, thorned whip. Not only can it attack enemies from afar, it can also tie them up, making it perfect for dealing with armored foes, spiked walls, and other prickly surfaces. It can also be used to latch onto certain surfaces to swing the whole team over gaps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there are always risks during the development and porting process, we are

This price is that Kevin has been commissioned to produce figures as described by others, as opposed to being totally creative in terms of originality. \nGoblinmaster Limited has been created to be dedicated to return Kevin\u2019s creative modelling to the original ethos of high-quality products that have humorous and quirky elements, that are true to the fantasy gaming community. Kevin is a major shareholder of the new business and may eventually become Kevin\u2019s sole vehicle for conceptualising, designing and delivering his artwork. Keep an eye out for the Goblinmaster copyright as this will now become Kevin\u2019s unadulterated brand, where quality and originality can be safeguarded.\nOver the coming year the wish is to produce 16 ranges/sets of products (most directly from the Goblinmaster website), all with the original, and somewhat \u2018old school\u2019 style; the very first model pack will be the Treadmill of Hubris, where Kevin has used his own ideas to produce a set-piece wagon, artifacts, characters, and narrative.  To achieve this we need initial support, both in terms of kick-start funding, plus a guide as to what ideas work and what doesn't.\nThis \u2018kick-start\u2019 is to bring Kevin\u2019s imaginary world once again alive, and to launch his unique artwork for the fantasy world.  Kevin would like to set up a fully-fledged website (goblinmaster.online)  where his work can be seen and purchased without the need for 'kick-starts'.  He can then merrily take requests from supporters as to product lines and ideas, or he can work on his pet-projects and the beloved Goblin families and the situations they find themselves in, that have made his life such fun!\n Please note that the current range are created from scratch; no characters have been adapted from existing models (and no goblins were harmed in the process).\nTreadmill of Hubris\nAs we all know, Dwarfs love their ale; and in this, they have a weakness, and often come a cropper.  The treadmill of hubris is a true demonstration of this.\nThe backdrop is that the goblins (in this case, Boglets, a small variant of goblin, that takes delight in trickery, cunning, and humiliation of their foe), having discovered a couple of Dwarfs drunk next to their barrel of ale, captures and enslaves them.  It is normal for Boglets to use the Dwarfs own barrel of beer as the cornerstone of their enslavement, and they do this with great mirth and delight in what the Boglets have coined, the Treadmill of Hubris.\nIt is a simple story; upon capture, the Dwarfs plead for their live, and seemingly being magnanimous the Boglets agree on the basis that they will commit to being slaves until their barrel of ale has become exhausted and the Dwarfs have fully sobered up.  The Boglets then use the barrel as the treadmill and lash the Dwarfs to a control bar to support them as they \u2018tread\u2019.\nUnbeknownst to the Dwarfs, the Boglets urinate in the barrel to keep it topped up (apparently 5 Boglets can produce sufficient urine so as to perpetually feed the Dwarfs \u2013 there is some science behind this, but that is another story). The Boglets add some strange fungi to the brew and produce a slightly hallucinogenic and intoxicating liquid that fool the Dwarfs into believing it is their ale.\nThe Boglets have no intention of ever letting their foe go\u2026.. Over the following weeks and sometimes months, the Boglets pimp-up their Treadmill wagon, and in this case it has a grinder and smasher; the team of Boglets are using snappers to encourage the Dwarfs when moving at \u2018battle-speed\u2019, and some other Boglets use a dung-barrel to dump onto their foe in battle.\nWe don\u2019t know what happens to the Dwarfs, they usually only last a couple of months; the Boglets either capture a new brace of Dwarfs, or dump the wagon.  Given the stature of the Dwarfs in this image, they are clearly new to the treadmill, cursing each other for not pulling their weight and for snoozing whilst drinking ale, thus causing their capture.  The Hubris bit is so the Boglets can have another laugh at the expense of the Dwarfs \u2026 Dutch courage an\u2019 all.  Dwarfs are way-too-proud and over-confident to be left without a Boglet ribbing.\nTreadmill Casting\nTreadmill Front\nTreadmill Back\nTreadmill Side\nCloser view of the Boglet crew (only 6 pieces shown)\nThe Treadmill of Hubris Boglet Crew is available to be pledged separately, however it is specifically designed to be used with the war wagon, and therefore does not have a base-insert. \n(Boglets have thin pegs so that there is freedom to drill holes anywhere in the base or roof thus allowing kustomisation of individual waggons and you could add that and soon we will have more Boglets that can be added or used as replacements for the Krew allowing for further individual kustomisation)\nPAINTED PICTURES COMING SOON!\nBaleful Boglet Bounders\nBoglets usually group in squads of between 6 and 10 beings; lead by a peer who has the greatest reputation for combining spite and irony.  The ability to think up and create new demeaning treatment of their friends and foe alike determines the success of each squad. Boglets if anything, are adaptive and experimental, using whatever is at hand to be their weapon of choice.\nIn this set, they use a variety of 'tools' to exercise their malice and malevolence, some designed to incapacitate their foe, others designed to purely humiliate.  Boglets, their height usually no more than an adult man's leg, will use attacks that are either high-level, or play to their strengths at lower levels; snappers with Boglet lancers are part of the 'and' world, the lance targets the enemy's upper-torso, and the snapper targets the lower;  one bight can easily sever a leg from a man, however they are often trained to attack softer regions.  Snappers have powerful legs, and can be trained to jump, sometimes Boglets have been known to use them a bit like bouncing-sticks and bouncing balls, riding them with glee.\nWord is that some Boglet Baddasses are being created later this year;  these are irksome creatures who care very little for any form of public decency and honour.  They are the most-ignoblest of life-forms, with their sole aim to humiliate others, and to be repulsive.  Kevin will rue the day these beggars were spawned on his workbench ....\nAll 8 Bounders\nWily Waggeries\nA little known fact of wizards is that their pointed hats are very precious to them; besides their quarterstaff, a wizard's hat is considered what defines the person who wears it.  And boy, don\u2019t the goblins all know this !!!  As part of inciting and goading wizards, Boglets will try, often to their demise, to target the wizards hat in an attack.  If they ever get hold of it, they will often urinate in the bearded-ones favourite clothing.  Wizards are not as liberal as one may believe, and will become incensed by this act and will often go berserk, killing the Boglets in an instance.  However the Boglets don\u2019t really care, the humour and insult are well worth the consequence; their names often become legendary and part of Boglet folklore.\nDon't get me started on what Boglets would do to a Wizard's Spell Book ...!!!\nAs for the wizard who has the misfortune of losing their hat, their peers sometime offer great support in dealing with the emotional upset, but their reputation can be irreparably tarnished. \nPesky Boglets!\nNEWSFLASH ....... NEWSFLASH .....  Kev has just given an update on the Wily Waggeries ....\nThe Boglets have majorly overlooked an important tool of the Wizard..... the Wizard Bertram Baptiste Bap has a very powerful wand tucked away up his sleeve. The wizard, partly out of anger, and partly out of exasperation, launches a spell using the wand ..... a spell incorrectly spoken as the spell book had been defiled, with a broken and emotional voice.  BANG !!!  The incantations were to direct the wand to turn these pesky goblins into fungus.  But no.  What was actually uttered by Baptiste turned these Boglets into a new and terrifying breed of goblin.  May the Great Goblin God forgive us ... for Baptiste has sinned ....\nFor those folk who pledged the \u00a3135 or more will be getting *** FREE OF CHARGE *** one of these new lines of Goblin as part of the package\nLook out for these new creatures on the website after this Kickstarter !!!!\nThe Oddgoblin\nThis new model is 20mm tall, so fits in with the existing scale of the Boglets.  Wizards can be good creatures, but sometimes they can be foolish - these creatures will come to haunt and plague the other beings in the world .... what have you done, Baptiste !!!?\n\nThe Goblinmaster (limited edition)\nKevin designed a 'punk' goblin many years ago - purely for personal consumption, never manufactured or displayed anywhere other than amongst family.  As part of this kickstart release, Goblinmaster will create a limited edition EXCLUSIVELY for those who support this funding initiative (for example, if 200 people request a copy on KIckstarter, then only 200 will be produced).\nBut beware, The Goblinmaster is the Manneken Pis of the Goblin World !!\nWill be available for pledges at \u00a310 if the stretch goal is met!\nThe old punk goblin (Kev will make a new one)\nThe new Goblin Master\n\nWhat else is included?\n- Custom Packaging\n- Guarantees for damaged goods\n- Directly supporting the artist!\n\n DISCLAIMER : ALL MODELS WILL BE SOLD AS CAST METAL (zero lead)\nNOTE:   POSTAL / DELIVERY CHARGES ARE NOT INCLUDED, WE WILL CONTACT YOU WITH COSTS DEPENDING ON THE WEIGHT OF YOUR ORDER AND WHAT COUNTRY YOU ARE IN.\n                BASES NOT INCLUDED\n\u00a38000   - At least one limited edition character made available (maximum production run of the number who pledge as part of this initiative )\n\u00a310,000   - Launch Boglet Baddasses,  Hoboglets, and Space Orc sets by August 2020\n\u00a315,000   - A further 8 sets launched by December 2020\nAll Future Work will be Sold on : GoblinMaster.Online ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt this point in the development cycle, the key risks are that we are trying to use recyclable materials, low- or zero-lead metals, and other environmentally friendly approaches.

This time however we have decided to change direction in the theme of the model itself and we will be creating a Privateer character; Gabrielle Kalothetos, the captain of a powerful interstellar ship exploring the fringes of Imperial space.\nLike our 2019 model, Gabrielle will come in two poses, a standard release pose which will be available for general sale and an exclusive event variant which is intended to be used by Event Organisers as prize support or event swag. This is to try and maintain some exclusivity for the Event models but still give people an opportunity to buy a variant of the model if they don't think they will attend an event which will have it available. The model itself was designed by Nuclear Shrimp Studios and the artwork of Gabrielle was done by Simartian, Siman Vlaisavljevi\u0107 (https://www.artstation.com/simartian).\nPrivateer Gabrielle Kalothetos\nSomething new which we are introducing with this project is the inclusion of the exclusive Pledge Coins. In the past whenever planning our project we have always tried to find something to show our appreciation to the backers and thank them for supporting the projects at this stage, during the Kickstarter. This is something we hope will fill that niche for both this project and future ones. The Pledge Coins themselves are 40mm metal coins with the AUS30K logo on one side and a unique design on the reverse face representing the project they are linked to. Each backer who supports the project with a pledge that has a physical reward will receive a coin with their pledge when it arrives. The design for this project is the iconic Corinthian helm which Gabrielle own helmet is modeled off.\nThe Pledge Coin for the Privateer Gabriel Kalothetos 2020 Event Model Kickstarter\nLike the previous event model project we have already completed the 3D design of the model itself and will be starting to create the masters for the mold making process. It is hopeful that we will get images of both the masters before the project completes to give you, the backer an opportunity to see a physical model, not just a render.\nPLAY\n\nGeneral Sale version above\nPLAY\n\nEvent Exclusive version above\nINDIVIDUAL PLEDGES\nThe current range of models available to the Individual pledges are shown below and include;\nPrivateer Gabrielle Kalothetos (2020 Event model, general sale only)\nKnight House Engineer (2019 Event model, general sale only)\nKnight House Envoy (2018 Event model)\nMaggot Men (all three variants available, each counts as one model)\nNow unlocked and only available at this price as part of the Kickstarter!\nPuppet Master \nPuppet Master Portal - Human Male \nPuppet Master Portal - Human Female\nPuppet Master Portal - Marine\nAny combination of these models may be selected in your pledge, but only pledges which contain a Privateer will qualify for a Pledge Coin.\nPuppet Master (Unlocked via Stretch Goals)\nPuppet Master Portal - Human Male WIP (Unlocked via Stretch Goals)\n\n\nEVENT SUPPORT PLEDGES\nEvent Support pledges have access to all of the above models in addition to the Event Exclusive variant of the Privateer model, at least half of the models in an Event Support Pledge must be the Privateer. Only a single Pledge Coin is supplied.\nThe event exclusive version, only available through the Event Pledge\nADD ONS\nTo accompany this model all backer can also access products from our previous Unarmoured Marine project to add onto their pledges. \nUnarmoured Marines\nThese were the second models we produced and funded through Kickstarter in late 2017. They comprise of 5 uniquely posed models without powered armour, intended to represent prisoners of war stripped of their protection. They come in two sizes, regular and extra large, the latter is in line with the Primaris sized models.\n            Individuals can add a set of these to their pledge for $44 for the regular size or $49 for the extra large (normally $49/$54 respectively).\n            Event Organisers can add individual models (a minimum of ten) to their pledges for $7.50 each or $8 each for the extra large size. These pledges will contain an even (as much as possible) distribution of the five different poses.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIn the event that the project funds over and above the goal we have some Stretch Goals planned;\nUNLOCKED - Unit Reference Card\nEach Privateer model (Individual and Event pledges), will be accompanied by a unit reference card containing the Gabrielle's custom rules and statistics.\nUNLOCKED $2,000 - Floating Puppet Master Model\nThis model will be made available as an add ons for all pledges and will also include a unit reference card. For the Kickstarter only this model, if unlocked, will be the same price as a regular infantry model!! $15 (or $13 if you are an early bird) to add or simply counts as a single model in a multi model pledge!\nUNLOCKED $3,000 - Puppet Master Portal (Human Male) Model \nUNLOCKED $3,500 - Puppet Master Portal (Human Female) Model \nUNLOCKED $4,000 - Puppet Master Portal (Marine) Model \nAll three of these models will be made available as an add ons for all pledges and will also include a unit reference card.

More details on that will be provided closer to the date of the event.\nPostage\nLike many projects before us we have been stung by the price rises of international postage. Because of this we have had to move the shipping cost component to the pledge manager stage shortly before fulfillment. Currently the costs post to international destinations are listed below, with luck this will not change between now and the fulfillment stage. These prices are based on bulk mail out orders, if individuals need their pledge sent separately, the cost may be higher then what is listed here.\n\n            New Zealand \n            Up to 500g: $15  (around two dozen models)\nNorth America, Western Europe, Asia and the Pacific\n            Up to 250g: $15  (around a dozen models)\n            Up to 500g: $20  (around two dozen models)\nRest of the world\n            Up to 250g: $15 (around a dozen models)\n            Up to 500g: $25 (around two dozen models)\n\n            *: unless requested, we will attempt to pack as many models into blisters as possible. If you request a 1:1 ratio of model per blister, this may result in a higher shipping cost.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our fifth project creating a model along with the trials and tribulations of production and distribution. We have worked closely with both 3rd parties involved in this particular project and are confident that we have ironed out any teething problems from the previous experiences.\nThe model itself has been fully designed already and as the project goes live the master has been printed and is in preparation for the mold creation. This will significantly speed up the production time, although it did require a lot more up front investment.\nThe major hiccup which we encountered on the last Kickstarter project was the international distribution. This came about from relying on a courier who had assured us that they would have rolled out international pickup to our location in time for our fulfillment. This did not happen and so were forced to instead ship the individual parcels in a single bulk lot to a secondary pickup location from where they were then dispatched. This caused some delays in the 2nd and 3rd wave for international backers.\nWe have taken steps to prevent this from occurring again with alternative courier contracts and other methods for distribution.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 15 or more", "title": "Individual Model", "descp": "This pledge is for a single Privateer model, cast in resin and the exclusive pledge coin.

This secretive audio visual group is comprised of 4 individuals (1 visual artist and 3 musicians). But to the general public they are known as the virtual characters that represent them: femme boss and front woman Cherry, keytarist Goldie Foxx and DJ Dyna Mink.\nJoin us on this adventure by following us on: YOUTUBE, INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK, TUMBLR!\nNot attached to any major label or conglomerate to date, Studio Killers is made through the hard work and dedication of the 4 people behind the band. The crew all have side gigs to make ends meet. The main visual artist creates the majority of all the visual work by herself, scaling up with a small crew for music videos and bigger events like this Kickstarter! Studio Killers has been a passion project fuelled by love, family, friends and fans.\nThis animated Studio Killers 404 pilot/special will be a parody on the classic magical girl trope. Kind of a crossbreed between Sailor Moon and Rick and Morty. It will feature a brand new song and a full soundtrack!\nIntroducing new characters for you to love!\nThrown into cyberspace and left fending for their very existence, Cherry and the Studio Killers are building an army of LGBTQ+ positive, misfits and outliers, on a quest to overthrow the Evil Algorithm, a deep state like organization that is destroying the internet and erasing all it\u2019s weird wonders. Style battles, a war between cats and porn, a whole planet dedicated to taco memes - there's so much to explore and save! Cherry\u2019s using her unique power of style to bring the \u2018love\u2019 back! \nCherry and the Studio Killers' big dream is to create an animated series to push this project to the next level and to deliver the kind of amazing jaw dropping content they\u2019re known for, but with much healthier business structure! Getting an animated series signed with a Network or VOD would drive all our other content, ensuring the project's future! There has been a lot of interest from partners and networks, but ultimately development, pitching, and negotiations often take several years with the additional added 1.5-3 years of production before the fans get to see anything at all, if ever. We\u2019d really prefer not to keep you in the dark THAT long.\nWith this Kickstarter we can share with you the process and the journey of creating an amazing animated special that doubles as a pilot for the series! With you the backers getting to see it as soon as it\u2019s done regardless of future deals in the making. While at the same time being able to create some amazing rewards for you to get your hands on! \nVisually stunning animated mayhem!\nYou can help by backing this campaign which you will be rewarded for with amazing swag! If you can't back this Kickstarter for whatever reason, you can still help by sharing this project with friends and family far and wide. Share it with anyone you think would love seeing a crazy action comedy magical girl concept with stunning art and great music! \nThe Writers for the Pilot\nFor the special Cherry will be working with Alison Norrington of storycentral.com, a storyteller who has worked across theme parks, film, television, crowdfunding and gaming. She will make sure that the Studio Killers 404 special and series concept is as uncompromising and fearless as Cherry herself.\nThe Writers for the series\nFor the series we\u2019re putting together a kick-ass team of diverse and inclusive talent handpicked throughout the industry to represent all the values that Studio Killers is founded on while being the kind of funny crazy super nerds with the experience of pulling off a hit series. We aim to walk the walk.\nThe Animation\nCherry (the visual artist) has a long history of running and building productions. With her knowledge, skills and contacts she has the tools to build an ace team to produce the special. We believe in creator driven properties and that is what this will be, with the reigns securely in the hands of the creator herself. We have many ties to production companies and talent, so we're ready to scale as needed!\nMajority of the money will be used for animation production. In fact our current goal is quite tight! So we plan to put in lots of our own resources and time to make this happen. Which is how we Studio Killers get things done.\n\nNEW STRETCH GOAL 220,000\u00a3!!! \nAMAZING! THIS IS GONNA BE HUGE! We reached our goal in under 48 hours!!! Our new goal is to double the fun! By doubling the length of the pilot from our planned 11 minutes to a robust 22 minutes!

Once we get into the series, episodes take less time to produce.\n\nDelivery of most rewards is set for august 2020. In the case of signed items, the reward delivery is set for December 2020. We need this time to make sure all the products meet our standards of quality and to create the pilot which is part of every reward tier! \n\nEven if we make and deliver the pilot, there is no guarantee that we will land a deal for an animated series.

Should for some reason, luck not be in our favor, we will let everyone know what our next steps will be.\n\nWhatever happens you will definitely see what we ever have made with the money, even if that should be an unfinished pilot!\n\nThank you for your support and understanding!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or

We love tabletop games. We love anthropomorphic animals, from Disney's Robin Hood through The Wind in the Willows to Brian Jaques' Redwall books. So we combined the things we love in our Burrows & Badgers tabletop skirmish game and the accompanying range of miniatures. And our Kickstarter backers have already helped us to grow the range to over 100 miniatures - but now it's time to add some more!\nSome miniatures from previous projects...\n\nWhy are we making more miniatures?\nBecause we want more characters for our Burrows & Badgers games \u2013 my Freebeast warband needs reinforcements, for a start! \nAnd we know a lot of other people are looking for more anthropomorphic animal miniatures too. A lot of people are playing Burrows & Badgers now, and many of them have asked for Massive Hounds and a Massive Raptor, so we've sculpted them! Some will want to use them for other tabletop or roleplaying games, while others love painting miniatures, and our figures are perfect for that, full of character ready to be brought to life with your paintbrush....\nAnd some people just love collecting miniatures; again, we've made this new set of Burrows & Badgers figures perfect for collectors. They are all single piece models, with integral bases, so there are no fiddly parts to be glued on.\nWe love making miniatures; we hope you'll love our miniatures too.\nWhy we need your help...\nWe've got 17 new miniatures sculpted, but they need to have moulds made before we can start producing the miniatures. And that's why we need funding; to get the production moulds made, and get the casting process started.\nAbout the miniatures...\nThere are other ranges of anthropomorphic animal miniatures out there, but ours are a little different. We didn't want all the races of animals to be the same size. Instead, we've scaled them to each other; so a shrew or a mouse is a very small model, about 20mm tall, and a really big animal like a badger will stand about 50mm tall, for example.\nEach sculpted figure shown below has a scale picture with it, showing its height in millimetres. All our models are supplied unpainted.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about the Burrows & Badgers range and the game, here's a link to the Burrows & Badgers website and to the Facebook Group (which is the friendliest Group on FB, I reckon!):\n\nThe Pledges\nWe\u2019re keeping it as simple as possible; there\u2019s an \u2018All-in\u2019 pledge, which gets you all the new miniatures in this Kickstarter, and any bonus bits that may come along\u2026 there\u2019s also a \u2018Pick\u2019n\u2019Mix\u2019 Pledge, if you just want to get a few of the new miniatures.

It's a brand new version of Say What You See, the the greatest Catchphrase-style rebus puzzle game ever (Don't just take our word for it - Harry Potter star Tom Felton loves it too!).\n- Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy, The Harry Potter Series)\nWe've got some amazing offers for you during this Kickstarter too, including:\n Great deals on Puzzle Pass annual subscriptions (which give you access to over 50 canvases at launch, at least 25 more in the first year, and tons of other benefits)\n Signed copies of the new Jim'll Paint It Book 'Of Mouse and Man' \n Jim'll Paint It signed Say What You See canvas prints \nThe chance to appear in a future SWYS painting done by Jim'll Paint It \n And lots more! \nA sample puzzle from our game - it's \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\"!\nLaunched by Big Ideas Digital almost 10 years ago, 'Say What You See: The Collection' was a mobile puzzle app like no other. Based on a concept by Big Ideas Digital owner David Stevens, it presented players with large themed canvas paintings, each with 50 rebus picture puzzles hidden inside for players to find and solve. It\u2018s also known as SWYS*.\nIf you've ever seen the TV show Catchphrase, or seen the puzzles under the bottle caps of Lone Star beers, you'll know how a rebus puzzle works - just look at the puzzle and Say What You See!\nHere's a small sample of the US TV Shows canvas to give you the idea:   \nThose puzzles explained: Buffy The Vampire Slayer - It's a buff 'E' slaying a Vampire! Charlie's Angels - It's Charlie Chaplin surrounded by angels! Knight Rider - He's riding a knight!\nYou can click here to play trial versions of some of the canvases at our website - give it a go, and you'll quickly see how much fun it is! \nAn instant success on launch in 2010, Say What You See: The Collection was a #1 app, and had over 2.5m downloads. It was also among the top 30 most popular apps of 2011. Over the next four years, Say What You See released over 50 canvases, and several spin-off apps, including a popular official tie-in version with the BBC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who. Click here to try it! We did an interview about it with Pocket Gamer, which you can read here. The Doctor Who canvases will be available in this new app too!\n- The Doctor Who version featured over 150 Doctor Who-inspired puzzles!\nSadly, all good things eventually come to an end, and in 2014 the app was discontinued when its parent company was sold on.\nBut the story doesn't have to end there. Cybernet Apps (a new company made up of ex-Big Ideas Digital staff) have licensed the game's IP, and are all ready to create a brand new Say What You See app - \"Say What You See: Ultimate Edition\".\nWe just need your help to make it happen.   \nWe want \"Say What You See: Ultimate Edition\" to be just that. It will contain the 50 original canvases produced for the various Say What You See apps, as well as new canvases every month. \nWe're bringing back all the classic Say What You See artists like Army of Trolls (Arcade Classics, Console Classics), Ryan Firchau (Fantasy Movies, Doctor Who) and Martin Davey (Christmas Movies, Grace's Toons). We're also very excited to announce our Exclusive Backer's Canvas artist...\nYes, our Exclusive Backer's Canvas will be created by internet sensation Jim'll Paint It! All Reward tiers from \u00a35 and up include Jim's Exclusive Backer's Canvas in the game. \n\"Ask me to paint anything you wish and I will try no matter how specific or surreal your demands. You name it. I\u2019ll paint it. On Paint.\u201d\nSince making this promise, back in 2013, Jim has painted some 400 requests - covering everything from Thom Yorke the Tank Engine and Dad\u2019s Army of Darkness to Mick Jagger disappointing customers at the paint mixing station in B&Q by matching every colour as black - each brought to life with painstaking detail using nothing but an archaic version of Microsoft Paint and an optical mouse. \n- Just a few of the brilliant images that have spewed from Jim's mind.\nWe're really excited to have Jim come on board to do his first Say What You See canvas, and we've got some great new backer deals that will let you get a signed copy of his brand new book 'Of Mouse and Man' (unbound Publishing, RRP \u00a325) or even a signed print of his upcoming canvas!\nAt Say What You See, we pride ourselves on finding the very best artistic talent around. Check out some of the 50 Canvases we've already produced:\nArcade Classics Canvas - by Army of Trolls\nFantasy Movies Canvas - by Ryan Firchau\nKids Cartoons - by Martin Davey\nRock Bands - By Aileen Raistrick\nHere's the full list of already produced canvases. The 50 canvases below are all completed already. All 50 will be unlocked and ready to play at launch with any subscription. On top of all these, we'll be producing new canvases every month, just as we did before.\nThe 50 original SWYS canvases.\nSay What You See is suitable for gamers of any age, gender or dexterity. Playing it is as easy as 1, 2, 3!\n1. Search for a potential puzzle, based on the canvas theme. Don't be shy to get a closer look too - use finger pinches and stretches to zoom in and out, and swipes to scroll around the image!\n2. Tap the puzzle and type in your guess... \n3. Repeat until you solve all 50 puzzles and the canvas!  \nWhile the initial app download and starter canvas is free, additional canvas downloads can either be cherry picked individually with one-off in-app purchases, or you can unlock all the current and future canvases at once by purchasing a Puzzle Pass Subscription! \nHere's how the subscriptions stack up!\nSubscribing offers the ultimate Say What You See experience. No ads, early access to canvases, free hint coins every month, and a store discount for purchasing Say What You See merch!  \nBuying a 1, 2, or 3 year Gold Puzzle Pass subscription will give you access to 50 canvases at launch, plus all additional canvases released over the duration of your sub. That's 2500 individual Say What You See puzzles at launch!\nThis Kickstarter is a great time to purchase a Gold Puzzle Pass Subscription, as we're offering massive discounts of up to 50% off if you're quick enough to grab an early bird package. \nAnd if you're already a big SWYS fan, you can even purchase a lifetime Platinum Puzzle Pass Subscription which will last for the entire length of the app's life. You'll never have to buy another canvas again! Plus you'll get access to Demo builds as we develop the app, meaning you'll be playing Say What You See again before anyone else!\nPlus, in addition to all the Gold Puzzle Pass benefits, you'll get EXTRA bonus canvases that are only available to Platinum Pass Subscribers! It gets better too - we're offering a whopping 60% off for this Kickstarter only - that's better than half price!\nThese discount rates will never be available again, so there really is no better time to subscribe.   \nWe do appreciate that some people simply don't like subscriptions, so there's also the Gold Digger tier, where you can purchase 25 canvas unlocks of your choice upon the app's release. \nApp Will Be Available On Android and Apple Devices\nSay What You See: Ultimate Edition is currently aimed at most mobile and tablet devices - but we're not ruling other platforms in the future! Currently we're targeting:\niPhone and iPad (iOS 12.0+)\nAndroid phones and Android tablets (Android OS 8.0+)\nWe're aware that a lot of SWYS fans purchased canvases on the original app, and while we don't have access to the old App Store and Google Play accounts, and can't restore purchases, we don't want our oldest fans to feel ignored. So for this Kickstarter period, we'll be running the Canvas Exchange Program. \nIf you back our Kickstarter at the Early Bird Gold Puzzle Pass tier or above, you'll have the option to exchange all your old paid canvases* for the equivalent amount of canvas unlocks in the new app. You can either spend them on the same canvases, or brand new ones! These canvases will be yours to keep whether or not you stay subscribed to the app. \n*NB. Proof of purchase, which can be found in your Google/iTunes accounts will be required.  We will show you how to find and send this information to us once the Kickstarter has completed. \nIf you check out the rewards section, you'll see we've got some amazing backer rewards available, including:\nA once in a lifetime chance to own a beautiful gallery-quality giclee print of Jim'll Paint It's Backer's Canvas\nSigned copies of Jim's brand new book \"Of Mouse and Man\"\n- Signed copies of Jim's brand new book 'Of Mouse and Man' are available in the rewards!\nThe chance to have your face painted into the canvas by Jim, preserved in the app for all time! And hey, if you're not a fan of putting yourself in the picture, think what an amazing birthday, wedding or anniversary gift it would make for a loved one!\nAnd of course, almost all backers* will get access to the Jim'll Paint It exclusive backer's canvas, as a thank you for your support.\n\nNeed a handy guide to see which rewards you get at each tier? We've got you covered, with this handy matrix diagram that we spent many hours making. \n*\u00a31 tier excepted. \nRewards Matrix\nSo the Say What You See project is awesome, right? Well what if we told you we could make it even more awesome by telling other people about it? \nAs you tick off backer achievements by helping us spread the word about this Kickstarter campaign on social media, you'll unlock some awesome backer rewards! \nThese rewards will change the Kickstarter for everyone, from unlocking  free hint coins to getting awesome physical rewards. Get all 36 achievements and you\u2019ll earn a new free canvas for every single backer! We'll be revealing more achievements as each target is hit. \nThe links for the content you need to promote can be found below the picture. \nBacker achievements and rewards\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/swysapp \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SWYSApp \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/swys_puzzle_app \nDavid Stevens - SWYS Creator\nDavid Stevens is the owner of Big Ideas Digital, and the creator of the Say What You See franchise. \nFormally VP at 20th Century Fox, David has built and run several companies in the technology and media space. He also makes a pretty mean cup of tea.  \nJon Hamblin - SWYS Designer, puzzle writer and pun-master.\nJon Hamblin was the designer of Say What You See: The Collection, and also the author of most of the original canvas puzzles. He also ran the social media channels, customer support and tea making for Big Ideas Digital. \nSince then, he's gone on to produce several award-winning games, and most recently worked on Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout for Devolver Digital and Mediatonic.\nHe'll be running this Kickstarter campaign, designing Say What You See: Ultimate Edition, writing all the puzzles and probably doing all the washing up. Again. \nCarleton Handley - Programmer extraordinaire\nCarleton Handley has been programming since the 8-bit era, notoriously coding the original Spitting Image game for Domark on the Commodore 64. \nCarleton was the programmer on Say What You See: The Collection, and he's keen to get started on bringing this classic series back to life. \nIf you're good enough to back this project, it's only fair to tell you how we're going to spend the money. \nWe've asked for the absolute bare minimum to make this project, and it breaks down into three sections - app development, UI (Essentially the menus, animations and whizzy graphics) and content, which is the canvases themselves. \nBudget Breakdown: App Development - 50%, UI/UX - 30%, Content, 20%\nIf we are lucky enough to get more than our goal, we'll be spending the extra money on more content for the app and marketing. So the more you fund the app, the more canvases and content you'll get! \nFinally, you might wonder why we're bringing this project to Kickstarter. \nIt's pretty simple really. Ever since we made the original Say What You See app, we've been passionate fans ourselves. It was heartbreaking for us when the app's first run ended, and behind the scenes we've been working tirelessly ever since to bring it back.\nNow the planets have aligned, and we have the Say What You See license back, we're keen to start making it as soon as possible - so rather than spending months looking for independent funding, we decided to Kickstart the development by bringing it to the SWYS fans first. \nOne of the biggest reasons the app died originally is that Say What You See is not a cheap game to make. We pride ourselves on only using the best artists from around the world and keeping the quality bar extremely high. The money raised by this Kickstarter will go towards new canvases, development costs and a fresh new look for the app. We're only asking for the barest minimum to make the project, and any extra money we make will go on more content. \nThat's why we're asking you, the fans, to help. Simply put, if the Kickstarter doesn't work, the app just won't get made. \nGiven how much joy this app has brought to people over the years, we think that'd be a shame. So let's all work together to bring Say What You See  back - and hopefully add a few extra smiles to the world in the process. \nSay What You See has had lots of press - here's where you might have seen us!\n*Oh and finally, sorry to any confused rugby fans who\u2018ve been directed here by Google - it stands for Say What You See and not Swys de Bruin, the Isuzu Southern Kings rugby coach \ud83d\ude09", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're a small team, and sometimes there are unforeseen bumps in the road. Games get delayed sometimes, and it would be impossible for us to promise you this one won't be.\n\nThat said, we've made Say What You See in several flavours before, and we're confident that we've set a timetable and budget that we can stick to. We've spent months trying to get this one right because we believe in the game (and really, really want to play it again!) We\u2019re certain the game will be made, and that you\u2019ll get all the rewards you\u2019ve backed for.\n\nIt's important to note that this is not some corporation buying an old license and trying to wring some cash out of it - this is a passion project from the people who started Say What You See. We're hoping that there\u2019s enough fans out there to help bring this app back through crowdfunding. \n\nWe want to create the Ultimate Edition of Say What You See, and with your help, we think we can do it.\n\nWe know Say What You See is special to many of you - It\u2019s certainly very special to us. Let\u2019s all work together to bring this app back, and this time, keep it around for good.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jon Hamblin\nFirst created \u00b7 7 backed\nProducer of several BAFTA-nominated games, Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout and designer of Say What You See, the popular mobile game.See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "The New Supporter", "descp": "\u25ba Support the project, and gain our eternal thanks!\nINCLUDES:\n\ud83d\ude4f Our Eternal Thanks", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "The Bet Hedger", "descp": "\u25ba Pledge \u00a35 and you'll get access to our exclusive backers canvas!\nThe canvas will be unlocked in the app via a unique code that will be distributed to backers.\nNEW!

Pre-order your copy here.\nALL EXPANSIONS AND BOOSTERS UNLOCKED!\nRendered image. Design not final.\nRendered image. Design not final.\nRendered image. Design not final.\n NOTE: For 4 weeks after the campaign finishes, all late pledges, upgraded pledges, and add-ons in BackerKit will count toward stretch goals. Donated decks and books will be paid for with a portion of post-campaign raised through BackerKit and pre-sales, not through Kickstarter funds.\n The Story Engine is a deck of 150 cards (now upgraded to 180 with stretch goals!) that offer endless storytelling prompts for writers, teachers, artists, DMs, RPG players, and more.\nIt runs on a simple, fast, open-ended system of drawing and arranging cards to create prompts for:\nStory ideas\nCharacter concepts\nEncounter premises\nMagical items\nCampaign hooks\nIt's all in how you arrange the cards, interpret the connections between them, and bring the concept to life.\nNote: This is a rendered image and not a final design.\nThe Story Engine deck works in any setting or genre. You can use recommended patterns for generating prompts for specific writing goals, or come up with your own systems.\nI've been using it to generate ideas for my weekly postcard fiction project, The Shortest Story, and using my stories to refine the deck system and simplify mechanics. \nBecause every story I write for The Shortest Story fits on a postcard and features an entirely new premise, it's the perfect testing ground for new ideas. I've collected 90 of the best stories I wrote while developing the deck into The Story Engine anthology (now 94 with stretch goals)! \nNote: This is a rendered image and not a final design.\nIt changed my life and helped me produce my best work when I discovered a creative structure that got me over my anxieties and mental blocks about writing.\nI think there are thousands of other people out there who have stories to tell, and just need a bit of help getting the words out.\nIf that sounds familiar, this project is for you.\nThe Story Engine deck has only two core rules:\n1) Don't leave the table without creating something, even if it's only in your head.\n2) Ignore any rule or guideline that doesn't serve your creative process.\nI've consulted friends who are writers, game designers, Tarot readers and artists for their thoughts, and come up with additional guidelines and recommendations for creating powerful prompts.\nThe Story Engine deck is made up of five types of cards that each tap into an element of what makes a powerful, interesting, and unique story.\nTo create the simplest form of a prompt:\n Draw and play 1 Agent to create a character\n Draw and play 1 Engine to give them a motivation\n Draw and play 1 Anchor to focus the Engine on an object, event or location\n Draw and play 1 Obstacle to create the central conflict of the story\n Draw and tuck 1 Aspect (place it under the Agent or Anchor, your choice) to add more detail\nEvery card in the deck is multi-sided, and can be rotated to create different interpretations or thematically linked variations of the same prompt.\n As you play your cards, arrange the cards so the version of the prompt you wish to use is facing you. You can interpret cards literally (where the Agent card \"Artist\" means a person who creates art) or in an open-ended way (where \"Artist\" means anyone with creative powers, like a prolific inventor, a manic genius, or a master heist-planner). \nWhen you're done, you'll have the basic prompt for your story: a character who wants something, and an obstacle to overcome to get it. Let your imagination take it from there.\nThis could be an apocalypse survivor who finds a seemingly perfect haven community with a dark secret, and must decide whether to dig deeper.\nOr an ageing war veteran who moves into an idyllic senior's residence, only to discover that the place is so nice because it's used to launder money.\nOr an addiction survivor finds out that their online support group, previously a haven in their journey to recovery, is being used to identify vulnerable targets for identity theft. The discover the group organizers are in on it. Confronting this problem will mean being hated for dissolving the group.\nThis basic pattern takes seconds to set up and offers more than 12,000,000,000 unique prompts to get you started, but there are endless card patterns you can use to open your storytelling options.\nYou can also use face-down cards to represent pre-existing portions of a story, such as player characters, NPCs, or important items/locations.\nHere's how you create a quick random encounter with an NPC with an agenda involving a party member.\n This could be a clairvoyant fire mage who spreads a rumour about a party member as a scare tactic to keep their congregation in line as their authority crumbles due to ailing health.\nOr the fire-and-brimstone leader of an apocalypse cult, whose last failed end-of-the-world prediction didn't come true, and they're blaming it on the party.\nHere's how you generate a sentient magic item or haunted location that wants something from a player, and will imprint its will on them.\n This could be a heavenly, golden trumpet, whose previous owner was tasked with closing down the fighting pits, and failed. If a party member finds it, they'll have the ability to play divine anthems to buff the party, but will be imprinted with a quest to go shut down blood sports once and for all.\nOr, the party finds an enchanted harp that plays the music of the spheres, captivating all who hear its strings. It longs to be connected to its previous owner, a disgraced bard who now plays for coin outside an illegal gambling arena on another continent. The harp will slowly possess the player character who finds it, making them play its former owner's songs until they track the bard down and give it back.\nOr you can structure a story or campaign around two rivals who want the same thing:\n The could be the god of war, who has decided that pestilence would be a more efficient way to end humanity. Meanwhile, a demon-plagued vigilante sees the incipient outbreak as a judgment on humanity, and is searching for a way to control who the plague kills so they can wipe out those they see as guilty. The players will have to  stop them both and contain the threat.\nOr a powerful demigod blamed for an ancient cataclysm is back, once again trying to end the world with a virus that sends ordinary people into sudden homicidal fits. Their old adversary, a demon, has possessed the body of a commoner and turned them into a folk hero fighting the outbreak. The party must work with them, however begrudgingly, to learn how the demigod was stopped last time and ensure they fail once again.\nFor an adventure hook tied to a campaign concept, take the rivals spread and have the party stumble across the contested Anchor. Or replace the Anchor with an NPC who approaches the party for help.\nThey must either choose a side, or become a third faction with their own connection to the Anchor.\nThe Story Engine deck gives you endless options for creating, developing, mapping or improvising entire stories, characters, and campaigns.\nI am even developing two-player prompts for collaborative storytelling or mutual writing challenges, along with genre-focused expansion decks for fantasy, science fiction, horror, and more.\nNote for disambiguation: Story Engine is a Precis Intermedia trademark for its collaborative roleplaying game and rules (www.pigames.net). The Story Engine is a Peter Chiykowski trademark for his deck of story prompts (www.storyenginedeck.com). \nI developed The Story Engine deck because I've met so many people who have incredible ideas for stories, books, characters, games and campaigns trapped in their heads, but can't find time or motivation to create them.\nI know first-hand how frustrating that is, and how feels like you're missing out on your best creative years. \nI lost my connection with writing for a few years, and I didn't realize how much colour and depth had drained from my world until I finally picked up the pen again. I knew I might never finish a novel, so I started writing these 25-to-250-word mini-stories, often prompted by scrolling through royalty-free photography sites looking for images that sparked an interest, or jotting down words, phrases or ideas that stuck with me.\nThis eventually became The Shortest Story, my weekly postcard fiction project, which has been running since June 2017. \nIt's also seen me through some really dark times and difficult life transitions. No matter what was going on outside of my little writing nook, I was able to turn to my stories either as an escape, or as an arena to face my down my demons on my own turf. These stories are always the scariest to write, but they're the ones people seek me out to talk to me about again and again, often to tell me about their own creative projects they want to get off the ground.\nI know these stories are speaking to people, and I know people have their own things to say too, their own stories to tell.\nThe project has grown by leaps and bounds since launch and I am excited to unveil three  60-card genre expansion decks as well as a set of six 18-card subgenre boosters for The Story Engine. \nRendered image. Design not final.\nWritten in Dragonfire features 60 cards for fantasy storytelling. I've teamed up with EMBERWIND, a groundbreaking tabletop RPG with stunning visuals and a world-class art team, to bring you some truly eye-watering visuals.\nThe 60-card deck showcases a mixture of existing art from the EMBERWIND lore and illustration library, as well as several new pieces special to this project. As a writer on the EMBERWIND team, I can tell you that the artists have been a major inspiration for pushing my storytelling and worldbuilding to new heights.\nThe cards feature artists from the EMBERWIND roster past and present, including CRUSH Visual, Toma Feizo Gas, William Liu, Colin Searle, Frank Yang, Jonny Hall, baimon, and more. These artists have worked on art for blockbuster movies, AAA video game titles, and tabletop classics like Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, and Magic: The Gathering.\n You can see more of their work in the EMBERWIND lore archive, which includes short stories, free EMBERWIND DLC, and lots of pretty art. You can also download and play a free demo the first act of The Songweave Tapestry, the forthcoming campaign I've been writing with the team for the past year. \nWritten in the Light of Strange Worlds features 60 science -fiction prompt cards, covering ground from tech-driven science fiction, to dystopian futurism, to space travel, to alien contact, to artificial intelligence and beyond.\n\nWritten in Ash and Bone features 60 horror-themed prompt cards covering everything from psychological thrillers, to ghost stories, to slashers, to paranormal investigation, to occult musings, to creepypasta, to classic monster stories.\nThere also booster sets of 18 cards focused on particular subgenres. Booster sets are non-randomized and contain the following breakdown of card types.\n5 Agent cards\n2 Engine cards\n5 Anchor cards\n2 Obstacle cards\n4 Aspect cards\n\nRendered image. Design not final.\nRendered image. Design not final.\n Dark Crafts & Ancient Horrors contains 18 eldritch/Lovecraftian horror-themed cards.\n Cog Hearts & Steam Souls contains 18 steampunk-themed cards and features the art of the tabletop RPG EMBERWIND.\n Circuits & Cybernetics contains 18 cyberpunk-themed cards.\n Wastelands& Wanderers contains 18 post-apocalyptic-themed cards.\n Mythwalkers & Eternals contains 18 mythology-themed cards and features the art of the tabletop RPG EMBERWIND.\n Jackboots & Chainlink contains 18 dystopian-themed cards.\nThe Story Engine: A Postcard Story Collection is a collection of 90 one-page mini-stories (now 94 with stretch goals) that read like postcards from alternate lives, parallel worlds, and broken timelines. \nNote: This is a rendered image and not a final design.\nThe theme of the collection is the idea that humans are story engines. The way we move forward, the way we survive, is by taking our environments and experiences and transforming them into stories.  It's how we take all of our heartbreaks and victories and betrayals and trysts and journeys and make sense of them, turn them into something that powers us, that we can share with others so we aren't alone with it. Stories are a survival mechanism, are the human spirit saying:\nI made it through this, and you can survive this too.\nThe stories in The Story Engine book mix genres and overturn tropes, jumping between:\na parable about demons seeking refuge in the suburbs\na heartfelt internal monologue by a ghost hunter looking back on their resume\na creepy urban legend about a dark entity you can only see with your eyes closed\nYou get to experience it all with the flip of a few pages.  \nThe collection also features 20 brand-new stories that have never appeared on the website before, as a special thank you for backers helping me bring this project to fruition.\nThere will also be 6 stories narrated by Cecil Baldwin, the voice of Welcome to Night Vale, with additional stories voiced by Jonathan Sims (The Magnus Archives) and one more mystery guest.  Below is a sample narrated story.\nYou can read or listen to more stories on shorteststory.com or:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nTumblr\nYouTube\nThe book will be published by ChiZine Publications, an award-winning publisher of dark fiction based in Peterborough Canada.\n The book also includes guest stories by some incredible contributors:\nSebastian A.

If you are interested in any of the older range, and want to save on shipping, there will be an option to add them to your pledge on the Pledge Manager that will be released after the campaign.\n And a huge thank you to all of the ArcWorlde fans who have helped me to get here - you are all wonderful, and I couldn't have done it without you!\nThe cost of shipping is not included in your pledge, and will be added after the conclusion of the campaign through the pledge manager. \nI will provide you all with full instructions when the time comes. I am still finalizing the exact shipping costs, but to give you a rough idea here are a couple of preliminary estimates:\nTREASURE MAP: - \u00a30 unless used to purchase miniatures in the campaign.\nEXPLORER: - \u00a32 to the UK, \u00a34 ROW. Additional shipping will be added if more miniatures are purchased in the campaign.\nADVENTURER/SWASHBUCKLER: \u00a34 to the UK, \u00a310 ROW.\nHERO: \u00a35 to the UK, \u00a312 ROW.\nThese estimates may increase if you purchase a large number of additional models on top of your core pledge. The final shipping costs are subject to change, and will be based on your location and specific rewards.\nFor those of you in the EU - as with everyone else, we have no idea what the outcome of Brexit will be on shipping costs, including any potential tariffs. We will keep you all updated as we find out more.\nSalute Pick-Up\nIf all goes to plan, I will have everything shipped before Salute 2020. If I've been able to stick to these deadlines, a free option to pick up at Salute will available in the pledge manager for those attending the show.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. My father is our resin caster, my mother is in charge of packing and shipment, and our metal caster is a tried and tested person we have worked with for over three years.\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products, all of the initial models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been cast, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in. I will be relying on Work in Progress sculpts and concept art for some of the stretch goals, but be assured that they will be completed and cast in a timely manner once the campaign has been funded.\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing an overly long list of stretch goals, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "(1.1) TREASURE MAP", "descp": "The start of your adventures into ArcWorlde.\nJust fancy a particular model?

In 2017 I did a series of sketches of those creatures and several of those creatures have since made it into miniature form. \nOne of those sketches, 'Juicy', was of a very wealthy trader from Gar Loren who has made his fortune selling a variety of potent juices from his patented mobile juice bars. The juice bars are Voralls; heavily armoured creatures who have had their tusks removed and large quantities of juice strapped to their backs.\nI sculpted a Vorall last year, fully intending to cover the poor creature in as much baggage as I could squeeze onto its shell. I have now had some master casts done and would like to get it into full production. I sent Joe one of the master casts and he has already worked his magic on it:\nThis is going to be another very simple campaign so I can get everything produced and out to backers as quickly as possible! I do have a few ideas for little stretch goals and potential additions during the campaign though, so I hope you give me the excuse I need to bring those to fruition!\nAt the moment there are just three pledge levels, a metal cast of Zhontain on his own, a resin cast of Zhontain with the Juice bar, or your own personal Juice Bar franchise. All models are supplied unpainted and require some assembly.\n\u00a35: The Juice Seller: Metal cast of Zhontain al Griba\n\u00a322: The Juice Bar: Resin cast of Zhontain al Griba and the Vorall Juice Bar with a laser cut wooden base, PLUS: Stat cards for Zhontain, the Juice Bar, Dravu, Chey, the well-fed PreePree and Lady Emarlai\n\u00a345: The Juice Franchise: Resin cast of Zhontain al Griba, two Vorall Juice Bars (with a laser cut wooden bases and one with a variant head and tail), an alternate sign and a little urchin. PLUS: Bonus bottles and Stat cards for Zhontain, the Juice Bar, Dravu, Chey, the well-fed PreePree and Lady Emarlai\nPostage: When you pledge, postage will automatically be added onto your pledge value, depending where in the world you are. The postage for The Juice Bar will also cover any extras you add on. The postage for the Juice Seller has been kept deliberately low, so does not cover postage if you add extras.\n\nThere are a couple of add-on options in case you need more Juice bars or would like a fancy resin base for your juice bar. If you have ordered The Juice Bar pledge level then simply increase your pledge by the necessary amount and I will ask for details after the kickstarter is over.\n\u00a32: 60mm resin base (max of one per Juice Bar ordered)\n\u00a34: Alternate Juice Bar sign and Urchin\n\u00a34: Well-fed PreePree\n\u00a34: Lady Emarlai\n\u00a34: Deck of 6 cards (Zhontain, Juice Bar, Dravu, Chey, Well-fed PreePree and Lady Emarlai)\u00a35: Additional Metal Zhontain\n\u00a38: Mercenaries (2 metal figures)\u00a320: Additional Resin Vorall Juice Bar with wooden base\n\u00a322: Additional Resin Zhontain and Juice Bar with wooden base\n\n\nFor those of you who are new to the World of Anyaral, it's a small scale miniatures skirmish game, involving roughly 28mm scale figures. The world itself is populated by the diminutive Fubarnii, of whom Zhontain is a somewhat overweight example!\nIf you would like to learn more then I would thoroughly recommend going and having a look at the website!\n* I also need to thank Joe Karame and Martin Clark for painting the models I've shared in this kickstarter - Joe is my regular painter and Martin had fun painting one of the master casts of the Juice Bar!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019ve successfully run four kickstarters on my own previously as well as jointly running one with Joek miniatures.

And the best part? for every stretch goal that falls, you get more episodes for exactly the same as what you'd pledge for the first one!\nOne season for the singular price of one episode!\n \nThe DESTINATION FANTASTIC Team \nSatine, Josh, Ron, Stefan and Lorraine\nStefan Pokorny: \nFounder and owner of Dwarven Forge, the industry leader in gaming terrain.\nPart artist, part philosopher, part jester, Stefan Pokorny preaches the virtues of fantasy gaming to all who will listen. Combining art, Dungeons and Dragons, and commerce, he formed his company Dwarven Forge in 1996, which has since become the gaming industry leader in the creation of miniature terrain and other fantasy sculptures. He has raised millions of dollars on Kickstarter for Dwarven Forge with the help of his legions of fans and is the subject of the documentary The Dwarvenaut, which premiered at SXSW in 2016. As an artist, he believes in travelling the world to see and experience all it has to offer in person.\nSatine Phoenix: \nGaming celebrity and former ambassador for D&D. About to go on a promotional tour of Europe for D&D.\nA consummate storyteller and lifelong creative, Satine Phoenix has always had a passion for building worlds and growing communities. She began filming Dungeons and Dragons games in 2009 which led to the inception of Celebrity Charity D20 with Keith Baker, a livestreamed gaming event benefiting Reach Out and Read. From there, she has worked on hundreds of Dungeons and Dragons events and is often called the \u2018Queen of D&D\u2019. Her impact on the tabletop community has been acknowledged in such publications as Forbes, Time Magazine, io9, and Maxim. Wherever the story leads her, Satine has proven time and again that the language of play is a universal one, bringing people together through the power of imagination.\n Josh Bishop: Award Winning Filmmaker\nAfter years of creating short form fiction and other content, Josh Bishop\u2019s first documentary feature Made In Japan, premiered at SXSW 2015 in Austin, Texas. It took the 2015 festival circuit by storm and won quite a few awards including Best Documentary at the Global Visons Film Festival and the Discovery Award for Best First Feature at the Calgary International Film Festival. Josh\u2019s sophomore documentary feature, The Dwarvenaut, premiered at SXSW 2016 and is available on most streaming platforms. Real stories and real human emotions are the heart of Josh\u2019s work.\nRon Harbin: Award Winning TV Producer\nIn 2000, Ron Harbin, a former Nashville music industry insider, found himself in the television production business. After a move to Santa Monica, he began traveling to exotic places with network specials and a variety of television series. Leading productions around the world for some of today\u2019s biggest shows has made him a highly sought-after producer.  Today, Ron\u2019s work is featured on Discovery, History, A&E, PBS, HGTV, CMT, along with many digital platforms.\nStretch goals\nOnce we lock picture on episode 1, there is only one strategy in mind for Destination Fantastic stretch goals; more episodes!\nThat's right, for every milestone we pass, another episode slides into the pipeline, beginning in New Zealand and continuing onward and outward for as long as your support sustains us. The New Zealand episode has already been prepped and scouted, and merely awaits the presence of our amazing explorers!  \nStefan and Satine will survey some of the key locations of the LOTR films on both the North and South islands, and will seek out the wily Peter Jackson himself to catch a glimpse into the process of fantasy filmmaking! A tour of the special effects studio WETA Workshop is also in store for our intrepid hosts!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe beauty of this project is that we have the first episode practically in the bag, and just need a little support nudging it over the finish line! Any subsequent stretch goal episodes you unlock will be added to the appropriate tiers at no additional cost!\n\nFrom Executive Producer Ron Harbin:\n\n\u2022 How are we going to spend all this money?\n\nI know that is the question on everyone\u2019s mind. 20 years ago, when I saw my first TV production budget, it blew my mind that a few frames of video could cost that much. I just thought you grab a camera and point it at the star and that was it. Boy! Was I ever wrong? After the producer revived me with some smelling salts and started to explain how the world worked, I understood and I think you will, too.\n\n\u2022 The people who are supported by your pledge.\n\nWhether it is the people you see on your screen or the people cleaning up after them, everyone has to get paid. And, more importantly, everyone deserves to get paid. The people who work on television and film productions are some of the hardest working and most dedicated people I know.\n\nThe hours are long and tiring. Riding a plane, bus, van, car, rickshaw, mule or whatever else you can think of, all while carrying enough equipment and tools to whittle a Tesla out of driftwood, takes its toll on the mind and the body. Sleeping in different time zone, every night, will lead to a level of confusion\u2026\u2026.what was I saying?\n\nWe stay gone for long periods of time and miss first days of school and birthday parties and bedtime stories. By the time we get back from one trip, it seems like it is time to leave on the next one. We kiss our kids and get back on the plane and the weird thing is\u2026most of us can\u2019t get enough. We love what we do and that is what keeps us going.\nAnd going. And going. And going.\n\n\u2022 Physical Production\n\nThe process of taking a cast and crew out into the world can get really expensive, really fast. Air travel, hotels, food and everyday expenses really start to add up when you\u2019re trekking across the globe for 2-3 weeks, at a time, especially if you\u2019re in an extreme or remote environment. Think about how much that last trip to Orlando cost you and the family!\n\nThe tools we use to make the show this beautiful do not come cheap, either. A travel based show needs to have equipment that can endure the elements (you may have seen a picture of me floating around where I am carrying a camera in the pouring rain on an Icelandic beach) while producing a high-quality image. Cameras, microphones, drones, hard drives, stabilizers, and more: if any of these items fail on the road, we can quickly find ourselves with no show. We want to show you the best, so we use the best.\n\n\u2022 Editing, Sound Editing, Post Production\n\nAfter we\u2019ve gone out into the world to shoot something amazing, an entirely new group of people gets involved to make sure everything looks and sounds as amazing as it did, in person. They want your experience, at home, to feel like you\u2019re there with us, on location. Not to mention, they usually catch (and fix) a few (*more than a few) mistakes made by yours truly!\n\nThe post production team is critical. We shoot dozens of hours of footage per episode, and believe me, you would tune out pretty quickly if you had to sit through all of it. Our post team works its special kind of magic to make sure that the show we end up with is the snappy, compelling, beautiful, crazy, nerdy, rock \u2018n roll travel adventure that we set out to bring to you.\n\n\u2022 Kickstarter\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the \u2018How to Pay for A Television Series\u2019 part of the story. \n\nThen, there is the \u2018How Much Does Running a Kickstarter Campaign Cost\u2019 part. \n\nWell\u2026let me tell you. That is where it gets really interesting. The short answer, though, is\u2026a lot! Kickstarter is an important platform in the independent business world. They, too, deserve our support. There are fees associated with running a campaign and, combined with credit card fees, total about 8% of the total amount raised. Add that to the cost of producing and sending all of our backers the fantastic rewards we have created and that means about $.35 out of every dollar is already spent the moment our campaign reaches its funding goal.\n\nAdd this all up and I promise you, the money you provide to help this production is well cared for and will be spent as responsibly as possible. Our goal is always to deliver the best product imaginable and as much of it as we possibly can. We appreciate the trust you have placed in us, by pledging your support, and we refuse to let you down.\n\nThank you,\n\nRon Harbin\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Onlookers", "descp": "You're helping us put art into the world!\nA heartfelt hank you + EXCLUSIVE INFO UPDATES, behind-the-scenes access, videos, and more!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["82 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Friends of the Realm", "descp": "An astounding digital postcard of our Iceland adventures!\nPlus a heartfelt thank you + EXCLUSIVE INFO UPDATES, behind-the-scenes access, videos, and more!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Nomad", "descp": "The HD digital edition of Episode One of Destination Fantastic, the Iceland Excursion!

Our casters have long experience in producing fine quality castings in both materials and have a proven track record of delivering on time.\nWant just one model from the set? No problem. Fancy a handpicked skirmish force? Again, easily done. Want a whole skirmish warband with some additional huge centrepiece beasties? We've got you covered.\nWhile all of the main warband models are already moulded and cast, this is a Kickstarter, not a preorder for shipping-ready product - and most have yet to reach the head of our painting queue. Pictures show either painted master castings or the original master sculpts. Hoping to update with more painted pics during the campaign!\nInclude any of these inidividual models to your Pledge by adding the cost marked on the lower right corner of each pic to your Pledge - eg. add Stumpff to a ROT GRUB Pledge for a total of \u00a34.\nSingle piece unpainted white metal miniature.\nCackling maniacally, Stumpff leads the dwarven cohort with word and with spell. Terrible mansplainer.\n24mm to the top of his head. One piece white metal model.\nTwo piece unpainted white metal miniature.\nKeeping his ridiculous beard meticulously clean while slathering the rest of his being in ordure, Saw uses the cursed mace Pestle to grind skulls to paste. Loves folk music.\n24mm tall multipart white metal miniature\nTwo piece unpainted white metal miniature.\nThoroughly disagreeable to every last inch of his four foot six height, Skaphion channels his anger towards chopping enemies into easily digestible chunks. Hobbies: woodcarving, philately.\n23mm to the crest of his helm.\nTwo-part unpainted white metal miniature.\nNobody has ever seen Kopron outside of his armour and foetid robes. He communicates in grunts and a variable flaring of the baleful glow from his skull sockets. The ultimate socially awkward wallflower, he much prefers two-handed bladeswinging to Karaoke.\n32mm to his rusty eyehole.\nSingle piece unpainted white metal miniature.\nSent to act as servitor to Sorceror Maldred, this creature can disappear like smoke, reforming to catch victims unawares as it spreads pestilence. Huge repertoire of folk songs. Very stabby. \nSingle piece unpainted white metal model.\nBeloved of the goddess, she spreads the Rotten Word and blesses the fallen with the caress of her tentacle and the fumes from her censer. Skilled spider wrangler. Fave colour: purple.\n31mm to her eye level. White metal miniature.\nMultipart unpainted white metal miniature.\nBlessed by the Powers, Hinrich\u2019s single eye allows him to see an opponent\u2019s next move so that he can outfight anyone.

GSOH, central heating, all his own teeth.\nSingle-piece white metal miniature.\nSingle piece unpainted resin model.\nA snivelling, slithering wet mass of teeth, toes, and tusks, Spot hung around the campfire waiting for scraps and now follows the warband everywhere. Good with children and animals, hates cats. \n60mm diameter, 50mm+ tall resin miniature cast in one piece.\nTwo piece unpainted resin miniature.\nYoungest of the two troll mercenaries in Maldred's employ, Sobell's job description in the warcompany's roster lists him as \"Blunt Force Technician\".\n60mm tall to the top of his skull. Resin two part miniature.\nMultipart unpainted resin model kit.\nEldest brother of the Troll Twins (NB they're \"twins\" only for professional/tax reasons), Rollo is the sophisticated heavy of the warband and considers himself a connoisseur of elf heads.\n60mm to the top of his head. Three piece resin miniature kit.\nSingle piece unpainted white metal model.\nAdaon is on the trail of the Warband, having been Geased to bring back the heads of the Troll Twins. He's not quite figured out yet that he doesn't necessarily need twin axes to take twin heads... \nWhite metal miniature. 20mm to the top of his head; 25mm to the top of his haircut.\nSingle piece unpainted white metal miniature.\nGwystyl has had a run-in with the Warband before now, losing his eye to Putriss' barbed tentacle some years back and swearing vengeance ever since. He really is old enough to know better with that haircut by now, though.\nWhite metal miniature. 20mm to the top of his forehead; 32mm to the crest of his frohawk.\n\nChoose from a  number of one-click Pledges for different rewards - add any individual models to any Pledge by simply increasing your Pledge by that amount.\neg. to add Skaphion and Saw to a BLOWFLY Pledge, increase your Pledge from \u00a325 to \u00a334\nPick any individual models, and customise your Pledge.\nAll three Plague Dwarfs.

We're old school gamers with a background in professional modelmaking and prototyping, with a combined experience of over 60 years. As well as Cthulhu Wars, our regular sculptors have worked for some of the biggest names in the wargaming and tabletop industry, including Games Workshop, Reaper, Ral Partha, Wizards of the Coast, and many more. \nMacrocosm Miniatures and Shed Games, our casters, are full time metal and resin casters with a proven track record working with small manufacturers and on fulfilment of numerous recent kickstarters over the last couple of years.\nWhite metal models in this campaign are mostly single-part; some have separate weapons and shields or separate hands with weapons attached.\nResin models are mostly multipart and will require some assembly.\nAll models should require a minimum amount of cleanup and prep ahead of undercoating and painting - nothing more than normally required for any equivalent tabletop gaming miniatures. Both resin and metal miniatures can be fixed with cyano / superglues and may benefit from pinning at joints.\nPostage costs will be calculated on completion of your pledge, during the backer survey stage of the campaign, and will be dependent on final weight/volume of your base reward and any add-ons you may have chosen. All parcels will be sent by tracked/signed-for services through Royal Mail - delivery times will vary according to country of final destination.These shippings costs will vary greatly depending on the weight/bulk of any add-ons you choose - we're confidently estimating  (postal price increases notwithstanding) that this will add between \u00a35-20 per customer for tracked/signed for mail, with highest costs being applied to overseas and/or large pledges. For example, a FULL ROTTEN ARMY pledge (packed weight just over 1 kilo) posting to the USA would need an additional \u00a320 shipping added in the Pledge Manager).\nCosts include not just Royal Mail's actual postage charges  -  shown here (https://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/royal-mail-our-prices-25-march-2019-46305575.pdf) but also enough to cover actual costs of packing materials.\nFenris Games is not liable for any customs or handling fees you may be charged by your country on import of your reward(s). ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the sculpts for this project are already finished - there will be no added delays waiting for pieces to be finished. Master moulds for most of the models have already been made and test castings poured (hence the painted examples shown in the campaign) - a successful campaign here will allow the manufacture of Production Moulds and, shortly thereafter, the mass casting of both white metal and resin models.\n\nWe have two dedicated subcontract casters ready and waiting to start work on making the models needed for fulfilment of your Pledge. As soon as those all-important funds arrive, resin and metal will begin to pour!\n\nWe've been making moulds and casting resin for over 30 years, and have partnered with a hugely reliable subcontract casting company whose work meets our high standards. They've made test moulds and pre-production castings of the warband models to measure mould wear and longevity, so already have a handle on production time, wear & tear, and amounts of materials needed.\n\nThis is our third Kickstarter. We've learned a huge amount from our first two, and know just which pitfalls to avoid and how best to deal with any new challenges. Our previous campaign - Rubble City - is over 90% fulfilled and expected to complete within another few weeks at time of writing. While there have been delays to production of the handcast resin components, these have been largely due to bereavement and the emotional and practical fallout that resulted.

THIS BUST IS FREE FOR BACKERS OVER 170 EUROS.\nAlso, we have the Stretch Goals of the Campaign. Each time we reach a new Stretch Goal, we will unlock freebies and new Add-ons to buy.  We will update periodically.\n\n\nYES, it reminds classic but it is new.\nThe N-Paint colors have been manufactured in the UK by the best modeling paint developers in the world, with more than 40 years of experience, authors of the most famous paints you have used during your life.\nWe used a classic formulation with some improvements. N-Paint has the perfect creamy texture you need, and the right coverage for a brilliant transparency on layers. We created a new formula for a perfect easy blending with high pigmentation. An enhanced matte finish without losing intensity, the cleanest colors for an elegant and smooth work.\nJoin the PAINTSPLOSION!\nForget about sand texture and muted colors. N-Paint is matte enough, but anyway you can adjust the slightly satin level of the finish, if you need it, by adding a drop of our Ultra Matte Solution into your mixes. This way you can reach an extremelly matte finish without losing intensity of color. This is how we paint, give a try! \nOur Inks are deeply pigmented and they have a little satin finish, but much less glossy than others. They can be used directly undiluted, or mixed with normal colors and metallics to reach incredibly intense tones. Also they will get completelly matte if you add Ultra Matte Solution to them, while they keep their high pigmentation and liquidity.\nOur Metallic colors are designed to have the best covering and strong colors, including a extreme light valid for every tone. They go well directly and combined with inks. You will need nothing else.\nN-Paint is very resistant! It can be used for wargames as well as professional painting or fine arts. Its consistency and fluidity does not disintegrate and it can be used both brush and airbrush. Its tonal variety makes it perfect to be used by themselves or combined with any other water based paint on the market.\nBut the greatest quality of N-Paint is not in its physical characteristics, but in what it allows you to do chromatically. The mixes made by Jes\u00fas Mart\u00edn, who created the colors of Vallejo Acrylics Fantasy Pro line, have exceeded expectations, achieving a balanced range of colors that will bring you closer both to Nocturna painting style and the extremes of the most radical painting you can think of.\nLive the N-Paint experience. A world of new colors is waiting for you. \nFor those who want a Basic Set to start trying our N-Paints, we have designed a Starter Paint Set composed with some basic colors for a first contact. All of them are included in their own paint set, they are just a selection.\n The Full Range of N-Paint Colors is composed by 8 Sets of 8 Colors, and the Auxiliary Paint Set (White, Black and Matte Medium).\n\nN-Paint rules. We don\u00b4t say that, our testers can tell you. Anyway, follow them because they are some of the best painters out there!\nMarc Masclans  @masclans_miniatures \nAleksandra Tana Cvetanovski  @craftworldstudio \nMichal P Lan @lanstudio \nIv\u00e1n Hortal  @ivan_hortal_miniature_painter  \nArnau L\u00e1zaro  @arnau.lazaro \nAndy Wardle   @andywardle_artwork \nFlameon  @flameonminiatures \nArkaitz   @nohacademy \nAaron Lovejoy  @aaronlovejoy \nArsies    @arsiesstudio  \nKirill Kanaev  Yellow_one \nKrzysztof Kobalczyk   Krzysztof \nBanshee  @miniatureartacademy \nJesukrypton  @jesus_nocturna \n\u00d3scar  @rrwatercolor \nTHESE ARE THE ELIGIBLE FIGURES OF THE CAMPAING.\nWe have remade 3 of our classic figures, Nocturna, The Sorcerer and El Juglar.

Since the hoodie crows had appeared there was a change in the air, their cawing giving voice to a restlessness the toys had not known before. The dark woods beckoned.\u201d\nLeft at the Bottom of the Garden is a project to fund the production of nine high quality, lead-free metal miniatures, each depicting a lost toy. Help me begin to tell their story in miniature form as the toys set off on their journey through the dark and twisted woods.\nAs the owner and sculptor of Statuesque Miniatures, I've produced many miniatures over the years. However, these figures are something quite different in style and purpose from my usual work and that's why I've come to Kickstarter to help reach as many people as possible. With your help, I can get production rolling and the toys can venture out into the world.\nThe Miniatures\nMeasuring approximately 14mm to 32mm tall, the Left at the Bottom of the Garden miniatures represent a motley collection of abandoned or lost toys. I sculpted the miniatures with tabletop gaming, painting and collecting in mind. In particular, I wanted them to be nice little objects in themselves, needing no glue, no assembly beyond normal casting clean-up and no plastic bases. They have bold, chunky details meaning they can be easily painted or finished however you wish.\nAll photos show production castings of the miniatures (albeit prepped and given a coat of boot polish to bring out the details), so if the Kickstarter is successful I'll be ready to start casting your miniatures immediately. There won't be any stretch goals or additional items added during the course of the campaign - I don't want anything to delay fulfilment.\nPlease note, due to their small size the Left at the Bottom of the Garden miniatures are not intended for small children.\nWhat are the toys peering at in the inky blackness? One of the hoodies is definitely whispering something mean in Clementine's ear.\nThe Pledges\nBelow you can see each of the pledge levels available. With the exception of the Fancy Toys reward, all miniatures are supplied in bare metal state.\nChoose any set or sets of miniatures from the Add On list below. Simply pledge the total for those sets. Details of your choices will be taken after the campaign.\nThe complete set of nine Left at the Bottom of the Garden miniatures, cast in high quality, lead-free metal.\nAdditional sets of miniatures can also be chosen from the Add On list below.

Details of your choices will be taken after the campaign.\nThe complete set of nine Left at the Bottom of the Garden miniatures, cast in high quality, lead-free metal and hand finished by me to match the display miniatures seen in the campaign photos on this page. This will involve the removal of any casting artefacts, a light buffing, ageing with boot polish to bring out the details and a coat of lacquer.\nAdditional sets of miniatures can be chosen from the Add On list below. Simply add the total cost for those sets to the pledge level. Details of your choices will be taken after the campaign. Please note, any additional miniatures added to this pledge will NOT be hand finished and will be supplied in a bare metal state.\nThis pledge level is limited to 10 backers.\nAdd Ons\nThe following items can be added to any pledge for the amount indicated.

All rewards sent to Russia (Europe shipping), Brazil and Canada (World Zone 1) will be sent by International Tracked mail only and charged appropriately, while rewards sent to Mexico (World Zone 1) will be sent by International Signed mail only and charged appropriately.

We have worked hard over the past years to create a new range of resin miniatures capable of making your little heart race at a million beats a minute. At long last, here we are, eager to throw ourselves into this new adventure like a lemming on the edge of a cliff! With \u2018The Second Government of Inneath\u2019, we want to repeat the wonderful experience of two years ago and, if possible, raise the bar a few notches. Just as with \u2018The Iron Crows\u2019, our goal has been to make you fall in love with us and our creations, \"The Second Government of Inneath\" was born to remind you that, despite the passing of years, in our eyes, you are still as beautiful as the day we met.\nTHE BACKER'S PORTAL: I made a page on our website to track all the progress of this campaign in the next months of wait (I know, it will be hard to wait!!). At this moment, obviously, the page is almost blank, but it will be updated regularly with all the news and important info concerning this campaign. Go to the Backer's Portal.\nWe have a single purpose: to create miniatures that are worthy of great heights. Or, at least metaphorically; in as much as 32mm miniatures can be. We sculpted 20 new characters and a solid range of Stretch Goals to give you the very best of the greatest human nation of Inneath: The Second Government. All our miniatures are casted in high quality resin, the best way to give you miniatures as faithful as possible to the original sculpt: if you took part in our previous Kickstarter (the blessing of Grundur be upon you!), you already have proof of how uncompromising we are when it comes to the quality of our products. On the other hand, if this is your first experience with us then you are even luckier! Now we have two more years of creative and technical experience that give us a firm belief that this Kickstarter will be even better than the last.\nPLAY\n\nSee the 3d sculpts of some of our characters in literally every single details on Sketchfab: you will be able to rotate and zoom at your leisure the 3d sculpts (warning: it could be addictive). \nNDT: we strongly believe that humans have different heights. Or at least, this is what I learned when I met a Latvian guy and I seemed like his backpack, comparing our heights. For this reason, our human characters represent individuals with different heights and their miniatures reflect this concept, going approximately from 34 to 41mm size.\nHave I failed to dismiss your doubts? Feel free to write to us at info@durginpaintforge.com if you have any more questions!\nYou will be able to support this project and contribute to the success of this range in three ways: you can select the miniatures you like individually, pounce on the convenient bundles for some bulk savings or, if you have an impassioned heart but only a few doubloons in your pocket, we would greatly appreciate if you could share this project far and wide, to wherever you think people might be interested.\nIf you are only interested in some specific miniatures from the range, take a look at the table below, crack out a sheet of paper, a pencil and some rounded-tip scissors. Note down the miniatures that interest you and add up their individual prices. Their total will be the amount that you will need to insert as your pledge amount. After the campaign is completed, we will send out a pledge manager in which you will be able to sort out the details of which miniatures you want. \nIf you are interested in buying a bundle, simply select the appropriate pledge and enjoy the anticipation of that little box of goodies being dropped on your doorstep (if you still have those scissors ready, you could cut out some nice origami to pass the time!).\n \"What if I want to buy more bundles? Or add more miniatures to my bundle?\"\nEasier than shooting an Elf in a barrel (don't feel bad, he deserves it). Just select the reward you are interested in, then modify your pledge by adding the value of the miniatures or any other bundles you want to add; voila!\nIt wouldn't be a Kickstarter campaign without a constant range of freebies raining down on you like a benevolent monsoon. As you can see, each bundle has a specific list of Stretch Goals available, if unlocked: obviously, if you buy, for example, the Redcoats Bundle and the Bluecoats Bundle you will receive all the unlocked Stretch Goals of both. The Stretch Goals that will be unlocked will be added to your bundle for free but if you want more copies of them, you can buy them adding their individual prices to your pledge (see the voice \"Add on:\" on the various Stretch Goals graphics)\nAfter the campaign, as usual, you will be able to take part to our Pledge Manager Event. Of course, the Iron Crows range will be able also on the Pledge Manager, including the same bundles that we offered during their campaign. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk, concerning a project like this one, is about the times of delivery. During our previous campaign we had, luckily, an unexpected success and we unlocked a lot of unplanned sculptures: we were overwhelmed by gratitude and happiness, but we lost almost 5 months to sculpt all the features unlocked. Moreover, our previous resin caster overbooked its schedule, which led to several quality problems and we lost several months to replace the bad resins, because, as any decent creator would do, we couldn't accept to send to our backers anything but high-quality miniatures. To avoid a similar situation, during these last two years we worked hard to start this new campaign with a better organization: we have already sculpted all the main range of characters including a solid amount of Stretch Goals and we have already started to 3d prints the first miniatures. This, for sure, will strongly optimize our production, allowing us to respect our schedule. Moreover, we found new partners, concerning the resin casts, that will surely grant us to better manage a large production maintaining the high quality that we expect for any of our products.\nIf, as during the previous campaign, we will unlock more unplanned features (which would mean exceeding the 36.000\u20ac funding goal) it may happen that our schedule will be slightly delayed, to allow us to properly design and sculpt them.\nOur first goal is to create something worthy of your expectations and we organized this campaign to be better than our previous one, concerning the times of delivery.

We were lucky enough to have people enjoy our stories. During this time, our comics were read over 20 million times, were shared by hundreds of thousands of people and most surreal of all, are now being taught in US high-schools.\nEach of our comics tells a short, unique story: A woman who becomes obsessed with a radio station that only appears in the middle of the night, a man in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, trying to collect all the healthy animals in a modern Noah's ark, and a cranky old man who might just have a time machine in the guest bedroom.\nHere's one comics. A twisted little love story called COLD EMBRACE:\nNow, we\u2019re collecting all 15 of our comics stories for the first time, in a beautiful 144 page hardcover book.

We hope you\u2019ll join us in bringing it to life.\nABOUT THE BOOK\nWe\u2019re obsessed with making this book the most beautiful object we can. We\u2019ve spent the last months testing different types of paper and debating foil-stamp colors. And now, it\u2019s finally time to make the book a reality. \n The book will be a cloth-bound, foil-stamped, oversized hardcover (The size of Marvel and DCs deluxe hardcovers). It will be printed on thick, durable paper.\n To make this book as gorgeous as possible, we\u2019ve teamed up with Mark Vierra of On The Mark printing. Mark has printed some of the most funded and beautifully produced books in Kickstarter\u2019s history (Steve Lichman and Scurry among others).\nPLAY\n\n ABOUT THE REWARD TIERS\nWe want to keep things simple and want every item we offer to be of the highest quality possible. For this reason, we\u2019re offering only 3 reward tiers: \nNote: If you\u2019re a comics store and would like to order Multiple copies of our book, please get in touch with us at: midnightradioks@gmail.com. We\u2019d love to help.\nABOUT THE STRETCH GOALS\nWe wanted to make the stretch goals as cool and beautifully printed as the book itself. We only chose things we\u2019d love to have, so we really hope you\u2019ll like them too!\nWe love this design. That about sums it up. Once we reach $45k we will include the bookmark with every copy of the book. \nOnce we reach $50k, every backer who ordered the limited-edition and original art versions of the book will receive the entire set of 4 signed and numbered mini-prints.\nThis one we've been obsessed with from the very beginning. Once we reach $55k, all backers who ordered the book will receive a copy of the 32 page MIDNIGHT RADIO COLORING BOOK! Like the name says, it\u2019s a coloring book, featuring Yael\u2019s gorgeous illustrations. We hope we get to share it with you!\nABOUT GETTING THE BOOKS TO YOU \n We want to get the books to you as quickly and smoothly as possible. For that, we\u2019ve teamed up with fulfilment company Quartermaster logistics, who know how to do exactly that. Quartermaster are focused on fulfilling crowdfunding campaigns and have successfully shipped backer rewards for hundreds of campaigns. \n AND THAT'S IT!\n If you have any questions, please email us at: midnightradioks@gmail.com\nThanks for reading all of that.

Please give us a shout through the 'Ask a Question\u2019 button on our Kickstarter campaign FAQ page.\nWe can\u2019t wait to bring the entire 10-episode The Legend of Vox Machina animated series to life!\n<3\nCritical Role\nCritical Role is a weekly livestreamed tabletop roleplaying game featuring a group of prominent voice actors, who happen to be best friends. Each week, veteran Game Master Matthew Mercer leads the cast through epic adventures set in the world of Exandria! Trust us \u2014 it\u2019s rad.  \nOur original storyline centered on a group of heroes known as Vox Machina \u2014 Pike Trickfoot (gnome cleric, Ashley Johnson), Keyleth (half-elf druid, Marisha Ray), Percival \u201cPercy\u201d Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III (human gunslinger, Taliesin Jaffe), Grog Strongjaw (goliath barbarian, Travis Willingham), Scanlan Shorthalt (gnome bard, Sam Riegel), Vex\u2019ahlia (half-elf ranger, Laura Bailey), and Vax\u2019ildan (half-elf rogue, Liam O\u2019Brien) \u2014 as they battled the forces of evil and learned to work as a team. Their epic tale concluded in November, 2017 after 115 episodes and 373 hours of gameplay.\nThe show is still going strong, now over 50 episodes in to our second season, which tracks the misfits known as the Mighty Nein. Critical Role reaches a wide, international audience called Critters, who are just about the greatest fans in history. \n Titmouse is an Emmy award-winning animation production company behind the hits Big Mouth, The Venture Bros., Metalocalypse, Niko and the Sword of Light and Star Wars: Galaxy of Adventures. One of the largest 2D animation studios in America with studios in Los Angeles, New York and Vancouver, B.C., it employs more than 400 of the most talented people in the industry (all guaranteed to be 100% human). Its fresh styles can be seen on major networks such as Disney, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and streaming services like Amazon and Netflix.  \nVox Machina is back, baby \u2014 but this time they\u2019re cartoons! Here\u2019s the amazing creative team that\u2019s gonna take our tale from imagination to animation...  \nArt by Critter Hunter Bonyun (@deerlordhunter)\nWRITING TEAM\nA brand new story was crafted by the cast of Critical Role and scripted by our good friend and talented TV writer, Jennifer Muro (Star Wars: Forces of Destiny, Spider-Man, Justice League: Action). Muro is one of the most sought-after writers in the industry and she\u2019s written an in-canon adventure that takes place before the events of the streaming show. \nANIMATION TEAM\nTo bring the magic and mayhem of Exandria to life, we\u2019re sinking the vast majority of our resources into the animation budget. As Titmouse has proven again and again, they pride themselves on top notch quality and attention to detail, ensuring this story will be told with visceral, action-packed visuals. It\u2019ll be bloody gorgeous.\nVOICEOVER\nThe voice acting for The Legend of Vox Machina will (of course) be provided by the cast of Critical Role, who bring decades of experience to the table. You\u2019ve no doubt heard their voices in some of your favorite cartoons \u2014 Teen Titans Go!, Ben 10, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball Z, Sofia the First, Avengers Assemble, DuckTales, Transformers, and many, many more. And to round out the main cast, we\u2019ll bring in some extra special celebrity cameos, as well as voice over industry legends. \nOTHER DETAILS\nIn The Legend of Vox Machina, our adventuring group is right around Level 7 \u2014 fledgling adventurers, but still powerful enough to fire off exciting spells and brutal attacks.\nSo, what will this campaign allow us to create? A bitchin\u2019 high-quality, fantasy cartoon set in a world created by one of the most accomplished storytellers, Matthew Mercer. With heart-stopping action and side-splitting comedy, it will have something for everyone. \nIf we smash through our crowdfunding goal, The Legend of Vox Machina will be released in Fall 2020. But we can\u2019t do it without your help funding this campaign \u2014 which ends on Thursday, April 18th at 11:59pm Pacific.\nUPDATE (MARCH 7TH):\nDue to the overwhelming love and support of our amazing backers, we're creating an animated series!\nAs a quick refresher: the first few episodes of our animation will focus on a brand new Vox Machina adventure, which takes place before our show began streaming live on Twitch. But because of your incredible generosity, we\u2019re following your lead and going for it, diving right into a series that begins the retelling of the saga of Vox Machina. We can\u2019t wait to show you how the story shapes up!\nWe're excited to share new episode offerings as part of our new stretch goals for our campaign: The Briarwoods are coming to animated life in The Legend of Vox Machina!\nThe Briarwoods arc is one of the most exciting and popular storylines of the Vox Machina streaming campaign. When we were brainstorming about what might come next, the clear winner was introducing the Briarwoods into The Legend of Vox Machina.\nThe Briarwoods arc story so far\u2026 Vox Machina arrive in Percy's hometown, Whitestone, to avenge the murder of his family and the corruption of his city at the hands of the evil Briarwoods. Danger and betrayal lurk around every corner, and it will take all of Vox Machina's abilities to combat this deadly threat. The Briarwoods arc began in episode 24 of our first streamed campaign, and remains one of our absolute favorites.\nFor the last batch of stretch goals that we crush, we\u2019ll be able to create two additional 22-minute Briarwoods arc episodes.\nSo, to recap, here\u2019s what you can expect episode-wise from The Legend of Vox Machina animated SERIES:\n Episodes 1 & 2: A brand new story centered around Vox Machina at level 7 (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 3, 4, 5, 6: Briarwoods arc! (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 7 & 8: Continuation of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 9 & 10: Continuation and conclusion of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\nBe sure to check out our backer updates tab at the top of this page for the full download.\nUPDATE (APRIL 5TH):\nWe have unlocked our final stretch goal and now, we\u2019ll make the entire 10-episode The Legends of Vox Machina series for you AND a one-shot GMed by our very own Ashley Johnson! \nAt the moment, we\u2019re not planning on adding additional stretch goals -- every dollar that we raise after this point will be allocated directly into making an even more kick ass animation. This means more animators, more music, and more awesomeness. Of course, if that changes, we\u2019ll be sure to let everyone know as soon as possible.\nIn our wildest dreams, we never thought that we\u2019d be able to bring an entire Vox Machina SERIES to life. But, time and time again, you all continue to challenge our expectations in the best way. We cannot thank you enough and we cannot wait to roll up our sleeves and get started. \nTravis & Sam went on dozens of Hollywood pitch meetings, and found some interest \u2014 but we ultimately decided to create our first animated special on our own. By doing so, we can continue to stay true to our beloved characters and tell the stories you want to see. With an ever-burning desire to bring a Vox Machina animation to the masses, we decided to give the power back to our amazing community, roll up our sleeves, and make this special with YOU instead. \nEvery dollar you contribute allows us to embark on this animated adventure together, with the ultimate goal of producing a full-blown animated series. We\u2019ll keep you posted on how the project is going \u2014 with behind-the-scenes looks at the animation process, recording sessions, reward product creation, and everything in-between. As a backer, you are part of our team and we guarantee you\u2019ll feel empowered and informed every step of the way.   \nCONTRIBUTE if you have the means to do so! Backers will get updates along the way, receive awesome rewards, and be the first to know when the show is ready for prime time.\nSHARE with your friends and family. Even if your loved ones don\u2019t know Critical Role yet, a super badass cartoon is a perfect way to introduce them to it. Help us spread the good word! \nAlong with making the 22-minute animated series of our dreams, the money raised through this campaign will allow us to provide cool rewards and administer our crowdfunding project. \nIt\u2019s incredibly important that we remain transparent, so we created this handy chart to show you exactly where your hard-earned money will go. \nThe overwhelming majority of our funds raised will support the production of our animated special \u2014 from our incredible animation team to voiceover studio time, soundtrack composition, music, effects, sound design, etc.\nOf course, we have accounted for some boring (but important!) stuff too \u2014 like credit card processing fees, accounting, and additional staff to keep this project running at full steam. \nWe wanted to give you the coolest and most high-quality rewards, all of which are exclusive to this crowdfunding campaign, which means you won\u2019t be able to find this swag anywhere else! \n We\u2019re thrilled to offer you a selection of campaign-exclusive perks as a thank you for supporting The Legend of Vox Machina. We\u2019ve set it up this way to guarantee that most of your funds go towards creating the best damn cartoon possible. After countless creative meetings, we created this set of sweet products that we would be proud to own ourselves.    \nEach time we hit a new goal together, we'll share our new crowdfunding goal with you! This means more swag and some bad ass Vox Machina one-shots that will unlock for everyone (backers or not!).   \nFirst, check out our Kickstarter FAQ on our campaign page. We will update this page as often as possible to ensure that the answers that you seek are readily available. \nIf your question isn\u2019t covered in the FAQ, feel free to drop us a note by hitting the \u2018Ask a question\u2019 button on the FAQ page. \nSpecial thanks to Critter Jessica Mahon (@my2k) for creating the portrait art for our campaign headings.

Over those two decades I\u2019ve visited large areas of Anyaral and we now have well over 100 unique playable units for the game (not to mention all the different variants, civilians and a wide variety of critters...), all in the usual World of Twilight scale (roughly 28mm).\nIf you are new to Anyaral, then I recommend you go and visit the World of Twilight website to find out more!\nOver the last year I\u2019ve continued with the normal range, but I\u2019ve also had a play with something slightly different, and that is where I need your help!\nLegends of Anyaral is a random little side project that will let me play with big buildings and creatures that simply wouldn\u2019t work in the usual scale. I took the very simplistic approach of sculpting everything half the usual size, which effectively makes it a 15mm range. The first sculpt I did was of a piece of Fubarnii architecture that I sketched during Inktober 2017; the Crooked Trade Outpost. \n\"Crooked\" from Inktober 2017\n\"We paused our travels briefly at the crooked tower of Geliad. I had initially assumed the tower was on the brink of collapse, but was assured by the locals that it was all part of their local engineer's eccentric but deliberate design! It now serves as an outpost where traders rest before braving the Moerasii marshes. We were fortunate enough to see a domesticated lorsaan being loaded with baggage. It never ceases to amaze me that such behemoths wander our lands.\" \nI wanted to create the building, but figured it would be somewhat huge in the usual scale! Instead, I halved all the dimensions, making it a much more manageable 135mm in height. Having sculpted the building I did of course need to sculpt the lorsaan to accompany it. Then a few little traders to look after the Lorsaan... Which gives a good insight into how Twilight has generally been created over the last twenty years!\nThe Crooked Trade Outpost, painted by Joe Karame\nI\u2019ve got a few other ideas I\u2019d like to do in the Legends scale (the enarii, more huge beasts!), but it depends a lot how well this project is received. I have no current plans for any rules, although that could be very tempting! That's for the future though, this kickstarter is just about the Outpost :)\nThanks to all the people who have backed so far, we have achieved our target! There are of course more things I would like to add to the campaign though...\n\nEven in the smaller scale I wasn\u2019t entirely sure how practical it would be to release the trade outpost, but the very talented Rob Huntley (Warploque) took it in hand and did an amazing job casting the tower as a single piece kit! I then worked with Rob Alderman and John Bryan to make some more production moulds that would make the set affordable to gamers as well as collectors. For this kickstarter most of the pledges will be cast by John Bryan, but I am also giving you the opportunity to get your hands on the Warploque master casts as a special collector's edition.\nI\u2019m keeping everything about this campaign simple. The campaign will run for a short period and will be very focused. I\u2019ve got a couple of ideas for extras and stretch goals (remember those traders I mentioned earlier...), but nothing that will delay delivery!\nAs soon as the campaign is over I\u2019ll get everything ordered and get the pledge manager open so I can start shipping as soon as Kickstarter release the funds.\nI\u2019m sure many of you in Europe will be a bit apprehensive about Brexit. I can't make any promises as there isn't much time, but the plan is to get all European orders shipped first (hopefully before the end of March) with the orders to the rest of the world close on their heels! \nFor this Kickstarter I\u2019ve come up with a few simple pledges, so you can get the Lorsaan or the Crooked Outpost, or everything together.\nI've also put together a special Master Quality Collector's Set, which is the definitive collector's edition. The Collector's Set includes resin Warploque master casts of the Trade Outpost and the Lorsaan. \nYou can add the following to your pledge by simply increasing your pledge value. You will then be able to specify what you would like after the campaign is over.\nThree Tiny Traders: \u00a35\nTiny Twilight (2 Knights, 4 Militia, 2 Devanu and 3 Grishak plus 1 Delgon priest and 1 KalGarkii): \u00a312\nThe Misfits (Limping Belan and Trader, Injured Knight and Militia) : \u00a36\nResin Belan: \u00a312", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've run three larger projects previously, so have a good grasp of the challenges involved!\nThis project does involve a lot of individual resin casts, which I know can cause production delays.

We have been working on this project for over a year and we enjoyed every step along the way. From the initial ideas bouncing around in my head to the concept sketches, the sculpting process and then seeing them come alive through printing and casting. It has been a very rewarding experience and now I can finally share them with you!\nLast year might have been mostly about scifi and Cyberpunk, but this year, we will start with some fantasy love!!!\nThis campaign is about a trio (trio?!? yes, trio!) of elves known as the Dragon Masters. They raise and train dragons for others of their kin. So the dragons (technically one of them is a Wyvern but we'll count it as a dragon! ;) ) you see on the busts are not mature and fully grown dragons. But they will be! Who knows, one day we might make some proper fully grown ones...!?\nKaradhran, the male Dragon Master stands almost 80mm tall and has a width of over 115mm!\nCiadrin, the female Dragon Master stands a little over 66mm with a width of 90mm!\n\nConcept art\nThe journey starts with an idea formulating in my head. I often do some rough sketches and write down some thoughts and notes to start establishing a concrete plan for the character. The second step is finding an artist that is suited for what I have mind and then let him or her do their magic.\nIn this case Denis Zimin took my ideas and made these two concepts which I really like!\nHe is currently making them into fully coloured artworks and I hope to share them soon. \nKaradhran\nCiadrin\nRenders\nAfter the concepts are finished, the sculptor goes to work. He takes the concepts and starts sculpting them. Digitally in this case. The concept art was spot on and Radmir Achmentov, one of our regular sculptors, had a blast and this shows in the sculpts.\n\nKaradhran render\nCiadrin render\nCyara render\nPrints\nOnce the sculpting has been done and the cuts are in place, the sculpts are turned into STL files and these are sent to the printer. In our case we use Micron 3D. \nCiadrin print\nCasts\nOnce the printer has sent the prints to our caster, the moulding and casting process begins. A magical and obscure happening that I absolutely have no clue on how to do it myself so  we rather let trained professionals do their stuff! First the print/sculpt is prepared and then a master mould is made. From this master mould some test casts are made to see if everything is working properly and if so, these casts are then used to produce casting moulds. \n\nCiadran master casting (prior to clean up!)\nKaradhran master casting (prior to clean up!)\n\n\n\nWe have a few types of pledges. The regular ones that will be available throughout the campaign with the busts at a discounted price from the MSRP and...   48 hour only EARLY BIRDS!!! \nKaradhran\nCiadrin\n\nKaradhran & Ciadrin\nCyara\n\nAdd-ons! \nWe decided to add the Draken busts of Drakogor and Dragyn to this campaign as they fit right in being dragon hybrids themselves! Drakogor wa released last year and dragyn is a brand new release!\nDrakogor\nDragyn\nDrakogor & Dragyn\nThese are HUGE busts! Drakogor standing at 90mm from bottom to top and Dragyn an impressive 110mm from bottom to the top of his horns!!! \nFor more angles check here;\n https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CMjSP14DRwLniSDOznFwpa83mXnyIrW9 \n\n\nShipping will be charged during the Kickstarter. For all pledges it is \u20ac10,- which includes tracking, signed for delivery and insurance.  \nWe have set the delivery date for May 2019. Casting will begin once the campaign is over and we have funded. We believe this is a realistic date after speaking things through with our caster. \nThe company who handles our shipping proved eight times already that they do a good job. We have every faith we can deliver on time as we have become quite good at organizing and packing. We don't think there will be a delay in packages going out to backers but would just like to add that delays can happen. Once the shipping company has your parcels it is out of our control. However we will do everything possible again to fulfill this Kickstarter on time. \nPlease note that we are not responsible for any customs or other fees that might occur. \nMiniatures come unpainted and need assembly and some minor cleaning.\n\nAs always there are a few people I want to thank! The following people who's help and hard work has made it possible to do this campaign!  \nSir Castalot (mysterious and legendary caster supreme!)\nRadmir Achmentov (Punga Miniatures)\nToni Garcia Krespo (CHK Studios)\nMichal NT (Digital painter)\nKyle Cruickshank (Mr Lees Minis)\nLuke Wilson\nMicron 3D\nBulat Satuchin\n\nOne thing that is very important if you want to help us fund, is to please take a moment to share the project. You can do this by sharing the campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, your blog, forums and on any other Social media you might know! \nTell your friends who might be interested and with your help we can make this project as successful as possible, ensuring we can make many more wonderful busts and miniatures in the near future!  \nYou can follow us here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/OuroborosMiniatures/\nhttps://ouroborosminiatures.blogspot.nl/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ouroborosminiatures/\nhttps://twitter.com/OuroborosMinis\nhttps://ouroborosminiatures.com ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Dragon Masters have already been sculpted, moulded and (test) cast.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs.

Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).

We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

This campaign is to help us fund the first model in our new Wasteland Raiders line called Fast Johnny. In doing so we can hopefully realise a few more of the riders that we have in mind for this range.\nDigitally coloured render of Fast Johnny by Miranda Bosch-Thurlings\nFast Johnny, the model in question, has a kind of ironic meaning to us personally. It didn't start out like that of course but this year has been really odd and intense for us. A rollercoaster ride of epic proportions with great highs and deep lows! \nYou see we started out this year with a very successful campaign called CP New Skin. The result from that campaign made sure we could do a lot of the things we had planned for this year. We try to very loosely plan a year ahead and for 2018 we wanted to try and release between 20-25 miniatures and busts. So when the New Skin campaign ended much better than we ever could have imagined, we had good confidence that we would be able to do all the things we wanted at a steady pace. Boy oh boy were we wrong...!!!\nContinued below... (it turned out into quite a long read and it was not very eye catching so hence the split!)\nSo who is Fast Johnny?! When the world went tumbled into madness and destruction reigned, Johnny who's actual name is Jony Ag Anaba, found himself without his trusty camel Sarah. Sarah got killed as his tribesmen ate her. Johnny was heartbroken and after having trained her from birth he was at loss on what to do. \nEmptiness and bitterness filled his soul and in a fit of rage he murdered his kin and ventured out into the desert. Wandering for weeks on end he almost gave in and was about to take his own life to be with his loved Sarah. \nBut then, as a sign from above he found a giant turtle in need of help. The turtle fell from a sand dune and was lying on its back, unable to get back on its feet. Johnny flipped the turtle over and ever since then, an unbreakable bond was firmly established between the two of them. He named the turtle Sarah in honour of his beloved camel and now they wander the Wasteland that the world has become.\nSlowly, yet steadfast...\nRenders\nHere are the renders that the sculptor, Radmir Achmentov of Punga Miniatures, made. He took our idea and really went for it. You can tell he enjoyed sculpting Fast Johnny and we hope that will be the case for the others we have planned too.\nIn these pics you can see one of the stretch goals we have planned. Sir Teddy was taken as spoils of combat from an encounter with another Wasteland Raider named Zarola. Apparently Fast Johnny shot her mount and took Sir Teddy from her. She's not dead though and is planning revenge as soon as she has found a new mount!\nPrint\nWhen the print came in we found out that there was quite some damage unfortunately and we had to use Green Stuff to fix some cracks and breaks. While a bit rusty I was able to repair them all. The print also suffered from some missing detail that the printer wasn't able to print very well. Mostly on the rifle. I think I managed to fix it properly and it even adds to the character of a post apocalyptic wanderer that has to prepare things with limited resources at hand. \nI also took the liberty to add reins that run from Fast Johhny's hands to the head of the turtle. The sculptor did sculpt them but only held in his hands and to me it looked a bit odd since Sarah has a halter and there was nothing attached to it.   \nCast\nThe casting is done by our anonymous casting benefactor who I call by the codename of Sir Castalot! He has done the casting of the new batch of CP New Skins, CP Yakuza Dragoness and Kumicho as well as the Eldritch Dre'ya the Silent leaf. Needles to say, that to us, he is an absolute legend and he has saved our ass a couple of times! \nHe told us that Fast Johnny casts up like a charm so we foresee no problems there whatsoever!\nFast Johnny front\nFast Johnny side\nFast Johnny other side\nFast Johnny back\nPictures courtesy of Sir Castalot. We didn't recieve the package on time and I didn't want to delay the launch. I'll prep one and do a video of fast Johnny and sarah this weekend.\nSize\nFast Johnny is 54mm scale. From the top of Johnny's head to the bottom of the turtle's shell is roughly 60mm. Including the turtle's legs this will be roughly70/75mm.\nBelow you see the print with a ruler next to it. \nFast Johnny height\nFast Johnny length\nWe only have two types of pledges this time. An Ouroboros Miniatures' first time ever...  48 hour only EARLY BIRD!!! \nYes you've read that right. For the first 48 hours of the campaign you can get Fast Johnny with an additional extra \u20ac5,- off!\nThe standard pledge for a copy of Fast Johnny comes with a discount from the MSRP too of course! \nEARLY BIRD!\nFast Johnny regular pledge!\nWe also have options (normal pledge plus an early bird!) to get two Fast Johnny miniatures with a little more discount. Just in case you are thinking to convert one so Fast Johnny doesn't get too lonely! ;)\nShipping will be charged during the Kickstarter. For all pledges it is \u20ac10,- which includes tracking, signed for delivery and insurance.  \nWe have set the delivery date for February 2019. Casting is almost ready to go and we believe this is a realistic date. \nThe company who handles our shipping proved a couple of times already that they do a good job. We have every faith we can deliver on time as we have become quite good at organizing and packing. We don't think there will be a delay in packages going out to backers but would just like to add that delays can happen. Once the shipping company has your parcels it is out of our control. However we will do everything possible again to fulfill this Kickstarter on time. \nPlease note that we are not responsible for any customs or other fees that might occur. \nMiniatures come unpainted and need assembly and some minor cleaning.\nAs always there are a few people I want to thank! The following people who's help and hard work has made it possible to do this campaign!  \nRadmir Achmentov (Punga Miniatures)\nMally Anderson (Journeyman Miniatures\nMiranda Bosch-Thurlings\nSir Castalot (our mysterious incognito caster who we very grateful for to have on our side! You know who you are and you are a legend mate!!!)\nKyle Cruickshank (Mr Lees Minis)\nLuke Wilson\nOne thing that is very important if you want to help us fund is to please take a moment to share the project. You can do this by sharing the campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, your blog, forums and on any other Social media you might know! Tell your friends who might be interested and with your help we can make this project as successful as possible, ensuring we can make many more wonderful busts and miniatures in the near future!  \nYou can follow us here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/OuroborosMiniatures/\nhttps://ouroborosminiatures.blogspot.nl/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ouroborosminiatures/\nhttps://twitter.com/OuroborosMinis\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/4nJUNE\nContinued from top...\nDue to severe issues with our then caster, we were only able to unofficially release a bunch of busts and could only release all of them officially last September. Releasing them all at once and in such a short timespan was definitely not ideal as you can imagine but we had no choice really. Our game of playing catch up had started and by now we are almost reaching a point that we are there where we want to be. Why not hold things off to next year you might think? Well to be honest we don't want this year to mess up our plans for next year really! We don't want to look back anymore but move forward! So, coming back to what this text started with, we started the year full of enthusiasm and wanted to go full speed but then did a Fast Johnny! Not going very fast but moving on forwards at a slow yet steady pace. Determined to not give up and continue doing what we do! Thankfully a lot of you like what we are doing and your continuous support has made it possible for us to grow and keep growing. We say it often but we do really appreciate your support!!! So maybe this comparison is not entirely accurate but the story of the turtle and the hare kinda suits here. A fast starter not always ends up first. But a slow starter ends up over the finish line at some point as well! Sorry for turning this into an essay in the end but to some of you it might be interesting to have some insight into things.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFast Johnny has already been sculpted, moulded and (test) cast.

Each model has been hand sculpted, and is cast in the finest white metal and resin. My goal is to make sure that every single WTFF miniature is packed full of character, is a joy to paint, and will look suitably splendid on your table top.  \nSo grab your popcorn, break out your beverages, and take your seats. Whilst we wait for the match to start, how's about we look at our second team to take to the pitch...\nCast in either white metal or fine resin.\nHuman model is for size comparison only and is owned by Games Workshop\nDifferent team, same quality\nBattle Ball/ WTFF Pitches\nCLICK HERE!\nCLICK HERE!\nWarp Team Fantasy Football have teamed up with Chris from Battle Ball to bring you these awesome Croc Blockers branded vinyl gaming mats! Usable on their own, they can also be placed inside the epic Battle Ball laser cut stadiums, and how awesome do they look?\nTo grab either the mat or the stadium, check out the Battle Ball Kickstarter here! - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/178326236/battle-ball-field-a-fantasy-football-arena/description\nWhy are there only a few stretch goals?  \nKickstarter is an interesting beast, as all of us know from experience. Countless times people get involved in long, extensive campaigns only to wait months, sometimes years for them to be fulfilled. When the crowd bays for more, it's tempting to give in and offer far more products than you can deliver in the time frame promised at the start of the campaign!  \nIn the past I've ran a few of those types of campaigns, and, as with the Ram Raiders Kickstarter, I have once again decided to keep this short and sweet. This means fewer products for you all to buy, but a much shorter time for you all to wait before your lovely models are on your painting desk. Which we can all agree, is exactly where they ought to be.\nThe cost of shipping is not included in your pledge, and will be added after the conclusion of the campaign through the pledge manager. I will provide you all with full instructions when the time comes. I am still finalising the exact shipping costs, but to give you a rough idea here are a couple of preliminary estimates:  \nGAME DAY TICKET: - \u00a30 unless used to purchase miniatures in the campaign.  \nBOOGIE'S BUY: - \u00a32 to the UK, \u00a34 EU and \u00a34 ROW.  \nTEAM PLAYER/GOLDEN CLAWS: \u00a33.50 to the UK, \u00a37 EU and \u00a37 ROW.  \nThese estimates may increase if you purchase a large number of additional models on top of your core pledge, especially at the BOOGIE'S BUY or GAME DAY TICKET level. The final shipping costs are subject to change, and will be based on your location and specific rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. My father is our resin caster, my mother is in charge of packing and shipment, and our metal caster is a tried and tested person we have worked with before.\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products, all of the initial models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been cast, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in. I will be relying on Work in Progress sculpts and concept art for some of the stretch goals, but be assured that they will be completed and cast in a timely manner once the campaign has been funded.\n\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing the long list of stretch goals that other campaigns have had, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "LEVEL 1: GAME DAY TICKET", "descp": "Show your love and support the campaign, even if you don't want any models!

We hope you\u2019ll come along for the ride!\nThe Forest Dragon Bang & Twang is a fast and fun game of keeping up with an ever-changing piece of music, played by a variety of characters on a variety of characterful instruments from the world of The Forest Dragon.\nThe musicians gather at crossroads and campfires across the forest. They produce their instruments, tune up and begin to play! They play tunes both weird and wonderful, with many a twang and bang from their array of amazing musical implements. As the tunes get faster and more complicated, the musicians wrestle to keep up and challenge each others\u2019 musical ability.\nWith amazing art from Rory, Ben, and with just a little help from their dad, games-industry veteran Jon Hodgson, The Forest Dragon Bang & Twang is a fast and exciting game for the whole family!\nThe Forest Dragon centres around 3 special cards. On one side they have \u201cBang\u201d and on the other, they have \u201cTwang\u201d.\nThere\u2019s also a deck of 24 other cards, from which players draw a hand of 2 cards. Players must try to match the sequence shown on those special \u201criff\u201d cards with the cards in their hand. They can flip one of the riff cards, or they can move one of them. If they can match a riff they \"bank\" that card. Or they can play a special card that has special effects. \nA round of play takes around ten minutes, and play moves around the table nice and fast!\n\nWe\u2019ve made the game so there\u2019s almost always something to do on your turn, so no one gets left out. And for younger players, you can just play along and have an enjoyable time. For older players though, there\u2019s a lot more strategy - remembering who has \u201cbanked\u201d what card, and deciding which of the possible moves is the best one on your turn adds a lot more depth.\nThere are 8 special cards in the Bang & Twang deck, and these cards form \u201cthe tune\u201d. If you want to change the tune for the next game, you can take out those 8 special cards, and replace them with a different set! This makes gameplay really varied!\nBang & Twang features 6 sets of special cards - 6 \u201ctunes\u201d, and totals 67 cards in the box!\nYou can download a print and play version of Bang & Twang right now! It doesn\u2019t have art - we\u2019ve kept it very simple for home printing, but you can try out the first \u201ctune\u201d, absolutely free! Download it here: https://www.dropbox.com/\nIn 2016 we Kickstarted our first game together. The Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9 proved to be a huge success. We raised way more support than we expected, and doubled the size of the game through the campaign! It was an amazing ride!\nThe Forest Dragon was created by Rory when he was 7. He\u2019d been thinking about games, and described the whole thing in pretty much one breath. We wrote it down and slowly over a couple of years turned it into a playable game. And with your help on Kickstarter we made it into a reality. You can buy our first game in selected stores and on line.\nClearly, this isn't really just about making another game. I want my kids, Rory and Ben to continue to learn about hard work, games design, probability, art, layout, writing rules, product design, costings and all kinds of things that are good to learn about. \nMaking a game with them has been a way to show them a creative path, and how the whole world around them is someone's idea put into practice. With this second game, we\u2019re learning about sticking with something, persistence, and all the trials and pitfalls of making that second game. Can we do it? We think so!\nI really want to show the boys the reality of how games get made, and all the different processes involved. With Bang & Twang, we\u2019re learning about what it means to make an \u201cintellectual property\u201d and how we approach a line of games, rather than just one game. \nOur first game was made with print on demand technology that let us order one game for each person that backed us. This time we\u2019d like to try to go one further and make a full print run of the game, and get it deeper into more shops around the world! If we fund, it means we\u2019ll make the game through print on demand once again. And we\u2019ll be very happy with that. But if we can reach some of our stretch goals, we\u2019ll be able to make a more fancy box, and do a whole print run, which will be a big learn for the boys! (Dad has made many such boxed games in his day job, so you\u2019re in safe hands!)\nTo help build towards our goal we had some great Add-Ons. These are extra things you can pledge for. If you decide you\u2019d like an Add-On, then up your pledge by the appropriate amount. You can pledge for them before they are unlocked if you wish - that will help them get unlocked.\n\nIf we do manage to unlock some of these Add-Ons we\u2019ll make some new pledge levels that include them too, for your convenience.\n\nAll prices include shipping.\nBang & Twang Badge Set Add \u00a35 to your pledge\nYou\u2019ll get a cool selection of exclusive Forest Dragon goodies! 4 Forest Dragon badges, a cool round sticker, and a square fridge magnet!\n\nThe Forest Dragon By Rory Add \u00a317 to your pledge\nThis is the game that started it all. The price includes shipping.\nThe Forest Dragon Expansion Box Add \u00a317 to your pledge\n A selection of amazing expansions to the original Forest Dragon game! Includes The Poo Cave, Dogs and Stuff, Robo Realm, Fire Dragon Realm, Quest Givers!\n\nOriginal Game Double Up! Add \u00a330 to your pledge\nBoth the original Forest Dragon by Rory game AND the Expansion Box\nBang & Twang Play Mat LOCKED Add \u00a312 to your pledge\nCurrently locked, but with enough backers, it\u2019ll become available! A neoprene play mat that makes a lovely space to hold the riff cards and the draw deck. It\u2019s 13 inches square making it large enough to use the coasters on too! It\u2019s like a mouse mat but bigger and cooler!\nBang & Twang Coasters Add \u00a35 to your pledge\nAVAILABLE NOW! These are adorable! Replace the Riff cards you get in your Bang & Twang Box with a set of 3 Bang & Twang Coasters! \nBang & Twang Coins Add \u00a312 to your pledge\nAVAILABLE NOW! The Bang & Twang coins are something very special - a strictly limited edition set of real metal coins, with gorgeous enamel colours - green on one side, orange on the other. Made by the coin experts at Campaign Coins these are really amazing. They come in a set of three, and are perfect to replace the riff cards in the Bang & Twang box for the fanciest game imaginable!\nBurp & Fart LOCKED Add \u00a315 to your pledge\nCurrently locked, but with enough backers, it\u2019ll become available! This is basically disgusting. One of our playtesters who is old enough to know better suggested the whole game could be re-skinned as \u201cBurp & Fart\u201d. This will feature the adorable \u201cGreedy Boys\u201d characters sat in a ditch, holding a burping and farting contest. If we unlock this stretch goal we\u2019ll make a whole new base game available as an Add-On. It will have the same rules, but all new, deeply ill-mannered card art. \nWARNING: Will contain pictures of burps and farts drawn by giddy children.\nMany of our fans are friends and family who don't know much about Kickstarter. Thanks for making it this far! We love you!\nKickstarter is a website that allows project creators with an idea to pitch that idea to the audience of the Internet. There's usually a product at the heart of a Kickstarter campaign. In this case, it's the Bang & Twang game. \nIf people like the idea they can pledge money to the project. If enough money is pledged in order to meet the campaign's funding goal by the end, the money is collected from your card by Kickstarter, they take a cut, and the rest is passed on to the creator. And the project is made a reality. If we don\u2019t raise enough pledges no one gets charged. And we go away to think very hard about what we did wrong. \nTo encourage and thank supporters, or \"backers\" as they are known, we are offering a range of Rewards and Add-Ons. These start out at the game itself, and you can get more stuff like artwork, your own expansions and more!\nAnother encouragement to spread the word and convince others to join in, are Stretch Goals. These are milestones which unlock extra rewards. Sometimes they allow backers to buy something new, by upping their pledge. Other times they add something to existing rewards for free. \n\nThroughout the period of the campaign, you can amend your pledge up and down as you see fit. Only once the campaign ends is the amount you pay locked in. So it pays to keep an eye on progress, and pledge for everything you'd like!\nIf you have any questions at all, please drop me (Jon) a line via PM, email, text or whatever method suits you best, and I\u2019ll do my best to explain how to back us! Don\u2019t be shy, we understand that Kickstarter can be daunting if you\u2019ve never used it.\nTo pledge to our campaign you need to hit the Pledge button. You'll sign up to an account, decide how much you'd like to pledge, select what kind of reward you'd like - you can choose to just give to the campaign out of kindness, or you can select what you'd like to receive for your support. We'd love you to have a copy of the game.\nYou can throw in whatever you like above the basic pledge levels - there aren't fixed amounts you have to give.\nYou'll provide some payment details and, if enough people chose to support us, at the end of the campaign your card will be charged. The project creators get in touch a short time after that to collect any additional information they might need.\nFollowing a Kickstarter campaign is a lot of fun. A community of supporters is created, who can all share their excitement and support in the comments section, as well as ask questions or make requests of the project. You'll also receive updates throughout the campaign either here or by email.\nFor our second campaign we\u2019re playing it very safe - the whole of the base game is done. 5 additional Expansions are completely made. With children helping to make the core reward we needed to know they'd be able to finish the project. And they have. We just need money for printing and shipping it to you. We are not spending any time after the campaign on further development, testing or art for the core game. It\u2019s done. This does mean we won\u2019t go much beyond 5 additional expansions, but we feel that\u2019s the best and most honest way to do things. We have not yet completed work on the art and graphics for \u201cBurp & Fart\u201d but should we be lucky enough to unlock that stretch goal we\u2019ll get it done as soon as possible! It won\u2019t take long.\nStretch goals are each unlocked as we reach their milestone in our funding level. If we\u2019re lucky we\u2019ll reveal more as the campaign progresses!\n\u00a31500 This is our basic goal. At this level, we\u2019ll make a print on demand version of the game in a nice tuck box and send it to you with our thanks. \nWe\u2019ll reveal more stretch goals if we do well!\nPraise for the Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9\nDon\u2019t just take our word for it, here are some thoughts about our first game, The Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9: \n\"The Forest Dragon is a precious thing, an experience Jon Hodgson and his son Rory will treasure for years to come. And it\u2019s a fine game to boot! We\u2019re so lucky they decided to share it with us.\" - Francesco Nepitello, game designer\n\u201cThe Forest Dragon is as indispensable as wet wipes and snacks, and occupies a permanent place in my 'leaving the house with the kids' bag.\u201d - Gareth Ryder Hanrahan, author, game designer \n\"If you\u2019ve ever experienced wonder while wandering and exploring, the Forest Dragon contains that excitement in a conveniently-carried, child-friendly card game.\" - Jacob Rodgers, game designer\n\u201cIt's very easy to pick up and play the game, with enough depth in the game to keep kids of all ages entertained. At its heart, there's a marvelous whimsical adventure, which had my pair (an 8 and 11-year-old) coming back for more. I knew I was onto a winner when they were picking up the cards and having games without me :) \u201d - Newt Newport, game designer\n\u201cThe most nutritious cardgame I have ever eaten!\u201d - Patric G\u00f6tz, game publisher \n\"Our Forest Dragon card game has (literally) been to the base of Mount Doom and to Hobbiton, entertained plenty of adults and children along the trek and is an absolute joy to play.\" - Scott Purdy, artist\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good game because it was written by a kid; it\u2019s a good game because it\u2019s a good game.\u201d - Jared Earle, writer, photographer\n\u201cIt's an awesome game which my kids love playing! Especially when they beat me at it!\u201d - Gordon Kennedy, game artist\n\n\"With its bright colors, fun illustrations, and easy rules, The Forest Dragon became a fast favorite in our house. It is quick enough to learn to hold my children's attention and fun enough to appeal to adults as well.\" - August Hahn, game designer\n\n\"This game is amazing. I like stealing items from my family, especially my brother. We usually play with the whole pack to make the game really long and exciting, and my favourite bit is the Poo Portal!\" - Milla aged 7.\n\"Both enchanting and hilarious, this simple-but-fun card game is already a favourite in our house. The artwork is delightful. The Poo Cave Expansion is essential. We've played it with small people and with my eighty-year-old parents. It's a winner with everyone. Gutted we missed out on Clarinetto.\" - Claire Longhurst, gamer\n\n\"So good I wrote a review of it\"  - Pookie, game reviewer\n\n\"It\u2019s funny and my wife likes it\" - Adam Littlefield, musician\n\n\"I\u2019ve so far only played it with adults, but they all loved it (and it wasn\u2019t too complicated for them) \ud83d\ude42\" Andrew Peregrine, game designer\n\n\"Fantastic game. My kids have racked up over 200 hours playing this game. A family favourite that never get old! Highly recommended.\" - Wayne McNamara, gamer\n\n\"Such a simple game and great fun to play. That said, I\u2019ve yet to win a game against my eight year old and his friends!\" -Tom Cusworth, gamer\n\"The Forest Dragon is a great game. Attractive to look at, simple enough to play as soon as the box is open, but with enough variety to repay any number of repeat plays. And the monsters are very cool.\" - Matt Cambridge, writer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve successfully made our first game and delivered it to people all around the world. \n\nWe're keeping things very simple.

We hope we've done our sums right.\n\nWhere we print the game will depend on how well we do. If we fund at a lower level it will be printed in the UK.

Goregasm Arena pits the hardiest denizens of the nuclear wastelands in brutal gladiatorial combat. Strike, shunt, and tackle the competition into submission, asserting your dominance of the alter square in this fast and brutal game. Wrestle for the adoration of the crowd by stomping your opponents into a bloody pulp and reap the rewards (or lament the disastrous consequences) when you spin the wheel. Will you claim the glory in the arena?\nPlayers take it in turns to control miniature combatants, spending adrenaline to perform actions such as strikes, shunts, and tackles in an attempt to gain glory points and whittle down their opponents meat points. Adrenaline only regenerates slowly, so players must be careful not to be caught out after an epic bout of athletic prowess! \nScream with delight while your foes squeal with pain as they draw awfully brutal injury cards as a result of your critical strikes!\nCombatants will inevitably be called to face the crowd with the wheel, where the unpredictable nature of their fans comes to life with fantastic bonuses or treacherous hazards.    \nEach box of Goregasm arena comes with the following:\nThe Miniatures - 35mm scale cast in high quality Resin. Supplied unpainted.\n 4 Combatant miniatures and 4 Totems, cast in gorgeous high quality resin.

Zealot is back with our third Kickstarter, bringing to life this new range, with our usual reputation for quality and jaw-droppingly detailed miniatures.\nBack in 2014 we created a new level of Dungeon scenery, using digital production methods and detailed vacuum casting. Then last year, we breathed new life into a too-long forgotten fantasy race, the Minotaurs, which we are finishing the delivery of now - with delighted backers praising the detail and quality.\nThis time, we wanted to go back to our roots and tackle real heroes and villains, characters which capture our imaginations and make us remember why we started gaming or collecting.\nWe are heavily inspired by classic RPG games; playing old fantasy games from the 80s is what started all this madness in the first place!\nSo welcome to a fusion of past and present, new and old. We are updating, modernizing and offering to you, this range of high quality miniatures traditionally sculpted by the awesome miniature artist, Boris Woloszyn.\nIf you like what you see; Read on, brave adventurer.\n We don't produce board game counters, these are not PVC pencil toppers, injection moulded in china  - we make Miniatures. Resin and Metal, these are produced the same as they were 30 years ago, cutting no corners and not skimping on quality or detail. It's not the fastest or cheapest process, but it certainly is the best. If you want Miniatures which you will cherish and still want to use in another 30 years time, then these are for you.\n We have teamed up with Boris Woloszyn, a traditional putty sculptor from Brazil, these models are made by hand, no 3D printing involved (unusually for us!). Boris has a real talent as an artist, able to bring true character to each sculpt, I'm sure you will agree.\nThese models are heavily inspired by the classic games we grew up loving and playing with our families and friends. Just take a look at the greens, all made from putty.\nProduction of Boris's sculpts is done in three materials, Standard Resin, White Metal and Premium Resin. As we unlock each material in the stretch goals, you will have a choice to add which material you want.\nStandard Resin is one for the gamer, it is on par with a lot of other companies' resin materials, the details are good but the resin is not as tough and flexible as the Premium offering. There will be more splits and parts for each model when they are produced in this material.\nWhite Metal, that fabled shiny material which is fondly remembered by older gamers. When your army weighed more than a cinder block and dropping a Dragon model on your toes resulted in a trip to the hospital.\nIt's for the gamer or painter who wants a shot of nostalgia, feeling the weight in their hands. The details are good, the models are tough and it paints well. White metal does have more gates and vents to clean up from the model than resin models.\nPremium Resin is really a superior resin. It requires very few gates and vents, has a nice matte surface to paint, has 0.2% shrinkage and captures every detail of the original sculpt perfectly. It is tougher than Standard Resin with some flex to avoid damage. It cuts and files well when cleaning the model up or converting.\nPremium resin is the material for the serious painter or collector.\n All of the pledges you can supplement with \"Add Ons\" from the section below.\nMiniatures come in three tiers 'Hero Sized', 'Mighty Sized' and 'Monstrous Sized'. Green, Blue and Yellow Dots respectively.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, Forgotten Halls\nYou can add to your pledge with any of the following packs. Just increase your pledge by the amount needed.\nTo see each scenery piece in better detail, you can view them in our store by clicking here.\nHere is a gallery for each of the core Miniatures, stretch goal models can bee seen in the section below. The coloured dot on each image, indicates if they are \"Hero Sized\", \"Mighty Sized\" or \"Monstrous Sized\".\nEach model will come with a standard Plastic Round Base or Classic Rectangle base, as shown in the pictures. You can make your selection on the Pledge Manager after the campaign closes.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, 3DBases\n As funding progresses we will unlock stretch goals and extra miniatures. Below you can see what has been unlocked and what is the next goal coming up. The coloured dot on each image refers to the size. Green \"Hero Size\", Blue \"Mighty Size\" and Orange \"Monstrous Size\".\nWe are splitting the production into three tiers with the three types of material on offer. This should allow us to deliver to our deadlines as the load on each manufacturing method is reduced. Currently we have marked July 2019 as the delivery for this project. \nSince this is a traditionally sculpted project, Boris requires around 1 week to complete each additional sculpt, depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked, this could take a fair few months for him to complete the sculpting. You cant rush this kind of art!\nIf this is the case and we hit a lot of the planned stretch goals, we are happy to offer a split dispatch option, where the core models are dispatched early - since they are already in moulds and not far off mass production. There will be no problem delivering core models before the dispatch date.\nThen the stretch goal sculpts will follow some months later in wave 2.\nDue to the manufacture method of vacuum cast resin and spincast metals, dispatch date will depend a lot on amount that we fund. We will update this section once funding is underway and we have a better idea for how popular this will be. We do dispatch on a rolling backer ID system.\nIt may be possible to dispatch Standard Resin core miniatures ahead of the predicted delivery date.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, 3DBases\nMAXIMUM Postage Costs\nThese are the MAXIMUM postage costs for a large pledge. For example a pledge of 50 models in White metal would be these values. 50 models in resin, the postage is around half these values.\nPostage costs start at the values which are stated on each pledge (\u00a33 UK, \u00a34 EU and \u00a35 Rest of World) If you add more models and Add ons, postage costs will increase with weight. The end postage will be calculated by the pledge manager after the campaign end.\nPlease note, metal models are around 4 times as heavy as resin.\nThe end postage costs will be calculated on the Pledge Manager, but they will not exceed the postage values in the table below. These include tracked and signed for shipping.\nBy Adam Skinner", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will produce a new range of quality resin and metal Heroes and Monsters. The risks to this project are very minimal. We do this kind of production, every day for 8 years, producing miniatures for many high profile companies. All the core set of models are already ready to start mass manufacture. \n\nWe are not new to Kickstarter; our first Kickstarter was a colossal project ~200k resin cast pieces.\nWe delivered it and it was highly praised that \"the quality was beyond amazing\" and the detail was \"phenomenal\". Certainly achieving what we set out; to bring a new level of cutting edge dungeon scenery to gamers.\nOur second project, the Minotaur Horde, we are on track to deliver the last few hundred backers inside the next 2 months, and again the feedback was overwhelmingly positive by everyone receiving their pledge. \n\nRisk#1: Speed of manufacture.\nResin and Spincast Metal are labor intensive materials to cast with. If there are many stretch goals which we hit, then Boris will need more time to sculpt them. This will push back the start of manufacture. \n\nWhile there will be no problem delivering the core models by the estimated date. If the project funds well and many goals are hit - then we will offer a split shipping option, so core models are delivered on time, then stretch goal models get delivered in a wave 2 a few months later. \n\nAside from the risk of delayed dispatch of stretch goals, the risks are very minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "+ MANNA SHARER +", "descp": "A big thank you from the Twisting Catacombs backers, Zealot Miniatures and the RPG gamer community for helping us to create some awesome miniatures.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "+ SOLO HERO +", "descp": "One Hero-Sized Miniature of your choice, in Standard Resin.\nUpgrading material to White Metal or Premium Resin is an addition.\nHero-Sized Models are marked with a Green Dot.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["131 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a318 or more", "title": "+ ADVENTURE PARTY +", "descp": "Four Hero-Sized Miniature of your choice, in Standard Resin.\nUpgrading material to White Metal or Premium Resin is an addition.\nHero-Sized Models are marked with a Green Dot.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["334 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a362 or more", "title": "+ COLLECTOR +", "descp": "One of all the 13 models in the Core Kickstarter, in Standard Resin.

Also for JUST $40.00 USD.\n     See? Not much math stuff, lots of Orcs and Goblins. Who needs them book learnin talkie times anyways? Not Gobbers and Orcsies don't.\n     It is our hope that as the campaign progresses we can add items to the offering and perhaps to the initial box contents as well HOWEVER as this is our first effort in plastic manufacturing we want to be sure we are responsible and take this slowly keeping everything nice and predictable and efficiently produced and delivered. So there will only be a few additions to this campaigns. We don't want to get too ahead of ourselves with promises but we also want to make sure we make the most of this campaign that we can. You CAN NOT go wrong with more and more monstrous beasties eh?\n\n    Please be aware you can buy as many of these boxes as you want! Personally I don't think any orc or goblin warband is complete unless it nearly breaks the shelves under it's ponderous weight when stowed away between sessions of rampaging blood thirst. \n   If you want to add to your rewards you can do so by managing the amount of your pledge upward by enough to cover the addition of as many green hellions your heart desires. \n  And remember a forest without goblins under every hedge is just not a forest worth trodding through for any self respecting adventurer!

They DESERVE awesome enemies to fight! the theatre of your imagination DESERVES fantastic minis! YOU. NEED. THE HORDES OF THE AULD WORLD ORCS AND GOBLINS BOXED SET!!\n   The whole idea of this kickstarter is to fund the production of these fantastic monstrosities in high detail hard grade PVC plastic similar to many of the newly beloved board games recently hitting the market like a spiked ball of steel in the gnarly green fist of a feral Orc berserker rampaging through the ranks of silly tights wearing doods who spend all their time preening their poofy feathered hats and shining their armor and dancing with their little swishy poke \" swords \" and singing songs about damsels and wine and stupid stuff. Do we really want those kinds of doods in charge of stuff and ruining our good time? No. No we do not. We want Orcs and goblins. Lots of them. That is why plastic is good; cause we can make a LOT of them and sell them cheap.\n\n  So to help us do this well we need your help to allow us to pay the high cost of plastic production with tried and true manufacturers who have produced many of these exact same great boxed game projects.\n   Ok this is serious. Shipping is important and can be costly depending upon where in the world you need your stuff to be delivered to. Because we do not know exactly when the project will complete production we cannot bill for postage until the product is actually in hand and ready to deliver. We are working to build a base frame of reference for the shipping costs and we are also working to establish relationships that may allow us to ship from hubs in various parts of the world to mitigate those costs. \n   We will work to keep the postage costs as low as possible cause we don't really want to make money from shipping we just want to get your stuff to you as soon as possible cause once you know you have orcs and goblins on the way.... well they just need to get there fast and cheap right? \n   For now though the only region in which we can reasonably project postage costs is the US. We will be shipping orders via priority mail so as long as your stuff fits into a priority box ( and we will be working to make sure that they do ) you can expect to pay the priority mail shipping rates.\nAnd Say!

Each model has been hand sculpted, and is cast in the finest white metal and resin. My goal is to make sure that every single WTFF miniature is packed full of character, is a joy to paint, and will look suitably splendid on your table top.\nSo grab your popcorn, break out your beverages, and take your seats. Whilst we wait for the match to start, how's about we look at our first plucky team to take to the pitch...\nCast in Metal (TEAM PLAYER) or Fine Resin (GOLDEN BOOTS)\nAdd any of the miniatures in the Team to your pledge\nHuman model is for size comparison only and is owned by Games Workshop\n Ram Raiders review by The Wargamer Viking\n Why are there only a few stretch goals?  \nKickstarter is an interesting beast, as all of us know from experience. Countless times people get involved in long, extensive campaigns only to wait months, sometimes years for them to be fulfilled. When the crowd bays for more, it's tempting to give in and offer far more products than you can deliver in the time frame promised at the start of the campaign!\nIn the past I've ran a few of those types of campaigns, and this time I have decided to keep it short and sweet. This means fewer products for you all to buy, but a much shorter time for you all to wait before your lovely models are on your painting desk. Which we can all agree, is exactly where they ought to be.\nKickstarter Launch Hangout!\nThe cost of shipping is not included in your pledge, and will be added after the conclusion of the campaign through the pledge manager. I will provide you all with full instructions when the time comes.  \nI am still finalising the exact shipping costs, but to give you a rough idea here are a couple of preliminary estimates:\nGAME DAY TICKET: - \u00a30 unless used to purchase miniatures in the campaign.\nMICKEY'S PICK: - \u00a32 to the UK, \u00a34 EU and \u00a34 ROW.  \nTEAM PLAYER/GOLDEN BOOTS: \u00a33.50 to the UK, \u00a37 EU and \u00a37 ROW.  \nThese estimates may increase if you purchase a large number of additional models on top of your core pledge, especially at the MICKEY'S PICK or DAY TICKET level.\nThe final shipping costs are subject to change, and will be based on your location and specific rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. My father is our resin caster, my mother is in charge of packing and shipment, and our metal caster is a tried and tested person we have worked with before.\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products, all of the initial models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been cast, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in.\n\nTo ensure the campaign runs smoothly I will be working on it full-time, and will ensure that all your questions will be answered and updates will posted at all hours.\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing the long list of stretch goals that other campaigns have had, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "LEVEL 1: GAME DAY TICKET", "descp": "Show your love and support the campaign, even if you don't want any models!

Now, picture yourself as a young American scientist; Hans Tannhauser. Yes, that\u2019s your name in this scenario. While you\u2019re at it, think of Tr\u00fcberbrook, a remote village in rural, mountain-sloped and densely forested cold-war Germany. Because, that\u2019s where you somehow end up after hitting the continent. But who cares, you won the trip in a lottery! Or at least, that\u2019s how it seems. But don\u2019t fear, instead of getting some rest, you could find yourself having to save the world \u2026\nAttention: All of our sceneries are hand-crafted!\n  Suspense! Mystery! Thrills! After all, it's a single player sci-fi mystery adventure game. We want to keep you entertained!\nJoin American student Tannhauser, stranger in a strange land\nSet in cold-war rural Germany in the late 1960s\nInspired by Twin Peaks, The X-Files, Stranger Things & Star Trek\nIndulge in universal themes such as love, friendship, loyalty, self-discovery and dinosaurs\nHandmade miniature scenery!\nEnglish and German localization with full voice acting!\nAtmospheric, moody soundtrack\nComing to Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation\u00ae4 & Nintendo Switch\nA likely mobile port later!\nUp to 10 hours of super exciting gameplay!\nRelease scheduled for late 2018 \u2013 not the longest wait!\n     The year is 1967. The world policy is dominated by the Cold War and Vietnam, Russia and America are racing to the moon. At the same time in Europe, students take to the streets from Paris to Berlin.\nOn a larger scale, the world is locked in turmoil, but most people are unaware of the events unfolding in an overlooked, sleepy part in the German province. Hans Tannhauser, an American student in his late twenties is caught by surprise: Out of the blue, he wins a trip to a small, German village, Tr\u00fcberbrook. Truber-what? No idea! It doesn\u2019t help he can\u2019t remember taking part in any lottery in the first place \u2026 Happy to put some distance between him and his Ph.D. in quantum physics, he makes his way to Tr\u00fcberbrook, Germany, bursting with curiosity.\nBut shortly after his arrival, inexplicable things start to happen: A mysterious stranger breaks into his room at the Guesthouse Waldeslust and steals a paper on physics. But who would do that? And why?\nGradually, he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests, one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Gretchen Lemke, who is on a research trip to Tr\u00fcberbrook, seems normal to him. Before he knows it, Gretchen becomes Tannhauser\u2019s accomplice on the adventure of a lifetime! It slowly dawns on the aspiring physicist that his presence in T\u00fcberbrook is not accidental \u2013 he is here to save the world!\nAs the story proceeds, Tannhauser teams up with Gretchen Lemke, a student of paleoanthropology, and bumps into the enigmatic inventor Lazarus Taft.\nThe ensemble (more detailed sketches down below)\n  Tannhauser is an American physics student in his mid-twenties \u2013 and a clever one at that. The adorable little fellow is well-read, always curious and of a deeply friendly nature.\n Tannhauser is played by Justin Beard:\nGretchen Lemke was always the fiercest kid in the sandbox; cute but merciless if someone dared interrupting her excavations of twig bones and toy artefacts. The somewhat overenthusiastic student of paleoanthropology arrives in Tr\u00fcberbrook on an adventure to unravel the mysteries surrounding the village.\nGretchen Lemke is played by Nora Tschirner:\nAs much a reclusive inventor as it gets, Lazarus Taft quickly became talk of the town due to his superior card playing. There must be a reason he bought this costly old mansion in Tr\u00fcberbrook, of all places \u2026 What's up with Lazarus Taft?\nLazarus Taft is played by Dirk von Lowtzow:\nTr\u00fcberbrook is full of quirky villagers, tourists and strangers \u2013 like the gruffy but warm-hearted innkeeper Trude or her daughter Leni, \"the weird kid\" from Tr\u00fcberbrook Elementary. And there's the old baron, a veteran of two world wars, or Lessing, the prototype of modern day conspiracists. And of course Tr\u00fcbi, the legendary lake monster. To name a few.\nOne of the most distinctive features of the game is the unique visual style. The sceneries are purely handmade. 'Handmade' as in: 'Manufactured using real hands!' And fingers!\nNot the most efficient way of doing things, but certainly the most inefficient one. We're loving it, though! Look at what we do here, piece by piece, by the sweat of our brows. Every little detail is custom-made.\nThe models are digitized using a technique called photogrammetry and later retopologized. This way we get highly detailed polygon models that blend perfectly with our digital characters.\nIt is a lot of work, but also quite exciting! You may ask yourself, how can they reach this level of detail? Are there very tiny people involved? They can't accomplish all of this with mere human hands, right? Well yes, we can! The answer might be our abundance of professional hands. Twenty-four seven at our disposal in all shapes and colors, they get things done!\nWeather effects, using real lights\nEvery scene gets an individual treatment and is staged with actual physical lighting. This allows us to simulate different hours of the day or weather conditions. Even a change of seasons is possible just by redecorating the set with real tiny little snowflakes, no joke.\nDifferent hours of the day\nThis way we achieve an exceptional and magical look that visually reflects the world of Tr\u00fcberbrook.\nTechnical breakdown of a scene\n  Collective childhood hero Ron Gilbert inspecting our models while on promotion for \"Thimbleweed Park\"\n      Tr\u00fcberbrook is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on characters and the narrative, but includes a lot of puzzles that need to be solved to progress the story. The puzzles are designed to integrate into the narrative.\nInteraction with the environment\nYou navigate Tannhauser through the different sceneries from a third person perspective, usually in long distance shots to intensify the impression of peeking into a little diorama. The story unfolds as you interact with your environment, talk to other characters and solve puzzles. These range from inventory-based puzzles to social challenges (such as persuading other characters) up to passing unsettling psycho tests.\nExtensive dialogue trees\nFor the console versions, we came up with a very intuitive controller input, allowing you to move the line of sight and walking directions independently. For the PC versions, you can choose between classic point and click mouse controls, and the controller navigation. \n  The soundtrack of Tr\u00fcberbrook is an original composition to fit the mood of the game \u2013 sort of a tranquil \"doom jazz\". Inspirations come from the works of Tom Waits, Angelo Badalamenti, Mark Lanegan, Timber Timbre or Bohren & der Club of Gore.\nThe soundtrack has a playtime of around 40 minutes and is directed by Sebastian Nagel & Albrecht Schrader. Why not listen to the serene main theme while browsing the project?\n\u2013\u2013 Please note that there's an additional fee for shipping and packaging on all the physical rewards. It will be applied on checkout and depends on your country. \u2013\u2013\nWe prepared some nice rewards for your support. Here are some details:\nRegular Digital Version: The regular digital version of the game comes for Windows, Mac and Linux (all DRM-free or via Steam, your choice) and for PlayStation\u00ae4, Xbox One or Nintendo Switch (all via their respective stores). If the game is successfully funded, we'll contact you so you can tell us which version you'd prefer. You can also add additional copies (for a friend or for another system) to your reward by adding 25\u20ac (or $29) to your pledge.\nEarly Access Version: The early access version of the game comes for Windows, Mac and Linux. Enjoy the game while there are no walkthroughs and letsplays around \u2013 unless you create them yourselves, which we'd like to encourage! For organizational reasons, this version is limited and will be distributed via Steam. It will be ready around ten days before the regular release!\nPC Boxed Version: This boxed version is exclusive to Kickstarter and includes a physical disc to install the game DRM-free on your Windows, Mac or Linux system. Also comes with an additional Steam Key and includes some really nice haptic goodies, such as a manual and stuff. You can add additional boxes to your reward by adding 75\u20ac (or $87) to your pledge, packaging and shipping included.\nPS4 Boxed Version: New! This boxed version is exclusive to Kickstarter and includes a PS4 version of the game. Comes with some really nice haptic goodies, such as a manual and stuff. You can add additional boxes to your reward by adding 75\u20ac (or $87) to your pledge, packaging and shipping included.\nArt Book: The art book is one of our favourite rewards, since, you know, we have tons of artwork, sketches and behind-the-scenes material to share with you! The digital version will be available as a DRM-free download. It is included in the digital plus edition and all higher tiers or can be added to a lower tier by adding 12\u20ac (or $14) to your pledge! The really neat printed version is a Kickstarter exclusive item and rather expensive to produce. Every copy will be numbered continuously and signed by the team. You can add more printed art books by raising your pledge by 59\u20ac (or $69).\nDigital Wallpapers: The lower tiers include one random (1 out of 5) digital wallpaper in a 5k resolution. The whole set of 5 digital wallpapers is included in the digital plus edition and all higher tiers. Can also be added to lower tiers by raising your pledge by 6\u20ac (or $7).\nDigital Soundtrack: The digital soundtrack is included in the digital plus edition and all higher tiers. It will be available as a DRM-free download. You can also add it to lower tiers by adding 15\u20ac (or $18) to your pledge!\nYour name in the credits: We would be happy to put your real name into the credits. Of course you can also provide us with a pseudonym.*\nYour name featured in the game: The higher tiers include the really cool opportunity to immortalize your name in the genetic code of the game. Could be in the hotel's guestbook, a book title in the library or in the patient manifesto of the sanatorium ... There will be different prominent spots throughout the game for you to leave your name! *\nYour Portrait: As in every decent guesthouse, there's a small ancestral gallery of regular visitors (\"Stammg\u00e4ste\") at the Waldeslust. We have reserved a unique spot for the most willing backers, awaiting your portrait to join in! Our character artist Benny will draw your likeness in the style of the game \u2013 or at least he will try to! For that, he will need some photos provided by you to meet your appearence. Take a look at our own team portraits below to get the idea! As a bonus feature, there will be a short biographical note* included for these sparkling personalities, of course commented by the main character.\n* Please keep in mind that every submission or pseudonym needs to meet community standards: no racist, sexist or otherwise offensive pseudonyms and submissions will be accepted, also no copyright infringing material. We reserve the right to reject a submission for any reason. Thank you for your understanding!\nPersonal Studio Tour: A personal studio tour of our facilities in Cologne, Germany. Visit our legendary main base \"Studio K\u00f6nig\", probably the only professional and fully functional TV studio made up from scratch and screwed together by a bunch of art students. Here we create our weekly late night show \"Neo Magazin Royale\" as well as \"Schulz & B\u00f6hmermann\". The tour is guided by the developers of the game and includes an exhibition of the miniature sceneries used in the game. To make the most of it, we suggest a visit on a weekday, so you can get to know all of our collegues in the wild! We are somewhat flexible regarding the date and will contact you on the details once the Kickstarter is over. Attention: travel expenses and accomodation are not included.\nOur main base \"Studio K\u00f6nig\" \u2013 famous for the lavish Hoppenbrock mural and the impressive triceratops gargoyle on it's roof\nOriginal Set Piece: We have tons of tiny little set pieces used in the making of the actual game. Each and every piece was created individually and received a lot of work, time and love from our set designers. We'll make sure to let you choose between a variety of original set pieces once the campaign is over. Don't worry, there's certainly enough for everyone!\nUnique Scenery Scale Model: Our scenery models come in different shapes and sizes \u2013 some are reaaally big, like an ankylosaurus, while others are rather small, like a hesperonychus. We are ready to give away one of our smaller models (as the big ones would be far to heavy to transport). Let's be honest here: it will probably break our hearts to see the little ones go. But from the day we brought them into life, we always knew they would want to leave the house one day, become independent, travel the world. So it's cool, really. (We can always make new ones.)\nIf you'd like to add a specific reward to your selected tier, just add the corresponding amount of money (see list for prices) to your pledge. We'll then check the difference between your selected tier and the actual pledged money and get back to you after the Kickstarter to clarify which rewards you wished to include. Feel free to message us or ask in the comments if you have any questions!\n  We'll release the game for Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation\u00ae4 & Nintendo Switch.\nMobile: Right now we cannot promise mobile versions for Android and iOS, but we think the game would be much fun on tablet computers and mobile phones. We would love to do these after the initial release, as the development would certainly take some extra time due to different technical challenges and performance reasons.\n  We've spent a lot of time working on a voice acting concept that joins in with the genetic code of the game. Since the protagonist is an American in the midst of a bunch of Germans, we wanted to reflect this in our choice of actors.\nIn the international English version, the main character Tannhauser speaks American English, while the townspeople of Tr\u00fcberbrook sport a (more or less) German accent. In the German version, it's vice versa: the protagonist might have a modest American accent, while the townspeople welcome him in regular German, most likely with a dialect. Both approaches bear a certain degree of entertainment, each in their own way.\nWe are btf, an interdisciplinary team with expertise in programming, game design, writing, animation, graphic design, sound design and production. The studio emerged in 2012 from a collective of art students in Cologne, Germany. If you are familiar with German television, you might know our late night TV shows \u00bbNeo Magazin Royale\u00ab or \u00bbSchulz & B\u00f6hmermann\u00ab or our web comedy series \u00bbGute Arbeit Originals\u00ab.\nAs passionate gamers and die-hard adventure game fans, we crave to develop video games. Our first two adventure games were addressed to the audience of our show \u00bbNeo Magazin Royale\u00ab and in German only, whereas the world of \u00bbTr\u00fcberbrook\u00ab is set in a genuine and independent universe.\nHello!\nOur small core team consists of Florian (director and game designer), Lea (the producer), Hans (technical artist), Lea (set designer), Simon (developer) and Benny (the character designer). The team is few and far between reinforced from the nucleus of btf by other artists, animators, designers and programmers.\nThe first ideas for Tr\u00fcberbrook date back as far as 2011, but pre-production was only started in 2014, when Florian approached the studio with the concept.\nSo far, we've managed to cross-finance the development mainly through side projects. To get things started, we received a funding for the game by the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, a regional media development fund. But this will only get us so far, which is why we reach out to you via Kickstarter.\nThough the conceptual development is already finished and most of the assets are already prototyped and tested, there is still a long way to go. The money from Kickstarter will mainly be used for the creation of 20 hand-crafted miniature scenery models, for the development in Unity3D as well as for the creation of the many assets needed, like 3D-models, animations and sounds.\nHow the money will be used\nBut ... isn't there a publisher involved? Yes, we are happy that the game will be published by our friends at Headup Games, a small but well-known indie label from Germany. As it's a pure distribution deal they don't bring any money at the table and let us keep full creative control over our game.\nLore Items.  When we created the world of Tr\u00fcberbrook, it's characters and places, we always came up with little backstories for each and every detail. We always thought it would be wonderful and quite enriching to dive into the game if we had the chance to put all these little backstories right into the game. With this stretch goal, we'll fill the world with many little pieces that are basically not important to finish the game, but will give you a better immersion, like newspapers, posters, notes, TV shows, inscriptions, smalltalk dialogue parts and more! We hope you like this goal as much as we do, as it will make the game just more detailed.\nHandmade Soundscape. This is something we always wanted to do! We think our handmade environments deserve an equally handmade soundscape. This includes making foley sound effects in the studio as well as field recordings. This stretch goal is also aiming at making the game just better.\nNew Chapter: The Prologue. This is a big one. We came up with this some time ago and are still looking forward to this: The prologue, a whole new chapter of the game that was already written along with the main story, but didn't make it into the final concept due to financial restrictions. We would still like to add this missing piece to the game somehow. If we reach this stretch goal, we'll create this all new chapter, including new handmade miniature sceneries and new characters, giving you the opportunity to explore a new facette of the storyline. We'll release the prologue exclusively as a stand-alone mini-episode for all our backers first \u2013 though it may be available for regular buyers at some later point after the release.\nNew Chapter: The Interlude. Another new chapter with even more content and more puzzles. We can't talk about the content without spoiling it, but to give you an idea, the interlude will explore a stranger and more bizarre part of the plot, another twist, another turn, a detour, a pocket in subspace that needs to be rediscovered, a new little story to be experienced.\nMaking-of Video. As already mentioned in the comments, we've stored tons and tons of filmed material on our harddrives. These were originally recorded to be used for the Kickstarter video, which shows but a small fraction of all the stuff we did. We would love to put together a long hands-on making-of video that mainly concentrates on the model making process, spending time with the set designers in the workshop, showing the lighting and camera work and the magical process of photogrammetry. It's going to be techy and nerdy in the raw!\nDeveloper's Audio Commentary: Be it by the set designers, the digital artists, the sound designer or the director \u2013 there's an abundance of stories to tell about every little detail in our world as we've spent a lot of time fleshing everything out. The developer's audio commentary (can be switched on and off inside the game menu) will give you the opportunity to take a surreal and wild ride on our train of thought.

Reseached and written by ambitious Tr\u00fcberbrookian journalists, the Tribune provides you with the freshest news and most interesting snippets of world lore, interwoven with the town\u2019s rich history, even forboding events that might eventually be happening in the game.\nClick to enlarge and dive deep into the Tr\u00fcberbrookian world lore!\n  The Tribune is released as a single-image snapshot on a semi-regular basis and available both in English and German.\nClick to enlarge and find some hints to events happening in the game!\n  The following character designs and much more stuff will be featured in our art book:\nTannhauser, the American physicist\n  Gretchen Lemke, paleoanthropologist\n  Lazarus Taft, enigmatic inventor\n  Trude, inkeeper at the guesthouse Waldeslust\n  Dr. von Streck & Dr. R\u00f6mmler\n  Leni, the \"weird kid\" from Tr\u00fcberbrook Elementary\n  The Baron of S\u00fclz, a veteran of two wars\n  The alpinist\n  Sweetwater Lars, a sailorman with fear of open waters\n  Lessing, tin foil hat\n  Madonna L\u00fcbke, weatherwoman\n  Penelope Hades I\n  Penelope Hades II\n  Penelope Hades III\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you're new to Kickstarter: You can support our game by selecting one of the rewards we prepared for you. If we reach our funding goal of 80.000 \u20ac, you enable us to develop the game from start to finish in every detail according to our vision. The amount of money you want to spend will only be collected if we reach our goal and you will receive your rewards once the game is released. If we fail to reach our goal though, your account won't be charged at all.\n\nThanks to a funding by the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg and our own crossfinancing through other projects, we were able to already finish a huge part of the game. Some of the most crucial phases lie behind us, like finishing the script, the dialogues and the game design. We've also built the first half of the scenery models and checked out the best workflows for our photogrammetry process. Also, all of the character designs are finished and some of them already modeled, rigged and extensively tested within the scenes. So there's is a good vertical slice \u2013 much more than a reliable and strong proof of concept. This was important to us before we even considered to do a Kickstarter, so we could show you a meaningful status of the project. In the months ahead, we want to finish and assemble all the missing parts and pieces according to a carefully fleshed out production plan.\n\nOf course, there can (and most likely will) always be surprises and challenges in the upcoming development. Bad examples: key team members might get ill or the office burns to the ground. Good examples: key team members are having a baby or win a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the moon. No matter what, we are determined to finish the project right on time and as soon as possible!\n\n\u201cNintendo Switch\u201d is a trademark of Nintendo. \u201cPlayStation\u201d is a registered trademark of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. \u201cPS4\u201d is a trademark of the same company.

I always had a fascination with these strange quirks of nature and thought it would be cool to do a range of them in miniature form.\nThe miniatures were sculpted by Radmir Achmentov. A very talented sculptor from Russia. I think he captured the essence of the characters very well and did a really good job! \nWe actually had commissioned them a pretty long time ago but they only arrived just recently due to some odd circumstances. Maybe the nature of the subject had something to do with that. But I'm happy that they are finally here and I can present them to you!\nWe have five (six including the Little Princess) different characters on offer in this campaign and if we do really well then I really hope we get to delve further into the subject matter and get many more Freaks done. I know that I have at least 20 more of them in mind so hopefully those might happen at some point also!\nThis campaign is pretty straightforward and small. I tried to stay as low as possible with the pricing of the miniatures. Hopefully you'll agree.\nAs said before we have five (six if you count the Giant & the Little Princess as two) miniatures on offer in this campaign. I've tried to take good pictures of them but the original sculpts proved quite difficult to photograph well due to the dark polymer clays that have been used. That's why I've also made some short video clips of them all which show them in all their glory. You can see these videos at the bottom of the page. I expect that the resin castings will be very smooth and even better looking as they always do.\nOnto the stars of the show!\nThe Ringmaster\nThe Bearded Lady \n Two-heads the musician\n The Giant & the Little Princess\n The Mighty Imp\nFor better views of the miniatures please scroll down for the videos. They show the sculpts quite well but are a bit big! :P\nThe sizes of each individual miniature are; (from bottom to top)\nRingmaster  45mm\nBearded Lady 52mm\nTwo-heads 47mm (hunched over)\nGiant 70mm & Little Princess 25mm\nMighty Imp 32mm\n             Shipping information:\nShipping will be charged during the Kickstarter and costs are as follows:\nMighty Imp & Ringmaster \u20ac3,-\nBearded Lady, Two-heads, Giant & the Little Princess \u20ac4,-\nThe Freak Circus! \u20ac10,-\nPlease add \u20ac1,- for each additional miniature you pledge for! (except for the Freak Circus! pledge, \u20ac10,- will be enough no matter how many extra miniatures you get!)\nThe company who handles our shipping proved he does a good job with our last three Kickstarters and shipping in general so we have every faith we can deliver on time once again. We don't think there will be a delay in packages going out to backers but would just like to add that delays can happen. Once the shipping company has your parcels it is out of our control. However we will do everything possible again to fulfill this Kickstarter on time.\nPlease note that we are not responsible for any customs or other fees that might occur.\nCredits\nAs always there are a few people I want to thank!

However, the obvious ones to us now are:\n\n1. 3D Printing - This is now in house so we do not anticipate any problems here.\n\n2. Manufacture of miniatures - This is also now an in house operation and we have many years experience moulding and casting so do not anticipate any problems here .\n\n3. Rules - the rules are written and being typeset. They will be going to print once the Kickstarter is complete.\n\n4. Popularity - we have restricted our stretch goals to what we feel are manageable, even though our imaginations would run riot if allowed to! If the game is a success we will look to expand the model range etc after the Kickstarter is fulfilled.\n\n5. Shipping - International customers (outside of the EU) may encounter unexpected import taxes and/or delays in customs. You can contact your customs department for more information. We are aiming to use UPS, who have a stellar track record.\n\nThroughout this Kickstarter, we will make sure that you guys are communicated with to the best of our ability, to show exactly where we are and exactly where any delays are coming from and how we are tackling them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Penguin", "descp": "Thanks from us for your contribution to the war effort.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Erk", "descp": "Get a PDF of the Spitfyre: Eagles Over Branz-h\u00fbm rulebook (RRP \u00a37.50)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "Pilot", "descp": "Get the Spitfyre: Eagles Over Branz-h\u00fbm core game plus all free add-ons unlocked in the Kickstarter!

That said they still have a limited life so investigations are underway to see about switching to metal for the KS (apart from the Kondor which would be too heavy in metal).

Apparently these things have a limited shelf life (unlike metal figure moulds), something I wasn\u2019t aware of.\nOf course this means that trying to fulfil the Kickstarter is now even harder. When I said I would try and rescue it I was starting from a position of no money. I never received a penny from Hysterical so it wasn\u2019t a case I could use something from them to move things on and despite some decent sales at Crusade and Partizan, the cost of some stock we had cast for Partizan (before the moulds went kaput), the trade stands and the storage costs mean that I\u2019ve been running at an increasing loss for some time now."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Nothing to Report...", "update_content": "Hi everyone\nApologies once again for the delay in providing an update, I\u2019m not quite sure where the last couple of months have gone.\nUnfortunately nothing to report, still waiting for the bats to be printed and for the Orc Defiant fighter sculpting to be properly started.
