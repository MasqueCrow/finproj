[{"backer": "Tony Yates", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm Alec Shaw, a Seattle based musician/producer currently fundraising for my fourth solo studio project, thank you for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter campaign. This is my first time asking people publicly to help me fund my album, so it's something that is a little scary for me. I've always put everything I have into the music I make, but due to COVID-19 I'm not able to pull it off alone.\n\n2020 started with my first featured plays on KEXP Seattle, a world famous independent radio station for new artists. This shot me to new heights in my career. Within a couple weeks I was flying to LA meeting with record labels, playing industry showcases, booking festivals I've always wanted to play, getting praise from artists I've loved for years, and had a slew of sold out shows opening for incredible artists. After 5 years of working hard, playing multiple shows a week, and self-producing my albums, it felt like I was finally getting my break.\n\nAs you know, in March of 2020 everything came crashing down with the pandemic. The music industry being hit the hardest of all, and none of my dreams had been realized... YET.\n\nI finished writing the last songs on my fourth album that April, called my producer friend Andy Park (Death Cab For Cutie, Noah Gunderson, Macklemore) and between the COVID induced panic attacks got to work setting the songs to tape. With a limited budget my plan was to play all the instruments myself, and for studio time using the money I had earned producing other artists that year. It didn't take long for what started as bunch of demo quality performances of me (playing instruments I didn't necessarily excel at) to become a collection of beautifully crafted songs with vivid arrangements.\nI had friends step up and contribute to help me create what I had imagined the songs to be, friends that believed in my vision and wanted to see it come to life even when it seemed impossible. These were drummers, guitarists, string players, choir directors, studio owners, and engineers, all people that make the music community what it is. I believe this contributed to making this project develop its purpose. These six songs are all my best work.\nPhoto By: Mark Alvis. Jon Berry (Violin) Alec Shaw, Katie Kuffel (Cello), Ed Brooks (Pedal steel) Recording \"I'll Just Let You Down\" for \"Quantity\" at studio Litho\nI didn't leave any song on that I was unsure of, and because of this I'm thinking of naming the project \"Quantity\" as a testament to the thing I had to let go of during this trying time. In the past I would get caught up thinking more is better. \u201cMore money, more songs, more instruments, more shows, larger audiences.\u201d\n\nDuring this season when the hustle was taken away (or put on pause), we had to play music together purely for the joy of it again. I forgot all about the quantity and all that was left was the soul. That's the thing that matters in music in the end. That's what people connect with and what I had to connect with to create this Album.\n\nI'm in the final push. As things will be opening up soon I need to be able to offer this to you, and I can't do it without you!\nHere are the things your contribution will go towards paying:\n\n- Studio Rental / Recording Engineer\n- Producer fees\n- Paying the Musicians\n- Post Production / Mixing and Mastering\n- Photos / Album Art & Design\n- Printing CDs & Vinyl\n- Promos\n- Kickstarter Fees / Shipping\n\nThank you so much for those who have supported me this far, and a big Thank You to all those who have just started. I can't wait to make music for you again and hopefully in person soon.\n\n Here is one of the songs that is featured on the album I was able to release already!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFunding my album through Kickstarter is taking a huge risk. I need to reach my goal or I won't receive any of the money. I know there are many people who have and will support me, but due to the size of my audience and that they are mostly younger I know that I will need all the help I can get to reach my goal. I also know that 2020 was a difficult year for more than just musicians. Anyone who was impacted, who lost a job, or couldn't work is still struggling now or still recovering making it a hard time to raise money in general. My hope is to see us all together in 2021 experiencing new music with our loved ones, and not feeling afraid.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "Get the EP before it's official release!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Download of the lossless master WAV files\nDigital artwork", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital EP Download + Exclusive Demos", "descp": "Includes the EP and exclusive raw demos of songs that won't be released publicly!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Download of the lossless master WAV files\nDigital artwork\nRaw demos of songs that didn't make it on this EP", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Signed CD + Digital Download", "descp": "Get the full EP, art, and demo download plus a signed CD and personal thank you letter for supporting me!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Download of the lossless master WAV files\nDigital artwork\nRaw demos of songs that didn't make it on this EP\nSigned CD\nPersonal thank you letter", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["11 backers", "Limited (89 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Signed Vinyl + Digital DL", "descp": "There's nothing like holding an LP in your hands, reading through the liner notes, looking at all the art.

It is time to take him to the NEXT LEVEL with his very own FEATURE HORROR/COMEDY \"ONYX THE FORTUITOUS AND THE TALISMAN OF SOULS.\" \nOnyx is the brainchild of writer and performer Andrew Bowser. Through an ongoing series of viral videos spanning nearly 9 years, Onyx has permeated every corner of pop culture. The character has amassed over 300 million views online and his content has been shared by numerous celebrities and referenced in multiple hit songs. \nAs a director, Bowser has helmed numerous independent films that have had premieres at SXSW, Seattle International, and Chattanooga Film Festival. He has worked with Legendary Pictures, Warner Bros. Games, Blizzard Entertainment, Funny or Die, Chrysler, and Marvel. He has also directed horror mainstays like Barbara Crampton, Bruce Campbell, and Adrienne Barbeau. \nThis film is the culmination of Bowser's abilities as a director and Onyx's potential as a resonating comedic character. \nTHE TALISMAN OF SOULS is a horror/comedy in the vein of 80's favorites like GREMLINS and FRIGHT NIGHT. It's a throwback to an era when horror movies were equal parts absurdity and humanity. \nPoster art by Lukas Ketner\nThe story follows fledgling Satanist Marcus J. Trillbury (Onyx) as he attends a once-in-a-lifetime ritual at his idol BARTOK THE GREAT'S dark mansion. Once there, Marcus meets a group of other worshippers. As the group is led by Bartok and his assistant Farrah in a series of rituals meant to \"better them,\" it becomes clear that their intentions are more nefarious. As his new friends are losing the battle to keep their souls, a question of great destiny looms over Onyx's head: is he doomed to be a nobody or is he the only one who can defeat Bartok and save his friends from damnation?\nInspiration for \"Talisman of Souls\"\nTHE VISION BEHIND THE FILM \n ---NEW \"FILM ONLY\" REWARDS! ---\nFULL REWARDS BREAKDOWN!\nCAMPAIGN PRODUCTION CREDITS : \nMAIN TITLE DESIGN BY JUSTIN CROWELL\nMAIN TITLE THEME BY ROB AMJARV\nMAIN TITLE SOUND DESIGN BY MIKE JAMES GALLAGHER\nTITLE HEADER ILLUSTRATIONS BY CHEY EPSEJO\nThrough his many years creating content in this industry, Bowser has amassed an amazingly talented team to surround him and Onyx on this project.\nDAN ADLERSTEIN/DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY\nDan is an LA based DP who works on a wide variety of projects in television, commercials, narrative, documentary, and digital content.\nHe has worked extensively in TV, shooting for HBO, CBS, Netflix, Amazon, HULU, AppleTV, and more.  His commercial work includes campaigns for Old Spice, Kahlua, Zappos, Fox Sports, as well as many other brands. His narrative work has been featured in festivals worldwide, including Sundance and Cannes.\nDan is an alumn of Wesleyan University where he majored in Film Studies, focusing mostly on film history and theory.  He went on to earn an MFA in Cinematography at the AFI Conservatory.\nDan is a member of IATSE Local 600 and on the Industry Experience Roster as a Director of Photography. He recently shot the Netflix show \"Aunty Donna's Big Ole' House of Fun\" and Bowser's short \"Little Willy.\"\nSTUDIO ADI/SPECIAL EFFECTS\nSTUDIO ADI is a group Academy Award winning creators of special characters and character effects. Calling upon a diverse range of talents and techniques, they create prosthetic make-ups, animatronic puppets, actor duplicates, and replica animals. With over twenty-five years of professional experience, they bring \"real\" character effects to the set to interact with actors, lighting, and practical atmosphere. Studio ADI prides themselves on working with the industry's leading CGI companies to find the right balance of digital and practical effects.  They continue to provide filmmakers with realistic and economical character effects that best serve the story and the production. Their credits include films such as IT, Godzilla VS. Kong, The Predator, and The Nun.\nMATT MAHAFFEY/COMPOSER\nMatt Mahaffey is a self-described quirky musician. After having niche success with a rock band, he found out - much like Mothersbaugh and Elfman - that his ideas fit better over the course of 11-75 minutes of picture than it did in a 3-minute pop song. The Shrek universe was his first job in film/tv and it was the gift that kept on giving.  He started a composer collective with his wife, creating scores for dozens of television shows over the last decade, including \"Rise of the Ninja Turtles.\"\nHe's worked with some of the biggest names in the industry, including doing 3 years on the road with Beck and writing and performing on his Grammy-award winning album Morning Phase. He also received Gold Sales Awards for Keith Urban\u2019s Fuse and Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Lasers, among others, and Platinum Sales Awards for Vitamin C and HelloGoodbye. Matt also scored \"Little Willy\" and Bowser grew up idolizing his work in the band Self.\nMIKE JAMES GALLAGHER/SOUND DESIGNER\nMike James Gallagher is a sound designer and re-recording mixer currently living and working in Los Angeles. As a sound designer he has worked for clients like Netflix, Hulu, Marvel, Lagavulin, Pro Sound Effects, Crypt TV, and Nerdist, among others. His work has also been featured in numerous festivals including Sundance and Edinburgh International. In 2018 he created the popular sound-oriented YouTube channel INDEPTH Sound Design (https://www.youtube.com/indepthsounddesign).\nMike met Bowser at Comic Con 10 years ago and they've been collaborating ever since on projects including Monster Machine, Worm, and Little Willy. He also enjoys writing about sound for picture, most recently writing the episode \"Storytelling with Cinematic Sound Design\" for the popular YouTube channel Film Riot. Some of his latest sound design work is featured in the Netflix series, Song Exploder, which was adapted from the acclaimed podcast of the same name.\nBOWSER'S DIRECTING REEL\nLITTLE WILLY (SHORT FILM)\nTHRILL ME!

Or rather, we were. We stopped performing in 2015, after 20-ish years of circling the globe kicking out the jams in tiny clubs and massive festivals and everything in between. Like Zamfir, the Master of the Pan Flute, we have \"enchanted millions\". Maybe YOU were one of these people!** \n**Or two of these people, if you are looking over the shoulder of a co-worker or spouse. \nOur debut album came out in 1995, first on a tiny Seattle label called Pop Llama, then some <action-packed> months later on COLUMBIA RECORDS. At some point early in the process, we did a sub-license <----(music business term!) with a small Spanish label for vinyl, and they made a few copies.  They continue to be battled over to this day. See below ......\nI'm being told there may have been a Dutch version as well? Maybe a bootleg? Who knows ANYHOOOOO there aren't very many out there is what I'm trying to tell you! \nYikes $185! Yikes BAD COVER!\n Great question!  \n1995 was a time when vinyl seemed like a format whose days were numbered. Because OMG COMPACT DISCS! We stayed very busy circling the globe and kicking out the jams and selling gajillions of these \"CDs.\" Here are some of the concepts we may have lost track of during this turbulent time:\nclean laundry\ntime zones\noccasionally eating salad \nreleasing our album on vinyl \nIt wasn't until years later when INTERNET let people talk to us that we found out we had made a huge mistake\nSo here we are, coming up on its 25th birthday....BOOM VINYL PUSA! \n\nThis is a celebratory FANCY-PANTS edition, white vinyl with green and bronze marbling. There's even a poster inside that you can take right down to your local tattoo shop and say \"please put this across my back!\"**\n**do not actually do this.\nWe are post-rock-band. While we remain friends and enjoy frequent lunches together, we have no label, no management, no infrastructure, no \"team\". That's OK though! We  don't need any of that stuff!*** Thanks to INTERNET and whatnot the music is out there for anyone who wants to hear it (that's my vague understanding of INTERNET.)\nAnd (this is important) we own most of our music, including this album! So involving a label again is kind of the opposite of what we want moving forward. Kickstarter gives us the chance to bring this directly to you, and (also important) figure out how many of you are interested in having one of these hot slabs of wax!  Also: not for nothing, but our research shows that people in general like and trust Kickstarter the most out of all the crowdfunding sites!\n***except the lunches.\n\nWhat kind of a question is that.....what CAN'T you get??\nFirst, the TECHY STUFF: \nBoth formats here are from when we remastered the album in 2005 with Vlado Meller (who is a big deal in the mastering game). It's a little bit shinier than the original, and we like it a lot. So much in fact, that we could find no legit excuse to remaster it again for vinyl.*****\n Everyone gets a link to the album as either WAV or 320k mp3 files. I don't know what that means, but I'm sure they will be higher quality than listening on a streaming service, or most regular mp3 files. So that's nice. \ntl;dr the digital stuff will sound better than what you have unless you have the 10 year anniversary edition in some form already.\nAND I believe we've already mentioned there is a HOT SLAB OF WAX involved! Please take this moment to admire it again! \n*****TURNS OUT the main reason one would want to re-master specifically for vinyl has something to do with the gain levels of stuff that was originally mastered for CD yadda yada I don't know I may have fallen asleep while I wrote this sentence anyway Vlado addressed that and it sounds great so let's relax with a martini poolside\n\n And here is a handsome shirt that we thought looked nice, and you won't find it anywhere else, so I mean it seems pretty important to get one now, right? Fun fact: After the campaign we will contact you to SELECT A SIZE and we will hound you constantly until you do. Eventually we will send some gym socks and a chia pet, and you will have no-one to blame, because you did not SELECT A SIZE on the friendly survey we sent you! \nS, M, L, XL! Sorry, limited sizes!\nAnd look here: a snappy enamel pin. This is a victory lap that can be worn out and about on a hat or lapel! In case you were wondering it is 1.5 inches a side. \n\n\nSTRAIGHT UP OUR NOSES\nKIDDING. The only thing that ever went up our noses were farts on a tour bus. \nBut yeah, us! There's all the normal things that need paying for...pressing, shrink wrapping, packing, mailing etc...there are many bites taken from the apple before the applesauce phase....\nI am using the \"apple\" metaphor because apples are often used to make \"pie\" and Kickstarter even suggests using a \"pie chart\" in this section, but I donut know how to make a \"pie chart\" even though I love pie. I love all desserts, did you even notice that I said \"donut\" instead of \"do not\"?\nWe're thinking of this as a fun way to get a thing into the world that we should have done years ago, while not having to do very much of the actual work ourselves. Instead we're hiring talented people to oversee production, fulfillment, art, and our fragile tempers. Everything is being made here in the USA by independent businesses. The HOT SLABS OF WAX are being pressed in Athens, GA by Kindercore, and inserted into jackets from LA's Stoughton Printing. The handsome shirts will be screened by Ruby Sue Graphics, likewise in Athens. \nHere is some info about our fulfillment partner:\nthey are called Fulfillment Merch, and they have a website.\nthey are very good at shipping vinyl.\nthey use vinyl-specific packaging made from recycled materials, which is nice.\npeople seem to like them! \nholy cow they are ALSO in Athens, GA....this must be some coincidence!\n\n\nSeriously, fam.....\nWe have been so lucky to be able to play music in your earholes and your hometowns and your cars for 20-ish years. YOU made it happen, and we have been humbled and honored by your continued interest and dare I say passion for our particular silly brand of rock and roll music. We hope this particular WAX piece of the big puzzle gives some of you more joy. You gotta love everybody...!\nXO PUSA", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRather than separating risks and challenges, let me talk a little about what I'm calling: GENERAL ANXIETIES.\n\nUGH shipping costs. I wish these were less! We've spent considerable energy making sure the numbers are correct territory by territory. There's some info on our fulfillment partner somewhere up there in the main story!\n\nTIMELINES: Everything should go smoothly and we'll be getting stuff into your actual hands by the middle of April (after this campaign runs for four weeks). We've got good people helping us in all aspects of production and fulfillment, so please oh please let it all go smoothly!\n\nALSO....we're not touring, because we're not touring, sorry!

My name is Harald Geisler. I am a typographer specialised in handwriting fonts. Here on Kickstarter I created fonts based on Albert Einstein's and Sigmund Freud's handwriting. Now, with approval of the King Estate in Atlanta, I would like to continue the series and create a font based on Martin Luther King jr.'s handwriting.\nWhat does Dr. King's handwriting look like?\nThe civil rights activist and minister's speeches and actions resonated around the world and continue to inspire generations today. We all know what his voice sounds like, but as a typographer I became curious: how did he prepare his speeches and organised his thoughts in writing, and what does Dr. King's handwriting look like?  \nOn your computer or smartphone fonts are the \u201csoftware\u201d that make text (letters, punctuation, numbers, etc.) appear on your screen: \nIn programmes like Word, Pages or Open Office you can choose different fonts to write in. Common fonts are Times, Arial, Helvetica and if this project is successful (fingers crossed): soon the Martin Luther King font.\nEverywhere you work with text, you can use the font. Here is an example of how to use handwriting fonts to create a paper: \nSupport this campaign and you can soon use Martin Luther King's handwriting with your projects: college papers \u2014 surprise your teacher with a paper about Martin Luther King in his handwriting, student assignments \u2014 surprise your students with a test \"handwritten\" by Dr. King, holiday-cards, invitations, hand-outs, a personal recipe book, tattoos, cover art for your new album,  email-art, titles for a video project, online-art or a cover for your book\u2026 \nHere you see the current state of the Martin Luther King font prototype:  \nThe font will work with your computer (PC, Mac, Linux) and phone or tablet (Android, iPhone, iPad). First time you install a font? Have a look at this Helpful Font Guide - PDF on how to use and install fonts \u2192here.\nWhat will the Martin Luther King font be based on? \nMy aim with these handwriting projects is to open a door to the content of an author through the aesthetic of handwriting and the general interest for typography and fonts, and with that to create awareness for the cultural activity of writing and to imagine a creative vision for the future of writing in the 21st and 22nd century.\nAs a typographer I search for meaningful ways to relate to writing. The available styles of typefaces are often copies or versions of another with little variation.  I believe that writing today needs new ways to relate and adequately express oneself. I hope that the Martin Luther King font will become a meaningful addition to your writing. \nPractically creating a handwriting font requires samples of every (lower- and uppercase) letter of the alphabet. I select a variety of manuscripts that are representative of the author's hand and are interesting and relevant to give an insight to the author's body of work and time. Like this here: \nDr. King's notes regarding Hegel's Philosophy (ca. 1952 / 1953). From the King Library and Archives, Atlanta.\nThe cards you see above are Dr. King's study notes about Hegel's philosophy while he studied at Boston University, they can be found in the King Library and Archives in Atlanta or the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University. While creating the font I will share with you background information about the manuscripts used in the creation, why they are important and where to find them.\nTo complete this art project, 27,059\u20ac are needed (find budget details below). The way Kickstarter works is that you can pledge for this project. In return for your peldge and to encourage you to support this project, I am offering you rewards. For example other handwriting fonts that I created here on Kickstarter or a poster, in return for your pledge. You can also make a donation if you just want to support this project, this can be done by pledging and choosing \"no reward\" or by simply pledging a bit more than your chosen reward tier. Donations are great, because I do not have to pay taxes on them. \nEither way: If this project does not reach its funding goal until the end of the campaign (25. October 2019), I will not be able to complete the Martin Luther King font and all pledges will automatically be transferred back to the backers.\nMy wish is that this project gets into the hands of as many interested people as possible. I do not want to exclude anyone for financial reasons, that is why I keep the entry reward as low as possible at 1 Euro. If you wish to support this project with more I have created some very interesting rewards below.\nThe \"Personal Typography Coach\" reward is very dear to me, because it is about more than sharing the font, it is about enabling you to use the font in the way you want to. \nThink of it as booking a session with your personal typography coach. There is something you like to do with the font, but you don\u2019t know yet how to do it. Harald will help you personally! May it be a leaflet, school paper, holiday card, instagram series or tattoo \u2014 First I will listen to what you are aiming to do and we talk about your project through a 30 minute Skype, phone or email conversation. From there I\u2019ll create a step-by-step tutorial based on your skill level (novices are welcome), software and device you use. I will improve the guide based on your feedback and share the tutorial with all backers.\nAll projects are welcome: you\u2019re working on a paper about Dr. King, a student assignment, you like to use the font in your Newsletter or email, create hand-outs, holiday-cards, a recipe book or album cover. This may be a general question like: how do I get the font on a t-shirt? or about fine tuning the drop shadow on the cover art for you latest album\u2026\n\u2014 All questions are welcome.\n\n50/100/150/200\u20ac @work commercial licence \u2022 Receive the Martin Luther King Font(50\u20ac) and additional Fonts(100/150/200\u20ac) to use at work in a commercial context (e.g. Design Studio, Advertising Agency, Newspaper, etc.) on PC, Mac, Linux, iPhone and iPad.\n\u20ac800 Presentation + Q&A // \u20ac1,500 Workshop with Harald Geisler \u2022 These rewards are for individuals, groups or universities and schools interested in typography, font making, crowdfunding, handwriting and everything that relates to this project or typography in general. A presentation will be with Q&A session about the project. The workshop will take either two or four days. Schedule, topic and details to be discussed. I will travel everywhere, but additionally you will have to cover traveling costs (flight, train and hotel) from Frankfurt, Germany. \nYour contribution will make the Martin Luther King font better and will go directly to everybody who receives the font. Your generous support will allow me to add one additional alphabet to the font \u2014 which makes its appearance more complex and one alphabet closer to the original.\nI can not thank you with a physically equivalent reward but you will be credited accordingly and feel free to pick from all the rewards above. \nYou have a question about the rewards \u2014 simply reach out to me through Kickstarter or my website. I am happy to help you. \nBelow you will find additional information to answer common questions about the project. If you have a question that is not answered below, feel free to contact me through Kickstarter or reach out in the comment-section of the project, I am happy to hear from you.\nOverview:\nThe ABC of how a \"handwriting\"-font is made.\nHow can a font look like beautiful handwriting? \nImprovising the @ sign\nInspiration - (History of the project) \nTimeline - When will the font be ready?\nBudgeting \u2022 How will the funding be used?\nKickstarter References\nPress\nTechnicalities: Font specifications \nCredits\nI  created multiple handwriting projects, for example the Sigmund Freud Typeface, based on Freud's handwriting, the Albert Einstein Font and Martin Luther Font. With each project I refine my process and everything I learn benefits the next project. Let me walk you through the basic steps of my process:\nA. Understanding Movement \u2014 Every writer has their own way of moving on paper, which can be described with characteristic angles. For example the angle at which one letter connects to the next \u2014 not all letters connect at the same angle, but there is an average. In the picture below the blue guides show the average \"connecting\"-angle of Dr. King's handwriting:\nB. Recreating Movement \u2014 For each letter I recreate the movement path that was used to draw the letter on paper. This movement-path uses the characteristic angles (i.e. connecting, ascending and descending angle) to describe the movement and is stored as a vector in the design software: \nC. Adding contrast to the letter \u2014 The movement-path is then modified to render the ink flow of the used writing tool. In this case a pen that creates thick down strokes and a slightly thinner upstroke. This digital form is then stored in the Font file, which is a rather technical process. If you wish to read more about it, I have written an in-depth article \u2192here.\nThe example above already shows characteristics of Dr. King's handwriting. Analysing how a writer makes the bow of an \u201cl\u201d or the slope of a \u201cg\u201d also affects ones own handwriting and has surprising side-effects. During past projects I found myself suddenly writing my grocery lists with Einsteinian (or Freudian) loops and hoops. \nHandwriting has a vivid character because one never writes the same letter twice. When I type the word 'look' in a regular font, the two 'o' look the same. \nIn the preparation of creating a handwriting font I look at all kind of documents, and mark certain letters that I find are typical for the writers' hand. In the example below you see a selection of lowercase \"d\" \u2014 notice how they are similar but also different in the beginning, middle and ending of a word: \nCapturing one version of each letter in the beginning, middle and end of a word is not enough: I create multiple versions of each letter that are stored in the font-file. The font is then programmed to exchange the different versions as you type. This way each word will appear different, depending on its position on the page. The more letter-sets I draw into the font, the closer it gets to  handwriting. I call this method polyalphabetic substitution. \nThe most complex font I made so far is the Albert Einstein Font. It holds five versions of each letter (Set 1-5) and different weights. Here you see comparisons of the font with original samples of Einstein writing \"Allgemeine Relativit\u00e4tstheorie\" (German for \"General Theory of Relativity\"):\nI mentioned that \"everything I learn benefits the next project\". One aspect I was not able to fully address in Freud nor the Einstein font, but is already implemented in the current state of the Mart Luther King font prototype. In handwriting a lowercase letter can look different in the beginning, middle or end of a word, which means this font should reflect that with additional lowercase letterforms (a in the beginning of a word, a in the middle, a at the end, b in the beginning, b\u2026 vs. just a, b, c, \u2026 ).  \nThis may sound like a small detail, but accordingly the Martin Luther King font will have triple the amount of lowercase - letters to be drawn per variation\u2026 a lot more work! But I am convinced the result will be worth the effort. The plan for the font is to add 3 variations per Letter (lower-case, uppercase, initial and final case too!). This is the minimum to bring the appearance of the font on the margin to handwriting. The more funding the campaign gets, the more variations per letter I can add to the final font \u2014 making the final result better for all backers!\nFor me it is important to not scan the image of letters, nor simply to trace them with an automated software. By focusing on movement and creating in this analog-digital way, I become familiar with the hand of a writer by re-writing characteristic letters. Learning the movement that a writer made to create a letter is essential to creating its digital counterpart. \nBecome familiar, study, reproduce and learn the original movement is essential when it comes to creating signs that were uncommon at Dr. King's time. For example one will hardly find an @ sign nor the letter combination www in his notes. After digitising all available letters, I use the collected knowledge about a writers movement to create a profund improvisation; for example the @-sign can be seen as the movement of a lowercase \"a\" connected with the bow of a parenthesis. \nThis is an excerpt of my creation process, \u2192here you can find an in-depth article about my process written in 2014.\nKickstarter campaigns have Stretch-goals, so that backers get animated to support the campaign further than its funding goal. This project is very dear to me and it is important for me to make it happen as I lay it out in this description. However this project is calculated on shoestring budget, in which many days and weeks that I already put in this project are not accounted. From past campaigns I know that the benefit of a higher funding is not that easy to calculate. For example in the rewards I say that if one person pledges 8500\u20ac I will add one more alphabet to the font. This means that I would have 8500\u20ac to spend solely on working on the font,  with little to none production of a physical good, handling, packaging by hand or shipping involved. The same amount coming from 100 or 1000 backers would involve additional accounting, shipping, handling, etc., which can easily add up to a huge amount of time and certainly production money.\nWith that in mind I ask myself: what would be a \"good\"stretch-goal for this project? What makes the font better for all backers? Answer: the more variations are stored in the font the closer it comes to actual handwriting. For each additional 15.000\u20ac I can add an additional alphabet in a comfortable and safe way \u2014 and I am offering something that I can fulfil.\nFirst I keep my fingers crossed, that the campaign reaches its goal \u2014 and then for every additional 15.000\u20ac I will add one more alphabet to the font, making it better for all backers of this project. \n2014 in the context of the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's visit to East Berlin (1964), I came upon a radio recording of a speech he gave in Marienkirche. I took a note of the introduction because of what he says about his name: \nPLAY\n\n\"I come to you not altogether as a stranger, for the name that I happen to have, is a name familiar to you, so familiar to Germany and so familiar to the world. And I am happy that my parents decided to name me after the great reformer.\"\nWhat influence is it on a person to grow up with a name linked to history? Is it a burden or is it an inspiration to carry a name? For Martin Luther King jr, I imagine this connection must have been a source of inspiration.\nWith the handwriting fonts project I am proposing a similar situation: What does it mean to write your thoughts and ideas with the \"hand\" of Dr. King, Luther, Einstein or Freud? Is the author lurking over your shoulder as you write or are you dictating, is the font a disguise or mask to hide behind, is it a role to switch into and to see and act as if you were, is it a challenging discussion on paper or an uplifting empowering writing together? I hope that these projects enrich your daily reading and writing experience and serve as a source of inspiration and a playful encounter with history.\nBack in 2014 listening to the radio feature, I wrote Martin Luther King (1929-1968) on a board in my studio. A friend saw it and suggested then that I should create a Martin Luther (1483-1546) font first. I launched a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2017, the 500th aniversary of the reformation. In the Luther project description you can read that I had planned to create the Dr. King font in 2018 commemorating the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's assassination. But Luther's half a millennia old handwriting occupied me longer than expected. After the campaign succeeded scholars from different fields (Historians, Palaeographers, Latin scholars) contributed freely to the documentation, expanding the work beyond what I had planned. These contributions gave the project new angles to the subject, which I value very much. I am curious to see how this project about Dr. King's handwriting will develop and invite you to contribute and join this journey. \n21 days after the campaign ends all Backers of the campaign will receive access to the current state of the font AND digital rewards. The final font will be available to all backers in February 2020. Before that all backers will receive updated versions of the font as I am working on it. You will be able to give feedback to the font as I am developing it, which will make the final font better. Physical rewards like Posters will be send out by February 2020.

Simply rotate the rings to open and close its captivating aperture mechanism. Iris will inspire you with every stroke of your pencil. \nIris is our second Kickstarter. We at Makers Cabinet are experts in drawing and writing implements and the designers of the H\u00f8vel pencil plane. \n\n At Makers Cabinet, we believe that drawing and writing tools should guide the path towards creativity rather than limit its potential. Instead of being a burdening generic tool the Iris is intuitive and unique. \nWe aim to inspire everybody that uses the Iris with a sense of satisfaction. Its mesmerising mechanism sparks delight in everyone that sees it open and close. We believe that the Iris helps rejuvenate the flow of creativity at moments of mental block. \nThe scalable Iris drawing tool.\n The concept of the Iris came from conversations with our Kickstarter Community. Our supporters said that circle drawing tools lacked innovation and were difficult to use. These tools were unreliable and short-lived. So, we set out to completely redesign the circle drawing tool.\nAs amateur photographers, we noticed that camera apertures were reliable mechanisms and were surprised that they had not yet been developed for other purposes. In response to this observation, we designed an instrument that brings the quality of the camera aperture to your desk.\nThe mechanism of the camera aperture has endured 200 years of photographic history. Owing to this resilience, the Iris is the perfect replacement to the inadequate rotary drawing compass. \n\nRotary compasses are:\nDifficult to hold\nUseless without a ruler\nRestricted to certain mark-making tools\nImmortalised by the holes in our pages\nIris is:\nEasy to use\nCompatible with any mark-making tool\nAn accurate measuring instrument\nSeamless on your page\n\n At Makers Cabinet, we strive to create objects with a guarantee of longevity and durability. Iris is the product of this ethos. \nIris is engineered using the most durable and effective materials. Its rings are machined from solid brass that patinas, improving with time and use. The leaves are resistant to ink and graphite as they are stamped from carefully selected stainless spring steel that retains its shape. The Iris houses twenty intricately designed leaves that enable you to create accurate circles with every stroke of your pencil.\nThe Iris is a reliable measuring instrument. In conversations with our users, we were inspired to add a scale along the side of the circle aperture. This allows you to effortlessly draw circles and measure diameters. The scale is marked with a high fidelity laser etching that denotes accuracy down to a millimetre. \nReminiscent of a camera\u2019s aperture enclosure, its scale is marked with a red dot. This allows you to read the diameter of your circle without the impediment of any other tool. Below the Iris\u2019 leaves sits a natural rubber footprint that seamlessly grips to your page. This means that all your focus can be on the circles you are drawing and not the instrument that you are using.\nEvery Iris purchased in the Kickstarter comes with a wooden base. \nOur first wooden base prototype was intended to simply support the Iris on your desk. However, at Makers Cabinet, we design every tool with the intention to be both beautiful and functional.  \nAccordingly, our updated base locates the centre-point of a circle. To achieve this, simply lay the Iris flat on your surface and place the base against the inside of the aperture. This added feature enables you to take your drawings to the next level. \n\nIn 2017 we launched our first Kickstarter for the H\u00f8vel pencil plane. H\u00f8vel is a completely redesigned pencil sharpener which planes your pencil to a perfectly crafted point reminiscent of woodblock planes.\nSince we launched the Kickstarter, the H\u00f8vel has won a Stationery Award, has been stocked in 20 stores worldwide and galvanised our business. Get a H\u00f8vel at a reduced rate by backing the Iris here today.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe design is complete, with our initial prototypes completed and Iris is almost ready to go into production.

In the summer of 2013, armed with an idea, prototypes and a few supplier quotes we made a heart-felt appeal to this community right here, to fund our idea and help us create a new toy company.  Your trust and generosity, with some steadfast determination and relentless work on our part made for a successful mix.  \nIt has now been six years, eight campaigns and we can finally legitimately say that we made an impact in the design toy space continuum.  There has been press, we are present in stores in 46 countries but we still come back home, right here on Kickstarter where we first started.   \nTruly, accurately, we couldn\u2019t have done it without you.   \nAnd we\u2019re going to keep going:  we made a pledge that you will be the first to know when we have fresh ideas and new product.  Are you ready for the next one? \nOur 2018 Candycars campaign and post-campaign sales were met with unmitigated success; we fulfilled our campaign pledge in a record 45 days, and every single backer that supported us was able to proudly beam about a brand new toy - the result of a novel way of making toy cars:  combining a diecast base with a cute, simple painted wooden body.  They roll like the wind, have a solid heft and won\u2019t be around for 10,000 years like their plastic cousins.  We consider that a plus.  \nFor this next round, we\u2019ll crank up the cuteness and playability:  we picked lovable food trucks and other vans full of personality, added a beefed-up wheel design of our own, and came up with a few squishy toppers, for a new tactile sensation.   \n*drum roll* \nIf you don't like tacos, this truck is nacho type.\nOur taco truck was inspired by the trailblazing spirit of the very first food trucks. Designed with true SoCal vibes in mind, it has fun and fiesty coats of paint, some spanking orange wheels, and a terrific taco up top.\nDo-nut be alarmed. \nYou're supposed to be this amazed -- it's impossible to glaze over this beauty. Already a crowd favorite, our donut van made its instagram debut back in March and has been garnering drools ever since with that striking hot pink topper.\u202f \nNow\u2019s the time to seal the deal and make sure you get one reserved! \nNothing says NYC like a hot dog stand.\nAs New Yorkers, we must pay tribute to the hot dog \u2013 it's the quintessential New York street food. Our hot dog truck is a minimalist, design-focused, vehicular interpretation of the hot dog stand with a mustard-yellow top and a perfectly toasted base.  Don't worry, we skipped the dirty water.\nChicago-dog fanatics, get outta \u2018ere. \nSoft-serving up good looks.\nAs far as a symbol of simpler times and a carefree way to stuff sugar and calories in your childhood, you can\u2019t beat the ice cream truck.  We popped a melty top, added a bright pink base, sprinkled a pun, and voila! Iconic toy made. No ice cream truck jingle \u2013 you\u2019re welcome. \nWe don\u2019t know how to put this, but our news van is kind of a big deal. \nBrought to you by the broadcast division of Candylab Media, it possesses an inquisitive personality.  It will magically appear wherever your other Candycars get mixed up in news worthy happenings. On the practical side of things, the dish is real stamped steel, and may have some actual tiny radio reception abilities.\n\nGeared up and overflowing with cool.\nOur S.W.A.T. van stops crime in its tracks. Rolling around and chasing bad guys all while looking like an absolute stunner, our S.W.A.T. (Sweet Wheels And Tires) van gives the phrase \"action-packed\" a whole new meaning.\nGot (a) coin? They\u2019ll take good care of it.\nDon't be fooled by its small stature, our armored van is tough and hardy \u2013 the perfect guardian for all sorts of goodies. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the crew!  We created 7 distinct designs and personalities, each with a stunning box, sure to impress children (and adults) way too accustomed to disposable blister packaging.  Scope this out before we move on to the reward levels! \nThe specs on this new line are the same as you've come to expect from us: Well-made, custom parts, all wrapped in our environmentally friendly formula: solid European beech, water based paint and a durable diecast metal base.  It is all engineered in-house by a new generation of toy designers and product developers who all share a drive to make a better toy. \nWe agonized over the donut/ice cream /taco /hot dog designs and tooling so the resulting parts are friendly to a child\u2019s touch, squishy and soft, but hard enough to be used as a handle and rougher play.   \nEst. Delivery Sept 2019\nWant Multiple Rewards? This go-around we will  be working through Backerkit post-campaign. That being said, if you are interested in more than one reward please add the cost of the two rewards as well as shipping costs and pledge for that total. Then post-campaign you will enter Backerkit with a credit in which you can apply it to various rewards.

We know, it's really expensive for you international folks. We strictly charge what postage actually costs and pay for warehousing, shipping cartons, labeling and on from the general overhead remaining. That is what carriers charge these days. \nAll international shipments are subject to duties, taxes and clearing fees which you are responsible for paying - your pledges are without sales-tax or VAT. All Kickstarter rewards will be considered gifts, however, most countries will assess duties/taxes and in certain countries the carrier will pre-pay the duties and taxes and bill you later. If you refuse delivery, your package will be abandoned. Once abandoned, we can\u2019t ship another package to you or issue a refund. Filling out your shipping address correctly is very important. A wrong address and package sent back will incur shipping charges back to USA on our account. A wrong address and package sent back will incur shipping charges back to USA on our account. If your parcel sits unclaimed and / or you have not answered our increasingly alarmed emails, there is a chance it will be sent back, or abandoned at destination.

Thanks to you we\u2019re funded and Brooklyn is getting a new arcade bar! We can\u2019t wait to have all of you at Wonderville!\nNow the fun stuff! If we clear our goal by an additional $15,000 ($85,000 total), we\u2019ll celebrate by building a two-player PICO-8 arcade machine. It will be hand-made and painted by a local artist!\nFor those not familiar with it, PICO-8 is a fantasy, retro console in the style of the Commodore 64. It\u2019s a lot of fun to make small games in, and a lot of our community has done just that! With this arcade we\u2019ll be able to rotate what\u2019s on display, showcasing different locally-made PICO-8 games in all of their 128x128 glory! \nIf we clear our goal by $30,00 ($100,000 total), we'll be redoing the backyard to make it look amazing. Secret Project Robot has a great outdoor space, and with a little love we can get it (and the cabana!) looking better than ever!\nWonderville will be a brand new arcade, event space and bar in Brooklyn specializing in independent video games, created by a growing and vibrant community of game developers in New York City and beyond. \nWe're not talking about retro arcade games from the 80s and 90s or just arcade versions of mobile games; these games are brand new, unique and ridiculously original experiences created by designers and artists today. Ever played games using only LED strips? Or door stops? Or juicers? At Wonderville you will! \nUp to this point, these games have only shown up at festivals and short-term pop-ups as physical installations meant to be played by a group of people in a public space, and then they disappear. But no more! Wonderville will house independent games as a permanent home for these modern treasures. The space will also host tournaments, playtest nights, board games, comedy, live music and rotating art installations and exhibits.\nWe have an amazing opportunity to inherit one of our favorite spaces, and transform it into a new celebration of independent games and interactive art, but we need your support to make it happen. Join us, and help make this venture a reality, and you can also receive amazing Kickstarter exclusive games, art and handmade arcade cabinets from independent game developers and artists!\nWe've got a lot of great game developers on board who are volunteering to make an exclusive game for this campaign! And we're combining it all to create:\nAt $20 ($15 for the limited EARLY BIRD), you'll get new games from some of the most innovative video game developers working today! A slew of devs are donating a brand new, exclusive game for the WONDERBUNDLE! This is an exclusive collection that you'll only find as part of this Kickstarter and nowhere else! \nYou'll get 10+ new games by:\n BumbleBear Games (Killer Queen)\n Ramiro Corbetta (Hokra/Sports Friends)\n snowhydra games (Zarvot)\n Robert Yang + Eddie Cameron (Radiator 2 & Queer Space)\n Catt Small  (Breakup Squad)\n Stephen Clark (Witch Ball)\n Fernando Ramallo (PANORAMICAL)\n Nick Fortugno (Diner Dash)\n Ayla Myers (Just One Boss)\n Ramsey Nasser (Dialog 3-D)\n Andy Wallace (PARTICLE MACE)\n Nick Santaniello (VOLLEYGON)\n Paolo Pedercini/Molleindustria (Every Day the Same Dream)\nMany of these games are being made especially for this event and none of them have been released anywhere else! These game makers have agreed to have these games be completely exclusive to this backer reward for one year after delivery (some time before September), so this is your chance to play them anytime soon!\n\nFor the past few years, we've been selling DBA Arcade Snackpack volumes filled with assorted games from the developers in our collective. For $40, you'll get the Wonderbundle, as well as both Snackpacks, with modern classics such as PARTICLE MACE, VOLLEYGON, Slam City Oracles, POWERBOAT Italia '88 and more! That's 20+ games and art from DBA Arcade to you!\n\nFor $45 you'll get an exclusive T-shirt ONLY available through the Kickstarter campaign. There are three designs by artists Marlowe Dobbe, Preston Spurlock, and Tim Fite. These will be available in all sizes and in both straight and fitted cuts! Pledge three times to score all three Kickstarter exclusive designs! Then come visit us at Wonderville in your shirt and prepare for lots and lots of high fives and nods of admiration.\n\nPin your indie arcade pride on your chest (or backpack, hat or your dog's collar) with a set of four premium custom designed limited edition enamel pins featuring Wonderville and other arcade designs. For $60 you'll get both games bundles, plus this set of exclusive Wonderville enamel pins designed by Chris Hernandez. Dreamboxx and Videofreak will use glitter enamel for their reflective and shiny bits, and Dreamboxxx will also be rainbow plated metal. These are limited edition, and will only be available through the Kickstarter campaign!\n\n\n\nAlt.Ctrl Workshop hosted by Death By Audio Arcade and Brooklyn Research\nOn the weekends at Wonderville, we plan to host classes and workshops taught by game design instructors, fabricators, and designers from the community in Brooklyn and beyond. Pledge to one of our workshop tiers and you can choose to learn about game design in Unity, physical computing with Arduino, modular synthesizer design and/or animations in Processing. A laptop is the only required material for the workshops, no need to have any existing knowledge to take part, we'll get you all set! \nIf you select one of these tiers, we'll coordinate to host the class on a date that works best for all students. If you cannot attend for some reason, we will give you a voucher for a future Wonderville class.\nFor our top tiers, we'll send you a custom-made bartop arcade cabinet or a full size arcade cabinet that includes all of the games in our collection: PARTICLE MACE, VOLLEYGON, KungFu Kickball, Slam City Oracles, Nothing Good Can Come of This, Powerboat Italia '88, F\u00fatbol Forever and Crystal Brawl. \nWe've built over 25 custom cabinets and we're confident these will be the best yet! The marquee and side art will be custom-painted by an artist from New York City - each one will be unique - and we can ship via freight anywhere in the lower 48 states. \nThrough our five years on the road, Death By Audio Arcade has been showcased at many venues and festivals. Here's a small sampling of the press we've received during that time:\n\nKotaku: Meet The Guy Making Arcade Cabinets For Indie Games\nWall Street Journal: Nostalgic for the Atari-Era Arcade? Millennial Gamers Are Reinventing It\nGothamist : Step Into the Dreamhouse, Where DIY Arcade Games Meet Queer Culture\nBedford+Bowery : An Indie Game Arcade Has Opened at Elsewhere\nThe Fader: Meet Mark Kleback, The Technologist Bringing Old-School Arcade Games Into The Future\nWonderville, the brainchild of Mark Kleback, was born out of his work as a creative technologist and founder of Death By Audio Arcade.\nDeath By Audio Arcade is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in New York City, founded in 2013 in the back of the punk warehouse, Death By Audio, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In addition to a music venue, Death By Audio was a loft space occupied by Mark and 12 other artists, musicians and DIY-enthusiasts. With access to a wood shop, Mark built his first arcade cabinet and started reaching out to local game developers to find games for his handmade arcade builds. Since independent musicians had dedicated spaces to showcase their art, why not indie game devs? \nWonderville builds on the foundation of Death By Audio Arcade, which collaborates with game developers and teaches them how to cut and paint wood, solder electronics and assemble physical installations for video games. Most game designers are used to making games to be played at home on a computer, but by showing games in public spaces, these designers also learn how to make great social arcade games. \nWe also host talks and panels and invite local artists to showcase games at public events. Since 2013, we've built over 20 custom arcade cabinets and we've been featured at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, MAGFest, World Maker Faire New York, South By Southwest, PlayNYC and Low-Level Festival. We've been a transformative organization for people looking to learn more about doing hands-on projects in an increasingly digital world.\nDeath By Audio Arcade at Elsewhere\nWhen Death By Audio closed in 2014, Death By Audio Arcade was left homeless and shifted focus to partnerships with other local New York venues for months at a time. Over the past five years, we've had residencies at Elsewhere, Superchief Gallery,  Babycastles, Caveat, Our Wicked Lady, Flattopps, Flux Factory, Silent Barn, Dreamhouse, H0L0, Brooklyn Research, Flowers For All Occasions, and Secret Project Robot.\nStephanie Gross is co-founder of Wonderville and has a decades long history of helping artists and organizations become non-profits and leverage their talents to achieve their dreams. As a NY city employee, Stephanie is a valuable resource for former residents of the DIY underground art world looking to navigate the bureaucracy of licenses, permits, and city departments. \nNew Year's Eve 2010\nSteph and Mark met at a show in 2010 at Death By Audio, one of her first clients. They're now engaged to be married later this year! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8d\u2728\n In late 2018, Rachel Nelson and Erik Zajaceskowski, the owners of Secret Project Robot, approached Mark and Stephanie about taking over their space. Secret Project Robot has been an artist-run venue in New York City for over fifteen years, hosting art installations, performance art, live music and community meetings. The opportunity was too good to be true. Not only would this space provide a home for the nomadic Death By Audio Arcade collection, but it would be a hub for the entire New York City indie game community. Not to mention it's 100% legal with a bar and liquor license!\n With your pledge, we'll have the funds to buy the business, with all of the necessary permits, licenses, inventory, and machinery. There are eight years remaining on the lease, and with your help, we'll be able to start with enough capital to run for the first 6-12 months. \nPaper Gardens Festival at Secret Project Robot\nAnd Wonderville isn't just for DBAA games, we have plans to collaborate with our friends in New York (and eventually the world)! While we spent time as nomads, we met a lot of like-minded developers: we've done collaborative events with Babycastles and The Sheep's Meow and continue to discuss setting up a rotating gallery space. We've shown work by Bumblebear and Videogamo and many many more. We plan to have a Killer Queen Machine, a Black Emperor machine, and a Line Wobbler. We'll work with the NYU Game Center and host playtest nights and panel discussions. On the weekends, we will host workshops based around game design, electronics, and fabrication. \nAllen Riley of Death By Audio Arcade showing video game art at Superchief Gallery\n\nWe want to make sure Wonderville is a home for everyone doing or interested in indie arcade work! \nWe'll also host live music! Secret Project Robot has an amazing stage and sound system that we plan to keep: DJs, musicians, bands, comedy shows, and other events are all on deck! We want to create a community space that bridges the gap between the games community and the wider New York arts and music community.\nWith your help, we can make all of this happen, buckle up and join us! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe rent is too damn high! It's really hard to keep a venue open in New York City. We've already been pushed out of one underground space due to rising rents, and this time we want to make sure we have enough of a savings to get it off the ground. We have a solid business plan vetted by Stephanie\u2019s non-profit background and informed by both Mark and Steph's years of living and working in music venues. We've also got many people volunteering their time to help with the success of Wonderville, but your contribution goes a long way!\n\nDeath by Audio Arcade will continue to operate as a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization inside of Wonderville.

After the insanity of 2018, wherein we collaborated with over a dozen venues, art spaces, and like-minded indie game groups, we knew we needed to find a permanent space of our own.

To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this material will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.\nThere's none more black!\nBlack 3.0 is a super special acrylic paint. We have spent nearly 2 years tweaking its formulation to create a black that absorbs between 98 and 99% of visible light! Quite simply we've created the blackest black acrylic paint.\nBlack 3.0 brush applied to sculpture\nLast November we shared a beta batch of Black 3.0 with 1000 artists around the world for feedback and thoughts. We've now taken that information and reformulated it to be the best black we could possibly make. \nAll the photos and video content on this page are created with the final formulation of Black 3.0 from the UK factory that are producing it for us, we are excited to be playing with it and feel like it's perfect!\nWe need your help so that we can pay the paint factory to produce their minimum order quantity of our recipe so we can share our creation with everyone!\n The science behind the Black!\nWe wanted a super-flat, ultra-matte black that absorbed almost all visible light. To achieve that we went right back to the basics of paint making. The problem with existing black pigments is they are all slightly reflective (carbon is the most common and if you think of coal or charcoal you'll know it has a shine to it), so we created a whole new pigment in the lab and we call it 'Black Magick', it is born matte! This means that the mattifiers we used in Black 2.0, which added a tiny grey tint, are no longer needed making a way blacker looking paint! We've also managed to formulate a new acrylic polymer to hold the pigment, it's special because it has more available bonds than any other acrylic polymer being used in paints. This means it can cling onto way more pigment, leading to a really dense pigment load and a depth of colour not previously possible. We have sourced some brand new nano-mattifiers which we have added, these flatten out the last bits of stray light without compromising colour. \nUnedited comparison with other well known black paints\nWe have benchmarked Black 3.0 against 45 existing black paints, this photo demonstrates a small section of those, being the most commonly available black paints in the UK. We also sent beta versions of Black 3.0 to 1000 artists around the world, they filled in a questionnaire and 93% of them preferred it to our Black 2.0 (previously the worlds flattest mattest black). \nIt's super easy to use.\nOther super blacks are complicated to use and extremely expensive. Most require heat, science labs and specialist training to apply. We wanted to make a super affordable, easy to use paint that was familiar to artists so they could concentrate on expressing themselves. \nWe think that sharing your colours with others is nice! When Stuart heard that Kapoor was the only artist that could use the blackest black he felt sad but also a bit bad that he'd been making awesome colours and only using them in his own work. So he started sharing his colour creations on the internet with other artists. \nThe holy grail of paints is the ultimate zero-point black. We've been on a mission to create exactly that for a long while because we want all artists to be able to express themselves with awesome materials. The limits of your creations should be your imagination not how rich or successful you are. \nWe are a small team of artists and paint makers based in a studio in Dorset on the south coast of England. We are headed up by British artist Stuart Semple who has been making his own colours for nearly 20 years. \nWe've created and shared tens of thousands of the artiest art materials with artists all over the world including LIT (the world's glowiest glow pigment). PINK (the pinkest pink), Gold (the goldest gold), Black 2.0 (the mattest flattest black paint), Dazzle (the glitteriest plant based glitters) and many more creations. \nYou can see what we make and learn all about us on our website:\nculturehustle.com\nNo matter what reward you choose you will get at least one bottle of Black 3.0 but your support means so much to us we wanted to thank you properly. Stuart and his team have been busy over the last few weeks designing the rewardiest rewards to thank you properly! These will only ever be available to kickstarter backers!

Some of you have been with us for the past 5 years, 7 product launches and we cannot, would not, should not be here without you.  I know we say that a lot but we really do mean it.  We are immensely grateful \u2014 as designers, as product developers, as believers in a more fun and creative world \u2014 and we sure plan to keep going as long as you guys keep loving the things we make.\nFor the first time, we are launching a more mass-oriented, retail-ready product, but of course with Candylab DNA (it's better that way).  And you get to watch and see how this gets made!  This story is a little different than our usual, but still leads to the cool, innovative toys that you've come to expect from us. \nYou know we do, and you do too. That's why we think you'll be glad to hear the seed of this idea:  Diecast little cars are a staple of every kid's bedroom and toy chest, making frequent appearances on adult shelves, toy collection and as fun office decor too.  What bugs us is that like any successful, long-running product, they've become commoditized. \nToday you can buy tiny 2-inch long diecast toy cars for a buck at virtually any gas station.  Of course, it's not the price that bugs us the most, it's the simple fact that the joy that comes with matchbox cars is gone. Those little guys are so often tossed around and forgotten, the magic disappears.  This mass invasion is a far cry from the 1950's when they were carefully crafted, and came in a box resembling a box of matches. Don't even get us started on plastic \"diecast-style\" cars. \n...is to provide a bit of an antidote to that while still doing what we do best:  wooden toy cars.  So we set out to design a \"Wooden Diecast\" car.  It sounds really simple but we banged our heads about for 2 years to be able to do this \u2014  make a cute, cartoonishly-proportioned wooden body with fun, splashy colors on a custom-designed diecast base. Screw it all together carefully, give it an adorable name and sell it for single digit dollars in the spirit of matchbox cars.  Then we made more of them.  And now we're releasing it into the wild!\nBut here we are, and here they are! Countless hours, work, prototypes, scale studies, engineering, and color studies, we have the finished products in hand \u2014 beech wood body, alloy diecast base, custom engineered wood screw, metallic foil paint accents and the coolest packaging we could come up with. \nNow, for the good part.\nWe came up with the best combo packs we could imagine, and it's pretty straightforward. There are 6 designs total, and we packed them in some common sense combinations.  All are at affordable price points, because no one is against affordable, but great. \nAlso, for the first time ever, Candylab announces... immediate fulfillment! Unlike our previous campaigns, every detail about these little guys have been finalized and ready to go which means they will begin the fulfillment process as soon as the campaign ends. And that means they're guaranteed to arrive in time for the holidays.\nWe're so sure of ourselves this time, we even made a giant red banner:\n(For those of you who are waiting on your Beasts, fret not \u2014 they'll be there sooner than you think.)\n ** Please note, the Dream Come True reward is limited to our existing body styles and cabins.

They're all contributors to Stories for Ways & Means, a whimsical illustrated collection of short stories by some of our greatest living songwriters. \nThe literary value of songwriting, for those who still had any doubts, was validated when a recent Nobel Prize in Literature went neither to a poet or a novelist, but to Bob Dylan. This long overdue recognition of the literary contributions of songwriters coincided with the publication of a book celebrating original children's stories written by musicians. In a stroke of serendipity, the release of Stories for Ways & Means couldn\u2019t have been timelier.\nIt all started when Jeff Antebi (founder of Waxploitation Records) found himself wondering, \"What kind of children's story would Devendra Banhart write if he was asked to write one?\" \"What would a story look like if it was written by Nick Cave, and illustrated by Anthony Lister?\" Or \"What would a story by Frank Black sound like if it was narrated by Danny Devito?\" And so he set out to answer these questions. \nIn the near-decade that followed, Jeff turned these \"why-nots\" into Stories for Ways & Means, a book of grown-up children\u2019s stories by some of this era\u2019s most compelling storytellers from the worlds of music and contemporary art\u2014with proceeds benefitting NGOs and nonprofit organizations advancing children\u2019s literacy worldwide (including Room to Read, Pencils of Promise, 826 National, and War Child.)    \nSFWAM exhibition at the acclaimed Corey Helford Gallery in Los Angeles\nThe book includes collaborations with Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Frank Black, Devendra Banhart, Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, Laura Marling, Kathleen Hanna, Gary Numan, Jim James (of My Morning Jacket), Manuel \u201cGuajiro\u201d Mirabal (of Buena Vista Social Club), Will Oldham, Alison Mosshart (of The Kills), Anna Von Hausswolff, Satomi Matsuzaki (of Deerhoof), Elliphant, Alec Empire, Amadou Bagayoko (of Amadou & Mariam), Del the Funky Homosapien, Matthew Dear, Micachu, Song Yuzhe, Ernest Ranglin, Eugene Hutz (of Gogol Bordello), Gibby Haynes (of Butthole Surfers), Jason Lytle, Sera Cahoone and Spencer Krug (of Moonface) ...as well as painters/illustrators like James Jean, Anthony Lister, Dan Baldwin, Ronzo, Kai & Sunny, Alessia Iannetti, Asha Zero, Candice Tripp, Carlin Diaz, Cinta Vidal, Clare Rojas, Daniel Munoz \"SAN\", Dave Kinsey, David Bray, Heisuke Kitazawa or PCP, Herakut, Joe Coleman, Kirsty Whiten, Lidia de Pedro, Loa Hjalmtysdottir, Maria Rivans, Sage Vaughn, SEPE, Swoon, Will Barras and more. \nWhile creating the project, we made sure to record many of the writers narrating their own stories.  We also brought in special guests to narrate such as Andre Royo (Actor: \"The Wire\", \"Empire\"), Channy Leaneagh (of Poli\u00e7a), Danny Devito, D.R.A.M., Ken Nordine (Handpicked by Tom Waits - American voice-over artist, best known for his series of Word Jazz albums), King Krule, Kumail Nanjiani (Actor: \"Silicon Valley\", \"The Big Sick\"), Lauren Lapkus (Actress: \"Orange is the New Black\", \"Crashing\"), Lauren Mayberry (of CHVRCHES), Lizzo, Madeline Follin (of Cults), Nick Offerman (Actor: \"Parks and Rec\"), Orvan Sm\u00e1rason (of M\u00fam ), Phil LaMarr (Actor:  \"Mad TV\", \"Futurama\"), Sarah Jones (Tony Award-winning Broadway Actress), Vivian Bang (Actress: \"Memoirs of a Geisha\"), and Zach Galifianakis.\nHardcover Edition\nThe book was a smash success and received praise from Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, Bill\u00adboard, Juxtapoz, Noisey, Okayplayer, The Talk\u00adhouse, DIY, Paste, Pigeons and Planes, Conse\u00adquence of Sound, and more.

Nobody was more curious and open-minded about California than Huell Howser. During his time with KCET, he produced over a thousand episodes of his various shows.\nHuell loved California!\nHe loved the big vistas, the hidden gems, the off-beat people who always turned out to have a story you didn't expect. And that's why California loved him.\nHuell Howser takes in a performance of the song, \"La Noche Est\u00e1 Serena,\" at the Lummis House in Highland Park.\nMany of the programs haven't been seen in years.\nHuell's old tapes won't last forever, they're sitting in his archive waiting to be digitally converted for broadcast and streaming. A lot of the early episodes still need closed captions and many need to be re-captioned to new standards. Each streaming platform requires its own file formats. For example, the process of making Huell available on Amazon is different than the process for KCET's Roku channel.\nHuell visits William Gore Sr. and his wife, Lena Gore at the Cobbler Factory in Pasadena.\nYou can be a part of Huell\u2019s legacy by actively participating in the preservation of his show. \nThis is where you come in. You can engage directly with this program you love. Huell fans have been clamoring for more episodes to be broadcast on KCET. You\u2019ve been asking us to make more episodes available for streaming. We heard you and created a Kickstarter campaign to do exactly that.\nAn original Betacam cassette of an early Visiting episode.\nJoin forces with KCET to make these classic programs available for everyone to see.\nWe want to broadcast and stream more rare and vintage episodes of Visiting with Huell Howser. What better way to celebrate 25 years of adventures? With the funds raised here, our team will digitize and re-caption these old tapes for broadcast on KCET and for streaming on multiple platforms like Amazon, Roku and Apple TV.\nWe\u2019ve hand-picked the best early and rare episodes of Visiting from Huell's archives.\nThe next step is to pull the master tapes from the archives and get them into our new system at KCET. From there, our engineers and video coordinators can convert the episodes into the proper formats for each streaming platform so you can watch Huell where you watch your other favorite shows.\nCongratulations, Huell fans - you did it! Thanks to you, there will be more Huell Howser in the world.\n\"Huell loved to be around people. He taught me the art of storytelling, and that made me a better cameraman.\"\n      - Luis Fuerte\nHuell Howser in a field of California Poppies.\n\"If, like me, you arrived in LA in the middle of Huell's long career, there are so many episodes you never got a chance to see, but need to see. Also, frankly, young Huell is drop-dead gorgeous.\"\n      - John Rabe, 89.3-KPCC\nHuell Howser and Luis Fuerte on location.\n\"If you have a good story, it doesn\u2019t have to be overproduced. I want our stories to reveal the wonders of the human spirit and the richness of life in California, including its history, people, culture and natural wonders.\"\n      - Huell Howser\nHuell with Vahan, Ara and Khechig Manoogian in 1990.\n  Huell fans unite and check out our rewards!\nThe images below are illustrations, the rewards are created and shipped once the campaign reaches its goal.\nPledge $5 or more: We've Made a New Friend\nThank you for joining forces to make more Huell episodes available for all to see.\nPledge $15 or more: Excitin'\nStay cool with this \"I'm a Huell Fan!\" personal fan made from recycled plastic.\nPledge $25 or more: Amazing!\nShow everyone you're a part of Huell's legacy with this enamel pin with a bright nickel finish.

Keep supporting us, and more crazy cool things will keep happening.\nOur first stretch goal was to reach $150,000 allowing us to have new art made so the game can include all unique, non-repeating game board tiles and use spot UV on the flames on the burninated side to increase the effect of burnination (we didn't know what it meant either, it makes a part of the art shinier than the others. cool!). \nArt and assets so NOT final it hurts!\nOur second stretch goal was to reach $250,000. See that \"Stack Em To The Heavens\" gif back up the page?

Strong Bad will be continuing his Skills of an Artist series by drawing one of your suggestions in the comment section of the campaign in an upcoming video. \nOh man! Look! Here is that video we just mentioned a sentence or two ago! You can watch it now! Thanks to backer Chris O'Connor for the suggestion!\nWe're adding some game upgrades! We're upgrading the cards to be linen cards so they're easy to shuffle and feel luxurious right out of the box. In addition to that, we're adding some spot UV to the flames of the game box itself, giving your box the ultimate effect of burnination. \nFor our fifth stretch goal, we'll be bringing you an all new Six-Sadded, Die video but in the meantime, grab the file (innie or outie) to 3D print your own Six-Sadded, Die! Help us get to 12,000 backers so we can do it! \nArt not final!\nWe decided to give you a surprise gift when we hit 12,000 backers!

Do awesome stuff in real life, help Trogdor burninate this cottage and we'll do dumb stuff in return!\nIn our game, before you can use an action to burninate a cottage, you must burninate all the surrounding terrain tiles as well as the tile the cottage is on. In such fashion, help Trogdor burninate everything by fulfilling all the dumb demands on the terrain tiles and cottage itself! Once you\u2019ve done them all, you will be rewarded by a live stream of Matt playing Strong Bad\u2019s Cool Game For Attractive People and performing all the voices LIVE until he gets tired of it, or his throat gives out!\nSubmit your achievements to Maya at maya@homestarrunner.com. When you submit pictures and content to us, know that we may post your picture in an update to show your awesomeness! You can track what achievements have been reached on this board which will be just below the stretch goal section of our campaign.\nUPDATE: We gave you the video of 25 people yelling 'Trogdor!' (though we'd still like to see that) since today (Aug 11, '18) is the 10th anniversary of the release of SBCG4AP and since the campaign's almost over. SO, On Sunday Aug 12th at 6pm EST, Matt is gonna do a Kickstarter Live while playing the game and performing the voices like we already said a couple paragraphs ago! Tune in and chat and comment and watch as the wheels come off!!\nMatt and Mattsets NOT Final.\nArt and assets NOT final. But in the ballpark. The meeply ballpark.\nWe're going to make a whole set of meeples of the 12 main Homestar Runner characters. Use them in this board game, or drop em into whatever other tabletop experience you want!

With his help, the game became playable, perhaps even... enjoyable!\nCourtroom sketches of Pat and James.\nWhile James playtested and iterated all over the place, Chris Schweizer got busy working on art for the game and our pal Rick Van Velsor (who sculpted the Homestar and Cheat Commandos figurines) began sculpting designs for the vinyl miniatures (available in the Burninator level and above). \nRick Van Velsor takes our janky 3D Tinkercad prototype and molds it into pure majesty!\nNow, the game is ready to be produced and played by burnination enthusiasts everywhere.\nFor updates outside of Kickstarter, like our Facebook page and follow us on Twitter.

Again.  \nWe are compulsive designers, product developers and parents (well, some of us) that have not quite let go of the inner kid.  We design, engineer, and manufacture toy cars that are absolutely loved by children and would sit nicely on a shelf too. And quite a few people say it, because we have been doing this for some years now:  we make culturally cheeky toys for contemporary humans, and everyone gets to play!   \nWe were born right here on Kickstarter, and since they say practice makes perfect, we kept practicing and practicing. Toy biz is a tough biz, in fact, but having an early supporter base in you, our loyal backers, always reassured us and gave us confidence in our design chops. \n...we have a real treat for you. We have been working on a radical new type of body and whole new approach to our builds, a difficult trick in woodworking.  But we persisted and the result is pushing the boundaries of woodworking and craftsmanship. And we teamed up with our friend Joey Ruiter, a Design Superhero for an extra spicy look.  He rocks.  \nWe give you:\nWith a strong nod to the peak of mid 60's automotive design when slabs reigned supreme, we created 4 new designs.  \nA direct channelling of Joey Ruiter's own White Beast, an iconic mid century luxury sedan turned into a monster sleeper with a swapped engine and bagged suspension. Smooth, abstract and stunning. We didn't stop here: we 3D scanned our friend and made him into a superhero action figure, so he can tell the entire story.\n The mirror image of the White beast. We'd say the evil twin, but really which one is it? With black matte body paint and whitewall tires, the Sheep sports a lowriding body and silky smooth presence.\n\nThis one ain't a beast name, but she's fast and silky smooth. Two-tone paint fenders, white letter tires, and an attitude of barely restrained aggressivity.\n\nA decidedly more laid back vehicular spirit, this is a new, slick take on our now famous Woodies. It has a precise veneer job with real microwood, a magnetic surfboard included and it's the first Candylab car to have covered rear wheel fenders.\nThey all come in a custom designed, tight fitting box, same width and length for proper stacking with your other Candylab Collectibles. We will outdo ourselves:  Silver foiled, black matte board packaging. \nFor the true collectors, we now offer a solid American Walnut wood base as an optional upgrade.  Each beast has 2 pieces of Neodymium rare earth magnets, which will snap to the 2 magnets embedded in the wood base, securing the car to it.  \nA true Renaissance designer, Joey's work spans automotive, nautical, furniture, graphic and product design. He is the rare designer that takes the time to build and fabricate his ideas: futuristic dune buggies, boxy snowmobiles, bikes, furniture for world-class companies and much more.  His moving, road-worthy kinetic sculptures are admired worldwide in the car community and featured in tons of publications.  His no-nonsense take on form and function is an alternate and inspiring view in the design world. That's why we love his work so much. And he has great hair too!\n   In other words, he is a Design Superhero and we want to celebrate that - so we made him into an action figure!\nCombining Rewards: If you'd like to pledge more than one item, please identify shipping costs for each, and 1) add it all up then 2) Type in the corresponding amount in the pledge field.

Women make 20+% less than men for doing the exact same job and are significantly underrepresented in political office - women of color are even further underrepresented and under paid. My story follows Sabrina, a fourth grader who runs for student council to get equal sized cookies for all of her classmates. It also speaks to the importance of equality and diversity. Please support this campaign, in any way you are able, so I can spread Sabrina's story!\nBackground\nOver the years, I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky to work with women who have held political office and fight for equity, so I decided to write a children's book inspired by them. It\u2019s about a 4th grader named Sabrina who sees inequity, and runs for office to put an end to it. I\u2019ve always loved children's books and their ability to teach lessons and promote life skills in a simple but powerful way, and I want this book to not only teach about equality and why it's important to have more women in office, but to also show a diverse cast of characters.\nThis story ties together the ideas of gender equity (specifically gender wage equity) and the need for more women (and specifically women of color) to have a voice as representatives in political office, all while teaching the terms and concepts that are a big part of any election. Hopefully, it\u2019ll inspire little girls to someday get involved in politics - or even run for office themselves!\nA fun glossary of terms in the beginning allows children to learn new words and see how they\u2019re used throughout the book. (Each term is specially highlighted in the text).\nLet's look at some statistics that need to change!:\nWomen make up over 50% of the U.S. population, yet they are significantly underrepresented both in politics and boardrooms. Currently, women hold 106 (19.8%) of the 535 seats in U.S. Congress, 22 (22%) of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate and 84 (19.3%) of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Only 70 women hold statewide elective executive offices across the country out of 312, that\u2019s 22.4%. All these numbers are even lower for women of color, who make up only 7.1% of all members of Congress. \nDid you know that only 4.6% of all of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women? Women also on average take home less pay than men in the same jobs. In Seattle, where I\u2019m from, women make about 73% of what men earn in the same positions (nationally it\u2019s about 79%). For women of color, the numbers are even lower. \nThis needs to change! And there are a lot of different ways to contribute to this change, but the earlier we start to educate people on these issues, the greater the chance we have to make a big impact. I think children\u2019s books are a fun way to teach lessons, instill values, and bring up topics to discuss with little readers. \nSabrina's Story: \nSabrina is starting the fourth grade with her two best friends, Elliott and Lainey. After noticing that boys get bigger chocolate chip cookies than girls during snack time, Sabrina decides to run for a student council seat in order to fight for an equal share. She embarks on an election campaign and works with groups such as the Art Student Association and the Milk Drinkers Union to spread her message and gain support. \nSabrina gets endorsements, Elliott takes a voter poll, and Lainey hosts a fundraiser while her opponent Oliver attempts to sway voters with the promise of a class pet. Sabrina shows that girls and boys complete the same classwork, play the same games at recess and should have the same size snacks!\nFollow her on the campaign trail! \nIllustrator: \nCharlotte Tang, a woman-of-color illustrator will bring this diverse cast of characters to life! Charlotte worked hard on developing these characters and has done amazing, adorable initial illustrations. I cannot wait to see the rest!\nRewards:\nRewards for giving to this project range from a thank you and a unique postcard of a scene from the story, to the printed book itself! Super special limited rewards include 1ft diameter chocolate chip cookie pillows, and the chance to get a character drawn into the story just for you!  \nMore delicious rewards include ice cream and cookie parties provided by Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream and Hello Robin Cookies! \nsee special edition cookie pillows below!  \nCost Breakdown:\nMost of the funding raised will go towards paying the illustrator. The story is already written and has been edited, but it needs to be brought to life! I worked with an illustrator on the character explorations and some initial draft pages, but there is a lot more that needs to be done! There will be about 35 pages of illustrated scenes, plus a cover, glossary, binding and back. This will be over 100 hours of work and I want to compensate the artist fairly for her work bringing this awesome project to life. Also, how cool that something like this can help provide a job for a young woman illustrator!\nFunding will go towards kickstarter and payment processing fees. \nFunding will go to getting the books printed. \nAnything raised over the amount needed for development will be donated to She Should Run, an amazing nonprofit organization dedicated to getting 250,000 women across the country running for elected office by 2030! They provide the information, the tools, community and the support to help women run for elected office.

We are humbled beyond words at your support. Since we still have a week to go and many great rewards to offer we are setting two new goals and incentives:\nIf we reach $35,000, Mike Musburger will curate a vintage drum kit for the studio. Mike is a dear friend of ours and has drummed for the likes of the Posies, Fastbacks, Love Battery, the Supersuckers and countless others. He\u2019s also an ace drum tech and of course a drum collector! He\u2019s one of our go-to people when we need the best sounding drums.\nMike Musburger - drummer extraordinaire!\nIf we reach $40,000 we will purchase for the studio a Mellotron 4000D. The mellotron was a mythical creature invented in late sixties. It played samples of real instruments from a tape bank. You\u2019ve heard it as the flutes on and strings on many famous recordings like Strawberry Fields Forever or Stairway to Heaven. The Mellotron 4000D is a modern version of the instrument which includes all of the original mellotron instrument recordings and a keyboard that\u2019s custom built to play like the original instruments. It\u2019s been very well received in the recording and live world and would get tons of use at the studio.\nMellotron 4000D\n Johnny Sangster & Andrew Smith founded Crackle & Pop! Studio 10 years ago as a creative space to make affordable recordings. The room quickly became a magnet for artists & gear & music and the trajectory of the studio has exceeded our wildest dreams. \nJohnny Sangster @ Crackle & Pop!\nThis last year two major events happened that have catapulted us head first into a studio expansion. Conrad Uno, of famed Egg Studios decided to retire and in an inspired moment, gave to us his Otari MTR90 2\" multitrack and a Studer B67 1/2\" mixdown deck. He also made us the caretakers of his Spectra Sonics recording console originally built for Stax Records in Memphis. Right around that same time our landlord at Crackle & Pop! informed us that the space directly below us would vacate this year. The space is twice the size of our current room with luxurious ceiling height. \nWe are asking for your help  to sound proof and build out the downstairs space to house our new control room, recording booth and beautiful live room. We are incredibly honored by Conrad Uno's generosity and are super excited to take on this amazing opportunity.\nCrackle & Pop! began in 2006 when Johnny & Andy cajoled each other into starting an overdubbing room. We found a quirky 500sq ft space in a multi-use building above a coffee roaster in the heart of industrial Ballard, in Seattle WA. Since then the studio has contributed to projects by Mudhoney, Maggie Bjorklund, Mark Lanegan, Earth, Jesse Sykes, Ken Stringfellow & Jon Auer, Cobirds Unite & countless others. We are proud to have become the home of many local producers & engineers. We've created the \"Live @ Crackle & Pop!\" video series supporting artists we love and taken on countless creative projects.\n Throughout the years we've looked at ways to possibly expand our footprint & capabilities but real estate in Seattle - as everyone knows - is crazy. Until now, nothing has looked quite compelling enough to tear us away from our awesome location in Ballard. \n2017 saw the closing of Egg Studios; a beloved, low-key room that was run by Conrad Uno of PopLlama Records. Egg was the home of the Posies, Young Fresh Fellows, Presidents of the United States of America, Fastbacks, Mudhoney and many more. \nJohnny & Conrad met in 1983 when Conrad recorded and released a cassette of Johnny's band the Sharing Patrol. Johnny left Seattle the next year to pursue the Sharing Patrol from Copenhagen Denmark and Egg & PopLlama continued to grow. Conrad had become friends with Paul Scoles of Ironwood Studio, and one day at a Mariners game Paul decided that Uno should have the recording console that he was storing in boxes in his attic.\nThat was the Spectra Sonics recording console that Paul had purchased from Stax Studio. It had been built for Stax in 1969 and was installed in their B studio. Conrad brought the board back to life and it became the heart of Egg Studio, contributing to the sound of hundreds of classic northwest records. \nThe Spectra being refurbished in Johnny's home.\nIn 1997 Johnny moved back to Seattle and asked Conrad if he needed someone to help out at the studio while he was at the ballpark. The Posies were about to begin recording their \"breakup album\" & Conrad put Johnny behind the board. Conrad continued to encourage Johnny to be at the studio, in fact telling anyone who called to record with Johnny. Thus began a many year stint as the Egg \"house engineer\" and really the beginning of Johnny's producer career.\nWhen Conrad and his wife Emily decided to retire, Conrad couldn't bring himself to sell off the studio gear. Instead he decided to give it away to his friends and to the engineers who had worked at Egg; Kurt Bloch & Johnny Sangster. Conrad became very excited with the thought of his gear living on in Johnny's recording space. Crackle & Pop! has now become the proud owner of an Otari MTR90 2\" 16/24 track deck, a Studer B67 1/4\" mixdown deck and we have worked out a deal with Conrad to be the caretakers of the wonderful & historic Spectra Sonics Stax Console. \nOne of our two new tape decks.\nThe unit directly below our current location is a 1000 sq ft industrial space.  It has 12 ft ceilings in the half below us and 21 ft ceilings in the other half. For those that have been to the current Crackle & Pop! it will have a very similar feel with the addition of a full band / high ceilinged / tracking space. And there will be NO STAIRS to climb with your heavy gear!\nSuite 1B\nThe new studio will consist of:\nControl Room : Dimensions - 20'L x 16'W x 11'H, housing both the Harrison Console & Spectrasonics Console, the Otari & Studer decks, our Protools rig and extensive outboard gear.\nRecording Booth: Dimension - 15'L x 12'W x 11'H, housing an upright piano and our vintage amp collection. \nLive Room: Dimensions - 18'L x 23'W x 20'H, housing our Hammond A100, Wurlitzer Piano, Guitar collection & Your Band!\nEntrance / Kitchenette: 5.5'W x 15'L x 10'H, hang your coat, make your coffee here. \n\"Friends\" / \"Gap\"\nThe studio construction will be double sheet rock, double walls throughout to decouple us from the the outside world. There will be sight lines through from control room to tracking room. We intend to maintain the vibe that everyone loves so about our current space. Keeping the day rate affordable is at the top of our priorities and that is why this we are counting on you to make this Kickstarter a success. We will offer the room at a very affordable $300 a day.\nEngineer Rachel Field recording the Tripwires\nOur construction guru is Brian Burnside, local rock n roller and all around great guy. We have a great community of builders and friends who are all chipping in to make it happen. Still the buildout cost is estimated at 40k.\nWe\u2019ve been saving our hard earned dollars and are already part of the way there. We know that the community around what we do is very strong and that together, we will make this happen. We\u2019ve got a lot to offer in return so please take a look. We are so excited to make this dream a reality.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been in the recording business for 22 some years and have seen the changes in the industry. Our own studio has grown organically and with very little debt. We are quite realistic about what it takes to keep a tracking room open in a place like Seattle.\n\nWe are not afraid of working hard and we our confident in our track record and our community. This is a terrifyingly exciting prospect and we are confident that it can and will succeed.\n\nAs we mentioned above, real estate in Seattle is rather daunting in these times. We have a 10+ year relationship with our landlord here in our building and he fully supports us and our artistic endeavors.

We are inventors. We designed two very successful products (Int\u00f9iti Creative Cards and Fabula Storytelling Cards). And this time we decided to work on a solution for efficiently speaking in public.\nYou can place Cicero on walls, tables, floors or any other available surface, with the help of adhesive putty or tape. Each card is like a box to fill, so you can just arm yourself with post-its and a pen, and start working your speech!\nYou can place it on every available surface\n\nCOMPOSITION\nIn each deck you'll find:\n7 GROUNDWORK cards; \n5 MAIN POINTS DEVELOPMENT cards; \n14 STRUCTURE cards: \na booklet with instructions.\nThe composition of Cicero\n\nTHE GROUNDWORK CARDS\nThe GROUNDWORK cards are the white cards in your deck and they help you organise the basic elements of your speech.\nThey give you the right questions, for example:\nWho's the audience? \nWhat are their expectations? \nHow much time do you have? \nWhat's the goal of your speech? \nPlace the GROUNDWORK cards and build the context of your speech, sticking around them notes, images and whatever comes to your mind!\nThe 7 Groundwork Cards\n\n\nDEVELOPING THE MAIN POINTS\nThe Main Points are the cores of your speech. This is the most crucial phase: imagine it as a sort of brainstorming. Start asking yourself: \"What do I want to say? What are the most essential topics? So... which are the main points of my speech?\".\nEach Main Point is composed of:\na Key Sentence \u2013 This is the concept you want to communicate (e.g. \"My product is very useful\", \"The groom will be a loyal husband\", \"This company has a glorious history\");\nFacts to support the sentence \u2013 To say something is not enough: you should always provide proofs and facts to confirm your Key Sentence (e.g. if you are selling a product, you can describe the reason why it's useful; if you are saying the groom is loyal, you would tell some anecdotes about it);\na Transition to the next Main Point \u2013 It never sounds right to jump from one topic to another. Sometimes the right phrase is enough (e.g. \"I told you about our product, now I wanna tell you something about the creation process\", or \"Well, now you know about the groom, but what about the bride?\").\nAfter defining your Main Points, you need to decide which is the most effective way to connect them. It could be using a chronological order, or an analytical one (first describe the product, then the benefits, then the team behind it), or the Problem/Solution strategy. That's what you'll be able to define with the card Pattern. \nThe 5 Main Points Development Cards\n\nBUILDING YOUR SPEECH\nWith the Structure Cards (the black cards in the deck) you can consider all the elements of your speech and start writing your first draft.\nWe followed a very effective structure that can be adapted successfully to any kind of speech:\nLure \u2013 In the first part of your speech you should say something to grab the audience attention (The Hook) and to explain them why they should trust you in what you are saying (The Credibility Statement);\nIntroduce \u2013 Now it's the moment to start promising something to your audience, to underline a problem they didn't consider yet but that you are going to solve;\nMain Points \u2013 Here you can use the Main Points you developed with the red cards!\nConclusion \u2013 At the end of the speech, you'll make sure to recap all the important information and to create a call to action in the audience.\nYou will be able to control every detail: Figures of Speech, Actions, Gestures, the Tone of the Voice, and the Slides you are gonna project (if needed).\nThe 14 Structure Cards\n\nIT WORKS WITH ANY KIND OF SPEECH\nWe tested Cicero and the structure is perfectly flexible:\n\nMAKING OF\nThe development took almost a year. For the first 3 months we studied the theory of Public Speaking in order to synthesise a practical and easy-to-use structure. Then we worked on the actual product to create a delightful experience. At last, we tested Cicero with around 20 users and the results were extraordinary!\nThe very first prototype of Cicero\n\nREWARDS\n \nTHE TEAM\nThe minds behind Cicero\nAndrea Binasco and Matteo di Pascale are true creative souls. Andrea is an expert teacher and Matteo is a designer, author of Int\u00f9iti Creative Cards. Together they designed Fabula, a framework for Storytelling.\nMarco Venturini is a Public Speaking expert and a Communication Consultant. Author of several books on Communication Skills, he is columnist for important newspaper.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we did with our previous project Fabula, we set the goal at the minimum possible because we want to see it realised and we want people to use Cicero. \n\nWe are ready for all circumstances. We know very well how to produce card decks (see http://www.intuiti.it and https://fabuladeck.com/), and as every entrepreneurs we have our own history of production and shipping issues and we are now able to handle them better than ever.\n\nSo trust us: we are going to make you satisfied as much as you want!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "DIGITAL Pack", "descp": "Get the do-it-yourself version and print Cicero wherever you want!

These new designs aim to bring space exploration to the next generation of enthusiasts and be awesome while doing so.\nPoster #1: Voyager Screen Print\nWith this year\u2019s eclipse and Cassini\u2019s last transmission, there has been a lot of wonderful public interest in space. My love of space started at 12 years old when I first picked up a copy of Cosmos. We hope to capture the curiosity of our audience and cultivate a lifelong love of science and art\u2013like Carl Sagan did for me.\nWe have been lucky to have built a studio of all things space.\nSpace Exploration Related Designs by Chop Shop 2010-17\nWe\u2019ve taken the three most popular robotic space missions from our original Spacecraft Series\u2013Voyager (shown at top), Cassini, and The Mars Rovers\u2013and have illustrated them for the young and young at heart. These missions brought us so much incredible knowledge: the first image of Earth and our moon, the discovery of volcanoes on Io, Titan revealed as an Earth-like planet with lakes and rain of methane, and discovering a long complex history of water on Mars\u2014and that\u2019s only the beginning!\nThe Planetary Society\nThe Official Planetary Society Store\nWe are also proud to announce that as of a few days ago, this project has been officially adopted by The Planetary Society. This means that these three posters will join their growing catalog of products sold at chopshopstore.com/planetarysociety where a portion of the profits will go to help to fund their ongoing mission: To empower the world's citizens to advance the cause of space science and exploration.\nWe want to create a fun poster series that not only showcases these stellar bodies, but ALSO celebrates the amazing missions that opened up these worlds.\nPoster #2: Cassini Screen Print\n  Poster #3: Mars Rovers Screen Print\nAbove is poster #2 for Cassini followed by Mars Rovers featuring the full family of Mars rovers: Curiosity (front), Opportunity (back), Sojourner (right) and shown in landing mode Spirit (left) and the next member of the family Mars 2020 (top right).\nThis project is the first collaboration with my brother, James Romer, who is a extraordinary character illustrator (images below). His imagination had no bounds and he imbues such fun and fantastical life into the inanimate. Jim knows, as the Roman poet Horace once noted, \u201cIt\u2019s good to be silly at the right moment\u201d. See more of his drawings, sketches and musings on his Arrrggghhh Blog.\nWork by James Romer (Arrrggghhh Ink)\nTHE DETAILS\nWe are proposing a series of posters based on three kid favorites\u2014Mars the red Planet, Jupiter the giant, or Saturn, the coolest looking\u2014but, we also want to celebrate the amazing spacecraft programs that brought so many more fascinating bodies in our solar system to light.\nVoyager: Cool Discoveries\nWhile many lament the downgrading of Pluto from planet to dwarf-planet \u2014 many have never even heard of the many moons that are just as fascinating as any planet and some are bigger than Mercury! With bold design and colorful characters, we want to not only include these cool bodies, but highlight some of the even cooler attributes of these moons! Active volcanos on Io! Cracks from the underground oceans of Europa! The Great Dark Spot on Neptune and active Geysers on its moon Triton!\nWe also plan on including an informative key to all the fun facts and discoveries represented in each design!\nEach 18\" x 24\" poster will be screen-printed in three colors by the same shop that beautifully executed our original poster series (see below). But, the fun doesn\u2019t stop when the lights go out! The screen printed posters have a glow-in-the-dark layer that shows each robotic spacecraft as it flows through the Milky Way as humanity\u2019s first interstellar probe. Note: the 12\"x16\" archival digital prints will not include glow.\n  We will finish the campaign in time to deliver for the holidays! We hope to ultimately make them available on our website, but if you back this project, the three poster series are available at a special price that won\u2019t be available on chopshopstore.com.\nPrinting Information\nScreen printing is an age old method that involves a manually pressing a single ink color on to the paper through a highly detailed stencil affixed to a mesh. Each poster goes through this process four times (once for each color, including the glow) and hand-produced by an actual human being well-versed in the technique. For more about the process, please take a look at this explainer web site at MoMA. Click \u201center\u201d and then choose \u201cScreenprinting\u201d in the nav. Then hit, \u201cPress Arrow to Start\u201d to watch the process or you can try and actually grab the tools and simulate the process to better understand. I was lucky to design and program that MoMA site  around 2003 when we were better known as The Chopping Block. \nAn Archival Digital Gicl\u00e9e print is a high quality print that is made-to-order here in our studio. These prints are produced with archival inks on archival papers and have an expected display life of about 60-100 years.\nFor more information about the fantastic studio responsible for the actual screen printing, check out Vahalla Studio in Kansas City. They have a great portfolio which include many high profile designers and clients like Phish, Wilco, Sony Pictures, Cirque Du Soleil, and more.\nThe Other Rewards\nTHE ORIGINAL ROBOTIC SPACECRAFT POSTERS were crowd-funded in 2014 and included Voyager, Cassini, Curiosity, Sputnik, Mars Exploration, and the special edition LightSail for The Planetary Society. The next series was funded in 2015 and included New Horizons, Rosetta, and Galileo. Finally, last year we funded another series that featured crewed space missions including Apollo 11, The International Space Station, and Vostok 1. All of these designs are still available for purchase on chopshopstore.com/space except for Voyager and Sputnik which are currently sold out in the screen print version but are still available as Glic\u00e9e prints.\nNEW VOYAGER REPRINTS\nThe original blue version of our Voyager screen print has been sold out since 2016. As a part of this new campaign, we are finally offering a new edition with updated design and all new Jupiter-based colors.\nVOYAGER TEE\nOur Voyager tee comes in all sizes from Men\u2019s SML-3X, Women's SML-2X, and Kid's XS-XL.\nGRAND TOUR STICKER SET\nThis 12 sticker set measures 6\"x 6\" and includes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and their amazing moons Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Enceladus, Titan, Triton, and the Voyager Spacecraft. \nFull Collection of Space Mission Stickers\n3\"x3\" vinyl stickers which are ideal for either indoor or outdoor use. Set includes all 12 missions featured in both our Historic Robotic Spacecraft Series and our Giant Leaps in Space Series.\nBobby\u2019s Biggest Bubble (A Kickstarter funded picture book!)\nJames Romer\u2019s first published storybook. A whimsical tale about a little boy who wins a million gumballs which begins an unbelievable day of fun and adventure and has an appropriately cosmic ending! No spoilers!\nThe Manual and a user\nMike Mongo\u2019s Astronaut Instruction Manual\nThe Astronaut Instruction Manual is an actual working astronaut instruction manual. It is created to let today\u2019s space-loving young students who want to live, work, and play in space know that they genuinely do have that opportunity. The book was also recently optioned by Legendary Entertainment and is in early pre-production for a television series adaptation.\nThanks \nAs always, a special thanks to The Planetary Society who supported my earlier projects and have since become an official partner of Chop Shop Store. More importantly, they help shape space policy and fight for the continued exploration of space. You might also be familiar with their CEO, Bill Nye.

See 'Add-ons' below.\nAbout this project\nFollowing on the heels of the first Hobo Coins project, I'm super-thrilled to offer the next series of four all-new designs based on iconic US Coins.\nWhat are Hobo Coins?\nThroughout time, people have modified coins by hand-carving or engraving their own designs into existing coins. But this form of folk art really took off during the Great Depression. Those that were out of work or down on their luck took to modifying coins by engraving their own designs into them. They would use pocket knives or even filed down nails to carve beautiful designs that were as varied as the artists themselves. This art form evolved over time to often portray skeletons or skulls, incorporating elements from the coins as part of the final works of art. They would almost always keep the lettering on the coins.\nThe Hobo Coins project brings back this largely forgotten piece of American history. These coins are being minted by the oldest continuously operated private mint in the U.S and are SOLID. They each weigh about the same as 5 US. quarters, and are a little larger than the size of a US Dollar coins (these coins are 39 mm). Die-struck with over 100 tons of pressure in solid metal alloys and featuring antique finishes.\nPlease note that Hobo Coins are not actual US currency or modified US currency coins, they are die-struck new coins at different sizes, weights, and (clearly), different art than actual US coins.\nHelp revive a piece of history you can carry!\nThe Designs\nEach coin was crafted and designed by me using some of the most iconic coins as their base:\n\u2018The Davey Jones Locker\u2019 - 1919 S Wheat Penny \nThe original wheat penny designed by Victor D. Brenner made its debut in 1909. My rendition reimagines the coin with a nautical theme underscoring the dangers that lurk below. Aged with an antique silver-finish the coins will have a \u2018smooth\u2019 edge like the original (not \u2018reeded\u2019). As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin.\nThe Davey Jones Locker - 1919 S Wheat Penny\n \u2018The John Henry\u2019 - 1871 20 Dollar Coin\nFolk hero John Henry immortalized in metal. Around 1870 or '71, John Henry raced a steam-powered hammer on the C&O train line and won! He did, tragically, die soon after from exhaustion, but his spirit of determination lives on this Hobo Coin! Aged with an antique silver-finish and as with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original 20 Dollar coin.\nThe John Henry - 1871 Twenty Dollar Coin\n\u2018The Good Doctor\u2019 - 1937 Buffalo Nickel \nMy take on the classic \u2018Plague Doctor\u2019 updated with an industrial age motif and featuring a fearsome rat (the source of the plague and its spread) guarding its prize. This is no mere Templeton! Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin. This coin will have a smooth edge like the Buffalo nickel (smooth edge).\nThe Good Doctor - 1937 Buffalo Nickel\n\u2018The Aviator\u2019 - 1942 Mercury Dime\nMy latest take on the classic Mercury dime, featuring one bad ass pilot on the front, and a Catch-22 inspired Mitchell B-29 on the back\u2014which is, incidentally, the source of my website\u2019s name Dead on Paper. Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin. This coin will have a \u2018reeded\u2019 edge like the original Mercury dime.\n  The Aviator - 1942 Mercury Dime\nThe \u2018Hobo Coin / Davey Jones Locker\u2019 Limited Edition Print \nTo complement the coins, I\u2019ve designed this print which is inspired by the Davey Jones Locker coin. Each print is 18\u201d x 24\u201d, signed, and numbered.\nLimited Edition Hobo Coins Print - Signed and Numbered - click to view higher resolution at deadonpaper.com\n  Add-ons \nAll Add-ons are immediately available (including Solid Silver coins this time).

And who is J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs? And why is his name always in quotes? And for nonbelievers, why has this strangely compelling parody religion, this long-running postmodern joke, caught the attention of such pop culture icons as Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), David Byrne, Robert Crumb, Richard Linklater, Alex Cox, Ken Kesey, Frank Zappa, Jonathan Demme, and Devo\u2019s Mark Mothersbaugh? And is it true that Tori Amos is also one of \"Bob\"\u2019s chosen?  \n\"Bob\" and the Church have caught the attention of many\u2013 include David Byrne, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), Tori Amos, Stephen Colbert, Robert Crumb, Mark Mothersbaugh and DEVO, Matt Groening, Margaret Moser, Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, and more.\nARE WE CONTROLLED BY SECRET FORCES? ARE ALIEN MONSTERS BRINGING A STARTLING NEW WORLD? DO PEOPLE THINK YOU\u2019RE STRANGE? DO YOU? \nThe Church of the SubGenius: The Early Years\n\u201cWe tied together every occult, superstitious fringe belief you could think of\u2026it was so much fun!\u201d\n\u2013 Ivan Stang, co-founder\nBorn into the suburban world of the 1950s, future founders of the Church of the SubGenius Reverend Ivan Stang (Douglass St. Clair Smith) and Dr. Philo Drummond (Steve Wilcox) come of age during the 1960s and 70s \u2013 a time of unprecedented social and political tumult. They experience the rise of a deafening consumer culture, the tarnishing of the \"American Dream,\" the violence of the Vietnam War abroad, and the Kennedy assassinations and conspiracies that follow. \nAs youths they revel in the delights of stable families, monster movies, Science Fiction, super-8 moviemaking, dinosaur figures, comic books, and Rock 'n' Roll. As they grow older they witness the emergence of televangelism, the Jonestown Massacre, punk culture, and Reaganomics.\nDespite both growing up in Texas, it was not until the mid 70s that Stang and Drummond meet and quickly forge a friendship over a shared love of comic books, Captain Beefheart, and UFO paperbacks. One not so particular eve in 1977, while bemoaning their lack of conventional \u201csuccess\u201d for two such intelligent, well read chaps, Stang remarks, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not exactly geniuses.\u201d To which Drummond replies, \u201cyeah, we\u2019re sub-geniuses.\u201d \nAnd in that moment the Church of the SubGenius is born. It is not long after that J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs reveals himself as the Church's iconic prophet and foremost patron of ineffable Slack. In fact, Stang and Drummond will later come to the realization that \"Bob\" has been planting evidence of his presence for them for the past twenty years!!!\nTHE SUBGENIUS DIASPORA\n\u201cThere was that moment of realizing that this thing goes further than I ever imagined.\u201d\n\u2013 Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman)\nIn late 1979 Stang and Drummond, with the help of their wives, brainstorm what would become perhaps the single most significant marketing effort made at the inception of the Church of the SubGenius \u2013 the writing, design, printing, and distribution of Pamphlet #1. The doctrine of the Church quickly spreads, and the word of \u201cBob\u201d and the teachings of JHVH-1 teach \u201ctime control\u201d as a way to wrest \u201cSlack\u201d from the \u2018Pinks\u2019 and \u2018Normals.\u2019 The Church, it seems, has struck a nerve amidst the deadening consumer culture, the evisceration of basic social services, and the worship of wealth that occurred during the Reagan/Thatcher years.\nL: An early years Devival | R: The Three Wise Guys \u2013 Ivan Stang, Dr.X and Philo Drummond \u2013 pose with a Model X Humanoid (1979)\nAs \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s pamphlet continues to travel the world, the emergent punk publishing scene and new wave comic writers seize on the humor and cultural critique of the Church's doctrine. In San Francisco it is fished out of a trashcan by cartoonist and artist Paul Mavrides, igniting a SubGenius cell that gives the movement some of its most enduring art and performances through LIES (Paul Mavrides), Dr. Howland Owl (Hal Robins), Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman), Janor Hypercleats and Pope Sternodox. \n\"Bob\" captures the zetigeist of the day. Cartoonist Robert Crumb reprints Pamphlet #1 in the first issue of his comic Weirdo. A few years later Simon and Schuster publishes The Book of the SubGenius.  Acclaimed film director and SubGenius Alex Cox channels Church mythology in Repo Man as the glowing, alien-owned Chevy Malibu soars high above Los Angeles with Otto (Emilio Estevez) and Miller (Tracy Walke) inside, their faces shining with Slack as Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) watches from below. \nDr. Howl and Puzzling Evidence conduct legendary \u201cDevivals,\u201d radio shows (More than an Hour, Less than a Show), and introduce the word of \"Bob\" to Burning Man. The Stark Fist of Removal newsletter, The Hour of Slack podcast, an MTV special, and countless cassette tapes, posters, comics, videos, websites, and Facebook groups perpetuate the word of \"Bob.\" \nBy the turn of the century, publications as powerful as TIME Magazine begin to get the SubGenius joke when \u201cBob\u201d is voted \u2018Fraud of the Century\u201d by readers of its online poll. In the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, the \u201cFree Party\u201d constituents of Brighton in Great Britain voted \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs as an M.P. to the House of Commons three times.\nToday, \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s hucksterism and the wisdom of JHVH-1 is apparent in all fifty states and a multitude of countries across the globe!\nPLAY\n\nAnother early SubGenius of Texas, David Boone (late husband of Slacking Towards Bethlehem director Sandy K. Boone), documents the rise of the SubGenius in his 1980 film, Invasion of the Aluminum People, which is lauded by Academy Award winning director Jonathan Demme. This is one of the first known recorded instances of the transmission of SLACK.\nGIVE TO THIS KICKSTARTER NOW AND ACHIEVE SALVATION \u2013 OR TRIPLE YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!\nOnly with your support can our intrepid group of award-winning filmmakers dare to make this film. By giving us your hard earned cash, we can make this dream a reality, and breach all Earthly human, political, and cultural barriers with the searing nonhuman truth of the Word of \"Bob,\" J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs, that LIVING GOD WHO WALKS THIS PLANET EARTH IN HUCKSTER'S SHOES. \nTo date, we\u2019ve travelled over 8,000 miles and interviewed 15 SubGenius in four cities, sharing the so-called \"reality\" that SubGenii are forced to share with humans. We\u2019ve only just begun to uncover many of the SubGenius\u2019 most guarded secrets. The SubGenii are finally willing to go public and tell the TRUTH. \nThis is YOUR chance to get in on the ground floor of a huge, globally important cult. You will then attract all the $$$, pleasure spacecraft, and SHEER POWER OVER OTHERS that go with high-ranking support of the Church and this documentary! \nBut most important, you can smite your enemies, achieve TIME CONTROL and attain SLACK.\nREMEMBERING SAINT MARGARET\nSince we began production on our film, a beloved avatar of the early SubGenius tribe, Margaret Moser, passed away on August 25 of this year. One of the nation\u2019s top music journalists and music scene nurturers, Reverend Reverend Doctor Doctor Archdoctor Saint Margaret Moser even had a photo of J.R. \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs on her Austin Chronicle business card. She said it helped her connect with her interview subjects, many of whom were already members of the Church themselves.\nPLAY\n\nIn her interview with us, she spoke about the pleasure, \u201cthe great release, to have all this nutty stuff in your head and find like minded people to express it with.\u201d But most notably she sang a song written by her own hand, \"Oh, Life's a Bowl of Cherries with \"Bob\" Dobbs.\" Saint Moser's life epitomized the way that membership in the Church accelerated the discovery of true friendships, experimentations, creative collisions, and rebellion through art, music, and comedy against dehumanization in any form.\nWHY THIS FILM? \nWhy not this film? Pull the wool over your own eyes and help us make a movie! The Church of the SubGenius is the underground movement that has galvanized the imaginative, the artistic, the nerdy, even the deranged \u2013 to examine the simmering dystopia in their culture, and do absolutely nothing about it... except, maybe, poke fun at it all. The Church of the SubGenius is taking over the universe. The sooner you learn about it, the better off you\u2019ll be. \nPLAY\n\nNow more than ever we feel that the story of the Church of the SubGenius needs to be told. There's a core of ideas within the SubGenius ethos \u2013 of fighting oppression with humor, community and creativity, of using absurdity as a nonviolent weapon, giving time, permission and priority to expression, creation, and zaniness with friends \u2013  that we think has great value we believe these ideas are necessary in today's world and that our film about the SubGenius is the perfect way to invoke them.\nAmongst all the spaceships, frop, pipes, eye-bludgeoning graphics, bulldada, yeti ancestors, (and yes, \u2018macho spoutings\u2019), we hope you will fund this film so you can join our merry band of pranksters on the culture-jam of the century! It\u2019s going to be a lot of fun!!!\nNo stranger to hiding in plain sight \u2013 \"Bob\" is everywhere, IF you know to look for him!\nSo please, give to our film, get our cool merch, show up at screenings, and talk to us in every way possible. We will have our third nostril open at all times.\nAnd remember, as one famous SubGenius said, \u201csince the main message is \u2018think for yourself,\u2019 the last thing you should be doing is believing all we\u2019re telling you. We make it up as we go along.\u201d\nIvan Stang hosts the 999 Club (1981)\nWHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?\nWith this funding, we can complete the remaining interviews, edit the film, animate key sequences, and all other post-production work necessary to bring this ridiculous story to the masses.\nA behind the scenes look at our film production.

Paul Mavrides is one of the originators and sustainers of the SubGenius aesthetic, and he is also a major artist whose work shows at Fine Art galleries and whose graphic design is sought after by companies like Apple. Writing about Paul for a recent show at the Steven Wolfe Fine Arts Gallery in San Francisco, art critic Mark Van Proyers said that SubGenius output is a key influence \"on much of the art production of the 1990s... and the mythomaniacal clip-art orgies that Mavrides concocted for several of the highly entertaining \u201cSubGenious\u201d books still seem to sustain a spot-on freshness\u2026.\"\nNEW REWARDS GENEROUSLY DONATED BY LOUIS BLACK, FROM HIS PERSONAL COLLECTION\nLouis Black is the co-founder of the Austin Chronicle and co-founder of the South By Southwest Music Festival and Conference (SXSW).\nANNOUNCING NEW REWARDS FROM COMIC BOOK ARTIST CULLY HAMNER.

Born on Kickstarter, this is our 6th campaign, and we are now back, faithful to our roots:  Our latest creations will ONLY be available here, on Kickstarter, for this Holiday Season, reserving a special thank you and exclusivity to our backers, who helped us grow to where we are today.  \nHere are our latest creations, and may they spark your imagination. Go play!\n    The Outlaws are 1920's-inspired, vintage wooden cars. We took cues from a mix of Art Deco modernism and the daredevil, rough and oily car culture of those years. In our era of clean, immediate digital entertainment, we want to bring some of these stories back, blending keen design, old-fashioned playtime and some storytelling.\nOur exclusive launch will feature five models total, and each has its own story and inspiration behind it. \n   This is inspired by the iconic American Truck - a newly mechanized workhorse during the late 20's and 30's.   This truck powered small businesses, construction and rebuilding projects, rumrunning, dustbowl migrations and post recession rebuild. It's ingrained in the pioneering spirit and hardships of that era, and we say it deserves a place in pop culture. The toy itself has a yellow and black herringbone pattern on the front radiator, a long bed to haul other toys, and a magnet \"hitch\" making sure the towed cars stay in place. \n  Our slickest, lowest riding racer. Stanced, bright blue, and decorated with a Carnival-inspired pattern, it flaunts a superstition-defying race no. 13. This is our flashiest car, with stories to tell. \n    A yellow-and red pill of a lowriding roadster, bearing the 250(mg) race number. Our first ever open-top car, sure to stand out in a toy collection.\n   A black matte coat of paint, a single red light arm placed sideways, and a scribbling of the precinct numbers on its roof: this is the epitome of the churning and drama of bringing law and order to those hard years. The toy carries the visual cues of an adventurous, free wheeling era: it stands for order, fierce car chases and keeping the lid on the bad guys. The car has a cute graphic on its belly, with tally marks that one assumes stand for the vanquished baddies.\n  This an homage to the fierce female race car drivers of the era. Maude Odell, Elinor Blevins, Kay Petre and many more others.  Their racers were sturdy, lifted, and off-roadish and we aimed to capture that look and stance with this toy. It has a spare tire, a positive (inward) suspension camber and a giant race number on its radiator.\nSo thats's what we've been sweating over all year folks!\n[Update]: The good Folks at CBS This Morning just gave us some sweet national TV thumbs up. They totally nailed what we are all about. Here they are visiting us at home and telling the world about it.  Million thanks to everyone there!\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/videos/toymakers-retro-cars-attract-both-adults-and-kids/#\n    At our Brooklyn Navy Yard workspace\n  Important details:\nShipping these rewards will be via either UPS or Priority US mail as appropriate, for all US-based backers. A couple of important points, especially if you are an international backer:\n- If your parcel sits unclaimed and / or you have not answered our increasingly alarmed emails, there is a chance it will be sent back, or abandoned at destination. We would not be able to resend your reward nor refund you in such a situation.\n- We can offer no refunds. If your set arrives damaged or somehow defective, we will replace it.\n- International backers will likely be charged customs fees or sales tax - even both at the same time! It's infrequently enforced, depending on each destination country and we really can't help this nor control it, but remember that essentially you are acquiring these items with no VAT or sales tax.\n But where are we with this process?\nWe started production a little while back to ensure our December delivery, but we need your help to make sure we can hit the MOQ counts our suppliers have to meet.\nThis is where you come in: with your backing, we can make sure that we have a home for these beauties, and for our end of the deal, we will ensure exclusivity: this Holiday Season, no one else will have access to these outside this campaign!\nSo for a truly special gift this Holiday season, hop on our bandwagon.\nThank you from all of us!", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Outlaw sticker pack", "descp": "The rebelest stickers one can get these days.

The first drawing will be comprised of all those  who pledged from the beginning of the campaign through August 31 and the second will consist of all pledgers from September 1 through the end of the campaign. See the band's Facebook pages for a video from Exene talking about this.\n**********************************************************************\nX! Live in Latin America! 40th Anniversary Celebration Continues!  \nWe want to release the first ever, all original X line up (Billy Zoom, DJ Bonebrake, John Doe, Exene Cervenka) LIVE X ALBUM! While there are other live recordings, this is the first and only one we are producing and releasing on our own.\nHere\u2019s the story\u2026 In November of 2011, X was fortunate to be touring Latin America as the opening band for Pearl Jam\u2019s South America Tour. What a life-changing and mind-altering experience it was! Our first show was in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We had no idea what the crowds would think of us, and we were really surprised when we started playing that first show.\nPJ\u2019s devoted fans were so welcoming and enthusiastic! We were playing stadiums, and sometimes it felt like a club. The early punk days in Los Angeles (and really, all the scenes in the U.S.) were about intensity as much as music. No barriers between band and people in the crowd. It was wild!  \nAnd on Thanksgiving, in Mexico City, playing and singing Los Angeles, while earthquakes rattled the Foro Sol Stadium stage, it felt that same way. We had that \u201cthis is crazy, this is only going to happen once so remember it and enjoy it\u201d feeling.\nX - Los Angeles 1981\n  X live in Brazil 2011\nWhile we toured in South America, Costa Rica, and Mexico, another fortunate thing happened. Pearl Jam\u2019s sound engineer recorded all our shows, and gave us these incredible, professional recordings to use.\nBut we didn\u2019t know what to do with the recordings! We didn\u2019t want to give them to a record label, or license the songs, we didn\u2019t even know if we could. We were apprehensive the songs would just disappear into somebody\u2019s pocket and never be heard from again. (We\u2019ve had a few bad experiences\u2026)   \nOne day a friend suggested we release the tracks via Kickstarter. We just needed someone great and amazing to mix the songs\u2026.  \nWe asked Rob Schnapf (Beck, Fidlar, Booker T., Elliot Smith) if he would produce, engineer and mix these for us. When he said yes, we decided to give this a go. Best case scenario!  \nWe came up with a long list of prizes and rewards for your patronage, should you be so kind as to donate to our project. There is something for everyone! X has always been a do-it-ourselves kind of band, as you will see by our rewards. We still love the hand-made, the paste-up, and the songbooks. Plus, you will get the first ever, all original member, X! LIVE RECORDING!   This is the ONLY place you can get it, as the album will be exclusive to this campaign and won't be available outside of that.\nX at the Roxy in LA by Rick Nyburg 2017\nThank you for staying with us the last 40 years! And thank you for funding our project. If we surpass our goal (which includes mixing & engineering, making & manufacturing rewards, and shipping & handling) we will use the money to keep our 2 vans running and keep ourselves touring. Maybe even get some matching outfits tailor-made\u2026. Gotta come up with something special for the 41st year.   \nTHANKS!!!  \nX\n*****TRACKS ON THE ALBUM LIKELY WILL INCLUDE*****\nYour Phone's Off The Hook  \nWhite Girl  \nHungry Wolf\nSugarlight  \nIt's Who You Know  \nDevil Doll  \nJohny Hit & Run Pauline  \nLos Angeles\nBlue Spark\nWe're Desperate  \nNausea  \nOnce Over Twice  \nThe World's A Mess  \nBecause I Do\nSoul Kitchen\nThe album will also likely include additional tracks but we won't know for sure until the mixing is completed.\n*****HIGHLIGHTED REWARD PACKAGES*****\nYou can see along the right hand side all the great reward packages we have available in detail. We wanted to highlight a few of them here as well, in order to draw your attention to the truly unique nature of this campaign. Many of these packages touch on other aspects of the band's creative lives and offer a different insight into who X really is.\n- Exene Art Postcards. This is a great way to get your hands on Exene's visual art. You'll get a set of  photographs of her work embodied on high quality postcards, with information about the work on the reverse side.\n- John's Book Club. You get a copy of a book picked out for you by John, with a message as to why he finds the book significant, what it means to him, etc. \n- Disposable Camera Tour Photos.  Ever wanted to see what life is really like on tour with X, behind the scenes? Now you can. You'll get the undeveloped disposable camera full of X tour photos. Each one of these packages will be totally unique, with pictures never to be used or seen in any other context.\n- Handwritten Lyric Sheets. Both John and Exene are offering this package, whereby they'll hand write the lyrics to an X song of your choice. Of course, this will also double as an artistic piece for the pledger, as the particular expression and style will be something only that band member could do.\n- Guided Tour of Grammy Museum. On October 13, the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles will open an exhibition dedicated to X.  Pledgers for this package will get treated to a personalized tour of the exhibition by Exene and DJ. You can ask any of those burning questions to which you've been dying to know the answer, as well as get an insight into the band and its history available nowhere else.\n- X and/or John and Exene Live. Ever had a notion that you wanted to see X or John and Exene in their acoustic duo performing for you and your friends? That's now a possibility.  Both of these packages require a lot of planning and discussion, so if you're interested you'll want to reach out via Kickstarter message and get the discussion rolling, but this is now possible!\nThese are just a few of the great packages we have available for pledgers.  We encourage you to look through them in detail, ask whatever questions you may have and we'll be happy to answer them. You can send questions via Kickstarter Message if you already have a Kickstarter account or XKickstarter@gmail.com.\nOne final note...often times in campaigns, people wish to pledge for more than one package.  Kickstarter limits you to one package per account, but if you have your eye on more than one, please contact us and we'll be happy to specify price and what you'll need to do in making your pledge.

Techniques like matte paintings and rear projections would make \u201eSlice of Life\u201c even more atmospheric and visually appealing, so it was always our wish to include them in our movie. If we reach this goal, that wish would become a reality! Plus, we would build even more more miniatures and that means a bigger, more vibrant cityscape!\n Our first stretch goal would enrich the visual appeal of the movie, and this one would add more drama and tension to its story. It is a scene that demands a brand new set, made from scratch, but it would be well worth it because that scene would give more gravitas to our main character and the struggle he has with himself, his nemesis and this damn city he's stuck in!\n\nEven though \u201eSlice of Life\u201c premiere will be held in Zagreb, Croatia, we always wanted to have another, international one. And what better place to do it than the center of film industry: Los Angeles. Not to mention that our movie is set in the streets and on the platforms of that same, albeit futuristic LA, so it would be kind of poetic! \u201eSlice of Life\u201c on the big screen, in-depth and detailed film-makers show and tell and a chance to hang out with you guys (and a couple of cold ones)... yap, that would be a dream come through!\n       When we started working on \u201cSlice of Life\u201d, we wanted to make an original movie set in a rather familiar world, and the biggest influence for us was clearly \u201cBlade Runner\u201d, as Ridley Scott, Jordan Cronenweth, and other movie legends envisioned it back in 1982.\nWet, foggy, and gritty streets of futuristic Los Angeles were a perfect place for our story, but we didn\u2019t want to just copy/paste it and shoot a replica\u2026 We wanted to pay our tribute to \u201cBlade Runner\u201d in terms of aesthetics, and at the same time make \u201cSlice of Life\u201d something more than a mere fan-film or a sequel, with an unique storyline that doesn\u2019t rely on anything seen in the \u201cBlade Runner\u201d universe.\nThat being said, \u201cSlice of Life\u201d is a tasteful homage to the masterpiece that inspired us on so many levels and we are honored if anyone can put our little movie in the same sentence as one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of our time, but that is where the connections between these two movies end and our paths diverge. \nThe duration of the short film will be approximately 20 minutes.\n    Follow Slice Of Life on: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\n  It is just another damp, rainy, and foggy night on the streets of the futuristic Los Angeles. Beneath the flashy neon signs and heavy traffic, scum of this megalopolis tries to make a living and hopefully survive to see another day.\nCriminals, junkies, prostitutes, punks\u2026 and one lonesome drug dealer in the middle of it all, fed up with this ever expanding city and lowlife parasites that inhabit it. He may be well on his way to leave it all behind, but fate has made other plans and his whole world will come crumbling down when a dirty cop with an agenda of his own enters his life.\n  A big part of that 70s and 80s Sci-Fi allure comes from the use of practical special effects. Visionaries of that era relied on miniatures and models, animatronics, matte paintings, and other techniques for creation of those lavish imaginary worlds. Even today, 30 or 40 years later, the charm and depth of their work remains unparalleled. We are not against CGI and other modern era tools (we use it heavily in our commercial work), but in order to pay a worthy homage to our predecessors, we wanted to make \u201cSlice of Life\u201d as authentic as we could.\nSo, everything you see in our trailer and will see in the completed movie is made the \u201cold-school\u201d way.\nWe learned to build miniatures, light them properly, learned how to create practical effects, so that we could film everything in camera like people did back in the 80s. We filmed on real sets that we built from scratch for \u201cSlice of Life\u201d. All of the miniatures and real-sized sets were created from cheap materials, junk, computer parts, and lots of imagination.\nBuilding the \"car set\":\nOld Citro\u00ebn BX 1986 bought for the production\n    Finished car interior\n Building the miniature car for exterior scenes:\nMiniature car model\n    We have spent the last three years in a garage, taking every spare moment of our time and all of our skill, dedicating it to bringing \u201cSlice of Life\u201d to\u2026 well, life.\nOur core team consists of only three people, and with some help of our friends and family, we carried this project on our backs for as long as we could, but we realized that, in order to finish our movie in the way we envisioned it, we need the help from our fans and the wider community. As a platform best suited for our needs, we chose Kickstarter to present this movie, connect us with our audience, and give you a chance to be an essential part in the creation of \u201cSlice of Life\u201d.\nFilming the miniature city\n  Filming the car interior\n    We need you guys to help us finish the movie. A big part of the movie is shot, but we have an extensive miniature shoot ahead of us and a complicated post-production process.\nFor the miniature shoot we need better equipment like new lenses and additional lighting, and a professional motion control system (because everything will be shot in passes*).\n*Shooting in passes - a complicated and slow process of shooting the same shot multiple times in different lighting conditions, the same way it was done in the 80's.\nThere\u2019s also lots of additional miniature building which is very time consuming so we need to put our daily commercial work on hold.\nUnpainted building made from junk / Finished miniature building\nThe cherry on top will be the soundtrack. Vangelis is infiltrated in our minds and souls, so we have a pretty big mountain to climb. Help us, and together we\u2019ll put our \u201cSlice of Life\u201d flag on top of it!\n  First and foremost, you get our deepest gratitude, not just for helping us financially, but for believing in us and our project. We want to thank you for your support and trust, and give you something to remember \"Slice of Life\" as one of your fondest memories in the years to come.\nThat being said, we prepared lots of cool \u201cSlice of Life\u201d props, T-shirts, special \u201cSlice of Life\u201d collectors\u2019 boxes and a beautiful movie soundtrack, exclusively pressed on vinyl. Of course, there will be one more thing - this finished short film called \u201cSlice of Life\u201d, which you will be able to enjoy for a very long time in the years to come.\n    Limited edition police badge, cast from the production molds\n    This cute spaceship is looking for a new home!\n  With less than 2 weeks to go, we\u2019ve decided to stir things up a bit and offer you something really special: two new awesome and unique rewards!\nIt\u2019s the one that our character drives throughout the whole movie and basically is a character of its own. This is not just a screen used model or fun looking prop that would look nice on your shelf, it is a true piece of craftsmanship, and a piece of our film\u2019s history.\nWe\u2019ll create a unique 15-second retro sci-fi commercial for your business, that will be featured in \u201cSlice of Life\u201d as one of the commercials projected on those huge building screens for 5 seconds. And now the best part, you\u2019ll get full copyright for the 15-second commercial to use it in real life promotion for your company! Show the ad to the world on your web site, social media, YouTube, TV etc.!\n You like our reward tiers and want to contribute, but feel like you\u2019re missing out on something?

We\u2019ll send you a survey after the end of the Kickstarter campaign regarding the add-ons you chose.\nAfter we have launched our trailer, we had great luck to be picked up by many esteemed international publications like \u201cThe Verge\u201d, \u201cio9 Gizmodo\u201d, \u201cHuffington Post\u201d and movie fan sites like \u201cJo Blo\u201d.\nWe appreciate all the help that we have managed to get so far.

We want to make \u201cSlice of Life\u201d an unforgettable experience for fans of the genre and also for those who don\u2019t really know that much about it, and to pay a truly worthy tribute to the classics that kept inspiring us for so many years.\n\nWe hope that we are not alone in this and that you share our love and admiration of those classics (and movies in general), and we welcome you to join us on our adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "** Exclusive Featurette **", "descp": "Wanna learn about the magic of miniatures?

We love playing cards, but we couldn\u2019t really find anything that was quite suited for our minimalist way of traveling. When you travel as much as we do, you don\u2019t want to carry anything extra around. Every item makes a difference. We\u2019re big fans of improvement, and decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers. The making of the Air Deck has taken us through several countries, and we\u2019ve met many wonderful people along the way. Now we have the prototype ready and we\u2019re proud of the result. Meet our new travel companion, the Air Deck. The world's first truly travel optimized playing cards!\nThe Air Deck team\nKey Features:\n52 Playing Cards + 2 jokers\nWaterproof and washable\nPremium printing with a protective matte varnish\nMade from extra durable premium PVC\nSlightly textured back, smooth front \nSturdy deluxe matte tuck box \nPlaying card size : 3.43 x 1.26 inches (87 x 32mm)\nPerks:\nFree world-wide shipping\nFree PDF \u201cCard games from around the world\u201d\nOption to buy the Air Deck in white color\nHere's a mock-up of how the Air Deck will look in red color.\n  With the Air Deck with you can play everywhere anytime. It fits easily on small surfaces, such as a plane tray table.\n  Regular paper playing cards tear, stain, bend and break easily, but we've designed the Air Deck to be extremely durable.\nQuality\nWhile we wanted a compact and light deck, we didn't want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world\u2019s manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high end plastic materials. The materials were taken through  scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want.\nThe cards have a premium feel to them.\n  The Air Deck is designed to be brought anywhere. It takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket.\nThe Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and it\u2019s totally waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of.\nThe cards are 100% waterproof, so you can even use them in the pool or the bathtub.\n  The cards are washable. Liquids and dust rinse off easily.\n  The Air Deck is a surefire convesation starter.\nHandling\nIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals, to help us find the optimal material and design. The end result a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on the back, while the front is plain. This provides excellent handling and a good grip.\nThe Air Deck shuffles easily\n  Our goal was to make the Air Deck both visually interesting and simple to read.\nDesign\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to create a fitting minimalist design for the Air Deck. For us, it was key that the cards are uncluttered, symmetrical and easy to read. We also wanted to create something fun and \u2018out-of-the- ordinary\u2019. The Air Deck\u2019s unique design will no doubt act as a conversation starter on your travels. The deck consists of 52 playing cards + 2 jokers and measures 87mm X 32mm. Despite the smaller footprint we\u2019ve retained all the features of standard decks. The length ensures that it handles much like a full size deck, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.\nJack, queen, king and ace of hearts.\n  The Air Deck comes with a solid tuck box. It's laminated for extra protection and features spot UV printing.\n For this campaign we\u2019re offering the cards in two different colors; black and white.\nThe Air Deck in black color\n  The Air Deck in white color.\n  The Air Deck in red color\nWe hope that you are as excited about the Air Deck as we are. Support our project, and give yourself, or someone you care about, the perfect playing cards for traveling.\nAdd a nice view to your game.\n  The Air Deck is incredibly strong and flexible.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe do not anticipate any major challenges to this project, and we promise to stay transparent and update you every step of the way. \n\nMuch of the work is already done. The design phase of the cards is finalized and we\u2019ve made the prototype you see in the video. We\u2019ve had personal meetings with the manufacturer and agreed on all details, and we've gotten several quotes for fulfillment and shipping from reliable partners.

The common card deck is right-handed. So it goes. Over the years, there have been left-handed decks, but not a single one has celebrated the many famous lefties of the world. A missed opportunity in our book. With the Sinister Deck, we set out to bring lefties and righties alike a deck that's unique, a little bit educational, and plenty of good fun.\nWhat makes our deck special?\nContains 54 custom, hand-illustrated cards by Michael White\n18 \"face cards\" featuring famous Left-Handed people (16 Ace-Jack + 2 Jokers)\nEach suit is a different theme: Hearts are Musicians, Spades are Historical Figures, Clubs are Politicians, and Diamonds are Film/TV Personalities\nOur deck is \"Left-handed\": Card Indicators are on the opposite sides so you can fan the cards \"left-handed\"\nSpecial Details: We added a few subtle touches to the designs that die-hard fans will notice.  We also retained traditional deck details like the \"suicidal king\" and \"one eyed jacks\". \nUPDATE:\nGUEST ARTIST: We have brought on the insanely talented (and left-handed) Danny Beck to draw a bonus card that will be included in the deck. Check out his art if you don't already know him and give that feller a follow. We're super excited to see what he comes up with.\nSTRETCH GOAL: $25k unlocks 20 additional lefties featured on the 6-10 number cards in monochrome \nBONUS: All Rewards above $100 get a free deck of cards.  \nAll Reward levels will have the chance to add on extra items via BackerClub\nCard Illustrations\nJoan of Arc prototype as one of the number cards for our stretch goal\nThe Lefties\nWhen we started this project, we had no idea how hard it would be to narrow down the ranks of left-handed visionaries to 18 people.

Thanks to all of you who helped us reach our stretch goal of $100,000 to support the conservation of puppets in the Museum\u2019s Jim Henson Collection.  \nFor the remainder of our Kickstarter campaign, we invite you to help support the production of the two interactive experiences in The Jim Henson Exhibition as we strive for a second and final stretch goal of $125,000. These interactive experiences are key ingredients in the exhibition, and with additional funding, we can build them as imagined. They demonstrate two of Henson\u2019s most significant innovations: puppetry for the television screen and puppet character design.  \n\u201cPerform a Puppet on Screen\u201d gives visitors an opportunity to experience first-hand what it is like to watch themselves perform a puppet on a television monitor. When they\u2019re finished, they will be able to email a video of their performance to themselves. \nThe \u201cDesign an Anything Muppet Character\u201d experience begins with a short video featuring Henson puppet-builder Rollie Krewson demonstrating how she designs \u201cAnything Muppet\u201d characters for Sesame Street. Visitors will be able to select facial features and accessories for an \u201cAnything Muppet\u201d form, and see what their character looks like on screen.  \nThese two interactive experiences will allow visitors to get creative and discover their inner character designer and puppeteer!\nStretch Goal: $100,000 to restore more puppets!\nWe are so grateful for the outpouring of support from the community of Jim Henson fans! Your generosity has enabled us to meet our goal of $40,000 to preserve and install the puppets in The Jim Henson Exhibition in just two days!\nWe hope you will continue to support us and help us spread the word about this campaign, as we extend our efforts to preserve Jim\u2019s legacy: we are setting a new goal of $100,000, which will help us restore more puppets in the Museum\u2019s Jim Henson collection. The Jim Henson Exhibition at MoMI and its traveling version, The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited, will feature many of Jim\u2019s unique puppets, but there are many more \u201cwaiting in the wings\u201d for their turn! As The Jim Henson Exhibition is a permanent exhibition at the Museum, the puppets in the original installation will rotate off at times for routine conservation, and it is imperative that other puppets be ready to take their place!\nThe Museum\u2019s Jim Henson collection includes puppets from all of Jim\u2019s work for film and television. To name just a few: \nKermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Rowlf, Beaker, Gonzo, Zoot, the Swedish Chef, the Koozebanians, and Camilla from The Muppet Show; \nBig Bird, Elmo, Count von Count, Grover, Cookie Monster, Prairie Dawn, Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street; \nJunior Gorg, Doozers, and all the Fraggles from Fraggle Rock; \nJen, Kira, Aughra, Pod people and a Skeksis and Mystic from The Dark Crystal; \nRare puppets from Jim\u2019s television commercials and other early work in the 1950s and 1960s, including Yorick from Sam and Friends, the LaChoy Dragon, Wilkins and Wontkins, Sir Linit, Taminella Grinderfall, the \u201cJava\u201d puppets, and the Tastee Freeze Boss; \nPuppets from Emmet Otter\u2019s Jugband Christmas, The Muppet Musicians of Bremen, Faffner Hall, and much more! \nWe cannot thank you enough for your overwhelming support. We are thrilled to be working with you all to preserve this unique and important collection for generations to come.\nWith a generous gift of hundreds of puppets and artifacts from the Henson family, Museum of the Moving Image in New York City plans to open a brand new, permanent exhibition dedicated to the work of legendary puppeteer and director Jim Henson. Over the course of a singular career, Henson created stories and characters for television and film that have delighted and inspired generations of fans around the world \u2014 from the glamorous Miss Piggy and the gentle Grover, to the mystical creatures of The Dark Crystal. The Jim Henson Exhibition will share the full story of Henson\u2019s unique talent, and the deeply collaborative creative process behind his work.\nWhat will the exhibition include?\nThe exhibition will feature more than 40 original puppets \u2014 including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Elmo, Cookie Monster, the Fraggles, and a Skeksis from The Dark Crystal \u2014 as well as puppet prototypes, original character sketches, rare behind-the-scenes footage and photographs, and interactive puppetry design and performance experiences.\nSections of the exhibition will be devoted to:\nHenson\u2019s early work for television and film in the 1950s and 60s, in which his unbridled imagination, wit, and capacity for creative innovation were clearly established \nSesame Street, where his remarkably expressive puppets have delighted children for generations \nThe Muppet Show and Muppet feature films, which have had an indelible impact on popular culture \nand the imaginary worlds of Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth\nPreserving the puppets for future generations\nThe Jim Henson Collection at Museum of the Moving Image includes approximately 175 historic puppets, such as Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Big Bird, Ernie, Bert, Elmo, the Fraggles, Jen and Kira from The Dark Crystal, and many, many more. The restoration of this important collection is an ongoing collaboration between the Museum and Jim Henson\u2019s Creature Shop, with input from fine art conservators. The Museum is honored to be working with the designers and builders at the legendary Creature Shop to restore and preserve the puppets for future generations.\nAbout the traveling exhibition\nThe Museum is excited to launch a traveling version of the exhibition, The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited, which will tour around the country and the world! The tour kicks off at Seattle\u2019s Museum of Pop Culture on May 20, 2017. We are thrilled that the flagship and traveling versions of the exhibition will reach such a large, diverse audience.\nAbout the screenings and public programs \nThe Museum is already a busy hub of Henson-related activity and programming: we host monthly screenings of Henson\u2019s work that draw a large, enthusiastic audience, and we have piloted an engaging slate of education and family programs related to the exhibition, which will serve school groups and families all year long.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nThe lasting, universal appeal of Henson\u2019s work is unprecedented. People of all ages continue to be delighted and inspired by Jim Henson\u2019s stories and characters. We\u2019re excited to use Kickstarter to connect with Henson fans around the world, and bring this global community together to support a permanent exhibition honoring his creative legacy.\nWhat will your contributions support? \nThe City of New York awarded the Museum a generous grant that has enabled us to build the gallery in which this important and inspiring exhibition will be housed. Construction of the gallery space is complete and plans for the exhibition have been finalized.\n\nBut we need your support to bring the rest of this incredible exhibition to life, in time for the 2017 school year. Your pledges will help us complete the important work of restoring the puppets in the Museum\u2019s Henson Collection and fabricating and installing the display cases for the puppets and other artifacts. \nYour contributions will ensure that hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world will be inspired by the creative process behind Jim Henson\u2019s work, and be able to get up close and personal with such beloved puppet characters as Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Elmo, Big Bird, the Fraggles, and many more.\nRewards\nVideo credits  \nVideo production by Slam!

They were popular on the indie rock circuit and paved the way for artists like Sufjan Stevens and Mumford & Sons, making well-respected music that didn't shy away from themes of faith. The band\u2019s sales and notoriety increased steadily throughout the early 2000s. But in 2006 Dave entered a time of deep personal introspection and began peeling back the layers of his beliefs. Initially he thought the process would lead him closer to the Christian God he believed in. Instead, HIS FAITH BEGAN TO COMPLETELY UNRAVEL, leading to the breakup of his band, a massive bout of writer\u2019s block, and a drinking problem. The onset of this dark season was publicly punctuated with a Washington Post article titled \u201cHallelujah Palooza\u201d where Dave was described as having \u201calready blown through a gallon jug of water mixed with Vodka\u201d at the strictly dry Cornerstone Christian Music Festival. \nThe mixture of NEWFOUND MEANINGLESSNESS AND ALCOHOL was a dangerous combination as he torched relationships, alienated his audience, and found himself unable to write new music. In losing his band. Dave lost his sole means of providing for his family of four. To maintain their bottom line, he was forced to strip down his touring method. Without a stage or even amplification, he began playing secondary and tertiary markets, performing literally in people\u2019s living rooms. He toured the country, driving alone for weeks at a time. In that solitude he WRESTLED WITH ALL HIS IDEAS ABOUT GOD, and finally left the Christian faith.\nIn the years since, Dave has been reconstructing his worldview from the ground up. Trying to figure out WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? And what does it mean for his work, his family, and society as a whole. And since we believe these are some of the most important questions one can ask, WE DECIDED TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT IT.\n  THE FILM\nWe\u2019ve been following Dave for two years. Riding in the van across the country, shooting in living rooms and rock clubs and having deep talks with Dave and the people who cross his path. And it has been a beautiful and fascinating journey. From the release of his 2016 album BLANCO through the creation and release of CARE (launching simultaneously with the Kickstarter.) we've been there for the ups and downs of Dave's life on the road as a working class musician. What we have is a stunning film about ART, FAITH, AND THE COURAGE TO BREAK RANKS IN SEARCH OF TRUTH. The footage we've captured, along with Dave\u2019s 20 year body of work give the audience a front row seat to the heartbreakingly intimate process of a man losing his faith, his worldview, and slogging eyes open through the stages of grief.\nTHIS IS A FILM FOR OUR TIMES. While the subject is a musician, this is not a tour documentary, a fan film, or a music doc in the traditional sense. It is instead an exploration of modern American spirituality viewed through the lens of an EXTRAORDINARY ARTIST GRAPPLING WITH HIS PERSONAL FAITH. And now is the perfect time for a film dealing with these questions. When we as a nation are struggling with our very identity, defining what is real, and what matters to us going forward. CHRISTIANITY IS AT THE CRUX OF THE DIVIDE IN AMERICA and Dave is one of the rare voices who is able to speak to both sides. His critically acclaimed record \u201cCurse Your Branches\u201d, was called his \u201cbreak up record with God\u201d by the biggest music journalists, but also somehow found its way onto the list of the Top Ten albums of the year by the massively influential, Christianity Today. Dave's living room shows, featuring no holds barred Q&A sessions, give us an incredibly rare look into the earnest discussions about faith and politics happening in small cities across the country. \nWe are making this film without an agenda beyond exploring the fascinating story of one man's wrestling with his beliefs. IT'S NOT A TAKEDOWN PIECE meant to insult people of faith, NOR A FLUFF PIECE meant to prop up easy orthodoxies. The tone will match Dave's humble, thoughtful, yet challenging style as it explores the journey from faithfulness to unbelief. We'll dig into all the doubt in-between without an axe to grind. We're interested in the COMPLICATED BEAUTY OF ALL THE GRAYS OF LIFE at a time when black and white answers feel fleeting.\n  Thus far we've worked on a shoestring, with the generous support of Fork Films, Barsuk Records and few key individuals who know this film is something really special. But now it\u2019s time for us to lock ourselves in a room and turn all this incredible footage into a film.  \nWE ARE LOOKING TO RAISE 75K (at least!). This is the bare minimum amount necessary to get us to a festival cut of the film with editing, composing, mixing, color correcting, and any additional photography we discover we need in the process. If we exceed our goal we will have more freedom and time to achieve the best version of this film. We will also be able to invest in the crucial marketing and PR necessary to get the word out.\nWe've partnered with Palaceworks, & Scraplabs to create some amazing exclusive perks for you. We're incredibly grateful for their involvement. We think you'll be excited about what they've come up with. Thanks also to Ryan Russell for the use of some of his images.\nLastly, YOU are essential to this process. As fans of Dave Bazan you know all the ways he and his music have impacted your life. We\u2019re looking to amplify his message exponentially, and we can\u2019t do that without your support. Please SPREAD THE WORD far and wide and follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. You can also sign up for our official mailing list at bazanfilm.com\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out to us with any questions.

See 'Add-ons' below.\n Select 24K Gold Plated coins now available! See 'Add-ons' below.\nWhat are Hobo Coins?\nThroughout time, people have modified coins by hand-carving or engraving their own designs into existing coins. But this form of folk art really took off during the Great Depression. Those that were out of work or down on their luck took to modifying coins by engraving their own designs into them. They would use pocket knives or even filed down nails to carve beautiful designs that were as varied as the artists themselves. Often, these coins would portray skeletons or skulls, incorporating elements from the coins as part of their final works of art. They would almost always keep the lettering on the coins.\nThe Hobo Coins project brings back this largely forgotten piece of American history. These coins are being minted by the oldest continuously operated private mint in the U.S. and are SOLID. They each weigh about the same as 5 US. quarters, and are a little larger than the size of a US Dollar coins (these coins are 39 mm). Die-struck with over 100 tons of pressure in solid metal alloys and featuring antique finishes. Please note that Hobo Coins are not actual US currency or modified US currency coins, they are die-struck new coins at different sizes, weights, and (clearly), different art than actual US coins.\nHelp revive a piece of history you can carry!\nThe Designs\nEach coin was crafted and designed by me using some of the most iconic coins as their base:\nThe \u2018R.I.P.\u2019 - 1922 Peace Dollar\nArguably the most beautiful coin ever produced, the U.S. Peace Dollar was originally produced to commemorate the peace that followed World War One. My rendition features a skull portrait (keeping the radiant crown) on the front (obverse), and two skeletal hands breaking a rifle on the back (reverse). Interesting to note that the \u2018broken rifle\u2019 was abstracted into the Peace Symbol we know today. Rest in Peace! Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. Also, this coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original Peace Dollar.\nThe 'R.I.P. Dollar - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Bad Mojo\u2019 - 1936 Buffalo Nickel\nMy take on the classic Buffalo Nickel hobo coin (popular because it was a \u2018soft\u2019 coin to carve), features a skeleton Chief with a no-nonsense attitude on the front, and an intricately carved buffalo skeleton on the back. Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'flat' edge like the original Buffalo Nickel.\nThe 'Bad Mojo' - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Walking Reaper\u2019 - 1936 Walking Liberty Half Dollar\nScares the sh*t outta me\u2014and that\u2019s a good thing! Based on what is considered one the most beautiful coins of all time, the Walking Liberty Half Dollar. Front side (obverse) features a grim reaper you never want to meet, and the back of the coin shows a Poe-esque scene with a raven. Nevermore! Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original Walking Liberty Half Dollar.\nThe 'Walking Reaper' - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Old Hobo\u2019 - 1891 Morgan Dollar\nEven hobos like a drink! The front face (obverse) of the coin features a hobo skeleton enjoying a pint. The back side (reverse) shows a skeleton hobo chilling in a box car with his loyal dog companion. Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original Morgan Dollar.\nThe 'Old Hobo' - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Hobo Coin / Hobo Signs\u2019 Limited Edition Print\nTo compliment the coins, I\u2019ve designed this print which features a hobo walking through a shanty town along railroad tracks carrying a gunny sack, and is emblazoned with 'Liberty' at the top. Each print is 18\u201d x 24\u201d, signed, and numbered.\n'Liberty' - inspired by coin typography and hobo coin art, each 18\" x 24\" print will be signed and numbered.\nAdd-ons\nAdditional coins or posters can be added to any base pledge as needed. Simply click on \u2018Manage My Pledge\u2019 and manually increase your pledge amount by the following:\nCoins - add $14 (in the US), 15$ (international) to your pledge amount per additional coin, feel free to add as many as you would like.

Her groundbreaking look, attitude, and performance were all years ahead of their time and continue to influence everyone from Quentin Tarantino and Rob Zombie to John Waters and Dita Von Teese. \nStill, Tura's screen life was nothing compared to her real life. As a child, Tura was imprisoned at Japanese American WWII internment camp Manzanar. As a pre-teen, she was the victim of a brutal, racially-motivated gang rape. But instead of letting those early tragedies destroy her, Tura flipped it around, reinventing herself into a world famous burlesque dancer, Asian American cinema hero, and most importantly, the living definition of female self-empowerment.\nFeaturing incredible new interviews with John Waters, Dita Von Teese & more, and narrated by Margaret Cho, TURA! will be a fascinating, thrilling white-knuckle ride through the life and career of one of the most infamous \u201cbad girls\u201d in cinema history. TURA! also serves to finally place Tura Satana alongside Bruce Lee in the pantheon of the most influential Asian American performers the world has ever known.\nThe production of this film was Tura Satana\u2019s deathbed wish. Help her, and us, make it a reality. TURA! -- Just do it!\n(This film is the AUTHORIZED DOCUMENTARY Tura Satana personally initiated prior to her death, being produced by her estate and closest friends).\nSEE THE NEW INDIEWIRE ARTICLE HERE!\nDespite her underground popularity and huge internet presence, Tura\u2019s accomplishments and vast influence remain largely unrecognized. Tura fought long and hard for gains that others have since reaped the benefits from. It\u2019s time to set the story straight! Tura didn\u2019t just \u2018open the door\u2019 for modern Hollywood\u2019s dominant leading ladies, she literally kicked that hole through the wall, blazing the path for others to follow. She deserves acknowledgement for that, and this film \u2013 created by those who knew and worked with her \u2013 gives her the respect and recognition she is long overdue. Tura\u2019s \u201cIf I can do this, anyone can\u201d attitude has inspired countless people in the past, and can now go on to inspire even more!\nOnce the film is completed (we estimate a year or less), we will use all of the means at our disposal to find the best possible release and distribution for the film. That includes screening at key festivals, distributor screenings, and inclusion at international film markets. We are very confident that the film will find wide release platforms, so all of our work will be shared with the world.\nTURA!

(It's Tura, we'll pick something amazing!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a film like this (independent documentary) has risks, many of which have already been taken on by the filmmakers. We've invested more than three years of time and our own money to get this off the ground. If this film were not finished & released, it would be both a financial blow and a loss of the time and effort spent by the crew and our amazing interview subjects. But this is something we believe in very strongly, so were willing to take on the risk in the interest of getting Tura's story told.\n \nHowever, the risk in not completing this film goes beyond financial... \n\nWe\u2019ve already captured moving, indepth, sometimes hilarious interviews- \n\nJOHN WATERS recalling his discovery of TURA, and being so excited he brought DIVINE with him to the next show\u2026 DENNIS BUSCH on working with Tura and RUSS MEYER in the Mojave Desert on Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!... TED V. MIKELS discussing his decades of Tura\u2026 the impact DITA VON TEESE felt when seeing Tura for the first time, and more. \n\nMany of these deeply personal memories and feelings have NEVER BEEN REVEALED BEFORE; gleams of personality and cinema history that will FALL AWAY, FORGOTTEN unless this film reaches its goal. Losing these touching, informative moments and breaking our final promise to Tura is the biggest risk of all, and something we can't let happen!\n\nThe Challenge\n\nThe depth and breadth of Tura Satana's life experiences could fill ten films. Tura \u201cbrings a lot to the table.\u201d The challenge here is not so much production delays (as this is a documentary), but rather choosing which of the many the impactful, meaningful events go into the film. No easy task! We're not just \"glossing over\" Tura's looks and career; her real life was much more harrowing than any movie script could be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "GO, BABY, GO!", "descp": "Show your support for Tura by helping to make her life\u2019s dream become a reality!

The film is complete and has enjoyed a successful festival run since its world premiere at the 2016 SXSW Film Festival. Though we cleared the music and footage rights to allow us to screen at festivals, we now need to clear those rights to allow for a worldwide release. With your support this can happen and we will be able to make the film available to music and movie fans around the world. In the process you will help to tell the incredible stories of these three remarkable men, preserve an important part of history and maybe, just maybe, help to get Hubert Sumlin elected to the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame. \n I have always been a huge music fan. As a kid it was Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, The Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, The Who and The Band. One of my favorite records was The Rolling Stones, \"Love You Live.\" I particularly loved the song \u201cMannish Boy.\u201d After seeing The Last Waltz for the first time and watching this guy named Muddy Waters (with a bushy haired Bob Margolin) perform that Rolling Stones song, my lifelong love and appreciation for the blues was born. In 2008 I was fortunate to meet and work with Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin and Willie \u201cBig Eyes\u201d Smith. After hearing their first hand accounts of life growing up in the Delta and experiences as sidemen for the legendary Muddy Waters and larger-than-life Howlin' Wolf, I knew I had to make a film that honored these men and the great legacies that they were a part of. My initial thought was to shoot a Last Waltz-style concert film, pairing these great blues musicians with all the rock and blues stars that covered, and in many cases made famous, the great blues-rock songs I grew up loving. But, the fates had other plans and what resulted after seven years is Sidemen: Long Road To Glory. I believe the film we made far surpasses my initial vision. My hope is that the film we created is worthy of these incredible musicians, the band leaders they played with and the great legacies they left behind. I believe that we have and I thank you for being a part of it. \nScott Rosenbaum - Director \n  Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin and Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith by: Jerome Brunet and Sandro Miller\n  Pinetop, Willie and Hubert were some of our last direct links to the origins of Delta and Chicago blues. As sidemen to the great Muddy Waters and Holwin' Wolf they were a part of some of the most recognizable and influential blues recordings of all time. The influence and cultural impact of these men and the legacies that they are a part of is incalculable. \nGet the Sidemen: Long Road To Glory button made specifically for the Kickstarter campaign and featuring the neon title design by artist Conrad Kochek\n    Get your Sidemen: Long Road To Glory T-shirt with the movie's official poster featuring Jerome Brunet's image of Pinetop Perkins.\n  Show your support for Hubert Sumlin's induction to the R&R Hall of Fame.

With a successful campaign we will move quickly to complete the clearance process, partner with a distributor and release the film. We want to be as clear as possible, this will take some time and may delay the shipment of the DVD.

He's a well-meaning genie, blissfully ignorant of his own power or purpose. Nothing can disturb his placid demeanor.\nIn my day-to-day art practice, it's fairly typical for me to exhaust myself with over-planning, sacrificing too much of the 'joy of making' in the name of attention to detail. So Rainpuppy began as an exercise in letting go - in between more 'professional' art undertakings, I would do a loose comic page here and there in a sketchbook specifically designated for the purpose. The idea was to return to my roots and draw something the way I would when I was a kid - wholly improvised, with absolutely no preparatory sketching or corrections. So the whole comic was made by putting ink straight to paper, not knowing what was going to happen in the next panel. The resulting action proceeds with the kind of absurd role-playing game logic you'd find in Adventure Time. It's a lyrical, meandering stream-of-consciousness, and hopefully also a soothing tonic to current events.\n\nYou may also detect faint notes of Moomin, Mushi-Shi, Studio Ghibli films (especially My Neighbor Totoro and The Secret World of Arrietty), and I guess also Winnie the Pooh?\nThe book will be 5 x 7-1/8\", 40 pages. The contents are divided in 4 vignettes, each comprised of 9 comic pages and 1 full-page painting. You can check out one of the four parts in the link at the top of this page!\nPrinting will be done on a risograph - a kind of duplicator manufactured in Japan. You can think of risographs as something like automatic screen printers that look a lot like photocopiers. The machines force eco-friendly soy ink from color drums through automatically-generated stencils. Risographs have become popular in alternative comics as an affordable way to achieve pretty colors in a small-sized print run. Part of the appeal also comes from the slight misregistration that can occur with multiple impressions. These 'beautiful imperfections' assure no two prints are exactly the same. Because the soy inks are translucent, they can be printed on top of each other to yield new colors. The art in Rainpuppy is designed to use three risograph ink colors (dark blue, fluorescent pink, and yellow), achieving a faux-CYMK color gamut that I expect to be reminiscent of the comic strips you'd find in the Sunday funny pages.\nThe books will be printed on super nice speckly paper, sustainably-milled by French Paper Co! Their paper has a pleasing tactility, as well as great chemistry with risograph ink, yielding bright matte colors. All matte everything. I wanted to make something that looks and feels rustic and natural, because I think that will resonate with the imagery in the comic. I think if a project consumes paper, it should feel deluxe and not disposable!\nThe content is all-ages. It wasn't really made for kids, but it's kid-friendly, and could make a great gift! The visual language of the book is pretty unsophisticated, and could hopefully even encourage kids to think \"I could do that,\" and draw their own comics.\nFor what it's worth, these books will be a hand-numbered limited edition! I do intend to fully meet demand though, so it's not meant to imply rarity or that this will necessarily be the only way to access the material forever - I just believe in moving on from a project once it's done, so there will never be another luxurious artist-produced print edition like this.\n- The Rainpuppy Tee: Screen printed on American Apparel Fine Jersey Crewneck T-Shirts (Red), available in XS-3XL. Youth sizes are available as well! Please note that youth tees may end up being Gildan instead of American Apparel. You'll be able to choose your size on a survey sent out after the fundraiser. If you are interested in pledging for multiple shirts, please message me.\n  - PDFs: All backers will receive a download link to a digital version of the full comic.\n- Process Post: I'm going to make a post summarizing my process for making the art for Rainpuppy, including information about the tools I used!\n- $1900: Free stickers for everyone who pledges toward the 2nd pledge level and above. Stickers will be die-cut, meaning puppy-shaped, not a lame rectangle!\n- $2700: Screen printed dust jackets for all the physical books. I'm really hoping we can get here, because it will really be the cherry on top, making the book feel like a more complete object.\nNote: cover art will be printed in differing colors by risograph if the $2700 stretch goal is not met.\n   (Website, Twitter)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the artwork is done and I've successfully fulfilled two Kickstarter campaigns before, so there aren't many foreseeable hurdles.

Psychological decision making in your dialogues with other characters.\nAnd a heavy emphasis on an RPG-like narrative with branching outcomes.\nYou will explore the jungles and rivers of Vietnam in first person perspective.  You join a crew of \u201crock and rollers with one foot in their grave\u201d.\nIt\u2019s like Fallout: New Vegas on acid in the middle of the Vietnam War.\nYour ultimate mission is to assassinate Colonel Kurtz, a rogue American officer who is accused of forming a private army and operating \"totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct.\u201d\nCombat is often your last resort; the wise soldier will avoid the ever-looming enemy at all costs.\nMaintaining resources and relationships is key to your survival and your success.\nYou will play Captain Willard.\nAnd you have a mission, but between receiving your mission in the hotel room and meeting Colonel Kurtz, how you journey upriver on PBR Streetgang is up to you.\nYou will engage in dialog, like in most roleplaying games, but you are a Special Forces operative, so your dialog will be like Captain Willard's dialog.\nYou aren't chatty, you get to the point, but you are friendly and charming when you want to be. You are alienated.  You are entertaining alternate points-of-view about the war and the world.\nBut you are also an assassin.\nAn assassin doesn't fire their weapon unless they have to.\nSo you will creep through the jungle.\nYou will engage in what everyone calls \"stealth gameplay.\" Your sneaking will be based on both your personal skill and your character skills (which will be built out by you as you gain experience during your journey up the river).\nWhy character skill?\nBecause this is an RPG. You are building your version of Captain Willard, not ours and not necessarily the movie's.\nYour skills will affect your dialogues, what dialogue choices you have, and will open up different avenues of approach to the characters in the world.\nCharacter Skills for you personally will have their greatest impact on two things: 1) how you interact with the characters you meet; 2) how you navigate the jungle.\nHow stealthily or combat-intensive is your approach?\nWhy personal skill? And what do we mean?\nWe do not mean twitch gameplay. This is a game about survival, horror and stealth.  You're a member of the special forces.\nWhat we do mean is:\nHow do you tactically and strategically approach the game as a Player. Paying attention to details in the environment including the lighting like in the Thief series.\nAnd why do we care?\nBecause this is a psychological horror game where the narrative gameplay and your interactions with the other characters drives the story; but we have the confidence to leave the steering wheel in your hands. Let you drive.\nIt might be our mission, but it's sure as hell your boat.\nSo first we ask for your support here:\nhttps://apocalypsenow.com/\nWhich will be both a long running ongoing crowdfunding campaign to raise $5,900,000 but also a site where we will provide entertainment throughout the course of development.\n  PLAY\n\n    A cross-disciplinary team of AAA game developers, motion picture professionals and Interactive creatives are coming together to create a truly unique experience.\nErebus LLC is a special-purpose LLC setup specifically to make the game with American Zoetrope.\nThe name is from the actual name of the Patrol Boat Riverine commonly known by it\u2019s codename PBR Streetgang. You see \u201cErebus\u201d painted on the back of the boat.\nRob Auten, Lawrence Liberty, Montgomery Markland, Kevin McCann, and a dozen other non-public members of the team came together to build the initial prototype. Liberty, Markland and McCann have all built entire game studios and game teams.\n\nBetween the core group they've probably got over 50+ credits? Josh Sawyer is a design consultant thanks to him and Feargus (and best wishes for Pillars of Eternity 2!).\nThere\u2019s a lot of long-experienced practical game development experience here. And we\u2019re happy to answer any questions about anything related to the team or the company. In the comments!\nFor the first time, fans can experience this psychedelic vision of Vietnam as originally presented by legendary filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. \nIn order to maintain the creative freedom and integrity that this daring and intense tale demands, the project is being financed outside the traditional video game publishing system.\nWe want the support of backers like you to make this vision a reality.\n    Apocalypse Now depicts the horror and spectacle of the Vietnam War through the character of Captain Benjamin Willard, an American tasked with the assassination of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. \nThe game is an interactive recreation of Willard\u2019s journey, as seen through a survival horror lens in which players with limited resources face unspeakable terrors.\nBy choosing how to react to these situations, each player molds a unique version of Willard within the loose confines of the film story. You are Willard and your actions will determine his fate.\nYour mission begins in Saigon, where Willard is holed up in a dingy hotel. Audio and visual distortion evoke Willard\u2019s emotions and past experiences. The game provides you subjective access to a character who is already nearly insane.\nUnlike a traditional RPG, the emphasis is not choosing dialogue, but rather actions and postures. Combat draws from survival horror to emphasize combat avoidance and stealth. This is not Call of Duty in Vietnam.\nYou will quickly learn that the gun-blazing solo war machine of other shooters would not have lasted long in the real Vietnam. Instead you will find rewards for proceeding cautiously and managing limited resources with care. Willard is your responsibility; make him an adept soldier and you will command respect in the jungle.\nBrutalism and hubris will bring about severe repercussions affecting your relationship with those around you, especially the crew of the PBR Streetgang (aka the Erebus). Your actions can endanger or empower them and will affect how they view you and their willingness to aid you.\nThere is also a war of resources. Food, water, first aid supplies, anti-malaria medicine, drugs, ammo, weapons, mission information, and gasoline are all vital to your and Willard\u2019s success. While in U.S.-controlled territory, you can find resources through exploration, interactions with allied forces, completing side missions, scavenging from hostiles, and supply drops.\nOnce the Erebus crosses under the Do Lung Bridge, the reigns of control are sheared away. American influence is replaced by something more primal, all ending in Kurtz.\nThe world of Apocalypse Now is full of compelling, disturbing, and potentially useful characters. You will recognize many of them from the film, but we\u2019ll be adding new ones in collaboration with our partners at American Zoetrope. Our goal is to immerse you in a tale of drama, magic, and horror.\n                         Francis Ford Coppola is the creative and prolific force behind American Graffiti, The Godfather series, The Conversation, Bram Stoker's Dracula and his most ambitious film, Apocalypse Now (1979), a Vietnam War epic that was inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899). Released in 1979, the acclaimed motion picture won the Golden Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival, and two Academy Awards.\nRob Auten has served as a lead writer on video game franchises like Gears of War and Battlefield, as an experience designer for Disney, and as a creative director on several forthcoming VR projects. As an entrepreneur, he is working to create an operating system for immersive experiences with the team at Hexagram.io.\nLawrence Liberty has held executive roles at studios and publishers in the Southern California games industry, and has shipped over 70 million units that have generated nearly 4 billion dollars of gross revenue. Titles for which he held an executive producer, studio director or senior producer role include Fallout: New Vegas, DC Universe Online, many Dungeons & Dragons titles, and was Senior Producer for the North American release of The Witcher (from publisher Atari). He is also a master project lead when it comes to developing or extending game engines and technology. On the personal front, he loves both pen and paper and computer RPGs. He\u2019s spent more hours playing The Witcher 3 than any other man on the face of the Planet Earth.\nMontgomery Markland obtained his Bachelor of Science in Film at the University of Texas \u2013 Austin. On the interactive side, Markland designed, produced or directed video games for Atari, Sega, THQ, Ubisoft, Obsidian Entertainment, Killspace Entertainment and inXile entertainment. His work includes being a producer on two of the most successful crowdfunding titles of all time: Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, a designer and producer on Aliens: Crucible, and work in various capacities from assistant producer to CCO on titles ranging from Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir to Rocksmith. He helped tabletop PNP setting Synthicide convert an unsuccessful Kickstarter project to a crowdfunding success. He is widely regarded as the go-to expert for entertainment crowdfunding. He's designed toys for Spinmasters, real-time facial replacement technology, and consulted on innumerable entertainment and social media projects. On the live-action side, Montgomery studied acting at The Beverly Hills Playhouse and directed his first feature film Malibu Road in 2014-2015 slated for a theatrical & VOD run in 2017.\nJosh Sawyer is the Design Director at Obsidian Entertainment and is providing external counsel to the team in a special advisory capacity in the area of gameplay design and crowdfunding.\nCarmine Coppola collaborated to create an extraordinary, dense, textural electronic and symphonic soundscape using state-of-the-art synths that veers from psychedelic to operatic. And we are very lucky to be able to use this amazing music in the video game adaptation.\n      American Zoetrope is a privately run American film studio, centered in San Francisco and founded by Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas. Opened on December 12, 1969, American Zoetrope was an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of HDTV.

Let's see if we can get another $2k to pay for a 2-table spot! \nSeriously, how amazing would it be to get Girl Scouts San Diego to San Diego Comic-Con? It's right here in our hometown! The girls will get a chance to join the amazing party that is Comic-Con downtown every year, and we can sell t-shirts, pillows, stickers and other cool swag and spread the word about the game!\nComic-Con 2017 here we come!\n  MORE STRETCH GOALS:\nBasically every $500 we go over gets another troop a set of 10 2-hour sessions, or another laptop for us to share! \n*\nWe know we can do A LOT with the goal we have already reached and are just so thrilled to get started. There are over 19,000 Girl Scouts in the San Diego / Imperial Valley area. We have until Sunday, 2/26 at 5:58PM PST... so it's not too late - tell your friends they can still get a curriculum pack, t-shirt, stickers, shout-out, character, or level! \n*\nGIANT SQUISHY MARSHMALLOW HUGS to the entire tech community for the outpouring of support!!!\n*\n*\n*\nSTEAM curriculum:\nYou may be wondering, \"Why marshmallows?\" and our answer would have to be, \"Because they make it easy to be creative and learn how to program!\" We provide the initial idea for the core group of characters and the game platforms - and then just let our scouts just take these and run with them. The idea of a bunch of marshmallows hanging out with chocolate, graham crackers and other friends makes it fun and easy for participants of any age to engage and come up with stories and scenarios for the characters, and in the process, learn the math and science of programming:\nHow to make the characters jump convincingly? Physics programming, i.e. emulating inertia, friction.\nWhat would happen if a marshmallow grabbed onto a balloon? Gameplay scripting, vectors, and loops.\nHow to generate new obstacles in the level? Procedural level design, coordinate geometry.\nHow to create timers and scoring?  Delta time, conditionals, collision detection.\nWhat do people like most about the game? Data analytics to determine player retention and drop-off rates to improve the game.\nAnd much more!\nMarshmallow Math T-Shirt: the formula for the parabola that maps the trajectory of a jump!\nWe will also be teaching design:\nGraphic design\nCharacter design\nSprite creation / sprite sheets\nStoryboarding\nGame level design\nAudio design and editing\nVideo editing\n Rewards\nWe're super-excited about our rewards - the scouts will help design and create them! Now that we've reached our 160th backer, we are celebrating with a brand-new reward - Marshmallow Run DIY Starter Pack #1! \nMarshmallow DIY Starter Pack #1: Join the fun and code your own level!\n We want to share Marshmallow Run with coding students everywhere. This pack comes with a full set of PNG sprites, backgrounds, and obstacles, and lesson plans for your class, or if you want to just try coding a level at home:\nOther benefits:\nEstablish a positive digital footprint: Participating scouts and troops will be credited on the game platforms they contribute to, and we will also help scouts involved with the javascript and mobile development of the game to establish git accounts to collaborate on our game repository. It's more important than ever these days to have a positive digital footprint for college and the job market - this is a great way to establish a reputation for being a creator and developer - not just a consumer!\nBadges! Scouts who participate will also receive Design Code Build's special-edition STEAM badges.\nCool guest speakers We will also be inviting great guest speakers to come talk to the scouts - special friends of Design Code Build who are experts in the fields of game design, coding, and filmmaking.\nAnd it would be so cool if... Our dream come true would be to bring a group of our Girl Scouts to Apple WWDC this June. We are going to apply! The first year we went to WWDC, in 2008, there were 2000+ developers in attendance, and only 12 of them were female. Things have definitely improved since then, but they could be better still.\nWho are we?\nDesign Code Build is a STEAM academy founded in San Diego, by principals with extensive experience creating award-winning apps, websites, videos, and digital museum experiences. We are also parents and teachers, and enjoy teaching and making things with kids - our next generation of digital visionaries. We are an official community partner of San Diego Girl Scouts.\nThe plan:\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nEveryone will learn to code in Scratch. Troops can also decide on a second focus - whether they would like to support the project further via design, project management, porting and more advanced coding, or marketing. Once troops have decided, we will set up our curricula for each troop and schedule group meetings. Each track will teach a set of software unique to each focus, such as Adobe Photoshop for the design track, Encore and Basecamp for project management, Flurry and Google Analytics for the marketing track, etc.\nPORTING AND LAUNCHING Since Scratch is Flash-based, Marshmallow Run will not be available to iOS phones and non-Flash-enabled web browsers if it remains only on the Scratch site. For our game to reach the widest possible audience, we will port the game to JavaScript once we have completed and launched the Scratch game. Scratch is basically a custom JavaScript library wrapped in Flash - when combined with HTML5 and CSS, JavaScript is the \u201csecret sauce\u201d behind the interactivity of many online games across the web. Older scouts such as juniors, cadettes and seniors who are interested can attend our JavaScript sessions and learn how the variables in Scratch translate to JavaScript, and begin the process of porting the game to the Web. This JavaScript phase will provide a strong codebase from which we can begin porting the game to the mobile platforms, iOS and Android, using Unity or Cocos2D. Scouts will also become familiar with the XCode and Android Studio authoring environments.\nMARKETING With nearly 500,000 games in the iTunes App Store alone, there is a lot to know to successfully market a game. Scouts will help create and set up Girl Scouts San Diego's first Apple iTunesconnect and Google Play accounts, and learn how to write enticing game descriptions, create game screenshots and preview videos, and track metrics from these portals. In addition, some troop teams will help set up a website for the web version of the game, and learn about web hosting and server administration, as well as setting up browser-based metrics layers such as Google Analytics and Flurry. Still other troop teams will learn how to craft press releases to submit to gaming and tech blogs, and social media gaming sites for reviews. There will also be fun and enriching workshops built around fulfilling the Rewards. Troops can choose whether they want to help provide spin-off Scratch games built to supporters\u2019 wishes; learn 3D-printing technology to print and distribute characters from the game; design and print t-shirts, postcards, stickers, or posters; design plush toys to be created by hand or submitted for production in a limited factory run, and more!\nFunding\nAll funds will be used to support the development of the game and provide in-depth STEAM instruction to Girl Scouts San Diego:\nA set of computers to bring to area troops.  \nA meeting space\nCreating and maintaining Apple Developer and Google Play accounts for Girl Scouts San Diego and getting XCode and Android Studio onto enough computers to be able to host development classes.\nWeb hosting for the web version of the game\nStipend for enough teachers for the program so that participating girls will get hands-on instruction and be able to build and launch the game according to schedule.\nProviding as much instructional time as possible to any Girl Scout San Diego troops who would like to participate.\nMaterials to support the Rewards program.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEveryone we've talked to about this idea is as excited about it as we are. We have, however, recognized that there are some important issues to address:\n\nPARTICIPATION FOR ALL\n\nOne of the main reasons why we are excited about this project is that it offers the possibility of teaching girls the various roles involved in a collaborative project and the process of creating a game. Designers, coders, writers/game designers, project managers, marketers. All are critical to the process. Scouts can decide which role they want to take on, and will come away with the confidence that they have contributed meaningfully to this fun project.\n\nLASTING IMPACT\n\nHow much lasting impact will our lessons have? To be sure our program has the greatest impact, reliable access to computers, and enough dedicated hours by teaching staff is essential. We have ready, willing and able volunteers, but we also want to have the principals be able to pour their time and hearts into this for the amount of time that it takes - we are anticipating anywhere from 9 to 12 months. Our team and pair-coding approach will help make this a memorable experience for all our participants, socially and pedagogically.\n\nACCESS\n\nIt may seem like computers are everywhere these days, but from our experience teaching, we realize that there are still many kids in the upper grades of elementary school and even middle school and high school who do not have regular access to a computer, or internet. We would like for this project to level the playing field - and for us to be able bring our programs to scouts and schools when and where they need support.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "A Big Marshmallow Run Thank You", "descp": "At this level, we will add your name to the scrolling credits in the scratch versions of our game!

I\u2019m David Pogue: former New York Times tech columnist, current tech critic at Yahoo Finance, and author of 104 tech books (including the Pogue\u2019s Basics and Missing Manual series).\nI'm also a dad, a pianist, a magician, and a life-long learner. In addition, I\u2019ve hosted more than a dozen programs for NOVA, the longest-running science program on American TV.\nAlong the way, I've gotten the chance to visit incredible places, meet brilliant people, and see amazing science in action. Best of all, I've been able to share it with you!\nBringing science to the public isn\u2019t always glamorous...\n...but it is always important, and that's why it's been NOVA's mission for over 40 years.\nIf we can bring out the excitement, the fun, and even the humor in science, we can make it more accessible to everyone. And that's critical to keeping science as part of our national conversation.\nStarting today, we have a chance to continue that mission together.\nJoin me on NOVA's next adventure as we explore the secret world of molecules\u2014for a new project called Beyond the Elements! \nTogether, we can bring our discoveries to life with a brand-new television special, rich educational materials, and a cutting-edge VR experience. And we can send it to every public high school in the United States\u2026 for free. Ready to get started?\nOf COURSE WE DO! Making science more accessible to everyone isn't just a good idea, it's essential to our very survival. Scientific knowledge is what lets us\u2026\n(Not to mention such science-enabled inventions as smartphones, emoji, and Snapchat.)\nThat's why, frankly, we should be worried when we hear statistics like these: \n (These are real facts! Sources: 1, 2, 3, 4)\nHow is this happening?! If science is so essential to a safe, prosperous future, why don't more Americans understand even the most basic scientific concepts? \nThere are many reasons, but one of them is that science is often inaccessible to the public. To non-experts, science can appear too abstract, intimidating, or unrelatable to feel essential. Many people never get the chance to see science the way science lovers see it: as an incredible key that can unlock the secrets of the universe. \nIf we want to live in a world that values science, we need to make sure more people can understand and love science. We need more people to experience the wonder of science, and not see it as \"too hard\" or \"just for experts.\" In short, we need to make science for all. And that\u2019s where NOVA comes in.\nFor over 40 years, NOVA has been at the forefront of making science more accessible to the public. Since 1973, PBS has aired more than 750 NOVA programs, which have helped millions of people understand and appreciate the importance of scientific thought and discovery. This work hasn't gone unnoticed: NOVA has won countless awards, including numerous EMMY\u00ae, Peabody and duPont-Columbia Awards.\nOf course, even more important than the awards are the results. Every year, people tell me, and NOVA, about the impact the show has had on their lives. In fact, I've met more than a few scientists who chose their careers because they watched NOVA, and even more kids who tell me that NOVA is the reason they want to become scientists.\nNOVA is also an indispensable resource for thousands of science teachers. Across the country, classrooms rely not just on NOVA programming, but on the free learning materials that NOVA creates to help teachers bring science to life. See for yourself: \nAnd NOVA isn't just for students and teachers. It's essential viewing for learners of all ages. When it comes to reach, not many shows can compare to NOVA. Tens of millions of Americans have watched NOVA over the years. In fact...\nThat\u2019s more than 50 million people. So let's recap:\nWe know we need more people to understand and love science.\nWe know that NOVA has been helping people discover science for over 40 years.\nWe know there's still a lot of work left to do. \nAnd that's where you come in.\nOur Kickstarter campaign has four potential goals. The more we raise, the more we'll be able to accomplish.  \nOur first goal is to fund an exciting new NOVA TV special called Beyond the Elements, hosted by me, David Pogue. It\u2019s a follow-up to Hunting the Elements, one of the most popular NOVA specials ever; you can read more about that further down the page. \nLike all NOVA shows, this two-hour TV special will air on all PBS stations. It will also be available online\u2014free to the public, thanks to \"viewers (and backers!) like you.\" \nBeyond the Elements tells a great story. There are only about 90 naturally occurring elements in the universe\u2014but they can combine in over 100 million ways to make up everything we know\u2014everything we\u2019ve ever encountered, from the air we breathe to the ketchup we put on our burgers. In this special, I\u2019ll travel the world on a quest to unlock the secrets of molecules, both human-made and natural, from poisons to peppers and everything inbetween. \nIf you want more details, you can read about\u2026\nWhy we chose Beyond the Elements for this crowdfunding campaign\nWhat Beyond the Elements will cover (further down the page!)\n \nOnce we\u2019ve passed $1 million, we\u2019ll be on a race for our second goal: To fund the production of free teaching resources that educators need to make Beyond the Elements more useful in their classrooms. \nThey\u2019ll include lesson plans, interactive videos, and even virtual field trips, in which NOVA will stream a live video feed directly into classrooms from exciting on-site locations. Students will get a chance to follow along in real time and ask questions to experts. \nAnd, like all NOVA educational materials, all of these materials will be available on the web for free to any teacher or student who wants them.\n \nThen, once we\u2019ve passed our second goal, we\u2019ll be on the road to meeting our third goal\u2014a special resource that NOVA\u2019s never offered before.\nNOVA's digital team already makes all kinds of great interactive materials; its free Elements iPad app has been downloaded nearly 3 million times. But if we reach our third goal, we can take Beyond the Elements where no NOVA special has gone before\u2026 into virtual reality.\nWhile Beyond the Elements will be great as a TV special, think how much cooler it'll be if you can then shrink down and go inside the mind-blowing world of molecules, to see everything up close! VR is still an emerging technology, but it has exciting implications for education. With your help, NOVA can pioneer new ways to make science for all in this new format.\nFinally, once we pass $2.25 million, we\u2019ll begin working to bring NOVA\u2014and Beyond the Elements\u2014to as many American students as possible. Beyond the Elements will be free on TV and, for a limited time, on the web\u2014but not all public high schools can stream online video in their classrooms. \nWe want to make sure teachers can depend on Beyond the Elements to be available whenever they need it. That's why our final goal is to make both Hunting the Elements and Beyond the Elements available on DVD or Blu-Ray, for free, to every public high school in the United States\u2014almost 26,000 schools.\n Together, we can make an incredible new special, bring it to life with classroom materials and a VR experience, and make sure that it's available to every high-school student in America. If we do, we'll have helped NOVA make the world of molecules both more exciting to all viewers, and more available to millions of students and teachers. \n If we want to make science for all, that's a pretty good start.  \nWe spent a long time thinking about this. \nNOVA covers a huge variety of science topics. Maybe you get most excited about outer space. Or chemistry, math, engineering, nature, or archaeology. No matter which topic excites you, chances are that there's a NOVA episode about it. \nHere are a few reasons we settled on Beyond the Elements for this campaign:\nIt's a follow-up to one of NOVA's most watched, most popular specials. \nIt makes some of science's most basic concepts enjoyable for all ages.\nWe've been wanting to make it for years. \nHunting the Elements fans have been asking us to make it. \nWe knew it would take some real funding to make it a reality, and...\nWe've received support from The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to get us started! \nNow, if we work together, we can finally make it happen.\nSeveral years ago, I hit the road with the NOVA team to discover the secrets behind our universe\u2019s building blocks: the elements of the periodic table. \nHunting the Elements aired in 2012, and was an instant hit: Over 10 million people have seen it to date, and nearly 3 million people have downloaded the accompanying app. You can watch it right now on the NOVA website, so you\u2019ll get an idea of our style of scientific storytelling. \nTeachers frequently write NOVA to say thank you, explaining how valuable it is in their classrooms. We\u2019re often told how students have been inspired by it. For example, I got to meet 10-year-old Eva from Oklahoma, who was so inspired by the show that she memorized the entire periodic table. Or 10-year-old Henry from Massachusetts, who has watched Hunting the Elements over 100 times:\nPLAY\n\nIf we\u2019re going to help more people fall in love with science, that\u2019s exactly the kind of inspiration we need!\nWith Beyond the Elements, we want to take that winning formula and run with it. \nThis time we\u2019ll take a look at how all those elements form molecules and make up everything we\u2019ve ever encountered! Water is a molecule, caffeine is a molecule, and you are made of molecules. Molecules occur naturally, and some can also be crafted by humans. They can help or hurt, and we intend to tell their stories. \nOur goal is for Hunting the Elements and Beyond the Elements to work together. We hope that they\u2019ll provide an exciting, comprehensive introduction to chemistry that can catalyze a reaction in curious minds of all ages.\nIf you've read this far, I hope it\u2019s because you agree that we need to make science for everyone. Our future depends on it. \nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t get more immediate gratification for supporting this project. (After all, PBS has been giving away mugs and tote bags to its supporters since long before Kickstarter was invented.) \nSome of you will be excited to get official NOVA rewards, and others would prefer that we spend everything we raise on helping more schools. \n That's why we have two kinds of rewards: \nYou can get PERSONAL REWARDS, including exclusive NOVA Kickstarter gear, such as T-shirts, mugs, tote bags, and even custom lab books, or you can pledge for EDUCATOR REWARDS, and we'll direct your pledge to helping the teacher(s) and school(s) of your choice. You'll find descriptions of all of the available rewards on the right side of this page, but if you're wondering what's included at each pledge level, this should help:\nIf you want more details, check out the FAQ for answers to questions like:\nHow do I tell you which rewards I want?\nWhen do the rewards ship?\nWhat format of digital download will I get?\nWe know that $1 million is a lot of money (let alone $2.25 million!). So we want to be very clear about why we're asking for this much money, and how we'll use it. \nThe first thing you should know is that Beyond the Elements has already received a significant grant from The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation toward the goals of this Kickstarter campaign. We\u2019re grateful for their enthusiasm and support. \nBut even with the generous support of the Sloan Foundation, NOVA still needs to raise the amounts listed here to do everything we've described. \nThat's because, as in every Kickstarter campaign, we'll have to pay certain fees to Kickstarter and the credit-card companies. We'll also have to cover the cost of making and packing all of the rewards you're getting. (T-shirts don\u2019t grow on trees, you know.) \nSo for each dollar we raise on Kickstarter, here's how our expenses break down: \n   I, David Pogue, am not the real force behind NOVA; I'm just the lucky slob who gets to host some of its specials! Here are the real brains of the operation, who will be joining us on this adventure:\nPaula S. Apsell is the Senior Executive Producer and Director of the WGBH Science Unit. She is a recipient of the Bradford Washburn Award, the Carl Sagan Award, the American Institute of Physics Andrew Gemant Award, and the Planetary Society\u2019s Cosmos Award, among many others.\nFAVORITE ELEMENT: Gold has two qualities that you might not think go together. It glitters and it\u2019s got substance. In that way, it\u2019s just like NOVA\u2013both entertaining and educational\u2014the gold standard of science programming!\nChris Schmidt is NOVA\u2019s Senior Producer and the Executive Producer for Beyond the Elements. He was Executive Producer, Writer, and Director on many other David Pogue films, including the Making Stuff series and Hunting the Elements.\nFAVORITE ELEMENT: At the moment, silicon (Si) is my favorite element because I find it to be sadly tragic. It\u2019s right below carbon on the periodic table, and it so wants to be able to do all the things carbon can do. But its bonds aren\u2019t quite as strong or flexible and it can\u2019t keep up with carbon\u2019s social life, moving easily between the air, the water and the earth. Still, it\u2019s got a great work ethic and it does its best. And even though we may never find alien life based on silicon, good old number 14 has given us plenty to be grateful for, like glass and computers! Thanks, silicon!\nPamela Rosenstein manages the development of multipart series and specials for NOVA and the WGBH Science Unit. She supervises the development pipeline of projects for foundation and government funding, overseeing concept development, fundraising strategies, proposal development, and stewardship of strategic partnerships.\nFAVORITE ELEMENT: Helium, because I find it amazing that something produced naturally through radioactive decay can make you squeak. But don\u2019t inhale too much; it is a finite resource, after all. \nTim De Chant is NOVA's senior digital editor and the founding editor of NOVA Next, NOVA's digital magazine. He is also in charge of NOVA's social media strategy. \nFAVORITE ELEMENT: Carbon is my favorite element because it can tell us an incredible amount about the natural world. In tree rings, carbon isotope ratios can also tell us if the conditions in which the tree is growing have changed over its lifetime!  \nRalph Bouquet is the Education and Outreach Manager at NOVA. Ralph helps make NOVA a valuable resource for educators through the production of digital resources like videos and web games, professional development opportunities, and collaboration with STEM education organizations. \nFAVORITE ELEMENT: Calcium, because it helps me rationalize my love for cheese.\nAllison Eck is NOVA\u2019s primary social media editor\u2014the voice of NOVA on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. She also writes for NOVA Next. She alternates between keeping her finger on the pulse of science news and interacting with our smart viewers and readers (i.e., YOU!). \nFAVORITE ELEMENT: Bismuth, because its crystals grow in a staircase-shaped formation that reminds me of an M.C.

This deck was designed by Dario Genuardi and myself with more than ONE year in the making. We are deeply in love with skateboarding and art. As a young magician who loves performing and spreading love, this skateboard deck is the quintessence of my life\u2019s goal. We\u2019ve put every possible detail of the deck into consideration and the outcome is a perfect combination of craftsmanship and art.\nMy intentions of creating this deck is to spread the positivity and inspiration I\u2019ve been lucky to receive from meeting new people in all areas of life but especially my friends in the skateboarding community and their beliefs of never surrendering to adversity and maintaining a positive outlook on life. I hope for anyone that receives this deck they\u2019ll be inspired to go against the rushed, exhausting lifestyle many adopt today and live a happy, relaxing life to do what they\u2019re passionate about and what they love.\n     Our vision is for it to suit the use of everyone from professional Magicians to Cardists to someone who has an appreciation for art. In order to accomplish our goals, we\u2019ve changed our designs of the back 20 times to reach perfection. The sky blue finish of the deck is to relay an easygoing attitude to the holder. Tiny designs that pay homage to skate culture and pop culture can be seen throughout the back of the cards with the screwdrivers and skulls that many skateboarders love. We\u2019ll leave it up to you guys to find more details for yourselves.\n    As a magician & Cardist I strongly believe that other than the design, quality & handling are the most important things for a deck. The Skateboard Playing Card is printed on the Finest quality card stock the United States Playing Card Company has to offer. The legendary Air Cushion Finish is also added to provide the smoothest experience of spreads, fans, and shuffles\n    Our court cards are based on people we\u2019ve met in real life. Their stories and their philosophies deeply influenced us and we wanted to share it with you guys. We\u2019ve taken their individualities and incorporated into the design of the court cards. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time personalizing the court cards in order to make them more humanized and realistic. We hope you\u2019ll be able to take away something from their relaxed and carefree lifestyle and just keep searching for the happiness in your life. Work Hard, Play Hard.\n                 Graffiti Jack; Mechanic Jack; Guitarist Jack; Rock & Roll Jack\n        Red wine loving Queen; Selfie Queen; Deep down romantic queen; Gopro Queen\nCarpenter King; Wacky gloves collector King; 3 year no shaving king, Photographer King\n    The Ace of Spades design is made up of half of the top and bottom of a skateboard. Eat, Sleep, Skate is the slogan of many skaters and the ultimate spirit of skateboarding.\nThe joker features a classic skater look embodying a laid back attitude that many people know and love. We want to create a unique joker that\u2019s an icon to the skate culture to spread our message of being care free and happy.\n     The box of the deck is designed to be as visually attractive as any art piece. The vibrant colors hints at the messages we want to spread. It perfectly exhibits the theme of the Skateboard Deck\n    We sincerely appreciate any amount or form of support from you and we want to give a little bonus as a token of gratitude for your support. We collaborated with 8 of the most talented people in the magic and cardistry community to bring you 4 card flourishes and 4 magic tricks that will blow your mind.

Thanks to everyone who has generously donated to the film. This was the bare minimum we needed to pull this off. Our new stretch goal is $25,000 -- this will allow us to attain things such as footage rights, additional b-roll, professional sound mix, dialogue cleanup.\n There's been a lot of discussion on the \"lack of female cinematographers\" and as a young female cinematographer, I wanted to respond. I attended UCLA's graduate school for cinematography and when graduation was approaching, I still only knew of a few women who were shooting big shows. I wanted to know more about how they got to where they were. \nThis feature documentary started out as my very ambitious UCLA thesis project that turned into a larger undertaking when I realized how many women there were to talk to -- and there are still so many beyond who is in the film. That's the point I've decided to make. \n\nThere are so many incredible women shooting, and I am so excited to have been able to put their stories in one piece: Women of Light.\n\nIn the media, we hear so much about how few women there are in the film industry:\nVARIETY   INDIEWIRE   THE NEW YORK TIMES   DEADLINE  \nTHE LA TIMES   THE TELEGRAPH\n\nIt's time we honor women in film. It's time to honor the women in cinematography, around the world, and inspire those of the future.\nJoin us in this movement -- whether you're filmmaker, a cinematographer, a lover of movies, a lover of art, a lover of stories. \nWe're ready to finish this film -- but we can't move forward without funds. Your contribution will help us with many things we need to complete it. Below is a breakdown of where the funds will go. Everything helps.\n Julia Swain // Director + Cinematographer Julia is a cinematographer who holds an MFA in Cinematography from the prestigious UCLA School of Theater, Film & Television. During her graduate study, Julia shot countless narrative films, including the feature Killing Animals by James Franco, was awarded multiple awards such as the Women in Film Foundation / Loreen Arbus Fellowship in Cinematography and shot the winning Sprite Films ad, which earned nationwide distribution on a multitude of platforms. The See You Soon (Michael Brun) music video Julia shot made MTV\u2019s #1 top new video summer of 2015. She has had other work air on networks such as VH1, ESPN, and Adult Swim. Julia has served as DP and 2nd Unit DP on multiple features, and continues to shoot on a variety of formats, consistently seeking to create compelling visuals for every story and brand.\nChelsi Johnston // Producer + Editor\nChelsi is a filmmaker from Honolulu, HI currently working towards an MFA in Directing/Production at UCLA\u2019s School of Theater, Film, and Television. After receiving her BA from Santa Clara University in Communication/Film, she worked on the production team for projections such as Godzilla (2015) and Hawaii Five-0. Most recently, she received the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Grant to work in post-production on The Invitation.\nAnnie Pace // Producer\nAnnie is currently getting her MFA in Directing at the UCLA School of Theater, Film & Television. She just completed her film Broken Pines lensed by Julia Swain, and the two are traveling to the Brazilian Amazon to shoot her next film. Before moving to Los Angeles, Annie previously worked on anthropological films in both Brazil and Mexico, and directed the music video entitled All For One for the Bluegrass/Hip-hop band Gangstagrass.\n\nTeodora Totoiu // Cinematographer\nTeodora is a Romanian-American Director of Photography based in Los Angeles, California.

Kangol is the world\u2019s most famous headwear brand and it\u2019s been worn by some of the world\u2019s most famous celebrities like Brad Pitt, Bill Murray, Eminem, Samuel L. Jackson, Gwen Stefani, Kid Rock, Madonna, Miley Cyrus, and others.  \nKangol is a brand that was born in Britain and grew up on the streets of New York and now we\u2019d like your help to bring another icon to the states and move as much as possible of the Kangol 504\u2019s manufacturing stateside with the Bollman Hat Company. \nWe\u2019re looking for your help us bring the historic machinery that has been used to make the Kangol 504 and other styles since the start of Kangol to the states and create new American jobs. \nBollman Hat Company is America's oldest hat maker.\nThe Bollman Hat Company is the oldest hat maker in America dating back to 1868. We are employee-owned and pay our employee-owners a living wage. In 2001, Bollman Hat Company acquired the global license to design, produce, and distribute Kangol headwear. By the time Bollman Hat Company had acquired the license, the decision had already been made by the previous ownership to move all the manufacturing to a factory in China which was created in the mid-1990s to stay competitive. The factory in China was purchased in 2006 by a Chinese hat maker who has now decided to exit due to rising labor costs in Southern China. Since acquiring the Kangol license, Bollman Hat Company made several Kangol straw, wool felt, and fur felt styles in their factory in Pennsylvania, but until now, did not make knitted and blocked hats which are the most iconic Kangol styles. \nThe 1932 staff of Bollman Hat Company.\nAbout The Kangol\u00ae 504\nThe Wool 504 is the iconic, original Kangol\u00ae Cap. First introduced in 1954, the 504 cap gets its name from the block number that it is made on. The 100% seamless wool cap is the ultimate cap for comfort and style and now for the first time ever Made In The USA.\nWhy Do We Need These Machines?\nOver the years there has been attempts to duplicate the machines unsuccessfully.  As our Design Director, Nic Harris, likes to point out this is very similar to the denim selvage machines that jean manufacturers replaced in the 80's.  The result was less of a quality product than what was produced with the older, slower machines.  We're not interested in faster machines that make an inferior product.  We want to keep the quality that has built Kangol and that our customers love.  \nThe manufacturing of the 504 requires special machinery which was built specifically for Kangol in the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s to create the knit of the 504. These are the same machines we are looking for your help to move today. These special machines were each customized to knit, link, tease, shear, and block the Kangol 504 style. Other styles will follow with sufficient funding. \nOne of the ten machines already brought to the US.\nWe have already moved 10 of the machines over to the U.S. and made the necessary electrical conversions for the equipment to work in the U.S., but there are another 70 machines yet to move. Altogether, the cost to move it will be over $650,000. Bollman Hat Company has invested more than $350,000 and in addition we\u2019ve already secured $60,000 from the Department of Community & Economic Development\u2019s Pennsylvania First Program grant, $82,000 in Job Creation Tax Credits, and $18,450 in Workforce and Economic Development Network of Pennsylvania helping to fund the skills training needed for our employee owners. The cost of making the Kangol product in the U.S. is estimated to be more than twice the cost of making it in China, but we eliminate the transportation costs to North America, achieve faster customer turnaround, and control our innovation. \nWhy Do We Want To Bring These Machines To America?\nAmerica became a world leader because of its manufacturing strength and the middle class built by this strength. Over the past 50 years America has lost its title of the world manufacturing leader with many of the jobs going overseas to China, India, and Bangladesh. That doesn\u2019t mean that great products can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be made here and Bollman Hat Company is a testament to that. Aside from being America\u2019s oldest hat maker and nearly 150 years old, Bollman Hat Company is also the founding member of American Made Matters, a community of US Makers with a focus on bringing attention to the importance of making and buying American products. Bollman Hat Company and American Made Matters believe that if it can be made here, it should be made here! The beloved Kangol 504 is the next piece in that puzzle.\nPLAY\n\nBringing the 504 and other Kangol styles' production to America will create dozens of new jobs for American workers while maintaining the current workforce and that can make a big impact.\nA Rewarding Campaign.\nWe've worked hard to come up with some great rewards for backers so not only do you get to feel good about where your money is going but you'll be able to show off your support too.  We've also created bundles so you can get almost any combination of rewards you'd like.\nSome of our rewards include:\nWe\u2019d like your help in strengthening America again and bringing jobs back to the U.S. Your help will be greatly appreciated and reinforce the tide of change to bring back Made In The U.S.A.\nSpecial thanks go to our friends Samuel L.

It's now available on Blu-ray and DVD.\nWith your help, I'll next be overseeing a full 4K restoration of the classic B-Movie \"The Atomic Brain\", also known as \"Monstrosity\", from the original 35mm camera negative.\nIn the process, we'll compile supplemental material about the circumstances of the film's creation, and create a documentary about its director, Joseph V. Mascelli, ASC, one of the most influential yet unknown cinematographers in film history.\nAbout The Director:\nA highly active member of the American Society of Cinematographers in his day, Mascelli learned his craft at a time when camera crew from the silent era were not only still alive, but still working: his collaborator on the second edition ASC Manual had shot 1914's The Perils of Pauline.\nMascelli himself began as a cinematographer in the Armed Forces, and would shoot countless miles of newsreel and training footage before moving into TV and Film. Due to the ephemeral and anonymous nature of much of his work, a true survey of his credits has never been made.\nHe would become best known for condensing the collective knowledge of his field into one concise, informative book, 1965's The 5 C's of Cinematography, that is still used to teach students the visual vocabulary of film. Mascelli's book makes the case for the democratization of film teaching, urges readers to push the boundaries of the rules (the sixth \"C\", he writes, is \"Cheating\") and fosters the easy discussion of what was once very specialized, even unspoken knowledge. It's still in print today, and could be considered his most enduring contribution to filmmaking.\nOur documentary will help paint a picture of Mascelli and the era in which he was working, an uneasy time when Corman and Cleopatra coexisted, a transitional decade that would give way to the \"New Hollywood\" of the 1970's. As one of the old guard looking to teach the new, how did Mascelli's educational work persist through the decades? In looking to the past, we might even find some good advice for the future.\nASC Manual: Second Edition, 1966\nAbout \"The Atomic Brain\":\nPromotional Still\nA year and change before The 5 C's of Cinematography was completed, Mascelli's name was conspicuously absent from the poster of Monstrosity. This B-Movie tells the story of Hetty March, a rich, somewhat vampiric old woman who conspires with a scientist to transfer her brain into a younger body through atomic fission. March employs three women in her mansion while she decides which one to kill and replace. Soon, a rejected candidate's brain is swapped with a cat's, causing her to eat a mouse and climb onto the roof.\nThroughout, two other failed experiments, a zombie woman and a Moreau-esque dog man, loom nearby as if refugees from another movie. The situation deteriorates until the mansion, as well as March's plans, are obliterated in a bright atomic blast.\nOriginal Poster\nMonstrosity, in fact, had been directed by Mascelli in 1958 until funding abruptly fell through. Hastily finished by its producers in 1963, sleazily advertised (see above), re-titled The Atomic Brain on dreary-looking 16mm prints, rarely presented in its intended widescreen aspect ratio, destined to land on Mystery Science Theater 3000, the film was never given much attention. Yet, despite all obstacles, Mascelli's original footage is directed and shot with a professionalism and a keen visual sense that stands out from the reshoots. Even in his one foiled attempt at directing a feature film, he proved that the principles he'd write about in \"The 5 C's\" did not discriminate based on budget.\nMonstrosity, AKA The Atomic Brain would be Mascelli's only directorial credit, and an incomplete one at that. But now, the original 35mm camera negative has been recovered, and with it comes a razor-sharp black and white image for both cult movie fans and students of cinematography to enjoy for the first time.\nPublic Domain Version\n4K Sample Scan, Full Aperture\nThe film's public domain status has long made it a staple of bargain bin DVDs, sourced from muddy VHS transfers that drop many low-key scenes into total darkness. It also has discouraged major distributors, who would never be able to fully own the results, from investing in a proper video transfer for the film. We, the public that own it, now have an opportunity to restore The Atomic Brain in full 4K resolution, and make this once-obscure \"Monstrosity\" available in a condition far better than it's ever been seen.\nIf we don't make it happen, no one will.\nHow Can I Help?\nDonate! Every dollar we raise will create a better restoration and a better documentary.\nSpread the word! Your words are important to us. If you can't donate, but still want to see The Atomic Brain brought back to life, make sure everyone- your friends, your family, and your social network- knows about this project and our goals. Share a link to this page with your endorsement on Facebook or Twitter. Not only will you help us restore the film, you'll encourage others to give the film the re-evaluation it needs.\nWhat Your Donation Will Cover\nSuccessful fundraising will support the following:\nFor the Restoration:\nScanning of the Original Camera Negative and Fine Grain Positive on a top-of-the-line archival film scanner into the DPX format in 4K resolution.\nDigitization of all audio from the Original Track Negative into 48khz uncompressed WAV Files.\nProfessional image restoration on PFClean and DRS\u2122 NOVA suites to correct countless occurrences of dirt, tears, irregularities and scratches in the film.\nRestoration and re-engineering of the soundtrack by an audio professional using iZotope, Protools, and other specialized hardware.\nHard drives and RAID for data capture, transportation, editing and backups. Working in 4k resolution means many terabytes of data and doubles of everything for backup.\nProfessional grading in a calibrated color correction suite. Even black and white films need this to ensure a consistent, accurate image across all video and theatrical formats\nLong term digital storage and migration of the restored film on LTO tape or equivalent.\nThe creation of a 4K DCP to allow modern digital projection. A must if we are to exhibit the film.\nThe creation of Blu-ray, DVD and UHD home video masters, ensuring that backers get the best possible quality in their choice of format.\nFor the Documentary:\nOffset the cost of travel and lodging in creating the documentary.\nHard drives and camera memory cards for data capture, transportation, editing and backups.\nThe employment of crew during filming and postproduction.\nRental of lighting, grip and sound equipment for interviews.\nLegal Fees to ensure rights and clearances relating to people, organizations and publications are all honored in the making of the restoration and documentary.\nIf We Exceed Our Goal\nOur initial goal of $16,000 is the minimum to ensure that the restoration of the film is finished and incentives are delivered. Donations well beyond that amount will allow for a dramatic increase in quality.\nMany more hours of cleanup on the film, for a truly flawless sound and image.\nMore personnel employed for image and sound restoration.\nAccess to better post-production tools and more extensive quality control.\nA stronger budget for the documentary, enabling further travel, interviews, and equipment rental.\nExtra crew hired on location and in postproduction during the creation of the documentary.\nProfessionally replicated dual layer Blu-ray discs with added, open-matte version of The Atomic Brain.\nA new 35mm theatrical print, struck from the negative, for preservation and exhibition.\nExclusive DVD, Blu-ray & UHD\nWe're self-distributing this film for the duration of the project. This means several things:\nA quicker turnaround. Backers, no matter where they are, need not wait for contract negotiations, retail scheduling, or press releases before they can receive their copies of the film.\nVersatility. We can deliver the film to some backers in a 4K resolution file, suitable for viewing on UHD Televisions and monitors, before distributors have put a reliable 4K system into practice. We have the freedom to change this delivery method if new distribution standards arrive before we're done.\nBacker Exclusives. As of now, there are no plans to distribute \"The Atomic Brain\" on physical media beyond this campaign. Whether this changes or not depends on demand- which, for such a niche title, is never a given. Backers could be the only ones with access to physical copies.\nTransparency. I'll be in the loop at every step, and so will you. No non-disclosable information, and no need to get your information from another source.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur last film restoration, of \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\", saw a substantial number of risks and challenges realized. At the center was a prolonged attack on the film's long standing public domain status from two outside parties. A great deal of time and effort was required to address that threat, but nearly every one of our backers stuck with us throughout. Their patience was rewarded with the best home video package possible and, I hope, the knowledge that their trust was well placed.\n\nThe restoration of The Atomic Brain begins with us in a far more advantageous position. With the recovery of the original 35mm camera negatives, as well as recent advancements in technology, the 4K restoration of this title can be completed faster and at less expense than was possible only a few years ago. \n\nWe are also going into our project with substantial copyright research strengthening the film's public domain status, and an intellectual property lawyer employed for the duration of the project. We are prepared, then, for any legal challenge, and this will also help us keep the entire restoration process transparent.\n\nBoth for the confidence of new backers and as a reward for repeat backers, I am placing a personal guarantee on the timely delivery of all media incentives. Should we meet our fundraising goal, incentives will be sent to backers between their original ETA of October 2016 and no later than December 31st of 2016. If this deadline is missed, then refunds on backer levels of $50 or greater (minus the Kickstarter / Paypal fees) will come from my own pocket.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "\"Hamlet\" Download and \"Monstrosity\" Discs Available!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Digital Downloads Begin, All Packages Out", "update_content": "Hi All,\nJust a quick note- a link to the digital version of Monstrosity will arrive in your inbox this week, with many of you likely seeing links already.\nThe personalized link will enable you to view and download at resolutions up to UHD through Vimeo Pro, as well as save the title on your Vimeo account for easy access.

To streamline this process, we are highlighting below the important ones, such as shipping discounts and add-ons that became available. \nUpdate#7, 5/13/2015: Added a new reward level, the Rare Bird #2\nUpdate #2, 4/11/2015: Announcing a stretch goal, and open design call for surfboard design.\nUpdate #3, 4/18/2015: Announced reduced shipping for multiple rewards selection\n___________________________________________________________________________\nWe're back on Kickstarter, where it all started. One and a half years ago you, our backers, supported our vision to make the most awesome wood car toys out there and willed Candylab Toys into existence. \nWe continue to nurture an idea and the conviction that children\u2019s toys can be awesome and enjoyed by all age groups. We took our love of classic cars, woodworking and mid-century nostalgia and made a big fat sandwich of engineering, design, manufacturing logistics, branding and some common sense retail strategy. The resulting mash-up struck a chord with a bunch of folks presumably fed up with piles of plastic toys and who appreciated a clean, simple and durable wooden design object backed by a strong aesthetic \u2013 vintage cars and throwback toys. The Kickstarter campaign we launched to materialize our designs went on to prove that other people also liked solid wood toy cars inspired by mid-century design and American muscle cars painted in bright colors with smooth rolling rubber tires. Who knew - but we were happy to see a lot of appreciation from folks across the world, and thumbs up from outlets big and small.\n The success of the campaign kicked our start-up into high gear. We scrapped our original plans to make a few hundred by ourselves, dusted off our initially far-fetched dream of placing a real factory order and the rest was history. Numerous late nights later, the last car was sent to our backers, stamped, checked, and packed. \nAnd we\u2019re now finally ready with our follow-up act. And as before, without your help none of these new designs will come to life, at least not in the near future. We\u2019ve learned a ton of lessons since our last campaign, smoothed out production and logistics and we\u2019re eager to put all this experience to work.\nWe have a whole lot of excitement lined up: no less than 5 new completely distinct styles! It\u2019s ambitious, but we\u2019ve been thinking hard about creating a real universe here, so this time will be about adding vehicle types. \n The last campaign hinted at a tow truck which got a tons of thumbs up. Check. But how about a classic wagon \u2013 wood paneled, or an iconic taxi? Check and check. Next, we wanted to try something fresh in a new design language, so a roundy camper trailer to go with a wood paneled angular wagon seemed like a good idea. And since it all started with the quintessential racer, we\u2019re staying close to our tradition: a new racer in powder blue is on its way. \n We\u2019re going to share with you our process and plans through the campaign updates, so we can keep the wordy part to a minimum. Let\u2019s move on to the eye candy please.\n  Here she is folks. Took us a looong time, and many a sweaty brows to do this. And we're not talking about designing, refining, designing some more, prototyping etc. We're talking about committing to a manufacturing approach, which is no small feat. US-made, numbered and signed, here she is.\nShown alongside its older cousin from the previous campaign\n Our pledge to you here and now: get this old girl and you'll have a collector item; we will not produce this particular combination of shapes and colors ever again, Kickstarter-only forever. You'll have a unique, limited edition collector item - it goes in the Vault after this Kickstarter campaign. Disclaimer: We may slightly, infinitesimally tweak the design during production - or as a result of your feedback. And we started late on this one , so we may ship in October. We have custom tooling to make, jigs to design and a painting rig to build. Please bear with us.  \nMaterial: Solid Beech Wood, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. Black ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 7.2\"L x 2.8\"W x 1.95\"H (18.3cm L x 7.3cm W x 5cm H) Weight: 9oz / 255g\nNo surprises here - we've unveiled it in our last campaign, but this is a complex one: 5 different wood parts, numerous wood cuts, tight tolerances, new wheels and tires to develop. We\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll enjoy the playtime: towing another toy car with a rubber band-equipped tow truck makes for hours of imaginative play. Lastly, before you ask: all new production runs of our previous models (except Police and Firechief) will come with the towing pin on their bellies and so will the three new ones in this campaign. Tow away to your heart\u2019s content.\nPLAY\n\nMaterial: Solid Beech Wood, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. White ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 6.8\"L x 3.8\"W x 2.95\"H (17.3cm L x 9.6cm W x 7.5cm H) Weight: 11oz / 310g (without packaging)\nAffectionately dubbed \u201cCandycab\u201d, this is a typical late 60\u2019s slab sedan. No cityscape or street play scene is complete without it. Also our lowest cost champ, we\u2019d hope for this to become a staple of any playset. Tiny luggage not included.\n Material: Solid Beech Wood, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. White ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 7.2\"L x 2.8\"W x 1.95\"H (18.3cm L x 7.3cm W x 5cm H) Weight: 9oz / 255g\nPLAY\n\nThe missing color in our lineup, this represents a refinement of the lessons learned so far. Black rims, the fastback roofline, and the powder blue / orange livery make it pretty striking. With belly towpin and black front grille, we think it will challenge the GT10 for supremacy and popularity.\nMaterial: Solid Beech Wood, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. Black ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 7.2\"L x 2.8\"W x 1.95\"H (18.3cm L x 7.3cm W x 5cm H) Weight: 9oz / 255g\nWe've had this one on the boards for a long time, but only now have we mastered its complexity. Aside from the tricky woodwork required to cut the taillights, it has a magnetic tow hitch under its belly. Then we added a roof magnet: the obvious way to snap a surfboard, which also gets a magnet in it. One surfboard included in this reward. \n All the embedded magnets are installed from the inside of the car, before assembling the cabin - there is no chance of them becoming loose. \n As an added bonus, it has actual walnut microveneer applied to its sides.  Nothing but the best, real stuff for our toys. Now go on and reenact that cross country surf trip.\nMaterial: Solid Beech Wood, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. White ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 7.2\"L x 2.8\"W x 1.95\"H (18.3cm L x 7.3cm W x 5cm H) Weight: 9.5oz / 270g\nThis particular object took some serious brain cycles in our lab. It needs to be lightweight, it has a completely different design language and represents our bet on bridging different looks in our growing garage. Perfectly rounding it off, or engineering the hitch are not the easiest thing we did either. A handful, but boy, are we happy. \nPLAY\n\nMaterial: Wood body, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. White ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 6\"L x 3\"W x 2.75\"H (15.24cm L x 7.6cm W x 7cm H) \n Sturdy, simple, durable, and fast.  Now that opens up the kind of playtime that's in danger of getting lost these days.  Use your imagination, fill in the blanks, and enjoy some reenactments that get the kiddos interested in an era long gone. And maybe they learn a thing or two about big block engines, weight distribution and rear drive axles. \nPLAY\n\nIt's a straightforward formula: take solid block of beech, cut block of beech, paint it, add wheels. We use real solid wood, real metal pins, and real rubber tires. No compromises. \nWho said they don't make'em like they used to?  \nBut the devil is in the details as they say:  smart color decisions, carefully engineered tooling to achieve the correct cuts at just the right angle and proportions, a painstakingly slow and manual painting process, and final assembly and installation of our custom designed wheels, pins and rubber tires.  A 2-ton press is responsible for fitting the pins, each an individual axle by itself.  All this is the culmination of almost 2 years of development, design, prototyping and preproduction testing. We're proud of our toys and ready to get them in your hands. \nEssentially all of the above, broken down on the right, and further explained below. If you still have questions, don't fret;  if you'd like specific iterations and multiples, or combinations not available in the rewards tier, you have the option to fine tune your pledge after the campaign ends during  the survey process. See more detailed explanations in the FAQ section or drop us a line. \nAll shipping costs are additional and vary according to pledge level and destination. Amount will be charged at checkout.  There are 4 shipping tiers: domestic USA shipping, Canada, EU, and rest of the world.  Customs fees or local sales taxes may, and will sometimes apply.  Check our FAQ for info. \nEvery single car coming out of this campaign will will bear a Kickstarter-only stamp, cementing your backer bragging rights.  \nSpecially packaged Towie and Blu74.  The two retail boxes are wrapped with a custom printed sleeve marking the Kickstarter-only availability of this awesome set.  Includes a set of 4 spare tires, standard 20mm size. \n Inseparable items, these.  Included:  Woodie, Camper, and two surfboards. \nA nice slider gift box for this perfect pair.  It includes two surfboards and a spare set of two tires. Box is sealed with a green Kickstarter sticker to prove the visionary backer chops to amazed friends and family. \nAll the cars and the reward bundles in this campaign, each set handsigned and with a nice big Kickstarter stamp. Total and ultimate bragging rights, plus a notch down from future retail pricing. Includes the Candycab, Blu74, Towie, Woodie, the Camper, a set of extra tires and two surfboards!\n*Palm Tree not included\n If none of the above speak strongly to you, you can still get a little reminder of our values to hang on your (ferrous) fridge.  We are packing a set of 3 cute mini surfboards, each with a magnet inside to go on the Woodie, your fridge, or any other magnetic or ferrous your heart desires.  Made from real wood, water painted and appropriately shaped. Final design and colors may be slightly tweaked from the depiction below. \nSo there you have it folks, this is our new lineup. We\u2019ve spent the last year working to develop sales, keeping production on track and designing new toys.  All of this takes hard work and funding.  And what makes sense to us is that we keep designing and building toys, and we keep our ear close to the ground, within the community who understood us, took a chance on us and ultimately propelled us into existence.  We promise to keep going if you want us to. \n If you believe in what we\u2019re doing here, please lend a hand to turn these into reality and keep us moving forward \u2013 help fund this project. \nFrom all of us here at Candylab toys, we thank you!

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving successfully completed fulfillment for our previous campaign, we've learned quite a few things. We hit up against two bottlenecks - fulfillment logistics and quality control- and we took steps to address both. On the production side the flow is now well established, having put our supplier through their paces, and our white-gloved (literally, not metaphorically) quality inspection team has been inspecting each and every car in our subsequent orders. Wheels, pins, tires and packaging stock production are now just an email away. The Woodie and Blu are already pre-produced in enough quantities, and are similar enough to styles we've made enough of to give us assurance that there won't be any surprises there. \n\nThe fulfillment is fully buttoned up now. We hired a local warehouse provider in Pennsylvania in September of last year - unfortunately after the painful effort of the first campaign- and they have been great to work with. They are in charge of our current fledgling wholesale operation and it's been smooth sailing. Least of our worries. \n\nThat being said, we can still encounter headwinds in unexpected places. The Camper employs a novel approach for us and while we've prototyped it and confidently established that it can be produced, there can always be unexpected setbacks. Global shipping also has a way of delivering surprises (see what I did there), from port of entry strikes to customs delays. \n\nNo one wants to spend the next half year struggling with fulfillment and you get Update #168 still explaining delays.

And that's not even to mention the Icelandic glossary, and pronunciation guide!\nIf I can print a bigger run, I can sell the whole thing for a much more reasonable price!\nThere are backer rewards for a wide range of donation levels, such as a pdf of the book, a physical copy, a signed and sketched in book, and even a custom illustration or comic on a subject of your choice, if you\u2019re willing to pitch in the big bucks!\nThank you so much for checking out my kickstarter, and for any support you can provide.\n1. Some nice things cool people have said about my comic\n\u201cLonnie Mann carefully parses out the wonders and pitfalls of Icelandic tourism with charming personality and enthusiastic artwork. The result is a lovely and entertaining read; his love of the trip is infectious, and his voice is adorable.\u201d\n\u2014Lucy Knisley, Creator of Age of License, Relish, and French Milk\n\u201cA terrific comic travelogue... It made me feel as if I actually visited a place I\u2019ve never been to, one I now want to \u201creturn\u201d to soon. Fantastic colors, too.\u201d\n\u2014Brian K.

Art Prints Pack\nThe two art prints which come in the art prints pack are each lovely 11x17 prints, and look like this:\n3. Those original watercolors\nAt the $200 backer reward level, you'll receive an original watecolor piece. What are those? The latter part of the book is a collection of watercolors and related stories about my second trip to Iceland. There are a bunch of them, so they range from people, to landscapes, to interior shots, etc. Backers at this level will receive a survey to choose their preferred categories, and will receive a randomly chosen piece of the type they selected. They vary in size and are sent as-is, so framing and mounting options are up to you once you receive it.\n4. Animation\nSpecial thanks to Ryan Gatts for animating the video above.

Let's talk stretch goals.\nAt $3,500 (reached!): Everyone receiving a physical reward ($20+) will also receive a set of 3 bookmarks. Here are the designs:\nAt $4,000 (reached!): Everyone receiving physical rewards will get another 3 bookmarks, for a total of 6! Here are the designs:\nAt $5,000 (reached!): The book covers will be printed with fancy spot gloss! This means parts of the design will be shiny and smooth, adding a small bit of dimensionality, and extra texture.\nAt $6,000: If, by some cosmic miracle, we reach $6k by the end of the campaign - less than 24 hours from the time of this update - I will create a new short comic (about 5-10 pages, probably) about my recent 3rd trip to Iceland for Design March in Reykjav\u00edk.

We\u2019re best known for our albums 3 Feet High and Rising, De La Soul Is Dead, Stakes Is High and many others. Some of our hit singles include \"Me Myself and I,\" \"Saturdays\" and \"Feel Good Inc.\" a collaboration with Gorillaz.\nWe\u2019ve collaborated with everyone from Chaka Khan to Common to even NASA: In 2004, our song \"Potholes in My Lawn,\" became one of the first rap records to be beamed from another planet by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity. Now we are here to collaborate with YOU, humanoid, on the most exciting project we\u2019ve ever done.\nFor the last decade, we've been independent artists, free of a record label interfering in our creative process. This will be our first De La Soul studio album in eleven years. We\u2019re excited and ready to create. It's been essential that we find ways to fund, record and release new music. Typically the fans have been the ones who support and appreciate our vision, so using Kickstarter and giving our fans the opportunity to be a part of the process just feels right. We see Kickstarter as a home for creative minds and a wonderful platform; where people who believe, respect and see the vision, can support an idea and make it a reality.\nTrue to our Hip-Hop roots, we make music without limits. This new album will incorporate elements of Jazz, Funk, Rock, Country Western and anything else we're feeling in the moment. To us, music is the influence of sounds, sounds in all vibrations and sizes, telling a story or pointing a direction. Some of these sounds we call samples, samples we use to make songs.\nS-950 & SP 1200 Samplers\nSampling is basically copying a piece of sound, from one recording, and reusing it to create a new recording. It is how De La has always made music. The sampler is our instrument, but people who copy, and in this case \"sample,\" have also been considered thieves and unoriginal. So, unfortunately a huge part of our career has also been spent fighting off the \u201csample police.\u201d\nEnough of those battles! For the new album, we needed a completely new approach, something Hip-Hop hasn\u2019t done before. So, here it is: For the first time, we're going to sample ourselves.\nVox Studios, Los Angeles, CA\nOver the last three years, we've collaborated with some of LA's finest studio musicians and recorded them in free-styled, unrehearsed, jam sessions. They played everything from banjo to upright bass, sometimes up to a dozen musicians at once; simply allowing sounds to integrate. We did 90% of these recordings in one of LA's most classic studios, Vox. We chose Vox because we wanted our recordings to have that creamy analog warm mixing board sound that the old records our parent\u2019s once played had. With over 200 hours of sounds, and vibes, equal to about 250 to 300 full-length vinyl LPs, it's time that we get to the work.\nHere\u2019s the interesting part. We are now in the process of going back to that 200+ hours of music, listening, enjoying and discovering those special moments where, musically, something magical happens, where interesting sounds and layers were forgotten, where new sounds can be sampled, looped, chopped, filtered and arranged, freely, without the intrusive presence of publishing politics and the infamous \u201csample police.\u201d What we've done is created our own crates of records; album upon albums to mine and sample from. In our world, what we\u2019ve created is freedom, freedom to make the art you believe in without having to compromise your vision. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always wanted most, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always believed in, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve fought for, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this Kickstarter with you.\nWe have a fantastic cast of artist we're collaborating with. So far Damon Albarn (of Blur/Gorillaz), 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, and David Byrne (of Talking Heads) have blessed us with their talents; and we\u2019ll have more announcements of collabs to come, right here on Kickstarter.\nClockwise: Damon Albarn, 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, David Bryne\nWe\u2019re crowdfunding it to help pay for recording, mixing, marketing, and everything else. Your support will keep us in the studio, help us continue to sample and manipulate the music we\u2019ve recorded, will help us get additional production work done; and will help us design, package, market, and distribute the album. The whole thing. We literally cannot do it without you.\nSo now, for the goodies\u2026 For your support we\u2019d like to offer you some cool rewards. Let\u2019s start with our Kickstarter only, 1GB De La Soul thumb drives uploaded with the new album. We have a limited amount of our 2015, out of stock De La Dunks by NIKE, autographed by us, for you. How about a De La Dinner Date?

His early stage name \u201cTrugoy\u201d is an inversion of his favorite food, yogurt.\nVincent Mason was born in Brooklyn, New York.

Check out these exclusive new opportunities.\nWhat Amazing Press! We've Been Featured In:\nWhat is Back in Time?\nPut simply, it's the ultimate documentary related to the Back to the Future trilogy. It's a film that digs deep into what these movies have meant to our culture. It's not a simple \u201cmaking of\u201d documentary, but rather one which explores the incredible, lasting resonance of the trilogy through the eyes of cast members and crew of the films, as well as some of the ultimate fans of the trilogy.\nPlus, the DeLorean Time Machine itself, of course.\nIt's a film that we think was begging to be made, so we did. All signs point to that being a great idea. After all, at this year's Academy Awards there were multiple references made to Back to the Future. 2015 marks the 30th anniversary of Back to the Future, and it's also the year Marty, Doc, and Jennifer visited in Back to the Future II.\nDidn't you do this before? It sounds familiar.\nYes! You may have seen or backed our previous Kickstarter campaign back in the summer of 2013. We were fortunate enough to enjoy widespread support from over 600 Back to the Future fans, and we've used the money raised during that campaign to fund filming the majority of the film.\nAnd on that note, we want to make sure we're very clear: every single pledge from the original campaign is still on track for delivery later this year, as promised. Nothing about this second campaign changes the original rewards, so if you're a backer already: THANK YOU, and you'll be receiving fulfillment this fall.\nWait, if you're already funded, what's this campaign for?\nBack in Time originated as this little idea after doing a customized \u201cflashback\u201d film for a client. Originally we were going to focus on a single, iconic part of the trilogy: the Time Machine. But as sometimes happens with an idea that has found its moment, Back in Time has grown in scope as we've progressed through production.\nThings we originally considered unlikely, or even impossible, have been captured by our crew as we've crisscrossed the country, and the world. If you'd told us that Michael J. Fox or Robert Zemeckis would have been willing to, let alone incredibly enthusiastic about, sitting down to talk about what the trilogy has meant across three decades, we'd have thought you were as looney as most of Hill Valley considered Doc Brown.\nBut we have those interviews in the can, and that's not all. Not by a long stretch. Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Bob Gale, Dean Cundey, Kevin Pike, and so many more cast and crew have lent their time to our efforts to chronicle the impact of the films. Plus some of the most amazing fans any movies have ever been blessed with, including Time Machine experts like Joe Walser; the Hendersons, who are responsible for bringing us hoverboards by 2015; and the Hollers, whose support for the Michael J. Fox foundation brings new perspective to what dedication a fandom can spawn.\nSo as much as we've carefully expended the money we collected during our previous campaign (and money from other, more traditional sources\u2014including our own pockets when we needed to) the sheer scale of the film as it stands today is far beyond our original dreams.\nThe side effect of our amazing good fortune is that we've exhausted the funds from the original campaign, while there are a number of things we can still use funding for in advance of the premiere this fall.\nBut this isn't just an opportunity for us, of course. This Kickstarter campaign offers new backers the chance to pledge for their perks, and allows returning backers to add to their previous commitments. We've also got some limited perks that are new to this campaign, and are offering up one last chance for you to get involved\u2014really involved\u2014with Back in Time before we release it into the wild.\nIn the end, this is a film which is for the fans of the films to salute the incredible, lasting impact they've had.\nA large number of the cast and crew of the trilogy, plus a bunch of people who have found themselves caught up by the films and had their lives changed profoundly as a result. But maybe you'd like to take a gander at these partial lists?\nRobert Zemeckis, Michael J. Fox, Bob Gale, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Dean Cundey, Alan Silvestri, Claudia Wells, James Tolkan, Donald Fullilove, Jeffrey Weissman, Kevin Pike, Michael Scheffe, and Andrew Probert are some of the trilogy's cast and crew we've interviewed.\nMJF Foundation fundraisers Terry and Oliver Holler, restorationist Joe Walser, collectors Bill & Patrick Shea, webmaster Stephen Clark, author and historian Rob Klein, hoverboard entrepreneurs Jill & Greg Henderson, Secret Cinema director Fabien Rigall, author Rich Handley, Superfan and Community creator Dan Harmon, and our own co-executive producer and The Goldbergs creator Adam F. Goldberg, are some of the fans who have taken the time to speak with us about how the Back to the Future trilogy has affected them.\nAnd have we mentioned that we have the DeLorean Time Machine on film? We have a few of them, actually. (Plus Marty's truck. And the clock tower. And so much other stuff.)\nAs you can see in our list of rewards, we've compiled quite an extensive list of unique rewards for those who choose to donate to this film.

He has interviewed and worked alongside personalities from all corners of the industry\u2014star athletes, team owners, pundits, analysts, and more. In addition to this heavy focus on documentary filmmaking, Jason has an extensive background in directing commercials for a wide range of companies. Jason\u2019s passion for the medium can be traced way Back in Time, to when he made a line-by-line tape recording of a certain iconic film. He\u2019s the original driving force behind this film project, and his commitment to the integrity of the documentary\u2019s material is second to none.\nLouis Krubich \u2014 Executive Producer\nA production company veteran with a long resume headlined by an extensive stint at MTV Networks, Louis leveraged his extensive knowledge of the industry into success as one of the principals at Hoboken-based Malka Media Group, a 2011 startup. His production work at MMG routinely brings him into contact with diverse clientele. Louis has worked with star clients including Adam Sandler, Michael Cera, Cameron Diaz, and Tom Cruise; as well as with major brands, corporations, charities and educational entities such as Ray-Ban, ESPN, the Embrace Kids Foundation, and New York University. Louis\u2019s Viacom past includes work creating impactful promotional content for major film releases\u2014an experience he intends to rely on to ensure the release of Back in Time is everything it can be.\nLee Leshen \u2014 Producer\nLee got his start in the industry doing finance and marketing work at Miramax Films and The Weinstein Company. Having cut his teeth with these major players, he founded Patchwork Media in the mid-00\u2019s. A facilitator at heart, Lee brings a vast array of experience in developing mutually beneficial arrangements to the table. His company\u2019s focus on finding ways for branded entertainment and media outlets to benefit from forging partnerships (and admittedly massive BttF fanboy status) paved the way for Lee signing on with Patchwork Media to serve as a production company for Back in Time. A problem-solver with an unconventional outlook, Lee\u2019s input has proven invaluable to the project ever since, and his marketing experience is about to be put to seriously good use.\nAdam F. Goldberg \u2014 Co-Executive Producer\nAdam is a producer/writer best known for his television work. He created and ran the hijinks-heavy Breaking In for two seasons on Fox, then followed up with The Goldbergs, the critically-acclaimed comedy not-so-loosely based on his own experiences growing up which once had an amusing, if less-than-clean, working title. With the series set to enter its third season in 2015, Adam is busy working non-stop on multiple new projects, including Back in Time. Adam\u2019s extensive resume includes screenplay credits for Fanboys, The Jetsons, Aliens in the Attic, The Muppet Wizard of Oz, and How to Train Your Dragon, as well as the upcoming films Flat Stanley and The Berenstain Bears. In addition to being the force behind two comedy series success stories, Adam has written for many other TV shows, including Community, Aliens in America, and Voltron Force\nGregory Lassik \u2014 Cinematographer\nGregory is the owner/operator of two production companies: Spark + Boom, and Endless Wave Studios. He brings extensive experience with documentary and commercial filming to the project, along with an incredible heart. Gregory\u2019s attention to always doing the right thing locks right in with his desire to, well, blow things up. His vision is influenced by this purity of purpose and he thrives on creating modern, electric cinema. His dedication to capturing the essence of the cultural phenomenon that BttF has become is expressed through what\u2019s at the center of the Back in Time project: the raw footage we shoot.\nThe Rest of Our Team\nAs the scope of this project has grown, so has our team.  To see a full list of our crew visit our website here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately we've managed to complete the vast majority of filming on the documentary already. Barring some kind of \u201cAct of God\u201d we're going to premiere Back in Time as planned this fall in Los Angeles\u2014during the 30th anniversary celebrations for Back to the Future known as We're Going Back. \n\nThe biggest risk of not making our campaign goal is that we'll be unable to screen Back in Time at as many film festivals as we'd like to, and that will mean less people get to see and hear about what we've put together. Failure to fund might also have a slight impact on how much better the final film could be, but considering what we have now vastly exceeds our wildest dreams for what this project was ever going to turn into, that's nowhere near a disaster. At this point we're adding little pieces to something already amazing, not working to get something presentable.\n\nIf we do end up failing to fund, we'll still be aggressively pursuing other avenues for trying to get together the funding to improve on what we have and to get more exposure. But to be honest, we believe in our film, we believe in the fans of the back to the Future trilogy, and we believe that a movie born of the passion we all share can't help but attract enough attention to succeed.\n\nLong story short: pledging has pretty much near zero downside. Back in Time is set to be a phenomenal documentary which really gets to the heart of the immense cultural significance of the trilogy, and it will be ready for backers to enjoy in October of 2015.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Full Video of the Shea's BTTF Collection Livestream!", "update_content": "That's right, the wait is almost over!

If you\u2019re not pleased with the result, you can simply click refresh and see a new design for your tweet.\nEvery design is based on the monospace grid system that adapts to fit different tweets.\nEach top level design comes in a wide variety of combinations of color, typefaces and graphics.\nWe want every print to be unique. Any given tweet can only be purchased once for every design combination. This means it's not possible for anyone else to own the same print as you, ensuring complete originality. At launch we will feature 15 different artists with 50 original designs and over 5000 possible design outcomes. And that\u2019s just the beginning!\nPeter and Louise discussing designs.\nTo celebrate the Kickstarter campaign, our Art Director Albin Holmqvist has made a one-of-a-kind, limited-edition print design for Kickstarter backers only. This is a \"once in a life print\" opportunity!\nThree of the many possible outcomes of our Kickstarter exclusive design\nDeveloping the site we have been focusing on three main principles. The first: to allow for a wide variety of design implementations. We don\u2019t want artists to be limited by the system, but rather make a system that can scale and adapt to their vision. We believe this is the only way to create something that has a real artistic value, rather than a computer-generated feel.\nSecond, we ensure that each design combination looks its best by linking certain fonts, colors and images together. This requires a close collaboration between the artist and the developer in constructing a specific framework around each design.\nSome very early wireframes of the print presentation page.\nThird, it has to be simple to find that perfect tweet from the 500 million tweets added each day. To solve this problem we are developing our own ranking system that takes both content and visual value into consideration to find something personal that looks great on your wall.\nOnce created, each print is presented in an environment matching the design\nSome of the lines of code responsible for it all.\nQuality is everything. We take great pride in the quality of our work. All of our prints are high quality gicl\u00e9e and the 300 gr/m2 untreated natural paper stock has a lovely tactile feel and works beautifully either framed or unframed. We inspect and hand-emboss every print that leaves our shop. We provide handwritten signatures from the artist, pack all the prints in silk paper and use a sturdy cardboard tube to ensure a safe delivery worldwide. All in all, we treat your art with the respect it deserves.\nEvery print is numbered in our endless number series\nWe've put together a list of nice rewards for all our awesome backers. Each and every contribution is extremely appreciated! \n       Uniqueness - of your words and of the prints - is at the heart of Onehundredforty. So when it comes to frames, we didn't want to go with an off-the-shelf solution. That\u2019s why we teamed up with Well Made, a great frame maker and fellow Kickstarter offspring.\n\nThe folks at Well Made have created STiiCKs, a really smart framing solution, sourced and made in the U.S. It consists of two wooden bars that hold your print in place through strong magnets. STiiCKs are available in oak, walnut, black or white (images show \u201coak\u201d), so you can pick the set that fits your home the best.\nBack Onehundredforty and get a tote bag with this awesome tweet from Kat Dennings.\nWe\u2019re a friendly group of creatives from Stockholm, Sweden, who got tired of seeing the same mass-produced art prints and posters cluttering the walls of homes and public spaces. So we decided to do something about it.\nAt our agency we have a tradition where we make personal prints for those who move on to new adventures as something to remember us by.\nWe truly miss both Arnaud and Elin, but look at their awesome prints!\nA year ago we started thinking, what if we could recreate that experience for people everywhere? What if we could make art prints that not only look beautiful from a far, have a personal and \u201creadable\u201d story to tell when you get up close? Two years later, we are proud to present Onehundredforty.\nBy day we work as a creative agency to make smart campaigns and projects for brands around the world. By night we dream of being free artists - without briefs, budgets or conference calls. We\u2019re an agile, dynamic group of designers, programmers, film-makers, strategists, PR-people, animators and project managers that have the skills and know-how to turn this idea into reality.\nWe want Onehundredforty to become more than just our private design playground. So we\u2019ve built an open system to allow contributions from artists, designers, font factories and photographers from all over the world. Our in-house staff curate the collection to ensure consistent design integrity. Together we aim to make this a living organism, a constantly evolving gallery of designs and memorable words.\nSome artists currently working with us:\nMichael Smith\nRedouane Oumahi\nHigino Rodriguez\nAdriana Bellet\nMalika Favre\nCecilia Schr\u00f6der\nMiki Stefanoski\nMaria Gr\u00f6nlund\nAnna Sundvall\nSatsuki Shibuya\nMagdalena Czarnecki\nPaula Maso\nCecilia B\u00f6rjesson\nGema Navarro\nThis is an art experiment. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to end. It\u2019s not going to be the new Facebook (we\u2019re pretty sure). So designers will probably have to wait awhile before quitting their day jobs. Our payment system ensures fair compensation to all contributors to Onehundredforty. We also have a whole section on the site celebrating the designers and font factories we collaborate with. This is truly a collective effort.\nWe want Onehundredforty to be affordable. Our fixed price of $55 per print covers the artist\u2019s fee, all production costs, packaging and international shipping!\nWe\u2019ve come a long way, but we need your help. Help us spread the word, get artists on board and expand our printing studio (right now we print on one printer in the corner of our office). So please pledge - and don\u2019t forget to share the project with your friends, family and Twitter acquaintances!\n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBelow are some of the challenges we\u2019re facing. We\u2019ve listed them to help give you better understanding of what your pledge money will be used for (we promise it\u2019s not too technical).\n\n1. Development of the algorithm\nThe development of the algorithm that creates the prints based on your tweet is up and running. However, we are still adding functionality and new designs to the site that may require adjustments and/or modifications to the system. In other words, lots of additional working hours for our developers.\n\n2. Timely shipping of the Kickstarter prints\nWe\u2019re currently managing all the printing and shipping in-house. Thus, resources for printing and packaging are limited. If we receive a tremendous amount of demand, we\u2019ll engage an external print service of comparable quality to ensure timely delivery.\n\n3. Implementation of new designs\nEvery new design needs to be manually implemented into our system in order to ensure scalability. This takes some time and not all submitted designs will work. This can affect the number of available designs upon launch of Onehundredforty. However, we are refining our briefing document for designers and working closely with them to make sure that all designs can be submitted successfully.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "All backers invited!", "update_content": "Hello early number backers,\nby 5pm CET tomorrow Wednesday we will email you your invitational codes.

This wonderful, deluxe version of the game will include the spectacular new characters developed for the very special version of the game played in Indianapolis at the Gen Con 2014 charity event.\nThe very special version of the game played at Gen Con 2014\nThe very special game map is the carpet in the top reward\nAnd Now, Some Notes From the Accountants on the Components\nEverything about this version of the game is designed to be impressive. \nThe multi-level board will be over ten square feet in size, featuring artwork by Jared Blando.\nThere will be more cards than you can shake a handcrafted artisan stick at. There will be components galore, to punch and explore! Imagine yourself punching out five or perhaps six sheets of the finest die-cut chipboard. Imagine seeing all of your favorite Dunshire characters rendered in 2d.   \nOne might say, \u201ccollect all 17,\u201d but here they are, all in one box. Take a second to think about each of them, who they are, and what they mean for you: Wizard, Maverick, Arbiter, Corporal, Warriors, Dragon, Alchemist, Provost, Denier, Shaman, Abbott, Brinksman, Farmer, Duchess, Mountebank, Minstrel, and Tradesman. We are showing art from Aaron J. Riley and others as we proceed.  \nThe Arbiter\nThe Arbiter has what you\u2019d call a alpha/type A personality. She likes to make a lot of decisions for people, but as she knows a lot of law stuff, and gets paid to do these things, it only makes sense. She\u2019s told me that she has very good taste and has a real understanding for what is best in every situation. Her six powers allow her to find the best way to take advantage of any situation, within the boundaries of the law of course, as is expected of any civil servant.\nThe Warrior\n In many ways The Warrior reminds me of my father. Strong, bold, always carrying a sword. He never wore boots like that, or a tunic. In fact, I can\u2019t remember him ever wearing a shirt. The warrior has six impressive powers, one of which is actually called \u201cImpressive.\u201d It will not surprise you to know that he likes to assert himself whenever possible. He also always has to have the last word in any argument, and will throw out all your collectable figurines without asking.\nThe Brinksman\nOne would expect that with a name like The Brinksman that he\u2019d want to push everything to the limit, but if you think that, you\u2019d be wrong. He wants to push it past the limit. How far past the limit? Not that far, but far enough that you know it. How would you know it? Because he\u2019d tell you, and then he\u2019d tell you again. And then he\u2019d laugh, and then he\u2019d laugh again just to make sure that the laugh was his. And then he\u2019d tell you about it.\nThe Abbot & The Shaman\nI\u2019m not going to say that The Abbot is lazy, I\u2019ll just say that he appreciates what he has been given. Everything is just fine for the Abbot and would prefer to keep it that way.\nThe Shaman walks the line between the light and the dark of the cone of decision. Sheathed or unsheathed, he sees the value of both. Some might think his methods are a little woo woo, but the results are all we really care about right? I mean no one really believes in astral projection, except my aunt Saffron. She believes in just about anything. \nThe Duchess & The Dragonman\nThe Duchess really appreciates all the ways in which you can help her out. She would really appreciate it if you could cover her bill and then find somewhere else to be. I was in a diner the other day, closed my eyes and wished three times that I was the Duchess, but everyone was still staring at me and the bill still sat there untouched. Luckily I get cash back if I charge it which is totally like being the Duchess.\nThe Dragonman is just outright a badass. He can fly. He can kick major booty on the board and against Doom points. So what if he has a compulsion? I mean who doesn\u2019t like to horde gold at the expense of any significant movement? I mean I work 12 hours a day just to get some cabbage, I ain\u2019t going nowhere. Of course, it will all be worth it once they move me from lead intern to assistant file clerk.\nThe Denier & The Maverick\nThe Denier: Sometimes I like to imagine myself as a The Denier. Only instead of destroying gems so that other characters cannot get them, I feel that I am destroying the gems from within\u2019 myself and then I come to screaming, covered in sweat and the contents of my juice box. \nThe Maverick: This lady is her own dawg. She isn\u2019t bound by any rules, because that\u2019s how she rolls. More accurately, she is actually bound by all the rules unless she gets the right dice, to \u2026 uh \u2026 not be bound by the rules, you know, how she rolls.\nEach character has a Character Sheet with all their absurd variety of powers, and to top it off we\u2019re providing you with three of each so that multiple players can enjoy an infinite combination of character power combos (please note that this is hyperbole, but trust us, it\u2019s a big number). You will have hero tokens and civilization tokens to impress your friends and relatives. \n A mountain of coins will be included, such that if they were real coins, you would be very rich. In addition, the game will be packed with gems. Real plastic gems, so real that if they were any more real they would be worth more than the price of the game, so plastic it is. Imagine large ones and small ones in 3 colors: red, yellow, and blue. \nDunshire is a dangerous place and with danger there is conflict. The Front of Traganaro piece shows where a never-ending combat roils, as the battle line is pushed back and forth across the land. \n The dice! One must roll dice to see how many dice need to be rolled. You will see 4 sets of dice that include both six sided dice and mindboggling 8 sided dice. These 8 siders are like no others, and will be provided in two colors. Seriously, it\u2019s gonna be great. \n But, of course, it\u2019s all about the cones. Sure, there are some games that have cones, but then there is THIS game. Wrap your head around 48 Cones of Dunshire cones in 4 different colors, Red, Green, Yellow, AND Blue. And who can forget the Start Player Cone? Is it the most important cone in the game? You have to play to find out. Then there is the big one, The Cone of Decision, AKA The Dark Cone. This one is a monster. I mean this thing is a gigantic piece of wood. Please do not use it as a weapon. This giant cone can only be controlled by the Cone Sheath, which slides on snugly. \nThen there is the box! Oh what a box this is going to be. How else are you going to hold a game this big without a container that won\u2019t fall apart under its own weight? It is a \u201cbox\u201d like you\u2019ve never seen before. In the coming weeks, we will show you exactly what that means! \nIn addition, we have a spectacular additional component set to add to the game. You can include special hero and civilization tokens. But really, if you were wowed by the concept of a 2D version, wait until you see these characters as fully formed miniatures in metallic three dimensions (and by that I mean with your eyes in real life). These will come with their own special base for gameplay and will be painted to look brassy and \u201cold fashioned.\u201d \nThis is expensive, but this is a one-time opportunity to own a legendary game in an edition that people will talk about and desire for years. Nothing else will bring The Architect\u2019s vision to life, as this game will!

I want to pay homage to that history and create a deck of playing cards with art inspired by the tarot. \nIn some countries, traditional tarot cards aren't used just for divination, they're actually used for games the way we commonly use regular playing cards. Likewise, today's standard playing cards are used by some for divination\u2014known as cartomancy. The two card systems started out as the same thing and are still inextricably linked. This deck is the first I'm aware of that takes that simple fact as the inspiration for its design.\nThe Art, Suits, Symbolism, and the Rider-Waite\nThe art for this deck is heavily influenced by the 1910 Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck\u2014its pretty much the standard for tarot cards used for divination. Though the style of my art is very different from Pamela Smith's art, the themes and intent will be very much in the spirit of her artwork with a healthy dose of my own intent and interpretation. \nArcana is first-and-foremost a playing card deck. Wherever possible I've pulled inspiration from the RWS Tarot, the Tarot of Marseilles, and the Sola Busca Tarot. That includes the royals, the suits, and the symbolism. That said, combining the two has meant a few tradeoffs.\nArcana isn't intended to be a full tarot deck. Playing cards printed through USPCC are 56 card decks (main cards plus 2 jokers, and 2 extra cards) while the tarot uses 78 cards. As a playing card deck, I'll be designing 56 cards, which means I have to limit the Major Arcana to 4 cards (replacing the two jokers and the 2 extra cards). The four cards I've chosen to include are The Tower, The Lovers, The Fool, and Death. I've consulted with a lot of tarot readers on this and they more or less agree that these cards are of importance to any reading and make sense to include. Additionally, these cards will not include the Page/Knave cards.\nCorrelating the suits was also a little dicey as there is at least a little healthy debate about which playing card suit goes with which tarot suit. I opted to go with what seemed like the most common concensus. Spades, Clubs, Hearts and Diamonds are paired up in this deck with Swords, Wands, Cups, and Pentacles respectively.\nAlso, just a note about my art. I take inspiration from all over\u2014art history, found images, my own sketches and photographs. I combine all of it to create something new. I create the final art by combining art from scratchboard and images I draw on my tablet. It's all hand drawn, and I'm meticulous about making sure the final imagery works at the relatively small scale of playing cards.\nThe Cards\nI hope you can tell from this artwork how much passion and dedication I have for the project. Each card takes many, many hours to draw, and I've been working on it for about a year. For me, the art is what custom playing cards are all about. If you backed one of my past projects, you know how detailed and unique my work is. It's a great pleasure to bring you these cards which I think takes my art to a whole new level. Please note that all images are just comps and subject to change.\nCard back light\nCard back dark\nJack of Clubs/Wands - light\nKing of Spades/Swords - light version\nJack of Spades/Swords light version\nAce of Hearts/Cups - dark version\nQueen of Hearts/Cups dark\n10 of Hearts/Cups dark\nAce of Spades/Swords light\nAce of Spades/Swords dark\n7 of Spades/Swords dark\nQueen of Diamonds/Pentacles\n5 of Clubs/Wands dark\nThe Tower - one of the 4 major arcana cards in this deck\nThe Lovers\nDeath\nJack of Hearts/Cups light\nKing of Hearts/Cups light\nKing of Diamonds/Pentacles - light\nMany of the other royals are in various stages of completion. My goal is to have all the artwork finalized by the end of the funding period. That's a tall order, so it's possible completing the art might stretch a bit past the funding period. I'll definitely be posting more card images as I create them, so be sure to check back and feel free to offer suggestions.\nThe Box\nAs you can tell, there will be 2 versions of Arcana, one light and the other dark. Here are some images of the box:\nText translates roughly to 'As above, so below'\nThe Prints\nNOTE: Prints can now be included as add-ons for $50/ ($58 Int.)\nAs with my past projects, I'm making prints available of of each royal design, the card back, box front, and the aces. My process is to create plates from the original card art. I ink the plates, then run them through my press on museum-grade artist paper:\nInking the printing plate\nLining it up on press\nThe finished hand-pulled print\nAn example of the detail in the prints\nThe finished print, signed and numbered. Please note that print rewards will not include the easel or board.\nI think there's something really rare and special about the artistry of hand-pulling editions. I'm thrilled to offer these gallery worthy prints for about the same as what others offer mass-produced silk screened prints or even less than Giclee prints (which are nice, but really they're just ink-jet prints with a fancy name). These hand-pulled prints are a unique chance to own a limited edition work of art.\nAll prints will be 12\" x 16\" on Stonehenge paper, with hand-torn deckled edges\u2014I personally tear down the paper myself to size. All prints will be 1 color, signed and numbered editions.\nPrints can be added on to your pledge for $50/($58 Int.)\nAdd Ons\nAdding any of the add on items below is pretty simple:\nFirst, choose a reward tier\nSecond, click on the \"Manage my pledge\" button, and add the amount of the add-on. \nThat's pretty much it. After the funding period, You'll be able to specify versions, sizes, etc.If you're an international backer, be sure to add the shipping amount if an add on has additional shipping costs (specified below).\nHardbound Illustrated Book - $28/$36 (Int.)SHIPS  DECEMBER 2015\nThis 6\" x 9\" black linen hardbound book with dust jacket will be illustrated with full page art for every major card (every card that has an illustration) and gives you a chance to learn more about what I wanted to accomplish with each illustration. It also will serve as a primer for those newer to tarot on how to read each card. It will contain approximately 150 \u2013 200 pages. \nPlease note that this is only a comp image and final art and layout is subject to change\nComp image of an interior layout. Minor cards (2s-10s) will likely be ganged 2-up on a page, all major illustrations will be full page art.\nMAJOR ARCANA Expansion Deck - $20/$25 (Int.)\nDeck with both light and dark versions of the Major Arcana tarot cards. This deck is for folks who want a complete tarot set and is in addition to the light and dark main cards. \nPLEASE NOTE THIS DECK WILL NOT SHIP UNTIL DECEMBER 2015\nMajor Arcana Expansion Deck\nTarot 2-piece Boxes - $5 each, int. shipping included\nShips December 2015\nDark version 2-part box (please note that no cards are included with the box and the design is subject to change\nLight version 2-part box (please note that no cards are included with the box and the design is subject to change\nAs promised, these premium finished boxes are being made available to you more-or-less at cost. These are 2mm thick cardboard boxes that will come in dark and light versions, will have metallic foil and spot UV varnish. These are 2-part boxes, meaning the top fits over the bottom and encloses the cards within. I did my best to mock these up, but please note the comps are for the general idea only and do not show the final design or premium finishes. These boxes are intended for folks who want to separate light and dark cards from the expansion deck and keep full tarot sets together.\nBlack Walnut and White Oak Inlay Wooden Tarot Box with Arcana Medallion - $45 / $55 Int.\nShips December 2015\nPlease note: The medallion in this image was comped, the box is a real prototype. Wooden box does not include cards.\nPlease note: Wooden box does not include cards.\nThis box is STUNNING in person, I hope the images do it justice! The white oak inlay really sets off the black walnut which has an at times reddish cast to it. This is sized to perfectly contain one full Tarot set (not included). This box can be used to protect and store complete tarot sets when used with the expansion deck. It features a swing hinge top piece that opens up to reveal the cards within. And, of course, it is topped off with an inset Arcana Silver-Finish Medallion.\n30\" x 30\" Black Silk Tarot Reading Cloth with Metallic Silver Imprint - $22 / $26 Int.\nSilk Tarot Reading Cloth. Please note design is subject to change slightly before being produced. Does not include wall or moulding, but shadows are included free of charge.\n I've found an amazing source for 100% silk tarot cloths. These beauties will be screen printed with metallic silver ink. They'll make an amazing setting for tarot readings!\nExtra decks - $11/$13(Int.)\nNo Extra deck limits, add on as many as you'd like.\nT-Shirts - $22/$32(Int.)\nPremium 4.2 oz. Available in S-XL (after the funding period you'll be able to select which version and size you'd like).\nArcana tree of life t-shirt\nArcana rota fortunae t-shirt\nArcana Uncut Sheets - $50/$75(Int.)\nUncut sheets are taken off the press as they're printed at the USPCC. They show every card in the deck, front and back. Each sheet will be signed and there is no limit to the number you may add-on. Each sheet is approximately 22\" x 26.5\"\nArcana Uncut sheets - dark and light versions\nAntique Silver Finish Coins\u2014$12, shipping included for domestic and international\nThese are the same heavy-duty, 10 gauge, half-dollar sized coins I had minted for my past projects, this time with an antique silver finish. They're a great weight (about the same as 5 quarters), super detailed and have a gorgeous finish. Other coins are molded, these are minted and that's a difference you can see and feel in the detail. Nothing beats a 100 tons of pressure making every detail pop. \nAntique finish coins - this is just a comp image and art is subject to change\nSolid Silver Proof Arcana Coin\u2014$55 (shipping included for domestic and international)\nOne troy ounce of .999 pure silver coin - note that this is just a mockup.\nOne of the advantages of having coins minted (as opposed to molded, don't get me started\u2026) is that I can mint them in solid precious metals. For the first time, I'm proud to offer a SOLID silver version of the Arcana coin. This coin isn't silver plated, it is one troy ounce of solid .999 pure silver. These are \"proof coins\" and will have with a mirror finish. Below is a comp (since they aren't minted yet), but should give you an idea of what it will look like and how it differs from the regular antique silver-finish coin (which is a great genuine metal minted coin, but is not solid silver, it's a brass alloy coin with a finish applied).\nPlease note that because of the nature of this reward, outside the US it is strictly \"buy at your own risk\". We will under no circumstances issue replacement coins if your postal carrier loses it, misplaces it, or you otherwise do not receive it. We lose tracking ability when most international shipments fly out through Chicago, but our responsibility for packages ends when ship to you in good faith. We've experienced some fraud in the past, and this type reward opens us up to a LOT of risk, so we are also limiting orders to 5 per backer. Also, within the US these coins will be sent separately from other rewards and the USPS will request your signature for you to receive the coins.\n It's hard to comp up the coins to show exactly what they look like, but here's a picture from a past project showing the detail when coins are minted:\nActual minted coins\n Stretch Goals\n50K - Iridescent pearl paper stock for tucks\u2014REACHED!\n55K - Designs/printing inside tucks\u2014REACHED!\n60K - Embossing + foil(s) on tucks\u2014REACHED!!\n65K - Major Arcana expansion deck\u2014REACHED!!!\n75K - Free print for EVERY PRINT BACKER\u2014REACHED!!!\n100K - Free gift for EVERY BACKER (over $11)\u2014REACHED!!! \n120K - The Illustrated Guide to Arcana hardbound book released. \u2014REACHED!!!\n150K stretch goal - LE deck sleeve for every every deck, Gilded Edition released\u2014REACHED!!! What? Yes!\nThis last stretch goal requires a little explanation. I want to do something very special that doesn\u2019t require backers to add anything on\u2014a true thank you from me to you for getting the project to this point. So if we reach this goal, I\u2019ll include a signed and numbered sleeve for every deck that won\u2019t interfere with you being able to open the cards up and use them. This will only be for backers\u2014only the KS decks will come with the LE sleeve. This will make every deck in the project extra valuable, since only KS backers will ever have them.\nThe Gilded Edition release will be a set of all three decks with a special leather bound book box I\u2019ll be hand binding myself (book binding is a one of my passions as you might have been able to tell from all the pictures with the cast-iron book press in this project). The decks will have edges gilded with palladium leaf. Palladium leaf is more expensive than silver leaf and has one major advantage. Palladium leaf does not tarnish, or oxidize, and maintains it\u2019s finish under the harshest of conditions. It\u2019s so stable in fact, that it\u2019s used for gilding in conditions where it will be exposed to outdoor elements. Personally I think it\u2019s more beautiful too, it has a slightly warmer tone than silver leaf. There will only be 25 (changed - now 45, also, will include everything at the $500 level too) of these very rare and special sets made available. Because these decks will be EXTREMELY labor intensive to produce, they will be a new reward tier and will cost $500. I know that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but others sell genuinely gilded decks (not fake gilding using cheap foils) for upwards of $125 a piece. Hand gilding decks is an EXTREMELY labor intensive process requiring sanding multiple times at progressively finer grits, buffing to a glass-like finish, sizing the edges to receive the metal leaf, and then carefully applying the leaf. Truly these will be the ultimate collector\u2019s item. If we reach the 150K mark, I\u2019ll release the timing details of the Gilded Edition tier in advance (see Update) so everyone has a fair shot if interested in them. They will be first-come, first-serve.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third project so I feel like I've got a lot of experience.

Here on the other side of the Hollywood sign, they\u2019re not pretending to have love scenes--they\u2019re doing it for real. The creators of Pretty Filthy spent months visiting porn sets and interviewing the real people of porn. What we learned changed our lives\u2014and now we want to change yours. This labor of love (and sex) has been years in the making\u2014YOUR support will help bring this bold new musical to the stage!\nA SHOWBIZ MUSICAL ABOUT PORN?\nThe story of Pretty Filthy began several years ago. Members of our company, The Civilians, found themselves talking about some of their favorite musicals\u2014Gypsy, Cabaret, A Chorus Line. What do these classics have in common? They\u2019re shows about performers\u2014 lives on the other side of the bright lights. We asked ourselves: \u201cWell, what type of entertainer has yet to have their own major musical?\u201d The obvious answer was the \u201cadult\u201d entertainer. The porn star on the other side of your screen. \nBut the hard question was\u2014what would it take for us to do this right? We didn\u2019t want to just write about our pre-conceived ideas. So we left New York for the Valley, and over several months we interviewed hundreds of porn professionals. We visited sets, visited porn stars at home, ate sushi with porn stars. We listened. We learned. And the extraordinary people we met proved our hunch was right\u2014porn is the next big show-biz musical. In a sense, porn is a mirror of our society (and a mirror that shows everything from the sublime to the totally trashy). But most importantly, these characters need to be heard on stage. (And they need to sing.)\nA TRUE LABOR OF LOVE.\nThe show\u2019s creative team, composer Michael Friedman (Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, Fortress of Solitude), writer Bess Wohl (American Hero), and director Steve Cosson (Mr. Burns, a post-electric play), have been crafting this musical for the past several years. Taking inspiration from the extensive research, the writing team developed the script. Along the way, we tried out songs and material in front of small audiences, much of which you can listen to on The Civilians podcast here.  (For quick reference: episodes 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 65)\nThe Civilians are thrilled to be producing the culmination of all these efforts with the premiere production of Pretty Filthy. The show will be presented in a beautiful hundred-year-old Broadway style theater in New York City\u2019s historic Lower East Side. We\u2019ve put together a cast featuring some of the brightest stars of musical theater, and a dream design team of Broadway visionaries. We are primed to launch, but we are doing this ourselves without the support of a larger institutional theater. And that makes this campaign all the more critical to our ability to fully realize the potential of Pretty Filthy.\nComposer Michael Friedman and Writer Bess Wohl\nWE CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOU.\nThis is by far the most ambitious project The Civilians has undertaken to date. We are producing on a bigger scale than ever before, and taking this risk because we believe so completely in Pretty Filthy. By supporting this project, you are an integral part of this brilliant team. Every contribution, no matter the amount, is vitally important and will go directly towards supporting this non-profit production. Your help also enables us to host a series of discussions with several leading adult entertainers such as the legendary Nina Hartley. We invite you to take this leap with us and boldly go where no major musical has ever gone before.\nResearch in the valley\nTHE PERKS\nTo thank you for joining us on this Pretty Filthy journey, we\u2019ve put together some exclusive awards\u2014benefits and experiences that are only available through this Kickstarter campaign. You can help bring the legendary Nina Hartley to New York, and join her for a pre-show dinner, a backstage tour, and you\u2019ll sit next to her during the show! Other rewards are one-on-one script development sessions with writer Bess Wohl and composer Michael Friedman. A special, behind-the-scenes download of photos and excerpts from our investigation.

This way you can carry your books or bags and talk on the phone while carrying your coffee around.\nGoat mug is 100% leak proof so don't worry about getting coffee stains on your jeans. It s also safe for your health because it is BPA FREE.\nSince you are on-the-go kind of person, we made your life easier by making the Goat\u00b4s lid so user friendly, you can easily open and close it with only one hand.\n Here's a look inside the Goat mug.

For Radiotopia - and all of radio - to be the best it can be, we need to find even more people who are not currently on our radar.\nSo we have a big idea. At $600,000, Radiotopia will create a pilot development fund to find new, talented producers and hosts. We will specifically seek out new voices to pilot programs that tackle subjects not well covered in traditional public media.\nQuality will always be our first criteria. I believe diversity of people and perspectives is the key component to quality that\u2019s too often neglected in media.\nWe are interested in producers who pilot their own program, as well as contribute stories to existing Radiotopia shows.\nBringing in new voices and broadening the audience are critical steps in remaking public radio. Our collective of shows is already proving that incredible talent exists in unexpected places, and that we have a knack for finding it.\nIf you believe in this mission, kick in another buck or two, or just spread the word.\n***The Hover 20,000 Backer Challenge***\nWe did it!

Look what we did together!\n\"[A] kind of Justice League for smart documentarians and sound artists.\"\n--Bill McKibben\nThis is Radiotopia. I'm Roman Mars.\nRadiotopia became a reality in November 2013, when I called on the backers of the last 99% Invisible campaign to fund \"a new kind of public radio.\" Radio full of the most compelling stories imaginable, made by a group of talented creators combining their energies to grow their audiences and thrive. \nPeople - probably many of you - rallied beyond our wildest dreams. It was an awe-inspiring moment, the realization that the heart of a radio fan can grow to make room for many deserving shows. Together with PRX, we\u2019ve taken that love, trust, and money to bring together a collective of the best storytelling shows on the planet.\n99% Invisible\nFugitive Waves\nLove + Radio\nRadio Diaries\nStrangers\nTheory of Everything\nThe Truth\nThese shows make you laugh, cry, cringe, remember, reflect, strive, despair, relax... everything. \nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, as members of Radiotopia, they are reimagining radio from broadcast to digital, and the life of a creator from starving to sustainable. Radiotopia is bringing a listener-first, creator-driven ethos to public radio.\nIn just a few months, we have built a true collective of indie producers who share editorial, business, and emotional resources. It\u2019s not just an amazing group of podcasts, it\u2019s an amazing group of people. And we\u2019re getting somewhere:\nThe Radiotopia Network has increased downloads by 165% since our launch nine months ago.\nTwo shows have more than quadrupled their audience.\n99% Invisible, which had the biggest audience to begin with, has grown by 135%.\nThe dream is alive, but our work here is far from done. \nTo take it to the next level, we need you. Podcasts need about 50,000 downloads per episode for some measure of financial sustainability. Radiotopia wants our existing shows to blow through that number. That takes more gear, more staff, more travel, more branding and promotion. Our shows are not just two people chatting in front of microphone (not that there's anything wrong with that - I love a lot of those shows); they are skillfully crafted, sound-rich productions. That commitment to craft requires a lot of time and resources.\nYour Kickstarter pledge will support all the shows in Radiotopia and ensure that all of us will continue to produce our best work.\nWe also want to invite more shows into Radiotopia. A win-win-win for us, for deserving creators, and for you, our fans and listeners. Your support will make that happen.\n The Rewards\nRadiotopia Ringtones\nAll the shows in Radiotopia are contributing to a set of awesome and awesomely weird ringtones/alert tones.

For those of you unfamiliar with that campaign, we successfully funded an illustrated map populated with the locations of 136 of the most popular sci-fi and fantasy events to ever take place in the Altered States of America.\nImage Altered States, our first Kickstarted campaign\nAfter delving deep into the world of fantasy and fiction we are now setting our sights much higher\u2026 deep space exploration. Having already launched our own line of space-themed t-shirts including Beyond Earth, Above Earth and You are the Sun \u2014 we are happy to have confirm that real robot themed designs seem to be just as popular as fictional robot designs.\n50+ YEARS OF ROBOTIC SPACE PROBES\nWith the recently completed airing of the new Cosmos series, a new high-tech rover on Mars, Europeans landing on a comet in November and New Horizons on it\u2019s way to Pluto in 2015 \u2014 the public is excited again about deep space exploration. Additionally, the age of the internet has made data from various past missions easily accessible to the masses. From all corners of the globe, amateur imagers are re-working old data sets with the power of modern computing and generating new looks at faraway places without ever having to leave the ground.\nEach of these missions represent the best of what human intellect can achieve and can also provide a nostalgic sense of pride. To many, Voyager was a big part living through the '80s with it\u2019s tour of the outer solar system and Carl Sagan\u2019s original Cosmos series. In the \u201990s Galileo treated us to a thrilling tour of Jupiter and it\u2019s exotic moons. Then Y2K served up Cassini at Saturn and two particularly robust rovers on Mars with two out of the three operating to this day. \nWe have noticed over the last few years, that there have been some beautiful poster series by various designers covering themes such as Earth science, manned space missions, the planets and astronomy. However, designs that focused specifically on any particular robotic planetary missions seemed to be almost non-existent. When you do find something \u2014 the designs are generally data-driven. The likes of which might be expected gracing the walls of a high school science lab, but not hanging prominently in one\u2019s own living room. Well we want to change that and here is how we propose doing it.\nTHE PROJECT\nWe are proposing a series of posters based on three different historic robotic spacecraft programs. Each poster will be screen-printed in a minimum of three colors by Vahalla Studios who beautifully executed our previously mentioned Kickstarter project from last year.\nHow were the missions selected? First, we wanted to find out what missions are favorites among an audience that is passionate about space exploration. So on October 19th, The Planetary Society completed a simple poll on their website. The poll put to users what their three favorite robotic spacecraft missions were from Sputnik to Curiosity. This poll ran it\u2019s course for two weeks and we now have the results which have determined what missions will be the subjects of the full series.\nPoster #1: The Voyager Program (2nd below)\nPoster #2: Cassini / Huygens (1st below)\nPoster #3: Mars Science Lab (seen at top)\nPoster #2: Cassini / Huygens\nPoster #1: Voyager\nAs of this date, all three posters are complete. Originally we established the look and design approach we were proposing for the whole series by designing a poster for the Voyager missions which we knew would wind up being in the top three of the survey results. We later added Cassini\u2019s design on October 21, and then Curiosity on October 31.\nPROJECT PHASES\nPHASE 1 We consider this campaign to have four phases. Phase 1 ran for two weeks and polled for the most popular missions according to planetary.com users.\n\nPHASE 2 We published the poll results and announced the three missions that will comprise the series.\n\nPHASE 3All three design options are made public.\nPHASE 4Is where we are now. Hoping to reach the stretch goals.\nOTHER REWARDS\nMEMBERSHIP TO THE PLANETARY SOCIETY\nThe Planetary Society was founded in 1980 by by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman. The group is an advocate for funding and for missions of exploration from within NASA. In it\u2019s many years it has been responsible for some well-known initiatives such as SETI, making rover-based exploration the standard for ongoing Mars missions and was instrumental in getting Pluto to be the first target of NASA\u2019s New Horizons type missions. We are offering on several reward levels an opportunity for backers to also become Members of The Planetary Society at a special rate of 50% the usual cost (normally $36, but available to backers for only $18).

These will be made available in styles for Men and Women and screen-printed on American Apparel brand t-shirts.

The missions are also loosely arranged according to their some of their most notable destinations. The design includes some of the earliest missions such as the Soviet Union\u2019s Venera 7 which was the first probe to soft-land on the surface of another planet to one of the newest members of the Martian community of surface dwellers, Curiosity.

That's what this project will be; the pilot episode of what we hope will become a series you see on TV in the near future.\nEach episode of SERIALBOXTV will focus on one artist with segments that interweave and intertwine in a way that has a multiplying effect, with the whole becoming greater than the sum of its parts.\nSEGMENTS (A BREAKDOWN):\n Some visual examples of the segments of SERIALBOXTV\nONE-TAKES (CINEMATIC/STUDIO-BASED) - The studio based one-takes are the bread and butter of SerialBoxTV. Shot completely live using the highest quality audio gear that you\u2019d find in a recording studio, but with the production equipment you\u2019d find on a movie set, the studio based one-takes aim to occupy a space at the intersection between the energy of a live show, the sound quality of a record, and the look of a movie.\nEverything you see and hear in a studio based one-take is 100% live, absolutely as it was played, without any punch-ins or pickups. The tiny imperfections present in any live performance are not something to be removed or glossed over, but rather become the very things that make for a beautiful, unexpected performance.\nA frame from The Lone Bellow's studio based one-take\n IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW - The interview is the hallmark of the SerialBox take on an artist. This isn\u2019t a \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d type of interview. Rather, it\u2019s one that aims to dig deep into the foundational elements of why an artist creates the music that they put out. It isn\u2019t a perfect facade, but an honest conversation about the very profound challenges of what it means to bare your soul in an effort to connect with listeners across the country and across the world. It\u2019s a conversation about writing, about storytelling, about the big \u201cwhy\u201d elements that drive any artist. The paradox of the interview is that, the more vulnerable, the more honest the conversation, the more the audience will connect with the artist on a fundamental level.\nThe interview is the yin to the studio session\u2019s yang. An audience likely has some working knowledge of the artists featured on the show, be it live concerts, music videos, or records. But the SERIALBOXTV interview will be the mortar which sets the audience\u2019s growing appreciation and connection with the band.\nA frame from JOHNNYSWIM's interview\n ONE-TAKES (SINGLE-CAMERA / ON LOCATION) - If the studio one-takes are about fidelity of image and fidelity of sound, the on-location one-takes are about creating an impression, a tone. They are about exploring how the layers of a song, a band, are revealed by performing these songs in places not normally associated with playing music.\nAn alleyway, a mountain top, a campfire. The \u201cwhere\u201d provides a unique perspective on the \u201cwhy.\u201d\nAdditionally, the broken down nature of these performances serve to further lower the wall between artist and audience. The viewer gets to experience these songs as if they were actually there with the artists while they perform them.\nA frame from NEEDTOBREATHE's single-camera one-take\nDAY-IN-THE-LIFE DOCUMENTARY - Sometimes the small moments, the in-between moments are the ones that tend to be the most revealing. The final minutes before an artist takes the stage. The down time wandering around an unfamiliar town. The moment alone, right after a show, before meeting the fans. These are the small things that give a glimpse into the peculiarities, the difficulties, and the rewards of a life spent playing music. These are the moments that say something about a band, about a sound, and about life behind the scenes.\nThe documentary segments are the unguarded and ultimately transportive moments that allow the audience to truly step into the shoes of the bands they love.\nA frame from David Ramirez's \"Any Given Tour Stop\" doc\nFEATURED ARTIST: NOAH GUNDERSEN:\nNoah and Abby Gundersen\n We've chosen Noah Gundersen as the artist we'll feature in the first SERIALBOXTV pilotepisode. Noah is an incredibly talented singer-songwriter and his SerialBox Presents session was the most viewed session we've ever made. We felt that he would be a perfect fit for this longer form project. We know we have more to accomplish with Noah and are excited to explore his music in this format.\nOne of the challenges of any SerialBox session is communicating the process and what it is that we're looking to accomplish with the artists. Many bands today do multiple performance video projects, sessions, and takeaway style videos. Creating a successful video with us is very different than creating a successful video with other productions and requires a shift in thinking, oftentimes. The beauty of working with Noah in this form is that being that he is a SerialBox Presents alum, he's very familiar with our method of production.\n Noah Gundersen - \"Cigarettes\" (SerialBox Presents, S2)\nPRODUCTION:\nWe have already scheduled the studio based one-takes and interviews for 11/14/14, and pending the successful funding of this campaign, will accompany Noah on the road for both the on-location one-takes as well as the day-in-the-life documentary.\nBehind the scenes of a SerialBox session\nKEY CREW AND COLLABORATORS:\nOver the last couple of years of making SerialBox Presents sessions, we've developed a short hand among our key crew and collaborators, all of whom will be involved in the production of our first SERIALBOXTV episode, including the following:\nNumerous other regular key crew, too many to count, will be involved in the pre, production, and post of this episode. SerialBox is a family and we're looking forward to creating together for this format. \nREWARDS:\nWe have a handful of rewards for contributing to this campaign, primarily centered around getting the music into your hands. We'll be pressing a limited run of vinyl that will include the studio audio from both Noah's SerialBox Presents session as well as the upcoming SerialBoxTV episode. We're very excited to be able to offer this limited edition as a thank you for contributing. \nMock up of the vinyl\nPhotography has been an important component of any SerialBox project and SERIALBOXTV will be no different. As a special thank you for contributing to this project, we'll be offering a limited run of polaroid diptychs of portraits and images we shoot during production. Obviously each polaroid will be the only one in existence and will be shot with a Polaroid 600SE (which shoots 3.25\"x4.25\" prints). \nBen Rector polaroid portraits\nAndy Davis polaroid portraits\nIn addition, we're planning a few events surrounding the release of the pilot episode. Primarily, a Houston premiere party that, in addition to the full episode, will include a live Q&A between Ryan and Noah, as well as a Noah playing a handful of songs, acoustically. It will be an evening you won't want to miss. \nFinally, we're making a few spaces available for those that may be interested in attending the studio session in November. It's an incredibly special way of experiencing the music and will be a memory you won't soon forget. Hang with us as we build sets, light, set up cameras, and our multicam system. Sit back and enjoy a view that very few people will get to see. We'll wrap the session and head to dinner together and then go to Noah's concert in Houston that evening. If you're interested in the filmmaking, or the audio, or simply the music, we'd be honored to have you on set with us.\nA THANK YOU FROM THE SERIALBOX TEAM:\nWe couldn't be more excited about the future of SERIALBOXTV and that you've decided to come along on this journey with us. We look forward to bringing you performances, documentary, and interviews with your favorites artists in a way that you haven't really seen before. By pledging to this campaign, you're joining the SBOX family as we partner together to bring something beautiful into the world. We really believe that this is the beginning of something very special.\nTHANKS!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur highest priorities in this project are as follows:\n\n1. Delivering a high quality, broadcast ready episode of SerialBoxTV\n2. Delivering said episode on time and within budget\n3. Delivering the stated rewards in a timely manner \n4. Exceeding the expectations of our backers. \n\nWe believe that we're set up to achieve these goals for the following reasons:\n\n1. This isn't a hypothetical idea, it's one that in some capacity, we've been working on the components of, for years.\n2. We've created over 25 sessions worth of content, including a series of longform livestreams earlier this year. Our pre, production, and post workflows have been refined and we are routinely hired to create content of this nature for some of the biggest brands on the planet (with the requisite deadlines/expectations to match).\n3. Those of us involved in SerialBox are full time filmmakers, designers, engineers, and photographers whose primary work consists of creating and delivering client work in a timely manner. We wouldn't get hired if we didn't do what we say we will do. We will bring the same mentality to this project, conveying information honestly and realistically. We're also limiting the number (and kinds) of rewards to further streamline the delivery process. \n4. If you've seen any of our previous work, I hope that we don't need to dive too deeply into this one. Exceeding expectations, creating something memorable, and helping you connect with music that you love? That's what we aim to do, every single time. This time wouldn't be any different.\n\nWe\u2019re thankful for your contribution and look forward to delivering a fantastic episode of SerialBoxTV!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Vinyl Artwork", "update_content": "Backers! \nWanted to share a short preview of EP/01 of SerialBoxTV. \nWe're in the final stretch getting everything wrapped up for release/premiere/etc. Couldn't be more excited to show you what we've all been working on, thanks to you."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 12, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ryanbooth/serialboxtv-pilot-episode-featuring-noah-gundersen", "project_name": "SerialBoxTV: PILOT Episode featuring NOAH GUNDERSEN"}}]
