Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "HEL: The Last Saga is a cooperative fantasy adventure viking board game, created by the duo behind SMOG: Rise of Moloch by CMON, game designer David Rakoto and art director Christophe Madura.\nThe game offers players the chance to lead a small group of Heroes, each with their own rank, occupation and background. Despite all these differences, these survivors will have to cooperate if they want to survive the cold, hunger and hostile threats, but they will also have to unveil the mysteries surrounding the disappearance of the colony founded by their lost King to be worthy of the Saga that will retain their name.\nHEL: The Last Saga is a highly narrative campaign game, with paragraphs to read according to what the players accomplish. The game mechanisms mix exploration, tactical combat with resource management. Storytelling and background are ubiquitous and replayability comes from the unique way you have to replay a failed mission.\nClick on the image to know more about the HEL-in\nClick on the picture to know more about this add-on\nClick on the picture to know more about this add-on\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\n\n\n NARRATIVE ALL THE WAY\nTell. Listen. Choose or test. Everywhere. Anytime. The game engine is based on the discovery or the triggering of events that lead to narrative chapters. These events can be hidden on the game board, placed on the turn track or on any other game component. The story  unfolds as you resolve these chapters by making choices, performing tests or simply listening.\nUNIQUE HEROES\nPlay strong characters. Each Clan member has their own story, strengths and weaknesses. You will learn about them as you play them, by acquiring new individual Hero cards in a non linear way. Some of these cards will be the result of choices you made during the adventure.\nSCENARIO BASED \nConquer a mysterious land, found a colony and resolve mysteries. Scouting missions, search or rescue parties, raids, escape, defence, investigation, or intrigue. Whether it's located on the modular and expandable wilderness game board or in the colony camp, each scenario provides a new challenge to overcome in order to gain access to the next scenario.\nPREDATORS & PREY \nFace hidden threats, which are controlled by a predation-based AI system. Use your perception and your pets to detect these threats before you face them, as an ambush can be fatal. Your enemies are vicious enough to target the most vulnerable or the highest ranking members of your group.\nWORSHIP SYSTEM\nBeg your gods to help you. Use your willpower, offerings, and the fervour of your companions to obtain permanent modifiers that will benefit all who share your faith.\nSURVIVAL... \nExploit scarce resources to survive and keep your clan together. Hunt for food. Collect that precious wood that will be a source of heat and an essential material for your constructions. But above all, maintain high morale to avoid sinking into defeat.\n...HORROR\nNight will eventually fall. For months. Second half of the campaign will take place into darkness. But only for Heroes who survive long enough to see the sunset. Forget every little knowledge or petty victory acquired. New rules. New threats. New objectives.\n\nThe USA, European Union, Canada, Australia, and UK will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nShipping is not charged as part of this Kickstarter campaign but is instead done so on the pledge manager after the campaign ends. The shipping price you will pay is based on the weight of your pledge and the country to which it is to be shipped.\nThe above is a list of rough estimates for shipping. These estimates are based on the costs for our previous campaigns and an estimated final weight of the Core pledge at 5kg. Keep in mind that adding optional buys or additional pledge levels will raise the weight of your pledge and may also then raise the final shipping price.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGeneral\n\nThis is our ninth Kickstarter and we\u2019ve learned a lot from our previous eight. Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 and Reichbusters: Projekt Vril have been delivered. Super Fantasy Brawl is being printed and ongoing for a delivery by the summer, Solomon Kane, a big scope project, is at the printer and will be delivered in two waves this year. Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters: East Quest development is finished and is going to production now and Steamwatchers is on track and will go to production this summer.\nFor all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates at least once a week, plus our posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and our videos on YouTube.\n\nPlease note that the components, component counts, quality and rules, are all work in progress and subject to change.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur experience in our previous KS has shown us that there can be variances in terms of timing and remaining in schedule when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\nAt the same time there are also the unpredictable factors; recently it was the Coronavirus outbreak, but there can be others such as weather conditions, strikes and others.\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is June 2021, but please bear in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nShipping\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes or APO addresses.\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nKSE\n\nAs KSE, or Kickstarter Exclusives, are marked the products that will not be available to retail. Mythic Games retains the right to continue to sell those in the Pledge Manager, the Mythic Games website, as well as conventions.\n\nRefunds\n\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy.\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available.\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will also be in USD.\nIf these terms are not acceptable to you, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Faithful pledge.

Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. \n*** For backers in China, please read this update.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates.  If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 have been delivered. Solomon Kane is a big scope project that will be delivered in two waves this year. Reichbusters: Projekt Vril is now on the ship to the HUBS. Super Fantasy Brawl is on track and production is ongoing for a delivery by the summer, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters is on track and will go to production next month.\nFor all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates at least once a week, plus our posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and our videos on YouTube.\n\nPlease note that the components, component counts, quality and rules, are all work in progress and subject to change.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur experience in our previous KS has shown us that there can be variances in terms of timing and remaining in schedule when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\nAt the same time there are also the unpredictable factors; recently it was the Coronavirus outbreak, but there can be others such as weather conditions, strikes and others.\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is March 2021, but please bear in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nShipping\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes or APO addresses.\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nKSE\n\nAs KSE, or Kickstarter Exclusives, are marked the products that will not be available to retail. Mythic Games retains the right to continue to sell those in the Pledge Manager, the Mythic Games website, as well as conventions.\n\nRefunds\n\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy.\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available.\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card.

Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

You will be assigning your workers to eleven different locations, such as Tea House, Quarry, Messenger Post, or Barracks, using special Command cards that have additional effects. Production in locations activates ONLY when all their slots are filled with clerks, but filling them all by yourself can result in a penalty. On top of that, players can buy overseers who will give additional output every time a location becomes activated. This creates a lot of involving long- and short-term strategies.\n Each player starts with one unique General, characterized by their asymmetric power, as well as the production level. From there, you will further customize your economic engine and fine-tune your strategy by recruiting advisors who provide additional bonuses.\nEventually, a Wall Defence phase beings, where players place previously build armies on Horde Cards \u2013 earning Honor (Victory points) and looting resources from the defeated troops. This requires smart management of three types of units: Archers, Spearmen and Cavalry. Players place these soldiers one by one, playing the Tactics cards that create another layer of interaction.\nGain meditation by shooting with the Monk Archer, then spend meditation on a Cavalry Squad Leader to move your Cavalry around the battlefield faster, and \u2013 finally \u2013 finish off by getting extra Honor for each of the Cavalry\u2019s engagements thanks to the Banner Holder. There are endless possibilities for great combos and memorable plays.\nOn top of that, your Advisors and General might give your troops extra abilities, such as shooting twice or looting twice the resources!\nAll of the above makes the Great Wall one of our most strategically involving designs that will be appreciated by many different groups of players:\n                            - those who love euro-styled games with their intricate economies and engine-building,\n                            - those who love over-the-table play,\n                            - and finally, those who simply like to wage war on a beautiful map.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

The two games have the same parents: the designer Antoine Bauza, the illustrator Na\u00efade, and the publisher Funforge for artistic direction.\nWith Namiji, the family grows with a hitherto unseen adventure!\n\u201cIn ancient Japanese, Namiji refers to the wake and eddies visible behind a boat.\u201d\nAntoine Bauza, designer of Namiji.\nIn Namiji, you are fishers from the Japan of yesteryear, navigating south of the Japanese archipelago, a few kilometers from the famous Tokaido road. You will need to have a fruitful day at sea to win the game.\nTo do this, you will have the opportunity to contemplate magnificent marine species, to fish with a line or a net to fill your racks with colorful fish, and haul in your crustacean traps.\nYou can benefit from stops to improve your fishing equipment, and you will also have to contend with the gods of the sea by setting offerings afloat, or by fulfilling their wishes that they express during your contemplations with the Sacred Rocks, for which they will reward you.\nFunforge is currently working on the rulebook. Please note that the PDFs below are prototypes, and the rules currently have neither illustrations nor nice layout. These are not the rules as you will receive them in your game box; however, the rules have been playtested hundreds of times by the designer and the Funforge team. The rules themselves have long since been approved and are final.\nPlease click on the picture to download the PDF file.\nCliquez sur l\u2019image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger le fichier PDF.\nDuring my forty-one years of existence, gaming has always occupied an important portion of my agenda. I have done a lot of role-playing games, and I have written a few. I long wanted to work in the videogame industry before discovering the modern world of board games in the early 2000s.\nAs a primary school teacher, I started to conceive my first prototypes. My first game, Chabyrinthe, was released in 2007, followed by Ghost Stories in 2008. In 2010, 7 Wonders appeared (Kennerspiel des Jahres 2011), which was an enormous success and permitted me to devote myself entirely to creating games.\nDriven by my passion for Japan, I designed several games around the them of the Land of the Rising Sun: Takenoko, Hanabi (Spiel des Jahres 2013), and in collaboration with Funforge, Samurai Spirit and Tokaido. Building on its success, Tokaido has been joined by two expansions, Crossroads and Matsuri.\nI am also one of the co-founders of Team Kaedama (a team of 4 game designers), and I take care of the logistics for la Radio des Jeux, a French podcast dedicated to the world of gaming.\nFor me, Namiji is the perfect opportunity to refresh the gaming experience you can appreciate in Tokaido, as well as revisit the graphical universe of Na\u00efade\u2026 and to share it all with you!\nFor me, the adventure really begins with Tokaido. At that time, it\u2019s been two years since I started the occupation of game illustrator. I was delighted because I am passionate about the ancient civilizations.\nThe Japan of the feudal era is obviously one of these civilizations that has long fascinated me. In addition, by that point, I had learned to read and write Japanese, and most of my interests came from Japan (manga, video games, figurines, movies).\nI did some research on boats, marine species, fashion of the era, Japanese archipelago, crustacean traps, fishing equipment and so on.\nAs with Tokaido, the final result here with Namiji is pure, white, peaceful\u2026\nFor both games, I wanted to keep an alchemy between the gameplay and the artwork to obtain two board games of which I am extremely proud.\nI hope that you will enjoy this new journey as much as I enjoyed retracing it through my art.\n\n\n\n\n\nROLL FOR CRIT: \u201cThere is a very good game to look forward to here. I am looking forward to see this more in final production state. I had a lot of fun.\u201d\nSPIKEYBITS: \u201cFunforge has a new title in the Tokaido universe coming out called Namiji. Not an expansion but a completely new game. Instead of walking the Eastern Sea Road, you are fishermen sailing around the islands of Japan. I\u2019m definitely dying to play more of this one.\u201d\nNERD CALIBER: \u201cI look forward to seeing it on Kickstarter later this year.\"\n\nTHE BOARD GAME KAPTAIN: \u201cAfter the game (played at Gen Con), they (Funforge) showed us some art and mini designs. The art and minis looked amazing! Be sure to look for Namiji on Kickstarter in November. It was really fun.\u201d\nGOING ANALOG:\u201cIt gave us the lovely, serene feeling of Tokaido but with more critical decision-making, more push-your-luck, and a fun puzzle element with fish collection.\u201d\nROLLING DOUBLES: \u201cRolling Doubles got a quick preview of this sequel and it looks to keep the foundation of Tokaido intact but moving & evolving the formula forward with Namiji! It. Looks. Wonderful.\u201d\nWithin three weeks after the campaign\u2019s end, we will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account using the CrowdOx pledge manager system.\nYou\u2019ll be able to chose your language options, add any desired add-ons to your pledge and complete your shipping informations at that time. You\u2019ll also be able to add any new add-ons at this point or complete your pledge in any desired way.\nIf you change adresses before we ship your rewards, you\u2019ll be able to access your survey anytime after we\u2019ve send it at this link: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/funforge/namiji-the-next-chapter-in-the-tokaido-universe\nPledge levels will be available in French and English. You will choose the language of your pledge in the Pledge Manager at the end of the campaign.\nWe will also provide rules as PDF only (not printed) in the following languages: German, Italian, and Spanish. Note that these files are not yet available, and will be provided between the end of the Kickstarter campaign and delivery of the games.\nLes niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais.

Please, keep in mind that these costs may increase depending on the evolution of the campaign (e.g. unlocked stretch goals, which would increase the weight of the parcel) and on potential add-ons you would add to your initial pledge during the Pledge Manager phase.\n USA: \u20ac12\u201315 to most states, \u20ac40 to Alaska, Hawaii, and all remote islands.\n EUROPE: \u20ac12 to France, Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg. \u20ac15\u201320 to the rest of the EU countries. \u20ac20\u201325 to the non-EU countries.\n CANADA: \u20ac20 to most cities\n LATIN AMERICA: \u20ac45\u201380 to most countries.\n ASIA: \u20ac15 to China and Hong Kong. \u20ac20\u201330 to most other countries.\n OCEANIA: \u20ac20\u201330 to Australia. \u20ac35 to New Zealand.\n FRENCH TERRITORIES: \u20ac40 to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\n REST OF THE WORLD (all unlisted countries): \u20ac80\u2013100 to most other countries.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.\nWe DO NOT SHIP to the following countries: Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Russia, and Syria.\nPlease note that these prices are NOT including the possible brokerage and/or customs fees and/or local taxes that may apply to your country, these fees are at the customer's charge (i.e. you).

This will contain any Stretch Goals unlocked for the regular Roleplayer pledge. \nThe Washington Z.C.

Missions properly, you'll need the 2nd Edition Tiles Set, below: \nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days).

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Join CMON in a time travel experience, revisiting and altering the past by funding immersive soundtracks for 3 of our biggest Kickstarter campaigns of the past: Rising Sun, Zombicide: Green Horde, and HATE. In addition, backers will get a brand new digital Art Book for Zombicide: Green Horde (including Black Plague content as well), accompanied by the digital versions of the Rising Sun and HATE Art Books. \nThe CMON Time Machine campaign is structured a bit differently than other campaigns. We're taking you to revisit past Kickstarters, Rising Sun, Zombicide: Green Horde, and HATE looking to fund brand new Soundtracks for them, as well as Digital Artbooks: The Kickstarter Exclusives from Rising Sun and HATE, and a brand new one for Zombicide: Green Horde and Black Plague.\nWith this also comes a new chance to pledge for those campaigns, acquiring these games along with many of their exclusives, as well access to a Time Vault (in the Pledge Manager) where many other leftover Exclusives from past campaigns (Arcadia Quest, The World of SMOG: Rise of Moloch, Zombicide: Black Plague, and Blood Rage, to name just a few) will be available.\nThere will be no Stretch Goals offered in this campaign and no new Optional Buys beyond the ones offered in the Pledge Manager system.\nThere will be a restriction of 1 pledge per backer.\nThe Time Vault is a Pledge Manager that gives you access to a plethora of Optional Buys from old campaigns, stored in our US warehouse.\nEach Optional Buy in the Pledge Manager system will be available in a specific limited quantity. Also, each backer will not be allowed to get more than 1 copies of very sought after items, or 5 of items that are easily available.\nBackers with $1 Time Vault pledge (with exception of those who have pledged to any of our previous Kickstarter campaigns) will gain access to the Pledge Manager only 48 hours after backers with a Rising Sun, Zombicide: Green Horde, or HATE Pledge (or any of the Bundles). So those backers will get first pick at the items in the Time Vault.\nThe Asia-Only Time Vault Pledge and Asia-Only HATE Pledge are separate from the other pledges. They give access to products in our Chinese warehouse, so these pledges will ship from China to Asian countries only.\nAsia-Only pledges give access to a different Time Vault, containing a smaller selection of items and in different quantities from the US Time Vault.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter (or other crowdfunding platforms) since its initial campaign, with any remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nFollowing is a list of rough estimates for shipping basic pledges. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.  \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nPlease note that, aside from the Asia-only Pledges (Time Vault and HATE) which will be shipping from our Chinese hub to Asian countries, all products will be shipped from the USA. Non-US backers shipments will likely incur increased costs and possible customs fees. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is December 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late there may not be enough quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

We call this totally different BG experience a Dream Crawler \u2013 you will dive into surreal and artistically crafted world and follow one of a kind co-op / solo campaign adventure for 1-4 players. Everything you do will change the strange rhythm of the Etherfields dream world, where even the wildest fantasy is possible. \nGameplay created by the Board Game veteran Micha\u0142 Oracz (author of This War of Mine: TBG, Neuroshima Hex or The Edge: Dawnfall and many others), will test not only your logical skills but also your intuition, deduction, and emotional intelligence. Develop your character from scratch using advanced deck-building, travel through the dream-world map and delve deeper into chosen locations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blown away by my experience with this game so far (\u2026) It\u2019s an amazing well of creativity!\u201d \n  - Rahdo\n\u201cThis one is real puzzler, it\u2019s so vastly different that anything I have played (\u2026) Really excited about this one!\u201d\n  - Ant Lab Games\n\"Etherfields is as a surreal and meaningful journey into a dream world that begs to be discovered.\"\n - Man vs Meeple\n \u201cEtherfields is an immersive experience. The constant state of discovery and the unknown keeps you glued to the table. The game mechanisms are well integrated and just pull you deeper and deeper into this dream world. A dream world I don\u2019t want to leave!\u201d \n- Rolling solo\n\"Etherfields is a magical combination of mechanics, card driven story, and an experience that just draws you in and does not want to let go. \"\n- theMCGuiRE review  \n\"Creative use of components and fantastic art really delivers on the idea of adventures in the dream world; creating an immersive and evocative experience.\"\n - Ready Steady Play \n\u201eAll in all, Etherfields is really, really unique and very, very cool game. Its got intense narrative to it, it got amazing components and amazing artwork!\u201d \n- Crabbok\n\u201cFrom the beginning I liked this a little weird, mysterious, a bit twisted, abstract atmosphere that this game offers.\u201d \n\u2013 ON TABLE \nAmazing gameplay will be accompanied by one of the most striking miniatures and art we have ever made. Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

NOTE THE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\n\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*** For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a mission-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.\nEach game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes,  who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side  takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to  achieve their objectives.\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a mission which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game,  number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to  achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing  sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game.  The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards... everything the  heroes need to play a mission. The villain box contains the miniatures,  tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the  fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals you have unlocked during the first campaign.\n This pledge level allows you to pick and choose what you want, and then decide on your pledge level \u20ac total. A default pledge of \u20ac7 has been set, as this is almost the lowest value element of this campaign. Once you have made your selection and have totaled its\u2019 value, you can directly enter that total \u20ac amount as your pledge.\nFor example: All you want is the Suicide Squad add-on (26 \u20ac), Batman Inc add-on (26 \u20ac), White Rabbit (6.5\u20ac), Carmine Falcone (6.5 \u20ac), and Nobody (6.5 \u20ac) from the picking zone. A total of 71.5\u20ac\nSo, select the \u201cYour choice - Open pledge\u201d pledge level and enter that total amount of 71.5\u20ac, overwriting the minimum pledge amount and you are set.\nAdventure mode racked up 42 missions in season 1, is still supported with 9 NEW missions in season 2. And, some of the new season 2 characters can also be used in S1 core box adventure mode missions.\nFinally, all season 2 characters come with their own tile, opening up a wider Versus mode selection pool for the 10 NEW versus mode missions.\nWhy are there two prices?\nThere are two prices displayed on season 2 elements, the lesser one is exclusive to this KS campaign, and the other will be the price per item once the Monolith WebShop goes live.\nFYI - We anticipate that the Season 2 Batman product will be available on the Webstore several months after the Season 2  kickstarter has been delivered.\nRed Hood \u2013 thank you gift miniature\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LEARN HOW TO GET RED HOOD\nIf your pledge includes ANY elements from season 2, then the Red Hood is yours - free.\nPledge during the \u201cLate pledge \u201cstage or \u201cNo reward\u201d pledge level and you can also pick him up as an add-on pledge within the pledge manager for \u20ac6.5.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS EXPANSION\n\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT BATMAN INC.

Intake opens your nasal passages far wider than nasal strips, stays on through sweaty exercise, and doesn't collapse upon inhale. \nSee the rest of these testimonials and others at the bottom in \u2018Testimonials from GEN 1 Users\u2019.\n\nSeen enough? CLICK HERE to be among the first people to get our new breathing device!\nClean each side of your nose with an included alcohol wipe to remove any dirt or oils from the skin. \nUsing the applicator, apply one adhesive tab to each nostril just above the pinch point. Press the edges of the tab into your skin. \nApply the Intake band over your nose. The magnetic ends of the band will \u201cclick\u201d into the tabs, opening your nose.\nUnlike some campaigns, we don't aim to make money on your shipping fees. By calculating shipping after the campaign is over, you save up to 30% on shipping fees. \nShipping charges above are estimates. Final shipping charges will appear on the post-campaign survey and may vary slightly from these estimates.\nUS estimates apply to the lower 48 contiguous states only. Alaska/Hawaii shipping is charged at \u201cRest of World\u201d level. \u201cRest of World\u201d prices are an estimated range.\nThere\u2019s sort of a biological catch-22 when it comes to nasal vs. oral breathing\nGenerally speaking, our noses are more efficient breathing machines than our mouths. When you breathe through your nose, you\u2019re able to pull oxygen into all five lobes of the lungs, whereas your mouth can only pull oxygen to the two uppermost lobes. This act of fully stimulating the lungs has a positive domino effect on the body, ultimately boosting blood flow and helping protect organs and muscles from damage. \nHere comes the catch: During increased heart rates, our noses physically can\u2019t inhale quickly enough to deliver air at the rate our bodies need. So, we rely on breathing through our mouths, which can deliver the requisite amount of oxygen, but can\u2019t create the positive domino effect achieved through nose breathing. \nIn fact, chronic mouth breathing actively hinders physical performance and recovery. \nSounds like a problem, right?\nThat\u2019s where Intake comes in. The Intake band keeps your nasal passage ways open at their widest capacity, allowing you access to deep breathing like never before. Intake ensures not only that you\u2019re getting the most out of your workout, but that your body has full access to the processes it needs to be at its absolute best. \nDEHYDRATING and IRRITATING - Your mouth can\u2019t filter air the same way your nose can, so the air you take in orally can cause inflammation in your lungs and throat. Exhaling through your mouth can also contribute to whole body dehydration, as water molecules leave your body more rapidly: you can see this on cold days, when the temperature makes the water vapor visible.\nUPSETS BLOOD PH - Nasal breathing balances CO2 levels in the bloodstream, which helps to keep the pH of our blood in its proper range. Mouth breathing decreases CO2 level, which in turn makes blood too alkaline. \nCAUSES PERPETUAL STRESS-STATE - Breathing through your mouth causes hyperventilation, which triggers the sympathetic nervous system and activates our fight-or-flight response. When this side of our nervous system is activated, our focus drops and our stress response goes up, contributing to feelings of anxiety and depression--despite the endorphins exercise can stimulate.\nINCREASE NITRIC OXIDE - Nitric Oxide is formed in the nasal cavity, and it\u2019s vital to your body\u2019s function. It\u2019s a vasodilator, which means it allows your blood vessels to relax so that blood flow increases and your body is able to deliver more oxygen to your muscles and organs. This means optimal endurance and stamina, and faster recovery. \nBOOST COGNITIVE FUNCTION - Nasal breathing stimulates the amygdala and hippocampus, balancing your mood and improving short term memory and focus. It also stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is associated with feelings of centeredness and relaxation. \nMAINTAIN HEALTH - Breathing exclusively through your nose protects your immune system in two ways: your nose filters particulates and humidifies the air reaching your lungs, which cuts down on inflammation, and the nitric oxide in your sinus cavity acts as an antimicrobial, helping to inhibit pathogen growth before it can enter your body.\nMost of our users are professional athletes--but you don\u2019t have to be to benefit from Intake. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re just regular humans who wanted to feel good when we were going for a jog or winding down with a yin yoga class. \nThe solution we found works so well that we want you to have access to it too, whether you\u2019re an Olympic trainee or a desk jockey or somewhere in between. The idea behind Intake is simple: if you can breathe your best, you can be your best, no matter where you are. \nThe hours you spend recharging are just as important as the ones you spend up and running\u2014if not more. While we designed Intake for high impact activity, many of our test phase users have also used Intake for sleep, and have reported feeling more rested and energized upon waking. Deepen your sleep, cut down on snoring, and utilize your breathing like never before.\n\nAfter over a year of development and testing we are excited to offer the new and improved Intake Breathing System to Kickstarter FIRST!\n The improvements to the Intake Sport Band:\nNew contours for increased comfort & fit across the bridge of the nose\nNew softer edges for additional comfort against the skin\nEven radius for custom printing capabilities\nChanges in Intake Tabs:\nNew method of manufacturing for minimal exposure of adhesive to air for better adhesion.\nNew pull tabs for easier application\nNew sweat channel to expel sweat built up under the steal disk\nThe Intake Band comes in sizes Small, Medium, and Large, and the sizing is determined by the width of your nose. We\u2019ve designed the range to be fairly universal\u2014if you\u2019re of average size, a Medium is a good place to start. Based on our test phase users, we typically recommend a small for kids and teens, a medium for women, and medium or large for men.\nHere\u2019s where it gets a little more complex: if you\u2019re wearing Intake for high-impact activity, or in a sport that requires goggles or a faceplate, we recommend sizing down. A smaller size band will create less pull on the adhesive tabs, making the band more likely to stay put.\nIf you\u2019ll primarily be using Intake for sleep or lower-impact activities (for instance, a moderate gym set), we recommend choosing your normal size or even sizing up\u2014the larger sized bands are less convex, meaning they\u2019ll pull your nostrils open wider and allow greater airflow. However, this also means they\u2019ll pull harder on the adhesive tabs, meaning you\u2019ll potentially get less run time out of the tabs.\nWe get it: this is kind of a weird product. Before we started Intake, we\u2019d all heard about the benefits of breathing through your nose, but we\u2019d likened it to eating broccoli: good for you, but weird to do all the time. Well, we\u2019re here now to tell you that nasal breathing is both good for you and decidedly not weird to do all the time. Actually, it\u2019s pretty incredible\nSo, we\u2019re launching a Kickstarter campaign because we think this product--while humble--is truly revolutionary, and we want to share it with you. Through our research and test phases, we\u2019ve realized that having a little help breathing through your nose can radically improve your athletic endurance, your recovery, your mental aptitude, and your mood. \nOur Kickstarter target is to raise enough money to make our production process more efficient. With support from our backers, we\u2019ll be able to increase both the accessibility and affordability of Intake, and be able to develop different product models for our increasingly diverse customer base. \nThe faster we\u2019re able to adapt to accommodate our growing market, the more people we will be able to help. Ultimately, this all boils down to one single, driving force: we want to help you breathe your best, because that means you can be your best.\nJust try it for yourself. You\u2019ll feel the difference.

(2017)\nWe launched in 2018 with our first generation product, a magnetic nasal breathing strip that our users tell us is--not to toot our own horn--the best on the market in terms of oxygen flow, comfort, and durability. \nOur original design was conceived by athlete and medical entrepreneur Jim Castillo (if you\u2019ve ever been in need of a knee brace, you can thank him for designing the most widely-used model).\nWant to know more?

We wanted to make sure we were bringing a product that was truly effective and revolutionary in the sphere of athletic gear, and one that the Kickstarter community could feel confident putting their money behind. We have invested our own capital to build Intake before turning to crowdsourcing: we\u2019ve been running this company successfully for over a year, and have already met and overcome a number of challenges on our own. We\u2019re still new, but we\u2019re seasoned, and this means we will be able to use our Kickstarter funding more efficiently than if we didn\u2019t have this past year of blood, sweat, and tears under our belt.\n\nThe time and money we\u2019ve already put behind Intake has allowed us to work the kinks out of our manufacturing process, make improvements to our design, and fine tune our materials, meaning we won\u2019t be using your money to experiment. We\u2019ve locked down 6 patents and have 9 pending, meaning Intake can\u2019t (and won\u2019t ever) be duplicated or reproduced. We know what we want, and we\u2019ve paved the road to get there, so you can rest easy that from here on out, it\u2019ll be a pretty smooth ride.\n\nThe machinery used to manufacture our tabs was built by our team, and therefore can\u2019t be replicated. This is good because it ensures our manufacturing process is a trade secret; however, if there\u2019s a problem with our machinery, we can\u2019t outsource to another factory. So, if something does go wrong, our process is held up until we can correct the issue ourselves, causing slowdowns in production.\n\nThere are always risks associated with international shipping.

Based on the award-winning Bloodborne video game by Sony Interactive Entertainment, the board game brings the beloved title to life with amazing miniatures! \nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Full Moon: All-In Set, Forbidden Woods, Forsaken Cainhurst Castle, Hunter's Dream, Upper Cathedral Ward, Yahar'gul Unseen Village, Byrgenwerth.\nScale comparison.\nMichael Shinall has been posting a series of updates, exploring the multiple aspects of the game's gameplay:\nHunter's Axe Overview\nBlade of Mercy Overview\nKirkhammer Overview\nBeast Claw Overview\nStake Driver Overview\nInsight and the Campaign\nPositioning and Combat\nBoss Encounters\nSkills and Upgrades\nCampaign Overview: Razing of Old Yharnam\nPainted by BigChild Creative. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this: \nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n \u2022 $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

For this reason, we've decided to thank you by giving away a few SG Kickstarter Exclusives. During the campaign, a number of SGs and Add-ons will be released, dedicated to all those who believe in our project.

The renaissance influence of the setting has a strong impact on the choice of clothing and names, deeply immersing players into this extraordinary atmosphere. \nWhile many other external sculptors have helped us give life to our ideas, it was Fernando Armentano and Tommaso Incecchi, who headed up the work.

Following a massive investment in terms of human resources, Dungeonology is the result of the efforts of a team that is passionate about its work and strives for excellence in every creative field. \nOur past projects, Nova Aetas, Sine Tempore and Black Rose Wars, are proof of the passion we invest in the development of our games and the quality we achieve thanks to our high-level professionalism. \nDungeonology is a project that was born more than 2 years ago.  \nThe game has been play-tested at numerous trade fairs by loads of groups, from occasional players to test the entertainment factor and more hardcore players to perfect the mechanics.\nThanks to this preliminary work, we will be able to send the core game, Circe and all aesthetic expansions in rapid time, making sure you receive the game before October 2019. Many of the SGs and Add-ons have already been developed and tested, ready to be unlocked and produced. Should we exceed the expectations of the project, all the rest of the material will be sent by May 2020. Thanks to the experience acquired in previous projects, we are fully aware that if certain objectives are reached, we will need to ask you for more time. \nBut we trust that by having the base game and part of the SGs and Add-ons straight away, the wait will be made a little easier.  \nYour rewards will be shipped from our international hubs. Based on your location, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or the United States (U.S.A. and the rest of the world).   \nIn most cases, you won\u2019t be hit with customs or VAT either, as we offer Customs Friendly Shipping to the countries where most of our backers are located.     \nBackers who do not complete their pledge manager by the deadline, which will be made clear via email notification, may need to have their rewards shipped from the US. This may incur additional shipping costs to international backers that would need to be paid for at that time.    \nDue to the size of the rewards and the risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes either domestically or internationally.    \nFollowing is a list of rough estimates for the cost of shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases due to unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you may select. \nWhy are the materials shipped in two waves?\n                          We've experimented with various shipping methods  over the years and after a number of calculations, we've reached the following conclusion:\n                          Generally speaking, it costs more to ship in two waves, but the difference is offset (or almost) by the greater number of shipments made, also thanks to optimized processes in the sorting centres.\n                          Moreover, double shipments offer two distinct benefits: firstly for you backers, who receive the game much quicker than you would for a normal KS project, and secondly for us editors insofar as we're able to optimise the process, thus lowering the error rate in shipments. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAn ambitious project like Dungeonology will require great effort for us as both individuals and a team. We are aware that the huge work to get to production and the subsequent distribution may suffer hitches and delays, but our team will do everything we can to prevent and correct any delays. \nWe will strive to get you your game on time. \nWe have collectively produced, or helped to produce, many projects and we are learning and improving our skills every day.\n\nWe promise to keep you informed on the project with regular and frequent news so that you can always be sure of your investment.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends. After 14 days and until we pay the production agreement with the manufactory, we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). Once we pay the production agreement with the manufactory, we do not offer a refund. If we fail to fulfill your game you are entitled to a full refund, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after 14 days may be processed via PayPal or the payment reversed through Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are issued through payment reversal via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is funded in USD.

Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nShipping is not charged as part of this Kickstarter campaign but is instead done so on the pledge manager after the campaign ends. The shipping price you will pay is based on the weight of your pledge and the country to which it is to be shipped.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard core pledge of Reichbusters: Projekt Vril. These estimates are based on the costs for our previous campaigns. They include not only the core box and exclusive O\u2019Reilly Hero, but also assume that all planned stretch goals are unlocked as well. This will give an estimated weight of 9-10kg for the core pledge. We do it this way instead of giving an estimate without stretch goals to ensure that there are no nasty surprises when the pledge manager opens. Should all planned stretch goals not be unlocked then the final weight of the core pledge may be less, and the final shipping cost may also be correspondingly less. Keep in mind that adding optional buys or additional pledge levels will raise the weight of your pledge and may also then raise the final shipping price.\n USA: $34\n CANADA: $37\n EUROPE (EU): $34 to France, UK, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Denmark. $37-$42 to other EU countries\n EUROPE (non-EU): $42-$69\n LATIN AMERICA: $105-$158\n OCEANIA: $42 to Australia. $84 to New-Zealand\n EASTERN ASIA: $42 to China. $48-$74 to other countries\n REST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $84 to Israel. $105-$158 to other countries\n HIDDEN FACE OF THE MOON (Solar system): Contact us.\nSpeaking of optional buys, should you decide to take the Gung Ho! all-in pledge, then below are the shipping estimates for that. As before, these estimates assume that all stretch goals have been unlocked and added to the core pledge, which gives an estimated weight of around 16kg for the all-in.\n USA: $43\n CANADA: $50\n EUROPE (EU): $43 to France, UK, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Denmark. $46-$63 to other EU countries\n EUROPE (non-EU): $63-$91\n LATIN AMERICA: $160-$221\n OCEANIA: $53 to Australia. $130 to New-Zealand\n EASTERN ASIA: $52 to China. $67-$84 to other countries\n REST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $120 to Israel. $160-$221 to other countries\n HIDDEN FACE OF THE MOON (Solar system): Contact us.\nOur fulfilment process aims to be as fair as possible. For this reason, rewards are sent to all backers at the same time. Due to the unpredictability of the postal services we cannot guarantee the order in which they arrive.  \nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy. \nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date. \nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available. \nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will also be in USD.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122: The Board Game is a semi co-operative tactical action game for 1-4 players designed in the rich and unique Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122 universe. \nAssigned a dangerous quarry by the Hunter\u2019s Lodge, players choose a tribe and class for their hunter and embark on an adventure through the wilds. A variety of machines and unexpected events lurk along the way, and awaiting them at the end of the trail is a lethal boss fight.\n Combining innovative and dynamic game mechanics with strategic deck building, Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122: The Board Game offers players a unique experience on each playthrough. Hunters can develop along several skill paths and purchase a wide variety of ammunition and equipment from merchants, as well as facing entirely different encounters each time.\nThe Seeker Pledge includes:  \nHorizon Zero Dawn\u2122: The Board Game  \nThe Lawless Badlands Expansion  \nThe Sacred Land Expansion  \nKickstarter Exclusive Aloy model  \nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\n After investing heavily in our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working closely with carefully selected manufacturing partners, the quality and detail produced in our industry-leading miniatures is simply world-class. We\u2019ve collaborated with Guerrilla to ensure each machine and model has been through a strict approval process to capture the essence of their videogame counterparts, really immersing players in the beautiful world of Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122.\nWe anticipate that many of you looking at this Kickstarter might be brand new to crowd-funding, and have taken the decision to keep things as simple as we can. Historically most Kickstarter projects tend to charge a little bit more than they strictly need for the initial offering and then \u2018bump-up\u2019 the perceived value through stretch goals.  \nTo minimise this confusion, for this Kickstarter we have given you one pledge level at an amazingly good price, including a plethora of models and even two additional expansions from the start. This comes in a beautiful Limited Edition Box, and the stunning Kickstarter exclusive Aloy model. However, the world of Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122 is a diverse and detailed place with many wonderful characters and powerful machines worthy of making into miniatures. Rest assured, stretch goals will still be making an appearance \u2013 you\u2019ll just be adding content from brand new expansions rather than fleshing out the core game over the course of the KS campaign. \nAnd the best bit is that your pledge will include every one of these stretch goals that get unlocked during the campaign, for free! So, the more people who support the project, and the more goals get unlocked, the more value we can squeeze in for all you awesome backers!\nEach hunter has a distinct playstyle with a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. The Nora Outcast is a highly skilled and resourceful archer; the Banuk Survivor lives on a knife edge, pushing themselves to the absolute limit. The Carja Warrior is a flashy but lethal duellist, and the Oseram Forgesmith smashes their enemies around with powerful sledgehammer blows.\nRemember, if one hunter dies, then it's game over for everyone, so pay careful attention and work with your allies. Don\u2019t leave an errant Watcher to run out and alert the other machines! Each session presents players with a host of variables and challenges to change their game experience and will keep them entertained for hours on end. \nChoosing a path to follow from the Tracking Deck offers players a difficult choice. They can choose to take the easy path, progressing with little resistance but earning few resources to spend with the merchants or to boost their attacks; or they can take a more challenging trail, encountering more formidable adversaries. Overcoming these foes will not be easy, but can earn precious materials to empower the hunters for their next encounter. The choice is yours\u2026 \nCombat is deeply tactical, offering players meaningful choices at every turn. Hunters can sneak through tall grass and remain hidden until the time to strike is right, but every second which passes means the machines are one step further along their patrol routes. Wait too long, and your prey will leave the playing area and you\u2019ll fail the encounter \u2013 attack too soon, and you\u2019ll make enough noise to attract the attention of every enemy in earshot. \nAs the game goes on, players will soon learn to adapt their strategy to each type of enemy, all of whom react differently to the hunters. Some have vulnerable components for the players to tear off, providing extra resources or disabling powerful attacks. Others are lethal foes who will need to be finished quickly, before they pin a hunter down and tear them to pieces. \nAlthough the players are working together to bring down their prey, they must still be aware of their allies. Hunters earn glory points during each encounter for performing particularly heroic or devastating attacks, attracting the attention of the ever-vigilant Hunter\u2019s Lodge. After each battle, the Lodge awards Sun tokens for the players with the most glory \u2013 and at the end of the game when their quarry is at last overcome, the player with the most Suns is declared the victorious winner!\nAfter each successful encounter, the players will be able to visit merchants to upgrade their decks with improved ammunition, new weapons, or stock up on potions. They\u2019ll also be able to level up, each progressing a skill path unique to their hunter and which allows further customisation. The more difficult the encounter, the higher tier of merchant they will be able to visit, and the further they\u2019ll be able to progress their skill tree. \nDesigned to be deep enough to satisfy experienced tabletop gamers whilst also remaining accessible to newer players, Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122: The Board Game is quick to learn but difficult to master. Fans will encounter the enemies and machines they fell in love with when playing the original videogame, and newcomers will find themselves drawn into this incredible world.\nOptional purchases are also available to backers during the campaign. To purchase an Add-On, simply click the \u2018manage your pledge\u2019 button, and increase your pledge amount by the amount of any Add-On(s) you\u2019d like to include. After the Kickstarter campaign ends, you will then be able to select your options via our pledge manager.  \nThe Frozen Wilds expansion is set in the icy north where the Banuk make their home, including unique tiles, equipment, and tracking cards to represent this wintery land. This expansion allows players to play as two proud new hunters from the Banuk tribe, and includes their hunter decks and upgrade cards. Also included are highly detailed models for the Scorcher and Frostclaw (2 of each), and rules for encountering them in your games, as well as rules and cards for introducing daemonic machines. Find out more about the Frozen Wilds HERE\nThe Thunderjaw expansion allows players to upgrade their quarry to the next level, and test themselves against this terrifying foe.

Find out more about Huge Machines HERE\nThe Heart of the Nora is an alternate play mode expansion, allowing players to enjoy the game as some of their favourite characters from Horizon Zero Dawn\u2122 and replay this iconic quest from the videogame. This expansion features the ancient war machines from the time of the old ones - a Deathbringer, and two Corruptors, as well as reference and behaviour cards for these powerful enemies. It also features additional tiles and a deck to allow players to replay the quest, replacing the tracking cards found in the main game.\nYou can also purchase multiple Seeker Pledges by increasing your pledge amount by +\u00a3100 per pledge. The 'Extra Seeker Pledge' gets you an additional copy of the core game, Lawless Badlands expansion, Sacred Land expansion and Kickstarter Exclusive Aloy Model with all applicable stretch goals.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and will be collected via our pledge manager system.

We have ensured that the pledge reward offered is packed with fantastic value and Kickstarter exclusives to compensate for any potential delays. However, if this unacceptable to you, please do not back this project and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the UK hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs.\nWe are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\nBelow is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan.

Cultists are summoning one of the Elder Ones to consume our world, and it is up to the ragtag group of investigators to face the nightmarish forces and disrupt the ritual long enough to make the Elder One vulnerable. And then kill it dead.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Season 2 Expansion, Black Goat of the Woods, Art Book, Extra Dice, Frost Dice.\nDesigned by Rob Daviau and Eric M. Lang, the game features monster artwork by Adrian Smith and investigator artwork by Karl Kopinski. Investigators come from all walks of life, each bringing a unique skill to the team, as well as two other generic skills.\nArt by Karl Kopinski, sculpts by RN Estudio.\nMadness is always at your side when battling unthinkable monstrosities from other dimensions. In fact, the investigators already start the game with a diagnosed insanity, which will will be triggered by your encounters with the occult. You may be doomed by your mental breakdown, or learn to use it to your advantage. The closer you are to losing your mind completely, the more powerful your skills will become.\nArt by Filipe Pagliuso.\nSummoning the Elder Gods are fanatic cultists, and the hosts of nightmarish monstrosities aiding  them in their cause. Each of these enemies possesses its own special ability and combat strength. They are not controlled by any player, but instead have their behavior triggered by Mythos cards used for each specific episode.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Sculpts by Thierry Masson, Yannick Hennebo, Remy Tremblay, Michael Jenkins, Edgar Skomorowski, and Jose Roig.\nThe Death May Die core box contains smaller boxes that hold the modular elements to create each unique game session. Players choose one of the two available Elder Ones and combine their contents with those of one of the six available Episodes. Each of these boxes contain unique figures, tokens, and cards that are only used when playing with those elements. The Mythos deck used in each game is a combination of cards from the chosen Elder One box and the chosen Episode box. Each Episode not only indicates the map setup using the various tiles in the game, but also new actions the investigators can perform in order to accomplish the tasks required to disrupt that episode's ritual. They each also bring their own Discovery cards for players to explore, and the monsters' behaviors and abilities are tailored to each unique story.\nHastur, known as the King in Yellow, and his disciples brand the world with their terrible Yellow Sign. Those that suffer this doom quickly meet their fate by the hands of death or madness.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Disciple sculpt by Thierry Masson. Hastur sculpt by JAG.\nCthulhu, The Thing That Should Not Be, will bring his sunken kingdom of R'lyeh into our world, plunging the earth into a nightmarish reality.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Cthulhu sculpt by Michael Jenkins. Star Spawn sculpt by Aragorn Marks.\nThe Elder Ones start the game off the board; as they move along the summoning track their growing presence invites chaos and insanity into the world to accompany their grand awakening. Eventually they cross over and the real nightmare begins. If the investigators have managed to disrupt the ritual, the Elder One becomes vulnerable and may (just possibly) be killed for good. If not, the investigators now have to contend with an immortal behemoth hunting them while they try to accomplish their tasks. Either way, killing the Elder One will not be easy, not by a long shot, as each time it's bested it grows more enraged and powerful. In the end, either all investigators will fall or death will come for the Great Old One.\nInvestigators, Cultists, Star Spawn, Cthulhu and Hastur painted by Robert Karlsson. Byakee, Deep One, Ghoul, and Shoggoth painted by Fabrizio Russo. Cthonian, Fire Vampire, and Hunting Horror painted by Angel Giraldez. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nIn their mission to thwart the cultist's plans, investigators engage in more than combat. If they can get some respite, they can discover all sorts of things to potentially help them in their tasks. Discovery cards are unique to each Episode, and present the investigators with challenges or choices that will grant them different resources, companions or negative effects.\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box comes with:\n45 Highly-Detailed Plastic Figures\n17 Terrain Tiles\n30 Plastic Tentacle Tokens\n8 Custom Dice\n5 Counter Bases\n10 Investigator Dashboards\n186 Cards\n120 Tokens\n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nUnspeakable Pledge - $100\nBackers with an Unspeakable Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nSculpt by RN Estudio. Painting by Robert Karlsson.\nJulia is an incredibly level-headed investigator. Given the extraordinary circumstances she finds herself in, it's amazing how she can keep her wits about her. Her unique skill allows her to take wounds instead of stress, greatly increasing her chances of success in any given encounter. Though it may cost her life in the end...\nR'lyeh Rising Pledge - $250\nBackers with a R'lyeh Rising Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive R'lyeh Rising expansion, and the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nAs the production of this statue is extremely expensive and time-consuming, delivery of it will be staggered. However, all backers will receive the rest of the base pledge at the same time. \nCheck out THIS UPDATE for for answers to some pressing questions, extra gameplay information, and shipping cost estimates.\nLet's not be coy, the heart and soul of the R'lyeh Rising expansion is its colossal figure of Cthulhu! This cyclopean creation is something never before seen in the world of board gaming. Its base is 44 x 44 cm wide, and it stands 57 cm tall to the tip of its wings. In fact, this thing is so huge that his base becomes the board on which the game is played! This plastic statue was sculpted in terrifying detail and will come pre-assembled, with the exception of the clip-on wings, so it can be proudly displayed for all to see.\nSculpt by Remy Tremblay (Julia figure included for scale).\nR'lyeh Rising is a wholly unique Episode, the epic finale to Death May Die, not only bringing its own set of tokens, Discovery cards, Monster cards, and Mythos cards, but also drastic changes to the game's base rules, as the figures move and act freely upon the behemoth's rocky base.\nPainting by Angel Giraldez (Cultist figures included for scale).\nPLEASE NOTE ALL FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON team dives into a gameplay overview of Death May Die with Episode 1 - Blasphemous Alchemy:\nFind out more about the Season 2 Expansion HERE.\nFind out more about the Black Goat of the Woods HERE. \nFind out more about the Art Book HERE.\nFind out more about the Extra Dice HERE.\nFind out more about the Frost Dice HERE.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 32nd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is July 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and Zombicide: Green Horde.

Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Cthulhu: Death May Die.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Whether you are new to Heroes of Land, Air & Sea or a seasoned warlord, welcome.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge for all the spoils of Heroes of Land, Air & Sea or you can add to your current collection with the all-new expansion Pestilence.\nTo Order Add-Ons, manually increase your pledge by the total dollar amount of your desired add-ons. Shipping charged separately for Add-Ons in PledgeManager.\nWant to see the Pre-Painted Minis up close? Click HERE to enlarge.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea is an easy to learn and easy to play 4X game. The depth is in forming your strategy. You can learn all you need to play from the video below.\nClick to read the full review!\n    Click HERE for more reviews of Heroes of Land, Air & Sea!  \nTo show off the new content first, the order of contents below is as follows: Pestilence, Base game, Order & Chaos.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea: Pestilence - ALL NEW CONTENT\nClick to enlarge!\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea: Pestilence introduces 2 new Factions, 20 new Spell Cards, 24 new Exploration Tokens, and an all new Floating Continent and Sunken Continent.\nBoth the Floating Continent and the Sunken Continent are usable with any player count.\nThe Floating Continent is the starting island for the Birdfolk and is accessible via ferry routes and air vessels. \nThe Sunken Continent is the starting island for the Merfolk and can be placed over any island. It is seeded with water exploration tokens instead of land tokens, but remains traversable only by land units and air units, like other islands.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea (Base Game)\nClick to enlarge!\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea: Order and Chaos \nClick to enlarge!\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea is a 4X style board game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) that was designed to recreate the experience of RTS (Real Time Strategy) games for the tabletop. It plays roughly 30-45 minutes per player and, with the inclusion of expansions, supports 1-7 players. It features rules for free-for-all \u2014 2 vs. 2 \u2014 2 vs. 2 vs. 2 \u2014 3 vs. 3 \u2014 and solo play.\nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, players will choose one of the many factions offered from the collective total of the base game and available expansions, and then develop this faction from the ground up over a series of rounds. These developments include growing your work force and army, constructing buildings and towers useful to your goals, recruiting heroes to lead your army, acquiring vessels that travel by sea and air, and expanding your reach to all areas of the map.\nThroughout the game, players will engage in epic battles, vie for area control, cast powerful spells and carefully manage resources. In addition to an economy of goods, the game features an action economy that requires players to find balance between committing their serfs to build, gather resources, and select the actions required to proceed through the game.\nThe game concludes one round after a player meets one of four end game triggers. The four end game triggers correspond with the 4x's: eXplore (all land exploration tokens have been revealed), eXpand (all the serfs and warriors of a single player are in play), eXploit (all three towers of a single player are in play) or eXterminate (a player's capital city has been destroyed). The player with the most victory points wins the game. Victory points are acquired in numerous ways that include the final level of your capital city, battles you have won and lost, regions you control and units in play at the end of the game.\nThe Factions of Heroes of Land, Air & Sea\nThe base game features the classic factions of Humans, Orcs, Dwarves and Elves. The Order & Chaos expansion features the Lionkin, Undead, Lizardfolk and Goblins. The new expansion, Pestilence, introduces the Birdfolk and Merfolk.\nMercenary Mini Expansions\nThe Mercenary Mini Expansions offer a wide range of Heroes that can be recruited by any player without prerequisites. Mercenary Heroes possess some of the most powerful abilities in the game and can be recruited alongside your faction's regular Heroes. \nNomads Mini Expansion \nThe Nomads Mini Expansion features 2 different play modes. You can either use the Nomads as Mercenaries or as NPCs (non-player characters). \nIf used as Mercenaries, a player is able to recruit 3 Nomads to join their army. In many ways they function as enhanced Serfs. While they cannot build, they can follow/muster actions and collect extra resources. They also reduce the resource collection of opponent's in adjacent regions and offer a late game boost to exploration. Their strength depends on how many are in play, so try to keep them all alive. \nIf used as NPCs, they cannot be controlled by any single player for long. Each round, 1 is added by the player who starts the round. The regions adjacent to Nomads produce 1 fewer resource. If left unchecked they can really hinder the progress of nearby players and the more there are in play, the more difficult they are to defeat. But, defeating one allows a player to capture them and use them to follow/muster a single future action. Then they return to the supply. \nAdditionally, the Nomads Mini Expansion introduces 6 new spell cards. These spells allow players to leverage the Nomads for their own gain, by either befriending them or enraging them.\nSiege Engines Mini Expansion\nThe Siege Engines Mini Expansion features 6 siege constructs. Like Mercenaries, these units can be recruited by any player without prerequisite. They offer abilities uniquely focused at giving you the edge in certain types of battles. For instance, the Ballistae offer ranged attack and are powerful against Heroes and Air Vessels. The Catapults also offer ranged attack and are designed to destroy towers and sea vessels while the Siege Towers have a singular focus on laying waste to Capital Cities. \nPestilence Booster Pack\nThe Pestilence Booster Pack provides the additional card sleeves needed to sleeve the extra cards added with the Pestilence Expansion. It also features 14 new Spell Cards and 2 new Vessels.\nThe Dragonscale Yacht is a new Mercenary Vessel featured in the Pestilence Booster Pack.\nNote: the 2 Vessel Stands used for the Dragonscale Yachts come inside the Pestilence Expansion box, NOT inside the Pestilence Booster Pack. The stands are the same as the ones offered in the Base Game and the Order & Chaos Expansion.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea 2nd Printing Update Kit\nIf you own the first printing of Heroes of Land, Air & Sea and its expansion products, this 2nd Printing Update Kit is for you. It will come with physical copies of any rules, player boards, and cards that have had any text changes. After swapping these in, your game and expansions will be the same as the versions offered in the 2nd printing. \nThe 2nd Printing Update Kit is offered for free with pledges to the Pestilence Expansion. It will also be offered at cost (plus shipping) in the PledgeManager. \nPre-Painted Hero and Mercenary Minis\nClick to enlarge!\nIf you're like me, you're not a painter but you enjoy having painted minis. While it's not feasible for us to have all the minis pre-painted, we can offer it for the Heroes and Mercenaries at roughly $2 per mini or less. \nWe will also back this option up with a *Money-Back Guarantee. If you'd like to take advantage of this offer, refer to the reward tier you have selected and manually add the amount listed to your pledge. \n*Money-Back Guarantee: If you are not satisfied with your pre-pianted miniatures, we will offer you a no-questions-asked money-back guarantee for the price of the Add-On. We will replace your pre-painted miniatures with the un-painted versions and refund your money for the add-on. We just ask that you please send us your pre-painted minis and cover the postage of that shipment.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea App\nWe are currently developing a FREE app for Android and iOS that will assist you in playing Heroes of Land, Air & Sea. We expect to have this app available for download in August. \nThis app will offer the following awesome features:\nRule References - So you can spy on your opponents' powers without asking them what they are. \nGuided Play - To help first time players with setup and round structure.\nFirst Player Selector - You know... to help you pick who will go first. :)\nScore Calculator - To assist with the accuracy and execution of end game scoring.\nLore Library - So you can read all about the world of Aughmoore and its inhabitants wherever you are. \nEvents of Aughmoore - A mini expansion that features 50 different events. Each event will last one round and will alter the conditions in which the game is played. There are currently no plans to produce a physical version of this expansion. We ask that you download the free app to enjoy these events. \nOther Pledge Options\nTo pledge for these options, you will need to enter the exact amount + shipping (see below) for your pledge, but you will not select a reward tier. \nYour pledge will be transferred to our PledgeManager after the project is over. There you will be able to select these packages and apply your pledge to cover their cost. \nIf you'd like pre-painted Heroes and Mercenaries, add $25 for Order & Chaos Only or add $40 for Order & Chaos + Pestilence + Extras.\nOrder & Chaos Only / Order & Chaos + Pestilence + Extras  \nUnited States, Canada, Germany, China: $15 / $25 \nEuropean Union, United Kingdom, Australia: $20 / $30\nHong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan: $25 / $35\nNew Zealand: $30 / $40\nLatin America, Rest of World: $55 / $65\nPLUS Customs Friendly Shipping is being offered for the U.K. and select parts of China.\nInstead of surprising you with shipping costs AFTER the project is funded just to offer you a low upfront price, we are charging the shipping now. You will NOT be hit with additional shipping charges from us after the project ends. In most cases, you will not be hit with customs or VAT either as we are offering Customs Friendly Shipping to the countries where most of our backers are located.  \nYour rewards will be shipped at our cost to our international hubs. Based on where you are located, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or New Hampshire (USA and the rest of the world).  \nBackers who do not complete their pledge manager by the deadline, which will be made clear via an email notification, may need to have their rewards shipped from the US. This may incur additional shipping charges to international backers that would need to be paid for at that time.  \nDue to the size of the rewards and risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.  \nShipping rates for the two primary reward tiers are described below: \nPestilence / Everything  \nUnited States, Canada, Germany, China: $15 / $25  \nEuropean Union, United Kingdom, Australia: $20 / $30 \nHong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan: $25 / $35  \nNew Zealand: $30 / $40  \nLatin America, Rest of World: $55 / $65\nThe most effective way to assure that we reach all potential upgrades is to share this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, blogs, etc. Share this project with EVERYONE!! \nHere are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nGamelyn Games, LLC is a passion-driven game publishing company based out of Arizona.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have many years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturer that we have used for numerous projects. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 5 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment. I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

Once your game has been packed for shipment, we do not offer a refund.

This is a turbulent time, with bandits lurking in the wilds of the countryside, and pirates roaming the high seas. Evil taints the hearts of men, and many give in to temptation. Many, but not all. Against this tide of corruption stands Solomon Kane. This mortal hero fights his lone crusade, aided by the silent might of the immortal Virtues. Together they fight against the implacable Darkness. This is the fearless opponent who tries to thwart our hero at every turn, and who must be overcome by the players if Solomon Kane is to emerge victorious.\nDarkness has emissaries too, and these Shadows are also attracted by Solomon Kane\u2019s faith. Shadows are not physical beings \u2013 they are the essence of the nameless horror that hides just out of sight, the lurking danger you think you glimpse from the corner of your eye, or the secret dread that sends shivers down your spine. This can drive lesser men to madness, and even Solomon Kane could be overwhelmed, for whilst his faith is strong, Darkness is powerful too. Solomon Kane can see neither Virtue nor Shadow, yet he can feel both, and he has his faith. This tells him that Good must triumph over Evil. It is up to the Virtues to ensure that he is right.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\u201cSolomon Kane\u2026 considered himself the fulfiller of God\u2019s judgment, a vessel of wrath to be emptied upon the souls of the unrighteous.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe central figure in the game is Solomon Kane himself. He is a dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs who roams the world, fighting against the ungodly and evil works of men and foul magic alike. He follows no master save his conscience, though that alone drives him to the ends of the Earth to fulfil his quest. All his life he has travelled, aiding the weak and fighting oppression. From the bleak moors of England, through the damp forests of Germany, to the sweltering jungles and savannahs of Africa \u2013 even to the shores of the distant New World of America.\nSpace Marine (Warhammer 40K), Warrior (Rising Sun), Vampire (Solomon Kane), Conan (Conan), Solomon Kane (Solomon Kane), Leonidas (Mythic Battles), Bandit (Solomon Kane), Khorne Warrior and Stormcast Eternals (Shadespire)\nHe neither knows nor questions why he is driven to do this. It simply must be done. To Solomon Kane, he is doing God\u2019s work. To his enemies he is a relentless fury, armed with flintlock and rapier, and armoured in unshakeable faith. The knowledge of the rightness of his cause makes him unstoppable, and gives him the ability to overcome any fiend or demon. At least, it does when the Virtues are on his side.\n\u201cHow I overcame it, I know not, for the battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe Solomon Kane core box comes with 4 complete Adventures: one each in 1 Act, two in 2 Acts, and one in 3 Acts. These stories are the Rattle of Bones, Skulls in the Stars, Death's Black Riders, and the Blue Flame of Vengeance - all based on original tales from Robert E Howard. We unlocked three 1 Act original stories, the Witchfinder General, L'Ogre and Beast of Bordeaux. With 10 Chapters per Act, this gives you 110 Chapters to explore, about 60 hours to play these stories once, and many, many hours of replay value.\nWe have many stretch goals planned for this Kickstarter campaign, adding new miniatures, Adventures, and other surprises. All stretch goals that we unlock during this campaign will be added FREE to every Puritan pledge, and every additional copy of the core box you pledge for.\nSOCIAL STRETCH GOALS\nThe Puritan Pledge contains many, many hours of game play, and stretch goals add even more. However, if you\u2019re enjoying Solomon Kane we will be revealing some additional content during the campaign that you may want to add to your pledge. If you\u2019re interested in purchasing any add-on, just click the Manage your Pledge button at the top of this page, and increase your current pledge amount by the amount of the extra items that you\u2019d like to add. Kickstarter doesn\u2019t let you specify what you want at this stage, so we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed. The system we use for this is called a Pledge Manager, and all backers will be sent a link to this after the Kickstarter campaign closes.\n(To find more about All-in bundles, click here)\nRED SHADOWS\nTHE ART BOOK OF SOLOMON\nThe Right Hand of Doom\n(To find more about this expansion, click here)\nHEART OF AFRICA\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAGAINST THE VAMPIRES\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAMERICA - THE NEW WORLD\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nEach player takes the part of one of the four Cardinal Virtues: Courage, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, each with a special combination of abilities that reflect their unique role. Together they must help Solomon Kane achieve his mission.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nCourage\nCourage is bold and sometimes reckless. She cannot sit idly by, and encourages Solomon to resolve everything with action!

She encourages Solomon to keep his wits about him, and be aware of what is going on around him. Her speciality is exploring the environment, and avoiding nasty surprises.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\"The battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell. \"\n Allied Mortals\nSolomon Kane is a loner, and only begrudgingly accepts the aid of others in his quest. However, when others need his aid he is quick to come to their assistance, and this means that his Adventures against the Darkness sometimes include companions. \nN'Longa is not included in the Core Box. But you will see him soon!\nN'Longa and Solomon Kane, blood brothers\n Solomon Kane\u2019s only regular companion is N\u2019longa \u2013 a self-styled \u201cmighty worker of nameless magic\u201d. Despite their significant differences in outlook, they get along perfectly, saving each other from death on more than one occasion. It is hard to say which one of them relies more on the other. \nJack is a hot-headed, somewhat naive, but well-meaning young man, whose main goal is to protect Mary and her honour. He falls in with Solomon Kane when the Puritan comes to his rescue.\nMary is the archetypical damsel in distress. If Jack can't save her, then Solomon Kane will always be ready to protect any innocent in peril.  \nThe wrong place at the wrong time, that\u2019s the best way to describe the unfortunate traveller. He really should have waited for daylight to cross that moor\u2026\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n Darkness is the natural opponent of Light. It is a combination of all the secret, unsavoury feelings and deeds which men are capable of. It lurks in the blackness, moulding the essence of the night into its minions, and sending them to plague the mortal world.\nShadows  \nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nThe main servants of Darkness are the mist-like Shadows. They are not really creatures at all, more embodiments of a terrifying idea. One that can drive mortals to insanity and death.\nMortals  \nThrough his many Adventures, Solomon Kane encounters a wide variety of misguided, malevolent, or just plain evil individuals who all do Darkness\u2019 bidding \u2013 whether they realise it or not. These range from simple thugs, through cannibal tribesmen, to otherworldly and magical creatures. Solomon Kane must overcome them all.    \nSolomon Kane and Jack Hollinster ready to confront Fishhawk and his pirates\n Latest Rules Playthrough - The Blue Flame of Vengeance - 3rd July\nPlease note that components and rules used in this video are not final and are subject to change.\nSolomon Kane\u2019s lifelong fight against Darkness is told in a series of Adventures, based on the stories and characters created by Robert E. Howard. Adventures are broken down into 1-5 Acts, depending on their length. Each Act is itself broken down into 8-10 Chapters. A gaming session will typically be a single Act, or part of one. Depending on the time you have available, you may play through a whole Act, or be able to complete only a few of its Chapters. If this is the case, you simply use the game\u2019s save function to remember where you have got to, and you can return to complete the rest of the Adventure another day.\nChapter 1 - \"Skulls in the stars\"\nWhen you play through an Act, you naturally start with the first Chapter. One player reads the narrative text aloud and follows the instructions on the card. The players then do their best to help Solomon Kane overcome whatever challenges the Chapter throws his way, and then they move onto the next one.\nEach Virtue Turn, the controlling player rolls their Fate dice to see what resources they have available to pay for actions. These dice can be donated to other players, or saved for later Turns, as well as buying actions immediately, and deciding how to coordinate these actions and share these resources between the players is a big part of the game. Solomon Kane takes the concept of cooperation very much to heart, and the players need to be discussing and working together throughout the game. Even when it is not your Turn you are involved in vital decisions.\nAllocating dice during your turn\nAfter each player\u2019s Virtue Turn comes a Darkness Turn. This is where the AI deck acts to thwart the players and destroy Solomon Kane. It can move its minions on the board, trigger unpleasant events, or simply sap the will of the mortals to carry on.\nThe Act continues with the players resolving one Chapter card after another, with their Adventure unfolding as they do. After many trials and obstacles, a final Chapter card will tell the players whether their actions have been enough to achieve victory, and whether they have won or lost. Solomon Kane is a pure co-op game, and players either all win together, or all lose together.\nCARDS\nSolomon Kane uses a number of different card types to tell the stories. These are:  \nChapter Cards  \nThese tell the steps in the story. Each Chapter number has a number of different options represented by different cards, some easier to complete, some near-impossible. This is a little bit like going through a choose-your-own adventure book, but instead of simply picking what you want to do, the players have to achieve a particular effect with their actions to decide what happens next. \n(To find more about Chapters, click here)\nChapter cards come in two main types: Story and Scene. A Story Chapter contains the next piece of the tale to read aloud. A Scene Chapter contains the map layout, miniatures, and objectives to play it out on the board.\nDarkness Cards \nThe Darkness deck is what drives the player\u2019s opponent. Each card is divided into several sections, each applying in a different circumstance. This allows the AI to be flexible and to react differently to each situation. Using them is simple: just flip the top card of the deck at the start of each Darkness Turn and do what it says.    \nEvent Cards  \nWhen a Shadow triggers an Event, the next card in this deck is revealed. This is usually bad, though not always. Occasionally the Light shines through the Darkness and a brief reprieve is granted to Solomon Kane and his companions.   \nVirtue Cards\nEach Virtue has their own unique 10-card deck of Virtue cards. These cards list the possible actions for that Virtue, together with the cost in Fate dice to perform each one. In principle, any Virtue can do any action, though only some of the actions will be available at any one time. During the game, players must carefully manage their decks, ensuring that their active cards give them the most useful range of options for the task at hand, and work well alongside those of their companions.\nDiscovery Cards  \nThere are many secrets in Solomon Kane, and whilst the Adventures are based on Robert E. Howard\u2019s tales, they have been greatly expanded. Where Solomon chose one path in the original works he now has a choice. That is, the players collectively have a choice to decide, by their actions, which path to take. Discovery cards hide many of the possible outcomes from the players, and keep the elements of tension and surprise: you must decide before you know for sure what will happen next. This means that even if you have played the Adventure before, there will be fresh elements each time. \n(To find more about Discovery cards, click here)\nMAP TILES\n Each Scene Chapter has a map, made up of 1 or more of the many double-sided tiles from the box. Maps vary in size and shape, each offering a unique puzzle for the players to unpick. \nFATE DICE\n Each Turn, a player rolls 3 Fate Dice to see what energies are available. The fate dice show Bravery, Determination, Fear, Pain, and (of course) Faith.\nEach of the Virtue cards has a number of slots for these resources, and the action on that card can be bought by filling those slots with matching results on the Fate dice. The ability to save some rolled dice for future Turns, and donate much-needed resources to other players makes for a lively discussion. What is the best thing to do?  \nDASHBOARDS\nVirtues\nEach player has a dashboard for the Virtue they are playing. These are all different. They include unique actions, effects of the Virtue\u2019s aura, and spaces for reserved and donated dice.  \nCourage Virtue dashboard with attached Virtue cards\nAdventure track\nThere are four game values that are tracked throughout the game. Three of these are measures of Solomon Kane\u2019s abilities: Strength, Clarity, and Compassion. Each of these is linked to a specific type of test: Strength to Fighting, Clarity to Exploring, and Compassion to Talking. As the game progresses, these tracks may rise and fall. In addition, there is a fourth track: Danger. This monitors the overall Danger of the situation. The more it rises, the more perilous the situation gets.\nEach of the Virtues is linked to one of these tracks. Their actions will often draw upon it, and in the process can lower or increase its value. However, these tracks apply to every Virtue. Even if it is Courage who is most tied to the Strength track, all Fight tests triggered by any Virtue will apply its modifier to them. So, whilst each Virtue looks after its own track, their management of it will impact every player, requiring them to work together.\nMINIATURES\nSame scale, different sizes!\nSolomon Kane includes a huge selection of beautiful 35mm scale miniatures, ranging from the man himself, through dastardly foes and innocent bystanders, to the towering Virtues who aid him. Although nominally 35mm (the height of an average man), the miniatures are all different sizes depending on the individual they represent. This gives us a range from 27mm tall children to the 90mm tall Virtues. Each miniature is a carefully-sculpted masterpiece, full of character. To further enhance this, and to give the painters among our backers even more to enjoy, each sculpt also has its own unique scenic base.\nEach model has its own unique scenic base!\n KANE'S CRUSADE\nThe Mythic Games Ambassador Programme has over 30 Ambassadors across six countries who tirelessly share out games with board game communities. We have already hosted over 60 events and demonstrations while also attending major conventions such as Cannes and UKGE. We have over 50 more events planned already which you can find listed on our Facebook page including attending Paris est Ludique, Origins, Gen Con and Essen SPIEL.\nSeveral hundred public demos organised for Kane's Crusade\nSolomon Kane is a simple fellow, and to reflect this we have only a single core pledge level: the Puritan.\nHowever, we also believe in rewarding our most loyal fans, and those who believe in us the most.

This is based on the costs for our last campaign and the assumption that the final weight will be comparable. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose. If the game is significantly lighter than Joan of Arc, then some of the higher end costs may drop.  \n\nUSA: $32\nCANADA: $35\nEUROPE (EU): $32-$40\nEUROPE (non-EU): $40-$65\nLATIN AMERICA: $100-$150\nOCEANIA: $40 to Australia. $80 to New-Zealand\nASIA: $40-$70\nREST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $100-$150\nOur fulfilment process aims to be as fair as possible.

Producing thousands of complex products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date. \n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon began delivery earlier than originally planned, and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc is currently on schedule to hit its planned date. We are confident that Solomon Kane will deliver on time too. \n\nThat brings us to communications: we think they are very important. During this campaign we will post at least one update every day. Afterwards, we will continue to keep you regularly updated with all the latest info in our famous weekly \u201cWhat\u2019s up Wednesday\u201d updates. This means that you\u2019ll always know what\u2019s going on in the adventurous world of Solomon Kane!\n\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy. \n\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date. \n\nIf you apply for a refund more that 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\n\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available. \n\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will also be in USD.\n\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

You won't have to choose your language as the products include both languages.\nTous les niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous n'aurez pas \u00e0 choisir votre langue car tous les produits incluront les deux langues.\n For those who missed our previous KS and would like to know much more about this game, have a look at our previous campaign where we launched Mythic Battles: Pantheon\nThis pledge level includes all the new products from Mythic Battles except the sleeve card packs. Please note that this pledge level also includes the \"1.5 upgrade kit\" for free those who pledged during the first KS.\nMythic Battles is a fictional universe and a range of games that\u2019s constantly evolving. Knowing this, we have been listening closely to our gaming community for player feedback, whether it comes from groups of friends or tournament players. When we combined our observations with yours we have come to realize that some units, game modes, and confusing rules need to be addressed and/or revised. And so for this reprint, we felt our best course of action was to implement some of these changes into MB 1.5.\nHere is some examples of changes we\u2019ve made:\nThe villager mode has been removed because it saw very little use. Additionally, villager miniatures do not appear in the base box and only in an add-on that we chose not to reprint for this campaign.\nA pictogram has been added to the troop maps and dashboards to more easily identify which set (Mythic Battles: Pantheon OR Ragnar\u00f6k ) the miniatures belong to. We have done this in anticipation of Mythic Battles: Ragnar\u00f6k and us wanting things to be clear for organizational purposes.\nA pictogram has been added to troop maps and dashboards to indicate, in addition to color, the unit type (troops, monster, hero, god or titan).\nBoth rocks have been removed. Indeed, it turns out that players had a lot of trouble assembling them and they hindered the readability on the board and sometimes obscured some miniatures. In addition, during our editing of the rules, we reviewed our wording and realized that only trees and columns are considered \"3D elements\" which obey specific rules. So the rocks\u2019 placement is static/immovable and the 3D pieces were merely an attempt to add dimension to the board.\nFor the \"skirmish\" scenario, we have created a \"built\" mode in addition to the \"draft\" mode. Thus, players who wish can dial their warband ahead and optimize their combos to face their opponent. In this way, it is also easier to focus on painting the figurines that make up their favorite bands.\nWe took advantage of the space gained by removing the rocks to replace the generic power tokens with specific tokens. Thus, in the core box, Arachne will have her own \"web\" token, for example. Some pieces will have a front with a different color from their back to facilitate their use in the \"built\" mode.\nThe system of stat clips that we designed did not seem to live up to the expectations of players. We\u2019ve discovered that even if they glide perfectly in the rails of the dashboards and framed the row of characteristics, they did not hold their position in the event of an unexpected bump. So we have revised this design by adding a rubber rear piece to the stat clips. Now the stat clips remain in place. As these are meant to be clipped and unclipped at will, in the box you will find 20 stat clips (with their backs), which is enough for a classic four-player game. Thus, add-ons will no longer contain new stat clips. If you pledged during the first MBP campaign and you do not pledge anything during this campaign but you want to receive the 20 stat clip backs for free, you will just need to make a request during the pledge manager that will follow this campaign. If you have pledged during the first MBP campaign and you pledged for at least one product during this current campaign, you will receive the 20 stat clip backs for free. If you want to have more than 20 stat clips backs, you will be allowed to buy them during the pledge manager.\nThe core game box gives you a complete game with dozens of stretch goal extras. You don\u2019t actually need any more to have months or even years of replay value. However, you can never have too much of a good thing, and the mythology we\u2019ve based Mythic Battles: Pantheon on is vast, so there was a lot we couldn\u2019t fit into the core box.\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please just click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Mythic Battles: Pantheon Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS EXPANSION\nYmir, ancestor of the Giants, was born in the Nine Worlds long before the gods. His brutality incited the gods to cast him into the Ginnungagap Gulf, a yawning void from where all life sprang. From his blood, the gods created the oceans and drowned the giants, and from his body they made Midgard, the land of men. They believed Ymir was dead, but in truth, he channelled his rage and hatred and slowly reformed at the bottom of icy depths. There in the darkness, Ymir\u2019s power swelled and his mind festered with one monomaniacal desire: revenge.\nSculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron and painted by Martin Grandbarbe\nOdysseus mini only for scale\nYmir will come as a MBR add-on during this Mythic Battles: Pantheon 1.5 Kickstarter campaign. However it is fully compatible with Mythic Battles: Pantheon (MBP). The game system is the same, but certain mythological features (characters, battlegrounds, etc) will inform new gameplay features.\nThe 2018 Ymir Expansion also includes an exclusive alternative head. This means you will be able to choose the head you want to use on Ymir. But it also means that if you pledge for Ymir during Mythic Battles: Ragnar\u00f6k in 2019, you will not receive this exclusive head. Now, if we do happen to launch another MB KS during 2018 (hey, anything is possible), we reserve the right to release this head at that point too, but will not be including it in the 2019 Ragnar\u00f6k Kickstarter. In short, if you know you want this exclusive option, now is the only time we can guarantee its availability.\nFrom left to right: the classic Ymir's head & the exclusive 2018 alternative head\nFrom left to right: the classic Ymir's head & the exclusive 2018 alternative head\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS EXPANSION\n Dionysus was conceived during an adulterous union between Zeus and the mortal Semele, daughter of the King of Thebes. After his mother\u2019s death, he was sewn into Zeus\u2019 thigh and kept safe until he reached maturity. To enter the Greek Pantheon, he had to contend not only with his mortal origins, but also with Hera\u2019s potent and fiery jealousy. By exploiting the intoxicating power of wine, he managed to reconcile Hera with her son Hephaestus, and thereby proved his divine legitimacy. Dionysus has been worshipped as the god of wine and excess\u2014known for his orgies and merriment, but also for his fits of rage and madness.\nOdysseus mini only for scale\nThis new set of 10 translucent battle dice is exclusive to 2018 Mythic Battles campaigns. This means that you are able to pledge for them now or maybe later if we decide to launch another MB KS in 2018. But after that, we will no longer produce them.\n The card sleeves will be manufactured to premium 100 micron thickness with a matte finish, matching current market leader standards.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\nPoseidon was lucky. Of all Greece, his realm was the least affected by the return of the Titans and the resulting devastation. Now, he thought, was his chance to step from his brother\u2019s shadow and claim the crown for himself. But first there was a small matter of revenge. That upstart favourite of Zeus: Athena. She was going to pay for winning Athens from him.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n This is not the first time Hera has been upset by her husband Zeus, and his wandering eye (and hands, and other parts). However, it has to be the most dramatic fallout. Since she released the Titans, several Gods have died, the rest have lost their immortality, and Greece lies in ruins.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\nTo show her independence from Zeus, Hera conceived Hephaistos alone. Although he was born crippled, he quickly became the patron god of blacksmiths, fire and volcanoes, and the most outstanding craftsman among the immortals. Hephaistos made many exceptional gifts for both mortals and gods, including the arrows of Artemis and Apollo, and the impenetrable armour of Achilles.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n   They are here! All four of these powerful characters are classed as Titans in the game, though as some of you will know they aren\u2019t always regarded as Titans in the background. Regardless of their technical classification, and call them what you will, on the battlefield they are bigger and more powerful than Gods!\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n    When Hades left the Underworld to fight alongside his fellow Gods, he left his wife, Persephone, in charge. She, in turn, enlisted the aid of Aeacus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus, who had all been famous lawgivers in life. They would help her to decide the correct treatment for each soul. That, at least, was the plan, and it worked for a while. Unfortunately the gates of the Underworld were open, and the dead began to escape back up to the realm of the living. Eventually the Judges followed suit, and now fight alongside the Gods, among the ruins.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n     The story of the Trojan Wars is one that all Greeks know well, and the fabled exploits of the many Heroes who fought in it are taught to every child. Now, in the time of suc h catastrophe, when the Gods are fallen from Olympus and walk the Earth as mortals, these legendary Heroes return to seek glory and honour once more.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n   In game the Manticore is a versatile and potent unit. It is the first 5RP unit released, and it is worth every point. Its basic stats put it on a par with the Hydra or Cerberus. However, it\u2019s quite a different beast. It lacks Cerberus\u2019 Guard talent, which makes its role very different. It cannot regenerate like the Hydra, meaning it cannot pile in to the enemy with quite the same abandon. So what\u2019s so good about the Manticore, and what\u2019s it\u2019s role?\nMainly, the Manticore serves to sow chaos and death across the battlefield in a rampage of carnage. It\u2019s fast. A basic move of 2 is bolstered by the ability to fly, which means that it can ignore enemy units and terrain to get at whatever or whoever it wants. The crowning glory in its mobility is its 5 activation cards, 1 more than either Hydra or Cerberus.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n     The campaign pits two players against each other: one controlling Echidna and her kin, the other controlling the Gods and their Heroes. You can use the contents of this box, or swap in any of her other children you may have.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n This expansion contains just two miniatures: Oedipus and the Sphinx, but they are potent forces in the game. They both have unique playing styles, which add an interesting twist whether they\u2019re being used in their dedicated campaign or in skirmish mode. Lots of replayability squeezed into these two.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n As you all know, Mythic Battles: Pantheon is played on different boards each divided into areas. Each of these areas has a terrain type, indicated by an icon. If the ground is empty of 3D terrain, then no rule applies except in special cases (stairs, water, \u2026). If you place a 3D terrain element on an area, the terrain type is then activated, and a small special rule applies.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n    The Thermopylae map board includes 1 double-sided, 60cm square, mounted map, plus 1 scenario. The map shows the battlefield, the cliffs, and the nearby sea into which you can force your foes. It offers a nice choke point for movement that gives the whole map a very different feeling than the others. Movement is restricted and controlled, and positioning is critical.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n     The Compendium includes 3 complete, and very different, campaigns. Each was written by a different author (or authors), and takes the core of the Mythic Battles: Pantheon game and twists it in a new way. We\u2019ve tested these scenarios extensively over many months of gaming, and are confident you\u2019ll enjoy them as much as we do.\nThe beautifully painted miniatures you see in our campaign were painted by a number of artists, including the talented Martin Grandbarbe, who wrote this guide.\n This Extension Kit allows you, with a very few components, to play two 2-players games at the same time.\n This upgrade kit allows you to upgrade your V1 set MBP to version 1.5.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FROM THE FIRST KS\n This is a Deluxe Storage box for all the cards and oddments that come with a full set of Mythic Battles: Pantheon. You don\u2019t need to have everything to use it; we just decided that if we did a Storage box then it might as well fit everything inside.\n Here\u2019s a video of a 2-player game by Beasts of War:\n 4-player video (part 1) by Tric Trac: Explanations & set-up\n 4-player video (part 2) by Tric Trac: Beginning of the game\n4-player video (part 3) by Tric Trac: Combat!\n Let's Play -  Regelvideo - Einf\u00fchrungsszenario Teil 1 von 2 - Brettspiel\n Mythic Battles: Pantheon is a miniatures board game that puts you in an Olympian God\u2019s sandals! It offers several game modes: from tactical battles against other Gods, to scenarios and campaigns that\u2019ll take you on an epic adventure across the devastated ruins of Ancient Greece.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO DOWNLOAD THE RULEBOOK\nThe Titans have escaped their prison in Tartarus to wreak havoc and devastation upon the world. Seeking revenge on their jailers, they attacked the home of the Gods - Mount Olympus itself! The battle was long and closely-fought, but in the end the Gods were victorious. Even so, the battle cost them dearly.\nThe surviving Gods are greatly weakened and have lost their immortality. The only way to regain this power is to assimilate the energy stones called Omphalos. The first to absorb enough of this energy will become the new ruler of the Gods, and can create a Pantheon in their own image.\nA typical army is made up of one God and their group of fighters. Here, Athena, the Lernean Hydra, Achilles, Odysseus and a group of five hoplites. Illustration by Stefan Kopinski.\nThe Gods, monsters, and heroes of Mythic Battles: Pantheon are represented by incredibly detailed miniatures. They\u2019ll make your tabletop come alive!\nEach miniature possesses unique powers: Zeus throws lightning bolts, the Hydra regenerates, Achilles is almost invulnerable\u2026 These powers can be combined to create devastating effects. At the start of each game you choose a God, and then build a warband around them. Choose wisely!\nEach character has an individual Dashboard which lists their cost, statistics, powers, and skills. These can change as the character takes wounds.\n STAT CLIPS\nIn order to track the changing stats of each unit their dashboards can be fitted with specially designed stat clips. These plastic clips simply snap on to a dashboard, showing the current stats in a window. As the unit takes damage, the stat clip slides down the track to show the modified stats.\nThe core box comes with enough clips for a 4-players game. Clips are removable and can be swapped between dashboards.\nPlastic production miniatures - Zeus (sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron), Ares (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Athena (sculpted by Viktor Dragosani & Aragorn Marks) & Hades (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon).\n The Gods are the most powerful miniatures in your army. However, since having your God slain means you are out of the game, they can also spell your defeat.\nPlastic production miniatures - Heracles, Achilles, Leonidas (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Odysseus (sculpted by Irek Zieli\u0144ski) and Atalanta (sculpted by Viktor Dragosani).\nPlastic production miniatures - Medusa (sculpted by Aragorn Marks), Minotaur (sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon), Cerberus (sculpted by Edgar Ramos), Hydra (sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron).\n All miniatures presented in this campaign will be plastic, pre-assembled, and shipped unpainted.\nSCALE\nOne feature of Mythic Battles: Pantheon is the number of large miniatures included in the game. The Gods in particular are all at least 65mm (2.5 inches) tall, and some of the Monsters also tower over normal mortals.\nMythic Battles: Pantheon plays a lot on scale. The Gods are gigantic, as are some of the creatures you can recruit into your army.\nA LOT OF SPEARS\nThe universe of Mythic Battles: Pantheon, counts many a spear, sword, and other long, thin weapon among its vast armoury. To avoid all the bent weapons we so often see in other board games\u2019 PVC miniatures, we\u2019ve decided to innovate by making some of the weapons in ABS (hard plastic) instead.\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\nFor a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components. To be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only!\nWe talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this. And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company.\nBased on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in China (Asia, Pacific and Japan backers), USA (USA), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and France (EU backers and the rest of the world). Keep in mind these are just estimates for the Core Box + Stretch Goals, and costs may rise based on weight increases from any optional buys you choose.\nAccept the conditions and import taxes of the country you selected for your delivery. We can not refund the orders not delivered or for which the import taxes are too high in the destination country.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally, and to the following countries: Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea and Syria.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014. Since then, Monolith created and successfully delivered 4 top Kickstarter projects driven by one goal: to create immersive games served by great gameplay mechanics and topped with high-quality components.

NATEDE connects to your home or office Wi-Fi, so you can manage NATEDE from everywhere. It features also Bluetooth, which makes the first connection and setup much easier.\nNATEDE\u2019s mobile app dashboard shows real-time monitoring of the IAQ (Internal Air Quality). The wave frequency changes depending on the IAQ levels.\nFrom the mobile app it\u2019s possible to manage NATEDE\u2019s fan speed and select one of the four available operating modes.\nIt's also possible to see a detailed breakdown of the pollutants in your environment.\nNATEDE\u2019s app features a Statistics section where you can monitor the levels of the measured elements such as humidity, temperature, VOCs, PM2.5 and CO. Premium users will also be able to monitor CO\u2082 levels.\nWhen NATEDE detects high levels of pollutants in the air, its app will send a notification and it will ask for information on your activity to better understand your habits and tailor the experience to your needs.\nThe core technology of NATEDE is phytoremediation, which means that it uses the natural power of common plants to clean toxins in the air. This was studied by NASA in the \u201980s and implemented by Vitesy with almost 3 years of research at PNAT and LINV, two of the most important laboratories on plants neurobiology in the world. \nPlants placed in NATEDE metabolize a significantly higher amount of pollutants as opposed to plants potted in regular vases given that the air purification process happens throughout the whole plant, including its roots.\nNATEDE also features a new and improved technology unit that supercharges this effect.\nNATEDE combines phytoremediation with a new incredible filtration process: photocatalysis. \nNATEDE's superpowers come from the so-called photocatalysis: light energy kick-starts a process that zaps all kinds of nasty air pollutants and turns them into harmless substances instead.\nFor people who suffer from asthma and allergies, the NATEDE light-powered air purifier is a great ally to breathe clean air and improve your health.\nThe photocatalytic filter inside NATEDE can capture and eliminate VOCs, viruses and bacteria, and it can significantly alleviate odors from pets, cigarettes and cigars, cooking, mildew, etc.\nAnd the best part of photocatalysis is that this filter does not need any replacement!\nNATEDE\u2019s technology has been scientifically tested\nPLANTS\nIt\u2019s now more than 3 years that we have been testing our products and our technology. Our main partners are PNAT and LINV, the most prestigious research labs on plants neurobiology in Europe, both spin-offs of the University of Florence, Italy. PNAT and LINV proved the effectiveness of our system and work closely with us to improve our products.\nResults from 2016 PNAT/LINV analysis\nAdditional 2017/2018 PNAT/LINV analysis\nFLUID DYNAMICS\nAfter the success of our first Kickstarter campaign back in 2016, we started working with fluid dynamics engineers to perfect the airflow and to improve the purification range. NATEDE has an incredible purification range and guarantees a perfect and silent air flow.\nSee results\nPHOTOCATALYSIS\nPhotocatalysis is a natural process by which the light strikes a mineral (titanium dioxide - TiO\u2082 - a common mineral) and activates a chemical process that securely and instantaneously oxidizes and decomposes the organic matter at the molecular level to form water vapor and small parts of carbon dioxide. The combination of photocatalysis with the plant is just perfect and guarantees a great improvement in performance.\nCenter of Industrial Microbiology Test Report 2018\nComparing NATEDE to other air filtering\n                                                          Vitesy's technology has 3 worldwide patent pending applications.\nPLAY\n\nHaving a NATEDE means you can lay back and relax: the NATEDE app lets you take control of the air you breathe, hassle-free.\nWhether you are cooking, working, relaxing or sleeping, you can select the right functioning mode of your NATEDE.\nYou will be able to save energy while you are not at home with its night mode, or boost its fan while you are preparing those yummy recipes with performance mode.\nAnd if you need a good sleep to be ready for an intense day tomorrow, just make sure you breathe good air during the night.\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a scenario in which objects, devices, and sensors are given the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.\nNATEDE can connect to other smart home devices, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home, who will directly report the quality of the air you breathe and will be able to manage it with voice commands.\nNATEDE features a proximity sensor that lets you turn it ON an OFF by simply moving your hand close to it. NATEDE is science, but you can do your little magic here.\nNATEDE features an intuitive LED guide that lets you see the quality of your air without checking the app.\nNATEDE features a self-watering system, which helps to further reduce water consumption \u2013 in addition to keeping plants alive while we are on the move or on long holidays - its water tank can bring water to plants for about a month.\nNATEDE's new photocatalytic filter, combined with the increased efficiency of the air flow, will also reduce smoke, cooking, and bathroom odors.\nNATEDE has a green soul: it is Made in Italy with sustainable materials often derived from natural waste. \nAt Vitesy, we are committed to a green lifestyle, we respect our planet, and while NATEDE purifies your air from harmful elements that can affect your health we are keen on avoiding an impact on our planet. \nThis is why we spent 2 years looking for the best combination of these materials.\nWe have created NATEDE starting from the concept of \"Circular Design Economy\", which refers to a sustainable design that thinks about our future. \nNATEDE is respectful to the environment in multiple ways: in its use of natural materials, in the lack of added harmful glues, and in its sustainable dismantling at the end of its lifecycle. \nAs a Nature-loving company, we leverage nature and we aim to preserve it as best as we can.\nAs a Technology-enabled company, we deliver the best in class of today's most advanced research in a sustainable future where Economy is based on Circular Design.\nAs a Design company, we are keen on thinking about your health and your future, while delivering a beautiful design object that will enrich your home, office, and your well-being.\nNATEDE Premium is made of ceramic and handcrafted by the best Venetian artisans.\nFor Kickstarter only, we are creating a Special Limited Edition. Every single NATEDE will be numbered and you will have a unique piece of Italian design. A series number will be put at the bottom of each NATEDE.\nNATEDE comes in 2 versions, regular and Premium, each one in 2 available colors, all able to adapt to any home or office style.\nPick your favorite color to enhance your own home or office style.\nNATEDE\nNATEDE comes with a power cord which plugs into the power outlet, and adapter.\n                                                                      What about NATEDE\u2019s production, logistics and shipping?\nAfter launching a first product in 2016, Vitesy has created an optimised supply chain that takes care of every aspect. Vitesy also secured a worldwide partnership with a leading shipping company \u2013 check out this video to learn more.\nTalking about partners, there\u2019s one we are super proud of: Eden Projects, an NGO that plants trees in developing countries.\nVitesy will donate 10 trees for every NATEDE sold.\nThanks to your support, as of today we have already donated 17,000 trees.\n                                                             Here is the list of our Partners: they are all leaders in their sectors.\n    We would like to thank:  \nAlireza Masrour & Plug and Play Ventures, Gert Gremes, Maria Anita Polese, the European Union, Ganis and Francescutti Family, Allison Romero, Ivana Kuchan, Alberto Rossetti, Michele Carlet & Check Up team, Ezio e Denis Maccan, Intertek, Adexe, Ceramiche ML, Ceramiche Rigoni, Ceramiche BS, Etra, Luca Turri and the TGT Family, Fabio Pivetta, IdealPack, Ranpack, Luca Bodin, Andrea Girotto, Giannattilio Usoni & Felice Fanizza, Adriana Turchet, Alessandro Trentin & Graffiti 2000, Microline, Euroetichette, Gianluca Minuzzi, Paolo Tonus, Marco Pasquin, Marcello Ceseratto, Talent Garden Pordenone taggers, Dario Fasiolo, Milica e Dimitrje, 221e, Carlo Cianfrone, Peter Oei, Quasar Media, Child and Youth Finance International, Andrea Petrussa, Luca Dovigo & Friulovest Banca, Ilenia Tommasini & Intesa San Paolo, SSA Informatica, Giorgio Pertegato, Mattia Attus, Politecnico di Milano, Universit\u00e0 Bocconi, Gabriele Agostinis, Stefano Mancuso, Camilla Pandolfi, Elisa Masi, Diego Comparini, Cosimo Taiti, Mauro Afflisio, Apple Italy, Serena Stramandinoli & Accenture, Il Posto di Follador, Shis Pordenone, Gennaro e Signora, Samanta Scaini, Daniele Boltin, Yassi Taromi, Valeria Boldrin, Katerina Ermolina, Valeria Galbiati e Gaetano Diodato.\nSpecial thanks to Kristalia.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur Mission\nWe\u2019ve set out to highlight the necessity of green ethics and to increase your quality of life by developing simple products that combine innovative technologies with incredible design.\n\nWhy Kickstarter? \nThanks to our first Kickstarter Campaign we created a well-structured company and now we are ready to launch a new product.

Lost in thought, you remember the first time you came across a Spanish Galleon. Few of you managed to escape that mess with your lives, but that marked the moment when you began forging your destiny as a pirate. Now, your reputation precedes you wherever you go, instilling fear among your enemies. Nothing will get in your way of becoming the most infamous pirate to ever sail the high seas\u2026\nMake your own destiny and become the terror of the seas in Skull Tales: Full Sail!\nSkull Tales: Full Sail! is a pirate adventures board game with miniatures. Set sail on the Southern Lady and explore the beautiful Caribbean sea, ripe with fearsome enemies and amazing treasures. Fame and fortune await you!\nChoose among twelve starting characters, each one with its own unique miniature, to be used on the different boards as you play through the game. Find all the information you need to start playing on their character sheets.\nIn Skull Tales: Full Sail! You\u2019ll be able to play individual scenarios or embark upon an immersive campaign that threads several different scenarios together into one captivating storyline.\nSkull Tales, created by David Illescas, is a semi-cooperative game for 1-5 players aged 14 and up. The approximate playing time in Campaign Mode is between 60-90 minutes for one scenario and about 150 minutes for a complete chapter (Voyage, Adventure and Port). The game also includes 52 miniatures - not counting stretch goals!\nDuring the Voyage Phase, which simulates being on a pirate ship, we\u2019ll be managing the crew that makes up our ship while we explore the map on the way towards our objective...or objectives! But, the Captain might have a hidden agenda that he/she is keeping from the rest of the crew\u2026\nThroughout this phase, characters will take on different jobs: steering the ship, managing boarding actions, cleaning up, or even fighting sea creatures. The idea is to gain the confidence of the crew, which will depend on where you place your character and how good he/she is at dealing with all the dangerous events you\u2019ll be facing together. The Captain will be able to assign different tasks to the crewmembers, but watch out - the other pirates can conspire against him/her!\nUnfortunately, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of things that can negatively affect crew's morale: hunger, losing battles, unexpected events, etc. If morale suffers too much, another pirate can organize a mutiny to take over the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges\u2026\nCharacters will earn Trust Points as they carry out duties on the ship, and these points will turn into Prestige Points once the Voyage phase comes to an end. This way, your pirate will start to gain a fearsome reputation!\nIn the Adventure Phase you\u2019ll explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, and abandoned temples. You\u2019ll also have the chance to pillage colonial villas and find legendary objects. However, there are frightening creatures and challenging enemies to face along the way.\nThe Adventure map develops as terrain tiles appear randomly according to the specifications of the scenario, making each game different!\nOn the Adventure board you\u2019ll be able to see how much time you have left to carry out the mission, as well as the current danger level\u2026\nEnemies have cards that outline their characteristics and a corresponding miniature. Also, every opponent you face will have a behavior or AI that generates reactions at unpredictable times, making each adventure a challenge.\nIn the Port Phase your character can acquire new abilities and equipment by interacting with the residents of Tortuga Island and visiting its different locations. But be careful, this place hides secrets that can make a pirate\u2019s fate take a turn for the worst.\nEach player will have time units they\u2019ll use to carry out actions, while making sure they are ready to go when the ship sets sail: heal wounds, learn abilities, make bets, listen out for rumors, equip and improve the ship, etc. Each location has an Event Deck, and there are also independent decks for Rumors and Captain Assignments.\nThe following list has everything initially included in the base game, not counting components that may have been unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe base game box also comes with a quick-start 10 chapter campaign (Campaign I) and a couple of special scenarios.\nThe new Skull Tales miniatures have been completely remodeled and will be made with a high quality plastic that is flexible, easy to paint, and allows for more clearly detailed figures. We have already started testing and the results are spectacular.\nThe scale of the miniatures is approximately 30-32mm up to the eye-line and not including the base.\n (Images courtesy from Icue)\nPIRATE contest!

Each story offers a unique puzzle and has optional objectives depending on how long you want to play.\nThe game features full character customisation, worker management, board exploration, roleplaying-style quests and strategic combat designed for replayability. Experience dice free combat and battle against more than 10,000,000 uniquely generated creatures on a map that has 1,000's of possible layouts, using characters you create by choosing from over 100 different options.\nThere are 6 heroes to choose from, each featuring 12 unique skills and 90 customisable stat points allowing you to specialise in attacking, healing, tanking, area control and worker management.\nThis Kickstarter adds four new World Packs to The City of Kings allowing you to pick and choose the new content you want to have:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma  \nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nSide Quest Pack 1\nHero Pack\nEach Character Pack contains 2 new playable heroes with advanced skills, a new 3 story adventure, and more terrifying creature abilities creating new puzzles for you to solve. \nThe Side Quest Pack tells you more about the world by adding 50 new side quests to The City of Kings, introducing the new \"Get To\" and \"Build\" quests to the game.\nThe Hero Pack adds 6 miniatures to The City of Kings, so you can replace your hero standees with beautifully sculpted miniatures.\nFor those of you who already own The City of Kings, an Upgrade Pack will be sent to anyone selecting the \"Create your own\" or \"World Packs\" tiers containing free copies of the updated Rulebook and Quick Reference booklets.\nDigital versions will also be made available shortly after the campaign for anyone who would like them.\nIn addition to new content for The City of Kings, during this Kickstarter we are offering our new standalone game, Vadoran Gardens for the very first time! Full details on the game, along with reviews and runthroughs are available at the bottom of this Kickstarter page!\n Retailers can find out more info about our retail options by messaging us directly.\nLast update at \u00a3340,000: 34xp | Quest total: 49xp\nThe City of Kings already contains 40 unlocked stretch goals from our first campaign, and we have already fully upgraded Vadoran Gardens to be the best it can be, this means we won\u2019t be adding anything extra to either game during this campaign.  \nHowever!  \nWe are going to be running an adventure over the duration of the Kickstarter which will give you the opportunity to unlock extra scenarios and stories for The City of Kings.\nThese will be released as free Print & Play files between August 2018 and February 2019.  \nHow do we unlock them? By earning XP! For every \u00a320,000 we raise, you will earn 2xp, and every day we will be releasing daily quests via updates, Facebook, Twitter and on our website where you can help earn bonus XP!\nThe City of Kings can be played in 2 ways, by choosing either a story or a scenario.\n7 Stories  \nThere are 7 stories to play, each story has its own objectives and continues a narrative introducing you to the world and characters. Stories are the heart of The City of Kings and will provide you with a challenging, immersive experience.\n12 Scenarios\nThe 12 scenarios provide quick ways to play the game offering smaller challenges of varying difficulty. They focus on different aspects such as combat or worker management and provide endless ways to play, and you can even create your own!\nLet\u2019s go  \nOnce you have chosen a story or scenario, each player will need to choose a hero to play. Each hero can be customised by levelling up, allowing you to create your own role.  \nPerhaps you want to be a long-range attacker or a fast moving, short range healer. If you\u2019d prefer to focus on absorbing damage (tanking) or managing workers, then you can do that too! There are 90 customisable stat points and 12 skills per hero, so you never have to play the same way twice.\nThe City of Kings is played in rounds, during each round you will check if you have completed your objective, update the time tracker and then each player will perform their turn.\nPlayers will move across the board turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders, creatures and more.\nEach player will control multiple characters, their hero and their own workers, who can be used to gather resources, build structures, explore and place traps.\nWhen you encounter creatures they will be generated from a simple set of rules creating a challenging creature for you to defeat. There are over 10,000,000 possible creatures to fight and each will require you to come up with a strategy to defeat it.\n Creatures are persistent, staying on the board until they are defeated. There are no dice*, if your attack stat is 5, you will do 5 damage. You will need to work together, using your environment to absorb the creatures attacks, keep each other alive and to find a way to overcome the creatures' powerful abilities.\n* For players who like to roll dice, there is an optional character stat which you can level up, allowing you to roll dice to modify your attack and heal actions.\nThe Blood-Letter's chase Vyliria and Earthshaker around the board setting fire to the environment. Our heroes try to survive whilst their workers build up the Shrine, giving them the additional strength they need to defeat the creature.\nThe City of Kings offers endless puzzles requiring true cooperation, full character customisation, roleplaying quests, resource management and an immersive experience that we hope you will love. \nYou can download the rulebook here and the quick reference booklet here.\nThe City of Kings is a fully cooperative game with no hidden information and supports solo play through a single player controlling 2 heroes. As such, the game plays the same as it would for 2, 3 and 4 players and you will get the full experience.\n  You can read the full review by Geek & Sundry here.\n You can read the full review by Who Dares Rolls here.\n You can read the full review by Polyhedron Collider here.\nYou can read the full player report by Robert Yates here.\n The following full customisation options can be added to any reward, simply increase your pledge amount by the amount shown below. If you have any questions please ask in the comments and we'll be happy to help you!\nAttention Acolytes! Old V\u2019Sheel, the High Priestess of the Vadoran Gardens is retiring, and maybe one of you will take her place. Go out into the gardens, study her lessons in Life, Nature, and Wisdom to prove yourself worthy of such an honor.  \nVadoran Gardens is a standalone competitive card-drafting and tile-laying card game, set in The City of Kings universe. Players take it in turns to play cards while trying to connect similar tasks such as feeding animals, watering flowers and cleaning relics, as they try and complete the lessons set by Old V'Sheel.\nVadoran Gardens is played over 10 rounds, in each round you will be set a lesson restricting the cards you can play.  \nOn your turn, you will pick up the card you selected on your previous turn (or during setup if it\u2019s the first round), and then place 1 card in front of you.\nThe first card you play will be placed on the table, every following card you play must overlap the last column of the previously played card. The card does not have to overlap all 3 squares in the last column, but it does have to overlap at least 1, giving you 5 options each turn.\nAs you explore the gardens, you will want to connect areas of grass, soil and water to score points and avoid the sand. You will need to connect animals, flowers and statues in specific ways to complete achievements while trying to return lost animals, pendants and tools to their homes.\nOnce you have played a card, you will then need to place your Player Token on the card you want for the next round, this decides both the card you get and turn order for the next round. You will always know what cards you have available for this round and the next, along with what restrictions will be in place, so forward planning is essential.\nYou can download a draft version of the rulebook here.\nIf you would like to get both Vadoran Gardens and The City of Kings then please select the appropriate tier for The City of Kings content you would like, and increase your pledge by \u00a317. You can do this when you select your reward by manually increasing the amount shown by \u00a317, and at the end of the Kickstarter we will ask you to confirm the \u00a317 is for Vadoran Gardens. \nShipping for Vadoran Gardens will be free, when added to any The City of Kings or World Pack rewards.\n You can read the full article by Creaking Shelves here.\n All shipping is EU, America, Canada and Australia friendly, so no custom fees will be charged for these locations.\nUnfortunately we can no longer ship to Brazil due to their customs regulations. If this should change I will let you know.\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\nFrank West is the designer of The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens, he is also the worldbuilder, art director and graphic designer.\nMiguel Mitchell Da Silva works full time creating the artwork for The City of Kings Universe and creates nearly all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst adventuring in The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens.\nSara Jorge is responsible for making Frank\u2019s dream became a reality by helping with prototypes, playtesting, design concepts and by believing in him every single day.\nIan O'Reilly is our primary writer assisting Frank with writing the stories and quests you\u2019ll find on our website and in the game.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nHeriberto Valle Mart\u00ednez is our primary sculptor and created the amazing miniatures available during this campaign.\nMatthew Walker created the sound track for our Kickstarter project video.\nRosko Lewis provided the voice for our Kickstarter project video.\n We would love to hear from you and talk about The City of Kings, Vadoran Gardens or just gaming in general!

We will be running more playtests as the Kickstarter campaign runs, but we expect any further changes to be minor. \n\nArtwork\nAll of the artwork is done for the core game, we have a few tokens and bits of graphic design to finish off for the expansions but otherwise we are good to go. \n\nMiniatures\nThis will be the first time we include miniatures in our campaign, but we have chosen to work with the same company that is used by CMON to produce their miniatures and are confident the end result will be amazing.\n\nEditing\nThe bulk of the work prior to manufacturing now is copy editing and proof readings of all the new content and rule updates to make sure we catch as many spelling mistakes as possible. We\u2019ve allowed time in our delivery schedule to manage this.\n\nManufacturing\nWe will once again be working with Whatz Games who did a fantastic job for us in the first print and we are confident in their ability to manufacture a great second print.\n\nShipping\nOur importing and fulfilment process went very well during the first campaign, delivering games to all regions within a few weeks of each other. There were a few minor issues which we have learned from and are confident our fulfilment partners will deliver on time.\n\nFinal words\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The City of Kings was an incredible journey, we all learned a lot and I hope you will join me in this next stage of the adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "Follow along with updates and take part in The School of Games!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["611 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Create your own", "descp": "If you would like a custom selection of World Packs, addons and Vadoran Gardens then this tier is for you!\nUse the \u201cFull Customisation\u201d menu on the campaign page to choose your items, add up the total and pledge here.\nShipping will be added after the campaign based on the shipping prices shown at the bottom of the page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["227 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a317 or more", "title": "Vadoran Gardens", "descp": "One copy of Vadoran Gardens.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Vadoran Gardens", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["168 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a367.50\nAll the new content for The City of Kings, for those who already own the game!\nINCLUDES:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\nSecond print upgrade pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,374 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a359 or more", "title": "The City of Kings", "descp": "MSRP: \u00a375\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["182 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a395 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3155\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter and all Deluxe upgrades!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["175 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3109 or more", "title": "The City of Kings & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3142.50\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3145 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3222.50\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter, all Deluxe upgrades and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,301 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Chapter 2 complete", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nIt is time for us to wrap up the campaign, by now everyone should have received their games and I want to thank you all for the incredible journey that has been Ancient Allies and Vadoran Gardens.

Through this campaign, we are seeking to fund our third project: Black Rose Wars. Just like our previous games, Black Rose Wars has required a huge effort on the part of the Studio and its creators. With a massive investment in terms of human resources, Black Rose Wars is the result of the efforts of a team that is passionate about its work and strives for excellence in every creative field.\nOur past projects, Nova Aetas and Sine Tempora, are proof of the passion we invest in the development of our games and the quality we achieve thanks our high-level professionalism.\n  Black Rose Wars is a project that was born more than 3 years ago and has been tested in all its parts to the extreme. Thanks to this preliminary work, we are able to send the core game, Crono and all aesthetic expansions in rapid time, making sure you receive the game before January 2019. Many of the SGs and add-ons have already been developed and tested, ready to be unlocked and produced. Should we exceed the expectations of the project, all the rest of the material will be sent by June 2019. Thanks to the experience acquired in previous projects, we are fully aware that if certain objectives are reached, we will need to ask you for more time. But we trust that by having the base game and part of the SGs and add-ons straight away, the wait will be made a little easier.\nYour rewards will be shipped at our cost to our international hubs. Based on where you are located, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or the United States (U.S.A. and the rest of the world).  \nIn most cases, you will not be hit with customs or VAT either as we are offering Customs Friendly Shipping to the countries where most of our backers are located.   \nBackers who do not complete their pledge manager by the deadline, which will be made clear via an email notification, may need to have their rewards shipped from the US. This may incur additional shipping charges to international backers that would need to be paid for at that time.  \nDue to the size of the rewards and risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.  \nFollowing is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAn ambitious project like Black Rose Wars will require great effort for us as both individuals and a team. We are aware that the huge work to get to production and the subsequent distribution may suffer hitches and delays, but our team will do everything we can to prevent and correct any delays. \nWe will strive to get you your game on time. \nWe have collectively produced, or helped to produce, many projects and we are learning and improving our skills every day. \n\nWe promise to keep you informed on the project with regular and frequent news so that you can always be sure of your investment.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends. After 14 days and until we pay the production agreement with the manufactory, we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). Once we pay the production agreement with the manufactory, we do not offer a refund.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Zombicide: Invader is a standalone cooperative board game for 1 to 6 players, taking the trademark Zombicide action into the far reaches of space! Players control a group of Survivors trying to defend their remote mining outpost from a swarm of infected aliens controlled by the game itself. The more experience and power the Survivors earn, the more Xenos invade the facility!\nThis sci-fi interpretation of Zombicide is as sleek as ever, playing fast and furious. The rules have been optimized to reduce setup time and make the game flow quickly, focusing the action on the struggle between the Survivors and the Xenos.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Dark Side / Promo Xenos / Plague Survivor Pack / Orphans Survivor Pack / Kabuki Survivor Pack / Tiles Set / Plastic Token Pack / 3D Plastic Doors / Deck Holders Set / Counter Base Set.\nThe game's character artwork was created by renowned artist Adrian Smith, and brought to life as miniatures by the talented team at BigChild Creatives.\nThe Survivors in the PK-L7 outpost came from all walks of life to aid in the Xenium mining operations, and are divided into two types: Civilians are incredibly resourceful, being able to find useful gear in any room of the facility, on the downside they tend to not be very well protected. Soldiers, on the other hand, usually wear heavy combat armor which give them an edge against the invaders. However, their military training means they'll only find gear in specific Security rooms.\nExplore the Survivors more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres. NOTE THAT MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED. CLICK THE IMAGE TO SEE A HIGH RES ALBUM\nWith some luck, Survivors may be able to use some advanced machines to aid their struggle. If you can find the right remote (or are a tech wiz) you'll be able to control the Falchion Sentry Gun to mow down Xenos, or maneuver the Peacekeeper Bot in coordinated attacks.\nIf they manage to last long enough, Survivors can become formidable fighting machines. The more Xenos they kill, the more experience they get, allowing them to unlock new skills as the game progresses. The equipment they find is arranged in their plastic dashboard, with slots for Hand weapons, armor and other gear that can be carried on the body, and a Backpack to store those things you may not need right now.\nSurvivor plastic dashboard.\nPrototype weapons are amazing silent killing machines, but they require an attached Energy Cell to use.\nSurvivors will need all the help they can get to face the Xeno invasion. These mindless creatures come in several different types. Workers are numerous, but manageable. Hunters are deadly fast predators you need to be always on the lookout for. Tanks can take a beating, and dole out an even worse beating. Keep your distance!\nThe different types of Xenos.\nXeno Worker figures 3D renders.\nXeno Hunter and Tank figures 3D renders.\nCertainly the worst of the Xenos is the hulking Spoiler Abomination! This nightmare can only be put down by concentrating your fire, or literally disintegrating it with Hellfire! Don't be fooled by its size, this thing can run you down when you least expect it. While its spawn cards give it extra activations, it will also leap forward if you ever run out of miniatures. The other Xenos may be threatening, but, make no mistake, this is the last thing you'll see before you die.\nSpoiler Abomination figure 3D render.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the Spoiler Abomination also fills any room it moves into with a terrible alien substance we call Mold. This thing eats through doors and walls, completely destroying the room and changing the layout of the map. This Mold may spawn even more Xenos, but worse yet, if it spreads too far, the base will be irrevocably lost (and so will you). Burn it down before it's too late.\nExplore the Xenos more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nUse a flamethrower to burn that Mold to a crisp before it can consume the base!\nThe base at PK-L7 is all you have. Walking out into the planet's surface may be necessary at times, but it's a dangerous endeavor. You'll need to get an Oxygen tank in the Supply room if you want to walk out the airlock. And you better arm yourself with a melee or energy weapon, since the outside atmosphere keeps bullet weapons or flamethrowers from working.\nThe tiles feature several different Zone types, like Exterior, Oxygen Supply Room, Airlock, Security, and Corridor.\nZombicide: Invader comes with:\n9 Double-sided Game Tiles \n72 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n6 Dice \n125 Mini Cards \n15 Mold Cards \n50 Tokens \n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nThe journey into the unknown doesn't end here!\nThe Zombicide: Black Ops expansion raises the intensity to new heights while bringing new challenges for an elite group of Survivors! The Soldiers of Black Squad can be added to your roster, allowing you to play the game with up to 12 players at the same time!\nThese battle-hardened soldiers have been called in to deal with the situation on PK-L7, and find a base already being consumed by the Mold. The 10 new Missions utilize 3 new tiles containing zones already filled with Mold. That means extra Xeno spawning, and a more imminent threat of the base being lost for good. These Mold zones also feature glowing pods of an altered form of Xenium, which may be fired at causing a Hellfire explosion! As dangerous as that sounds, it may be used for our advantage, if we're careful.\nThe Black Ops tiles feature explosive Xenium Pod Zones.\nThis dilapidated base is also under threat of a new type of Abomination we call the Juggernaut. This thing is as ugly as it is unstoppable. Upgrading your weapon won't work, concentrating your fire won't work. I guess we'll just need to lure it into one of those sensitive Pod zones.\nBlack Squad brings some of its own elite equipment to the mission, including the hard-hitting XN35 \"Crawley\" Bot, the devastating Meteor Sentry Gun (a rail gun that can hit multiple zones), and an arsenal of powerful Starting Equipment and other gear.\nExtra arsenal for the Black Ops.\nExplore Black Ops more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nZombicide: Black Ops comes with:\n3 Double-sided Game Tiles \n9 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n29 Mini Cards\n10 Mold Cards\n39 Tokens\n1 Rulebook \nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China and Thailand, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n\u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n\u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n\u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 30th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is May 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde, with wave 2 shipping soon.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, and HATE, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Zombicide: Invader.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Dinosaur Island is the product of an insanely successful Kickstarter last Spring. We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Duelosaur Island X-Treme Edition", "descp": "Pledge for the brand new stand-alone 2 player game Duelosaur Island!\n*Shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Duelosaur Island -

(Check the \u201cWhy Kickstarter Exclusive?\u201d section for details)\nTraduction de la page en fran\u00e7ais\nEnglish and French (printed copies) - Spanish, German (as PDF downloads)\nNew to Kickstarter?\nHere is a guide to guide you through all the steps from pledging on Kickstarter to getting your game!\nThe Base Game Pledge for the core boxes gives you a complete game experience with dozens of stretch goal extras for even more replay value.\nHowever, the Batman universe is so vast that we couldn\u2019t fit all of it into the core boxes.\nThe expansions listed below all add new miniatures, new gameplay, new game boards, new scenarios, or a mix of all of these. They expand your gameplay options to give you even more great content.\nHere is the complete list of all the optional buys available and their price:\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you would like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage. We will sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you a link to our pledge manager.\nClick on the picture to learn more about the Villain Campaign Pack\n                      The mini-campaign takes place on the four maps of the base box(es). You will play as Bane and some of the worst criminals of Gotham City he has allied with. Bane\u2019s plan is to use them to take over the city and break its protector, the Dark Knight. Also, and this is very important, you will require a copy of the Versus Mode add on to play these scenarios.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Wayne Manor Expansion\n This expansion includes 2 game boards: Wayne Manor and the Batcave, each of which includes 3 scenarios. The Batcave is divided into 4 boards to allow players to move into the well-known location under Wayne Manor, but also to other buildings, like those created by Batman Inc. This expansion contains only hero miniatures, like Bruce Wayne, Alfred and his daughter Julia. It also includes ally tiles for use in scenarios, or with the Command skill, and in the Versus expansion. Oh, and there is also a T-Rex!\nClick on the picture for more details about the Arkham Asylum expansion\n                                                  This expansion includes 2 game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with 3 scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can\u2019t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won\u2019t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Versus Mode expansion\n                                                     Good versus evil. Light versus darkness. Heroes versus villains. Opposition is the core of the Batman universe. Sometimes villains turn to heroes and heroes to villains, blurring the lines, but the dichotomy is always there.\nTo represent this opposition, we developed a whole new mode which pits one player against another, each of them controlling their forces through their own command board, giving a more \u201cskirmish\u201d feel to the game. This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn.\nThis expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero\u2019s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes\u2019 side, boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain\u2019s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode.\nThis expansion includes the Batmobile and three scenarios: one for the Bank map, from the base game, one for the Batcave map from the Wayne Manor expansion, and one for the Jokerland map from the Arkham Asylum expansion. The Batmobile is played by the heroes, but does not function independently as a hero. Heroes will control it through a special tile which allows them to create shortcuts by destroying walls or to neutralize hordes of villains.\nBatman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a scenario-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.\nEach game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes, who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to achieve their objectives.\nThe heroes and the villain playing one of the 20 scenarios of the base game\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a scenario which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game, number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game. The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards...everything the heroes need to play a scenario. The villain box contains the miniatures, tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals we're hoping will be unlocked during the campaign.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download a scenario\n                                   Cliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger un sc\u00e9nario\nEach player on the heroes' side controls one or many characters.\nAt the beginning of a scenario, the players may choose which hero they want to play from a large roster. Each hero is represented on the game board by a blue miniature.\nFrom left to right: Nightwing, The Huntress and Robin\nFrom left to right: Commissioner Gordon, Batgirl, Batman and Catwoman\nBatman sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron\nThe Huntress sculpted by Edgar Skomorovski\nEach hero has their own hero board detailing their characteristics, skills, and traits.\nBatman, Jim Gordon, and Nightwing's hero screens\nThe hero board is made of 2 parts: a hero screen that slides into a bat-tablet.\nA hero screen and a bat-tablet forming a hero board\nThis hero board allows the player to control their hero to perform actions such as fighting or jumping from a walkway, by spending energy cubes from their reserve zone.\nThese energy cubes represent both a hero's life points and their capacity to act. The more actions they perform, the more exhausted they become.\nBut when a hero gets wounded, they must transfer energy cubes from their fatigue zone to their wound zone, diminishing their capacity to perform actions in future rounds.\nThe double-thickness bat-tablet with the energy zones\nTo better understand how a hero board works, please watch the following 3 videos from Wayne Entertainment:\nA hero can also carry equipment cards, placed next to their hero board. These cards grant bonuses to the hero when performing actions but have a weight that might slow down the hero or reduce their skills.\nEquipment cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nFinally, some heroes of the bat-family have access to the latest innovations from Wayne Enterprises and can have bat-gadgets. These bat-gadgets also grant bonuses but do not have a weight as they fit into their utility belt.\nBat-Gadgets cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nA hero setup\nFacing the heroes is one player: the villain.

They may activate up to 2 tiles per turn by spending energy cubes. But unlike the heroes, these cubes only represent the villain's ability to activate tiles, as each character they control has their own life point count.\nPlastic sample of the command board\nClose-up of the plastic sample of the command board\nTo better understand how the command board works, please watch the following video series from Wayne Entertainment:\nAll miniatures presented in this campaign will be of high-quality plastic, pre-assembled, and shipped unpainted.\nSCALE\nThe scale of our miniatures is 35mm from feet to eyes. This large scale allows us to create highly detailed miniatures, with dynamic poses that are easier to paint.\nBut some of our models are even bigger, like the hulking Bane, towering Clayface, and the gigantic T-Rex!\nFrom left to right: the gigantic T-Rex, Clayface, Killer Croc, Bane, and Montoya\nTHE BASES\nAs you may have noticed in the images above, the bases of our figures are no longer plain. Indeed, we are moving the quality of our miniatures one step further by offering textured bases so your figures look even better on the game board. Instead of having one base for all your miniatures, we have created 5 different bases of 30mm that will be used for \"human-sized\" figures. Larger miniatures like Killer Croc will have a 45mm textured base and unconventionally large characters like Clayface will be placed on a 60mm textured base.\nA 3D render of the five 30mm bases\nOUR EXPERIENCE\nThis is our third Kickstarter project that features hundreds of miniatures. We have gained a lot of experience crafting these kinds of complex miniatures from the sculpting stage to the final model you will have in your hands. With Mythic Battles: Pantheon we actually set a new standard by using ABS (a harder plastic compared to the standard PCV) for thin sections (such as knives and ankles) and straight components (such as swords).\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\nThis experience allows us to offer very high-quality miniatures without bendy parts, that are regarded as the best available.  \nAdventure mode by Beasts of War (EN):\nLet's play! by Beasts of War (EN):\nHow to play by Barry Doublet (EN):\nDe l'explication par Trictrac (FR) :\n De la partie par Trictrac (FR) :\n Learn to Play: Kickstarter Overview (EN):\n Learn to Play: Conan VS Batman (EN):\n The Dice Tower plays (EN):\nAll pledge levels will be available in both English and French.

Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne. Attention cependant : seules les r\u00e8gles et les sc\u00e9narios seront traduits en fran\u00e7ais. Le reste du mat\u00e9riel contient relativement peu de texte : le nom des cartes d'\u00e9quipement et le nom des personnages resteront en anglais. Par exemple, Gueule d'Argile s\u2019appellera Clayface.\nWe will offer translations in German and Spanish, available to download as PDF when the game will be delivered. However, only the rules and scenarios will be translated. The rest of the components contain relatively little text: the name of the asset cards and the name of the characters will remain in English. For example, Clay Maw will be called Clayface.\nFor a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components on top of the cost of the Batman license.\nTo be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only!\nWe talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this. And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company.\nBased on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in China (Asia, Pacific and Japan backers), USA (USA), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and France (EU backers and the rest of the world). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $20-$25 to most states.\nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nEUROPE: $20-25 to France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands. $25-35 to Spain, UK, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Czech Republic and to most other countries.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nBRAZIL: $120-130 to Brazil (including customs and tax fees)\nASIA: $27 to China and Hong Kong. $40 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia. $50-55 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $50-55 to Morocco, $80-85 to South Africa, $140-145 to most other countries.\nDOM-TOM: $60-65 to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally, and to the following countries:\nCuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea and Syria.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014.

Doctor Babylon, LEGION\u2019s head of technology and development, has unlocked the secrets of the cosmic power source Dark Matter and plans global armageddon. In the wake of LEGION\u2019s ascendance, a crack-shot team of hand-picked agents known as MAYHEM emerges, whose sole purpose is to destroy LEGION and take the world back. Will you use LEGION\u2019s Dark Matter-powered doomsday devices and super-weapons to wreak havoc on Seoul: The City of Tomorrow or will you join the band of gadget-wielding misfits to dish out some MAYHEM?\n\nAgents of Mayhem - Pride of Babylon is a team vs. team skirmish boardgame for 2 to 4 players. The game is played on a modular 3D board that is fully destructible. You and your opponents will play through a radiant story where every choice you make will have effects that ripple throughout the campaign. Play as either LEGION, an organization of super villains who have taken over the world, or as MAYHEM, a band of anti-heroes who will do what ever it takes to stop LEGION.\nIn every game, use the modular tiles to set up an entirely new cityscape in near-future Seoul, Korea!\n3D BOARD! - Play on a board made of modular tiles with 3D multi-level buildings that are up to 240mm high! Use the buildings as cover or to dodge an attack by jumping behind a wall. Take the high ground to gain elevation advantages and attack bonuses against your enemies. The modular tiles allow you to make hundreds of different game maps.\nLEGION troopers have surrounded a building in which they suspect a MAYHEM agent is holed up. Why storm the building and risk injury? Lets just blow the dang thing up and pick up MAYHEM souvenirs!\nDestructible Terrain - You can drive enemies from behind cover by triggering explosions. These explosions and your attacks will often cause damage to a building which will eventually cause it to collapse.\nPictured are MAYHEM's Fortune character and one of LEGION's Swarm Troopers!\nUnique Characters - Every MAYHEM and LEGION character has their own highly detailed miniature and a Character Board that outlines their stats and abilities. Each character has a unique gameplay style and you will have to choose the right team for each mission. Finding the right combination of characters and tactics is half the fun of Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon. The other half is blowing stuff up!\nHollywood's Character Board shows all of his abilities, actions, upgrades and gadgets. Between games you can upgrade the character board.\nCustomizable Characters - Customize your characters before each mission with an arsenal of gadget cards that slide into their Character Board and Mayhem Cards that let them unleash crazy and hilarious powers.\nHere new hard won Gadgets are added to Fortune's character board.\nCharacter Progression - After every game, you will have the opportunity to unlock new Gadgets and buy upgrade tiles for your characters. Upgrades stay permanently in the character\u2019s board until you decide to reset the game.\nFast Skirmish Gameplay and Tactics - Alternate taking turns with your opponent in quick game play that keeps you involved at all times. On your turn, you take actions with one of your characters while your other characters regenerate some of their resources. There is no downtime and you fluidly take turns back and forth until the Mission ends.\nBackstrikes and Flanking Fire\nAimed Attacks\nHeight Advantage\nA close up of a game in progress. Fortune goes for the loot while Hardtack keeps Gaunt busy!\nStory Campaign - Play through an immersive campaign with a radiant storyline. Decisions you make have ripple effects that impact your future missions, assets, and abilities. Every group\u2019s experience is unique in an open world that can branch into dozens of different story-lines full of humor and awesomeness with hundreds of ways to win.\nHumor - Agents of Mayhem - Pride of Babylon is full of over the top action and humor. Get immersed into the Saints Row universe with hilarious card flavor text, mission comics, and sometimes helpful character public service announcements.  \nMultiple Play Modes:\n1 to 8 players\nPlayer vs Player (1vs1, 1vs Many, Team vs Team)\nCo-op against the AI (with Solo Add-On)\nSolo mode with  dynamic AI (with Solo Add-On)\nNote - We rate Pride of Babylon as PG-13.

But, those dang cars to make some tempting targets for the LEGION!\nThis stretch goal upgrades the Golem from an Ally to a Full Elite Unit!

And as we all know, bigger is better!\nNow you have a plethora (yes, I said a plethora El Guapo) of new toys for LEGION to play with and make the really bad guys even badder.\nSheherazade, Oni, and Kingpin have been upgraded with more toys to play with so that you have more MAYHEM options to wreak havoc with!\nAugust Gaunt, recording superstar, uses a mix of auto-tune and brainwashing headphones to control the minds of of his fans! With this stretch goal he will be able to manipulate the innocent civilians in the game, giving MAYHEM some real headaches.\nYou get so much cool stuff in this game that we wanted to include a way to store it effectively.\nLEGION needs a sweet ride to keep up with MAYHEM so here you go.  That may have been the fastest unlock yet...\n  To include an Add-On with your pledge, increase your pledge amount by the Add-On's value. When you receive your Survey after the campaign ends, you will specify what the extra amount is for. \nEx: You pledged for the $90 Hardtack's Headshot. You want to add the $20 - 'COPs' and the $10 - '300 Card Sleeves' Add-Ons to your pledge. Click on the pledge level that you chose, which is on the top right hand part of this page. A pledge detail window will open and there you can increase your pledge amount from $90 to $120. It is that easy.\nAnd thank you for your support.\nThe modern police force (Civil Overwatch Patrol) of near-future Seoul is composed of Androids. The COPs are programmed to enforce a safe environment using civil tactics. But what happens if an organization hacks into their system and overrides their programming?!  \nThe COPs are a fantastic Add-On that add game play elements.\nThese are more than just cards. The 'Athena AI' was developed for military training games and tactics analysis. Athena innovatively uses Object Oriented Programming in a card deck that rivals video game AIs! Now play solo or cooperatively with your friends against Athena as either MAYHEM or LEGION. \nThe Solo Ad-On will be shipped in a second wave three months after Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon has been shipped. This delay is necessary, since we estimate an additional total of 520 man hours to program the AI deck. A nominal shipping fee will be added during the survey.\nAfter saving the world in Saints Row IV: Gat Out of Hell, Johnny Gat is back for more action and incredible campaign story lines! He is joined by his old hacker friend Safeword and the advanced human/nano-machine Lazarus!

When we were approached to develop a board game utilizing our military tactical engines, we were taken aback. But the more we thought about it, the more excited we became about the near future Agents of Mayhem world. We decided to go for it and founded our new Sci-Fi and Fantasy division - Apollo Games!  \nWe have applied all of our award winning experience into the over-the-top and humorous Anti-Hero vs Super Villain theme of Agents of Mayhem. Now you will need to utilize real world military combined arms tactics to succeed, even if you can jump over buildings, stop the bad guys with your looks, or conjure up monsters from the earth! On top of this, we have developed a campaign system like no other board game, in which every decision you make can affect you in the future. \nShipping will be charged during your post-Kickstarter campaign survey on which you will fill in your shipping address.

Our last two projects 'Mare Nostrum - Empires' and '878 Vikings' were so successful, that we unlocked all of our stretch goals. 878 Vikings English language games began shipping only 3 months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. Online Forum and BoardGameGeek ratings and comments are very high and positive.\n\n'Pride of Babylon' is 100% developed and project managed in the USA. We have full control of every aspect of the project. All stretch goals and game expansions have already been fully developed and playtested. All artwork is finalized and manpower has been scheduled and set aside to make sure that Pride of Babylon will ship in a timely manner.\n\nPride of Babylon is scheduled to ship by Sept 2018, 6 months after the end of the KS campaign!

This game is set to be printed in China with a printer that we have developed a relationship with for years. Past issues have been always taken care of in a professional and quick manner and we expect this good relationship to continue.\n\nWe appreciate your Kickstarter support, which allows us to continue to create unique and high-quality games.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Based on the \"Chronicles of HATE\" graphic novel by acclaimed artist Adrian Smith, HATE is a board game of brutal combat and conquest in a desolate world of savage warriors. Created by the same design team who brought you the Zombicide series, under the supervision of Eric Lang, HATE combines the gruesome artwork of Adrian Smith with exquisitely sculpted miniatures to immerse you in a universe of cruel survival by any means.\nTake control of your tribe and lead them in battle against your opponents. Each battle pits two tribes controlled by different players, clashing against each other to achieve objectives, massacre the enemy, and reap rewards from blood and land. As the Chronicle unfolds, players engage each other in numerous clashes in an effort to defend or conquer territories, trying to be the ultimate Tyrant and rule the wastes of the world. While the HATE core box initially allowed for up to 4 players to fight through a Chronicle together, more tribes have since been unlocked allowing the game to expand to up to 6 players. Explore the 4 original core Tribes here: Um'Gra, Um'Rak, Um'Kator, and Um'Cal.  \n  Find out more about these Optional Buys in these links: The Mother Prophecy, Tribe of Vore Nash, Tribe of Um'Tull, Tribe of Sarrassa, Battlegrounds of HATE, HATE Art Book, 3D Plastic Plateaus, 3D Plastic Huts, 3D Plastic Trees, Red Dice.\nThe Tyrant - Only a worthy tribe will be led by this legend, all others will cower under his hateful gaze.\nEach battle in the Chronicle has consequences, not only in terms of the control of the land, but also in the tribes that fight for it. Killing your opponent in merciless fashion and reaping all that which the land has to give increases your tribe's Hate and Resources. These then allow your warriors to gain new skills, turning them into ever more formidable killers as the Chronicle progresses. You will also be able to bolster your village, giving your tribe extra abilities and features to use in both short and long term. However, dismemberment and death may also be your fate in the battlefield, and you will also need to carry the burden of that in your struggle for power. \nTribe of Um'Gra - Blood-frenzied maniacs, their recklessness is their greatest strength, though it can often be their weakness.\n  The world of HATE is brutal, and is recommended for mature audiences only. The art of the game depicts acts of extreme violence, as well as nudity. To survive and thrive in this barren wasteland, you'll need to embrace the savagery of not only massacring your enemies, but taking innocents captive, torturing them, and even feasting off their flesh. You've been warned, this is not a world for the faint of heart!\nThe figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Gra.\nEach tribe is composed of 11 characters: 2 Youngbloods, 6 Warriors, 1 Shaman, 1 Champion, and 1 towering Prince. (The last belong to the Varn, a \"higher\" lineage of men, who grew monstrous as the ages passed, by feeding on the lesser kind.) Each of these have different stats and starting skills, offering their own tactical choices in battle.\nThe Character cards show your tribe's initial skills and stats.\n  Tribe of Um'Rak - Hive minded, they move as one, to strike like a horde.\nEach tribe also counts on their own unique deck of 8 Tribe cards that they can employ at different points of the battle, usually by spending gathered Savagery tokens. These cards reinforce each tribe's individual nature by offering powerful bonuses and abilities to outmaneuver your enemies.\nTribe cards can often turn the tide of battle.\n  The figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Rak.\nWhen a player challenges another to battle, they choose among 10 different scenarios to play, depending upon how close they are to conquering the heart of the land. Each scenario contains a different terrain setup, as well as different objectives the attacker and defender must accomplish in order to be victorious, and different rewards they may gain from that.\nTribe of Um'Kator - Jacks of all trades, they are relentless and always prepared for changes in the tide of battle.\nBattles are fast and furious, taking around 40 minutes to play. Players maneuver and activate their characters around the board to crush their enemies and reap rewards. Ganging up on an opponent is a sure way to bring them down, or hinder their attacks. Use terrain to your advantage, holding the high ground to dominate your foes. Pillage huts you find to steal their resources or capture any innocents hiding within (being careful of possible ambushes), and harvest withering trees for the meager resources they may yield.\nThe figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Kator.\nIf you happen be knocked out in battle, though, you had better pray your allies keep your limp body safe so you may live to fight another day. If you're carried off by the enemy, a fate worse than death awaits you (usually followed by death). At the end of a battle, captives are dragged to the villages, where the sadistic choice of whether to torture them to death (to gain Hate) or kill and cook them (to gain Resources) is made.\nTribe of Um'Cal - Fearless berserkers, they leave a trail of blood where they go, even if some of it is their own.\nAt the end of each battle, all Hate and Resources gained by each tribe is tallied in the Chronicle sheet. Every few of these gathered unlocks a milestone, which allows you to upgrade your tribe in several different ways. Resource milestones help you upgrade your village. Your tribe's Village sheet shows the buildings you have, and the ones you can build, as well as upgrade. The more you upgrade your village, the more resourceful your tribe becomes. The Forge offers you several Feats of Savagery that can be activated during a battle by spending Savagery tokens to gain different bonuses. The Hall of Heroes allows you to conscript Mercenaries to your tribe, the Training Grounds allow your characters to learn extra skills, and the Shaman's Hut gives you more control over your Tribe cards. At the end of each battle, you may use your Chiurgeon to heal your warrior's scars, and the bigger your Oven and Torture Pit are, the more enemies you can cook or torture!\nVillage Sheet.\n  The figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Cal.\nMeanwhile, Hate milestones allow you to choose Upgrade cards to add to your characters (those that have proven worthy in battle). These dozens of transparent cards contain a myriad of different skills for you to choose, including 6 of them which are exclusive to your tribe. The character cards are all protected by plastic sleeves, allowing you to simply slide the Upgrade card on top of them. Each character may have up to 4 different skills, becoming a legendary fighter. But be careful, such legends can still be killed and erased from the Chronicle.\nAdding an Upgrade to a Warrior.\n  Mercenaries come in all shapes and sizes, with varied abilities. They have their own goals, but you can force them to join your tribe!\nBeing wounded in battle can have drastic consequences. Any characters knocked down on the battlefield (those lucky enough not to have been dragged off and roasted) must make a roll to determine their fate. They may come out of it unscathed, or suffer a tragic death, but more often than not they'll go on carrying a scar to remind them of their failures. These can range from a mental debilitation, to a gouged eye or torn off limb, with the penalties associated with that. Scars are added to characters similarly to Upgrades, possibly cancelling a skill the warrior possessed!\nAdding a Scar to a Warrior.\n  The Mercenary figures, and the imposing Tyrant.\nOnce the Chronicle is over, how much Hate and Resources you accumulated, as well as the strength of the territories you conquered, will determine who becomes the Tyrant that rules the world, while their enemies cower under their merciless feet!\nExample of an epic battle between 4 Tribes!\nUPDATE: With the Stretch Goals unlocking an extra board and extra components, the game will also allow players to use a set of Optional Rules that introduce, at certain points of the Chronicle, massive battles involving more than 2 players. Form alliances in 2x1 or 2x2 battles, or go crazy in a free-for-all slaughterfest!\nDue to its violent, adult content, we have decided to make it so the entire HATE board game is Kickstarter Exclusive (or other crowdfunding platforms). This means the core box and any of its ancillaries can only be acquired through Kickstarter or other crowdfunding platforms, and will not be made available to stores through normal distribution channels. Limited quantities will be available to retailers who want to make a Retail Pledge to this campaign (see below), but if you're interested in HATE, this campaign is the only guaranteed place to get it.\nThe HATE miniatures are 32mm scale. However, the Princes and other members of the higher race are gigantic figures standing about 75mm tall! The pictures shown in the campaign are of resin copies, while the figures that will come in the game will be high-quality pvc plastic.\nOn the left is a resin figure, and on the right a first test sample of the plastic figure. As you can see, the detail already holds very well, even with improvements still being done to the mold.\nGame Components:\nAt the start of the campaign, the HATE core box includes:\n51 Highly Detailed Miniatures\n1 Game Board\n30 Terrain Tiles\nOver 100 Cardboard Tokens\n32 Tribe Cards\n51 Figure Cards\n88 Transparent Upgrade/Scar Cards\n44 Plastic Card Sleeves\n6 Custom Dice\n13 Counter Bases\n5 Scenario Dashboards\n1 Village Sheet Pad\n1 Chronicle Sheet Pad\n1 Rulebook\n  WIP RULEBOOK - Please note this is not the final version of the rules. This rulebook is still being developed, so rules and graphics are subject to change.\n  For $120 the Tyrant Pledge gets you the Kickstarter Exclusive HATE core box, which is sure to become even more impressive with all the Stretch Goals we hope to unlock and add to it!  \nOur own Eric Lang and Michael Shinall sat down to battle each other and explain to you the basic mechanics of HATE.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\n                                                                                            Please Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $60-$70 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $80 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries.\n $35 to Norway, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n $40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n $60-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n  To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE. Keep in mind this will be the only chance for retailers to grab some copies of this game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 29th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is January 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, and Massive Darkness. The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde are on their way to backers.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: wave 2 of Zombicide: Green Horde, and A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of HATE.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

We also produce a news podcast, Board Game Breakfast and other variety shows, a series of popular \"Top Ten\" list videos, shopping guides, and more! All of this can be found at our website - www.dicetower.com.\n  Our show gets a majority of its funding from our Kickstarter campaign each year. We have four full-time employees (Tom, Sam, Zee, and our editor, Derek), as well as a part-time webmaster and Eric. Last year, our focus was on getting our own studio.  This year, our goals are\nImprove live streaming, both in quantity and quality\nHave amazing convention coverage\nIncrease the quality of our current Youtube shows\n We're asking for your help as we pursue our goal of covering the entire world of board games.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Chronicle X is a 1-7 player tactical board game, set in a Sci-Fi Retro 1980s, tasking players to either control the daring men and women that make up the military organization, Chronicle X, or the Overmind, a ruthless and cunning alien overseeing the invasion of Earth and the end of all human resistance. The Chronicle X player(s) have a diverse group of heroes to choose from to form their squad, but must also manage the expansion of their base of operations, using what scraps and materials they can to secure a foothold on the planet. The Overmind player has a cadre of alien troops to choose from to overwhelm the Chronicle X players, ensuring they will never save Earth.\n        Chronicle X miniatures are made from a specially produced HIPS-based material. It is able to hold an amazing amount of detail (similar to resin minis) while at the same time providing the durability needed for regular play. Each miniature is produced as a single piece, thus no need for assembly. You will be ready to play straight from the box!\nWHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET\nShown above and below are painted final production miniatures, identical to what you will find included in your game (with the exception of paint).\nAll base game miniature molds are already produced! We need your help to enter mass production and deliver Chronicle X to the world!\nPLAY\n\nThe entire production process will be completed within the EU (Poland), avoiding any fulfillment delays that can occur when production is performed in China. Chronicle X will be Archon Studio's second new game fully produced in-house after Vanguard of War, which is already in the midst of fulfillment to backers. We have the necessary machinery, a competent staff and will oversee the entire process from the beginning until the last package is shipped to our backers!\nChronicle X\u2019s miniatures are 32 mm scale but as you can see, we have models as big as almost 80 mm! Big or small, each miniature is brought to life in gorgeous detail as a single piece.\n      ABOUT GAMEPLAY. Chronicle X features a rich and robust rules system enhanced by quality miniatures and components. Below are some of the key aspects that make Chronicle X a challenging and rewarding experience for players.\nHEROES: Humanity\u2019s only hope for survival rests in the hands of a ragtag group of larger than life soldiers, scientists and terrorists. All the information a player needs to know about a hero is featured on their profile card, including special abilities and equipment. Each hero has a piece of signature equipment unique to them that can be upgraded throughout the course of the campaign. Heroes can also store equipment in their backpack, ready to use whenever battlefield conditions warrant it.\nDIALS: Each hero also has a unique Stat Dial. As a hero becomes injured, their combat capabilities decrease; moving the dial to reduce the hero\u2019s health on the card also lowers their other stats. Pride will be the downfall of any hero who thinks severe injuries will not slow them down. Luckily, heroes can utilize healing items to regain health, and thus, increase their stats. A wise hero will keep a healer close by, for their support can mean the difference between life and death in a battle against the Overmind.\nGAME BOARD: Each mission takes place on a board built from 4 tiles. There are 6 tiles included in Chronicle X and each contains a wealth of battlefield features, from terrain that blocks line of sight and movement, to open ground and cover that affects the attack or defenses of those standing there. There are also searchable squares for the heroes to find new items and equipment as well as Access Points that dictate models\u2019 starting positions. Both heroes and aliens must navigate the board and utilize the battlefield features to their advantage in order to crush their enemies.\nALIENS: Earth\u2019s defenders must face a variety of deadly adversaries brought from the depths of space to conquer Earth. From the Grays and their Commanders to the savage denizens of Devol, the Overmind player can customize their forces each mission to defeat Chronicle X and bring an end to humanity\u2019s foolish resistance.\nBASE OF OPERATIONS: Chronicle X\u2019s base of operations is an important advantage for the heroes between (and sometimes during) missions to sway the battle in humanity\u2019s favor. Using scrap components found during their missions, the heroes can build new rooms such as the Med Bay to fully heal their heroes before battle or the Communications room to allow them to alter the difficulty level of their upcoming mission. The heroes must use their rooms wisely as the Grays\u2019 army grows stronger with each mission.\nITEMS: To aid Chronicle X in its struggle against the invading aliens, players can gather resources and equipment to upgrade their base and outfit their heroes. From items such as high tech bullets and first aid kits to powerful weapons and armor that can be equipped to grant additional combat bonuses, the heroes can find a wealth of items to use when taking the fight to the Overmind. In addition, the heroes can also gather scrap components which can be taken back to their base of operations in order to upgrade the items they have found or even expand their base.\nDICE: Both attacking and defending are resolved using unique twelve sided combat dice that feature Hits, Defense and rare but devastating Critical Hits. These combined with modifiers, penalties and unique attack effects, such as Stun or Push, create a quick and intense combat system. Profile cards allow players to monitor their models' states, such as the hero statistic dial, that alters the model's combat effectiveness over time as the hero takes damage.\nShipping will be charged via our Pledge Manager system after the Kickstarter campaign ends based on the actual costs incurred to ship. Below is a list of rough estimates for shipping. These are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and optional buys you choose.\nUSA & CA: $10 - $15  \nEU: $10 - $20 \nAustralia: $15 - $20 \nRest of the World: $20 - $30\nBy default, the games will ship after all items are produced. However, as the base games will be produced first, you will have the option of getting your base game shipped as soon as it is produced, with the rest of your pledge shipping later. This \u201ctwo shipments\u201d option incurs an additional shipping cost and will be available via the Pledge Manager.\nIn its short lifetime, Archon has helped 12 Kickstarter projects come to life by providing manufacturing and other services and products to companies.\nWe decided to make a name for ourselves as a creator of games not just components, so we designed, produced, and delivered League of Ancient Defenders (LOAD) and Vanguard of War (VoW) as a solo projects and wish to continue that work with the release of Chronicle X.\nWe are now 100% in control of our board game manufacturing process, including 2D concepts and art, 3D designs and all printed elements.\nEvery single component is made in Europe, avoiding possible delays caused by China shipping or New Year holidays.\nWe are using carton for cardboard elements supplied by a Germany-based supplier to guarantee the quality of the final product.\nThe graphics for our cardboard materials are provided by a local printing company that is 500 meters away from our manufacturing and assembly plant.\nArchon Studio miniatures are made from a specially produced non-PVC-based material.\nThe process is called Unicast and it\u2019s exclusive to Archon Studio products.\nOur current formulation of the manufacturing material (aR MK3) is able to hold an amazing amount of detail while at the same time providing the durability needed for regular play.\nEach miniature is produced as a single piece, thus no need for assembly. You will be ready to play straight from the box!\nWe are constantly improving the formulation of our production material to make sure our products meet the strict United Europe regulations and surpass customer expectations. We are happy to announce that products manufactured by Archon Studio pass all safety tests and our products are now marked with the CE logo \"Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene\".\nMoney-Back Guarantee\nWe are so confident you will enjoy Chronicle X, we\u2019re offering a full refund if you are not completely satisfied with the game. If you decide you do not like the game within 60 days after the Kickstarter campaign is over, we will refund 100% of your money. If more than 60 days have passed (but before shipment), we will refund the amount you pledged minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees. After a pledge has been shipped to you, you will have the right to return the product to us for a refund within 14 days of receiving it if you are not happy with the final product.\nDelivery Deadlines Will Be Met\nWe set extremely optimistic delivery dates for our previous campaigns and still managed to pull them off. As we are now in control of the entire production process, we know how much time the entire project will take, from the first 3D models until the game is delivered to you. We\u2019ve established a realistic delivery plan we will meet!\nArchon Loyalty Program\nIf you back Chronicle X now, you will be become a member of our Loyalty Program. As an Archon Loyalty Program member, if you also back our next Kickstarter, you will receive a guaranteed bonus miniature absolutely free! For the returning backers who decide to support Chronicle X, we are preparing a bonus Loyalty mini to be revealed prior to the beginning of the campaign.

Set in the heart of the Palace of Mists, the legendary comic book hero Okko and his traveling companions must hunt down powerful Oni (demons) and thwart their dark conspiracies.\nDuring each game, one of the players will take the role of the Oni and their lackeys as they attempt to achieve their objectives without revealing themselves or being forced to flee by the Heroes.\nMeanwhile, one to four players take on the role of Okko\u2019s legendary band of demon hunters as they carry out their investigation to uncover the identity of the Oni hidden among the palace\u2019s residents.\n          Before you start playing, everyone chooses a Hero, each of whom has their own skills and special abilities.\nA Hero is represented by the following:\nA Miniature which represents the character on the game board.\nA Character card which describes their characteristics (Speed, Might, Defense, Guile, Stamina and Natural Talent).\n A hand of Action cards that allows to use the Hero\u2019s specific skills.\nAn Initiative card is used to determine the order in which the Heroes take their turn. .\nA Mission card that sets a personal goal, which the Hero must attempt to achieve during the game.\n  During the Strategy Phase, each Hero chooses up to two Action cards to use in the coming round. These cards can be used in two different ways:\nAs Secret Technique: The card is placed to the right of their Character card, where it modifies the Hero\u2019s Attributes.\nAs a Special Talent: The card is placed to the left of their Character card, and enables the Hero to perform extraordinary feats.\nOnce each Hero has chosen their Action cards, they determine the order in which they will act by creating a deck of Initiative cards.\n  Around the edges of their Character card, Heroes have 4 Equipment slots to indicate which weapons and equipment they are carrying.\nEach Equipment card has its own characteristics and some may only be carried by characters of one of the 4 unique character classes: Hinin, Ronin, Samurai or Maotsukai.\n  One of the players will take the role of Oni, who has its own objectives. It will attempt to achieve these goals while attempting to prevent being unmasked by the Heroes.\nAs the game progresses, the Oni\u2019s control over the inhabitants of the Palace will become stronger and stronger. The Corruption track records the extent of the Oni\u2019s corrupting influence and the additional abilities its agents gain as a result.\n  The Heroes must investigate every dark recesses if they are to successfully analyze clues, interrogate courtiers and decipher documents scattered throughout the Palace of Mists.\n  At the end of the game, Recollections based on the various events that have occurred during the adventure are placed side-by-side, one after the other, to construct Tikku Memoirs. Each Recollection is worth a number of Victory points:\nIf the Oni or the Heroes managed to achieve a Mission tile objective (4 Victory points).\nIf the Heroes\u2019 accusations have successfully unmasked the Oni (4 Victory points).\nIf the Oni is defeated (2 Victory points).\nIf a Hero accomplishes their Personal mission (1 Victory point).\nOnce you have written the memoirs, it's time to compare the colors of the memoir\u2019s Recollections (blue for Heroes, red for the Oni). The party with the most Victory points, wins the game.\n        Okko Chronicles miniatures are on average 35mm in height. This scale is based on the height to the eyes of an adult human character.\nSome miniatures will be much larger, while others will have smaller proportions, depending on the characters they represent.\nFor us, the quality of the miniatures is a priority and you can expect a level of detail equivalent to those shown here.\n               Click on pictures for more details...https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/359037226/okko-chronicles/posts/2033968\n                                Without further indications, all Stretch Goals will be sent in separate boxes.\nThey are also included in the Ronin pledge.\nOkko is a comic book that chronicles the adventures of a ronin and his companions as they hunt demons and other evil creatures across the continent of the Pajan.\nThe saga is divided into 5 cycles, each inspired by a critical element that sets the tone of the adventure\u2019s narrative: The Cycle of Water, The Cycle of Earth, The Cycle of Air, The Cycle of Fire and The Cycle of Emptiness.\n.\nThe group of oni hunters is made up of the following Heroes:\nAs a venerable monk, Tikku recounts the exploits of his erstwhile companions.\nEspecially for this game, HUB, the author-illustrator of the Okko saga, has produced many new and impressive illustrations, along with several new characters to accompany Okko and his companions in their adventures.\n  If you wish to order more than one copy of the game, it is possible to add as many Ronin (\u20ac75) or Samurai (\u20ac90) pledges as you want.

Players carefully select their squad of characters then fight it out to complete life or death missions - that can help turn the tide in the battle to come! \nThese can be played as one-off narrative missions between elite fighting forces, but Vanguard is also fully compatible with your larger games of Kings of War. By linking battles in Vanguard to your mass battles, thanks to the innovative interlinked campaign system, victory in Vanguard could mean you\u2019ll gain access to better magical artefacts, new units or even the chance to deploy in better positions. Meanwhile, defeat could force your units to arrive late or your deployment options will be hampered.\nAs your troops successfully complete missions, they\u2019ll become a renowned force, so we\u2019re also developing an in-depth war band progression system to reflect that. As you play more games, your key heroes will gain new and more powerful abilities and discover new equipment - but wounds suffered might mean they pick up game-changing injuries!

It only excludes the stretch goals marked as MONSTER stretch goals.\n  Want to go in for a real treat? With the MONSTER pledge, you will get deluxe components on top of everything you get in the LEADER pledge, and MONSTER stretch goals that add further deluxe components.

In the Dice Pool Generation phase you collect dice from the track and all your mercenaries, these are your tools to prosper.  \n  You will use your dice to take actions using a \u201cworker-placement\u201d mechanic. In the Citadel, your dice allow you to improve your clan, acquiring traps, shields, potions, venoms, mercenaries, and more. The timing of your dice placement and the type of dice you use affects both yourself and other players.  \n  All of the mercenaries, resources, and items you acquire go back to your clan base, and once you feel equipped enough, you go out to the wilderness and face the monsters.  \n  Outside the Citadel, your dice become battle tools. You roll them in missions and battles, aiming to surpass target values. Careful, though, the choice of position in the battle is strategic, you compete with other players to take down the monsters or free the lands.  \n  You will have many opportunities to manipulate your dice results and increase your chance of success, using a multitude of items and abilities. You cannot simply hope for lucky rolls to snatch the crown, you will need to carefully manage your resources and do some proper planning to be successful.  \n If you capture or eliminate a monster or re-conquer a land, you will reap substantial rewards in form of glory and money. Use them to improve your clan even more. At the end of the game, the crown is handed to the clan with most Victory Points, which are generated by glory, reputation and a few more aspects which enrich the game even further.   \n  MONSTER LANDS will come with a printed English rulebook by default, but you can also choose to receive it in either Spanish, French, or German.

We are extremely excited and motivated! \nHaving learned from our partner CMON in the launch of B-Sieged, a game we authored, we now look forward to applying these learnings and \u201cdrown you with stretch-goals\u201d ;) \n But even more important than the campaign itself is the desire to provide you with a game that is both fun to play and beautiful to behold. \n Second Gate Games as publisher does not only release its own games like Monster Lands, but has also successfully started to publish licensed games of other authors, like Cat Box and Kitty Paw. Why is this important? Because it gives you reassurance that the company is not a one-off stunt, we are here to stay, with a long-term commitment. \n The people behind Second Gate Games: \n    Quite simply, because we couldn\u2019t do this without Kickstarter. As a new kid on the block in the board game publishing industry, we do not have the funds to finance a full production nor the means to gauge demand.\n  Kickstarter is a great tool for us as a company, but is also good news for you as a backer. We are creating Kickstarter exclusive stretch-goals and a Monster pledge level that would never have been possible in a retail environment.\n    The USA, the UK, the European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cFriendly Shipping\u201d. This means we will mass import the product into these regions and handle and pay all the import taxes, you won\u2019t have to incur additional cost.\nThe games will be produced in China by LongPack Games, an experienced board game manufacturer with a proven track record. Prototype quality has been outstanding. For the overseas freight, we are working with global forwarding agents that allow visibility of the shipment at any time, as they are on their way to the various distribution centers. We will be using established fulfillment companies like Ship Naked, Quartermaster Logistic, VFI, Aetherworks, Happyshops, and others, specialized and experienced in the fulfillment of Kickstarter projects, to cover the distance from distribution centers to your home. \nAll steps included, we calculate the product should arrive at your home end of September 2018. [EDIT from Nov. 2: we have adjusted the expected delivery time to end of SEPTEMBER 2018, in order to include the Heavy Weapons and 5p expansion set. Unfortunately, we cannot edit this information in the original pledge boxes]\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, which we will do with the help of Backerkit, the leading Pledge Manager platform. Above you will find the shipping cost you will have to expect per region. In the case of single unit pledges, these are maximum prices.\nWe say \u201cmaximum\u201d because these prices may go down further, but never up. Shipping prices fluctuate, but our pledge to you is that, for single unit shipments, we cover any potential additional cost beyond these shipping quotes, which are already subsidized by about 4\u20ac. And what\u2019s even better: the more volume we ship, the better we can streamline and optimize shipping, and we want to give back to the community by reducing shipping cost further.\n              ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe creation process for a board game is a complex enterprise, especially for a game like ours with hundreds of components: design adjustments, approval processes, pre-production samples, printing & assembling, freight shipping, handling in logistic centers and finally the last shipment to your door. If anything goes wrong or isn\u2019t perfectly right, there is a risk of delay at any of those steps. This is a simple reality that you as backer need to be aware of. If anything did indeed go awry, we would communicate this to you openly.\n \nHowever, we feel that we are well prepared for a good fulfillment process and minimize the risk of delay, for the following reasons:\n \n1. We have done about 95% of the illustration work and graphic design of the game, we are almost ready to push the button.\n2. We already went through the production process with LongPack, while producing prototypes with mass-production techniques. So we are familiar with their requirements, leadtimes, and processes.\n3. Our manufacturer has a proven track record in the gaming industry and the quality of our prototypes has been outstanding. Communication has been very smooth so far and we are sure this will continue.\n4. We are working with specialized fulfillment companies like Ship Naked or HappyShops, we are sure they can handle all your pledges easily, they have the systems and the experience.\n \n Let us also point out that Monster Lands is not a one-off stunt for us.

Wilson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "        Time of Legends: Joan of Arc is a narrative miniatures board game that plunges you into the heart of the Hundred Years\u2019 War. In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.\nFor more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Years\u2019 War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.\nIn Time of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the game\u2019s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.\nYou are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.\nDownload the Beta Rulebook here !  \n  All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\n                                Joan Of Arc, Bertrand Du Guesclin, La Hire, Gilles de Rais & Jean de Dunois (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\n The French have a very large army whose leaders follow the code of chivalry to the letter. These noble knights form the main striking force of the army, with their infantry taking a subservient role. The French employ few archers, but do hire efficient crossbowmen to fight alongside their men-at-arms. All these warriors fight on behalf of the King of France, who sees the war as a chance to reclaim lands lost to the English under earlier monarchs.\nThe Black Prince, Falstaff, John Talbot, John Chandos & John of Lancaster (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe English king considers himself the legitimate heir to the throne of France, and there is some truth in this. In fact, he only failed to gain the crown because the French changed the rule of royal succession to stop him.\nThe English army, though considerably less numerous than the French, are formidable combatants, who often have the best strategists. Their longbowmen wreak havoc on the battlefield, and have repeatedly bested the cream of French chivalry in battle. This is a slight that the French knights are determined to avenge.\nArchangel Gabriel, the Unicorn & Angel (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe army of God is made up of powerful, heavenly beings like the angels and archangels. They fight their righteous battles alongside the lesser creatures of God, and the weary mortals who struggle with sin, but are devoted to their creator.\nThe Holy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\nThe Witch, the Werewolf & the Ghost Warrior (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe Devil\u2019s army is made up of all sorts of foul creatures: werewolves, demons, skeletons, dragons, witches, and many more. Countless fallen mortals march alongside this monstrous host, having cast aside their God and sold their souls for mere wealth or power. It is rumoured that in this dark time, when the End of Days has never seemed so close, even the Devil himself may make an appearance...\nThe Unholy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\n All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\nTime of Legends: Joan of Arc can be played in two different modes: scenario or battle.\nIn the scenario mode, you choose a scenario from the many options offered in the core box and elsewhere. The key feature of a scenario is that it sets a scene and describes a situation, then lets you finish the story by playing a game. A scenario can be anything from a select group of heroes investigating dire rumours of witchcraft, to a sudden ambush featuring dozens of soldiers on either side.\nIn the battle mode, you fight your opponent using an army of your choice. The key feature of battle mode is that both players choose their own forces \u2013 nothing is pre-set. Once you have constructed your army following the simple rules, you fight a battle, with victory depending on the objectives chosen.\nThe cross of the hanged wolf Scenario (3D Demo Board for convention - Not for sale).\n   All pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language during the pledge manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de souscriptions seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la campagne.\nThis campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations. Please bear with us.\nThe French version of this page is here.\n   The Maiden Pledge, with more than 230 miniatures plus all unlocked stretch goals and 12 scenarios that each have a strong replayability, includes everything you need to play for a very, very long time. It is however possible to explore new horizons with the optional buys.\nYou can buy Optional Buys separately with the Companion in Arms Pledge, if you are not interested in the rest of the range.\nOr you can buy them in addition to your Maiden Pledge if you want to play them as we've designed them.\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any optional buy, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Time of Legends: Joan of Arc Kickstarter page, and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage, we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you our pledge manager.\n BUNDLES ADD-ONS\nLEGENDARY ADD-ON\n   MAJESTIC ADD-ON\n    MYTHIC ADD-ON\n   HEROIC ADD-ON\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nJOAN OF ARC ROLEPLAYING GAME\nClick here to find more about this add-on\nVILLAGE PACK \n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nPLUNDER\n COMPENDIUM\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nSIEGE\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nARS NOVA\n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY BATTLES\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nUNLEASH HELL\n Click to find out more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY DRAGON\nThe Legendary Dragon is the biggest figure in the game and the biggest playable figure in boardgame history.

This extension adds new models, a new game play, new hexagons to give you even more play time and fun, and a new special scenario.\nLeo's baby. Dragon / Human size comparison (Dragon supplied unpainted. Leo not supplied at all)\nThe Dragon is supplied with the Archangel Saint Michael, one bombard, two artillerymen, ruins, 4 hexes, 6 hexagons of destruction and a special scenario featuring the Dragon, played by one player, and an army of human soldiers assisted by angels, played by the other players (1 or 2).\nClick here to find out more about this Add-On\n\u201cI loved loved loved this, and spent two days with the scenario bubbling in my mind around the other tactical options I could have taken!\u201d\nWarren (Beasts of War)\n\u201cThe miniatures are all cool. The amount of terrain that\u2019s going to come in the box is also amazing. Had a great time playing it.\u201d\nSam Healey (The Dice Tower) - in the Top 3 of the best games that Sam played at Gen Con 2017.\n\u201cTime of Legends: Joan of Arc stole the show for us. Mythic Games had pictures of hard plastic miniatures painted up, and they looked incredible.\u201d\n Techraptor at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cWithout a doubt, hands-down, my big giant experience at (GenCon) was Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. An amazing Euro minis game. The way you activate the models is extremely innovative. It was awesome, the most fun of any game I played in the vendor hall.\u201d\nD6 Generation at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cMythic Games is no slouch when it comes to producing excellent gaming experiences and they\u2019re ready to take everyone back in time with their latest game, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. Words really cannot do the pieces justice.\u201d\nFresh Mana\n\u201csi le c\u0153ur est \u00e0 l\u2019affrontement, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 narratif suinte de toutes parts, envahit le gameplay pour proposer une exp\u00e9rience vibrante et forte, et donner des options significativement vari\u00e9es au joueur.\u201d\n\u201cIf the heart of the game is in confrontation, the narrative oozes in from all sides, and infuses the gameplay to provide a strong, vibrant experience that provides the players with significantly different options.\u201d\n VIDEOS IN ENGLISH\n             VIDEOS EN FRANCAIS\n            Joan of Arc uses a different scale from what is usually offered on Kickstarter, the Legendary Scale. This smaller but extremely accurate and detailed scale offers many advantages:\n- You can play on a normal sized table, and yet have a large area to cover and a wide variety of terrain types;\n- You can play, if desired, with a very large number of figures on each side; We can include complete and numerous 3D buildings: church, houses, trees, rocks, etc.\n- You can enjoy a dramatically impressive size difference between humans and creatures. Thus, our giants and monsters are really enormous... And our dragon has the actual size that this legendary monster should have.\nSize comparison : Odysseus (from Mythic Battles:Pantheon), Gilles de Rais, Crossbowmen & Angel.\nThe Time of Legends: Joan of Arc miniatures fall into three categories:\nHeroes\nJoan of Arc\nThese are figures known from the medieval period. They possess powers and can level up during an adventure or a battle.\nTroops \nHalberdiers\nThese are the basic units of armies. They are set in groups of 3 infantry models, 2 cavalry models, or 1 single model for exceptionally powerful beings such as angels, demons or dragons. They do not level up, but may possess powers.\nCharacters \nBishop\nThey represent professional bodies of medieval society: blacksmith, priest, merchant, diviner, shepherd, etc. They are always set in 1 single model and bring special powers to their allies, but can rarely fight and can not level up. They are neutral at first, and rally those who enter their zone. Some of them are called Protagonists and have a Discussion Deck. Only a Hero or a Character can discuss with a Protagonist.\nGog and Magog \n     Gog and Magog are two giants offered exclusively to all backers who have taken at least one Maiden Pledge (the Companion in Arms does not qualify), only during the time of this 31 days campaign. These \"Super Exclusive\" figures will only be available during the Kickstarter campaign, to thank the backers who supported us from the start. They will not be available during the Late Pledge, or during the Pledge Manager if you only pledged for less than a Maiden Pledge during the Kickstarter campaign, they will not be given or sold at convention or event.\nThese two terrifying heralds of the Apocalypse, foretellers of chaos and the end of time, possess devastating power on the battlefield.\nGog is poured into satanic magic, while the powerful Magog is a real killing machine. You will be able to play Gog and Magog in one of the proposed scenarios as well as in Battle mode, they are part of the Unholy Army.\nTo know more about God and Magog, read this update\n3D Scenery\nThe game offers a large number of buildings and elements of 3D terrain. They are not just eye candy, in fact they all have a real gameplay. Thus, they count in the occupation of the play areas, offering various bonuses/penalties and opening new scenaristic options. For example, praying in a church gives more Myth points than praying elsewhere and the presence of trees in a forest area allows the defender to roll a defence dice against ranged attacks. Buildings can be visited, searched, and offer defensive bonuses. The buildings are laid on cardboard floor plans. When miniatures penetrate inside a building, the building is temporarily removed to place the minis on the floor plans. When all the minis leave, the building is put back on the board to indicate that it is unoccupied.\nTerrain Tiles\nJoan of Arc is played on modular tiles, composed of large Hexagons divided into 1, 2 or 3 areas. Each area is a type of terrain (Forest, Plain, Field, Marsh, Village, etc.) that can accommodate elements of terrain and of course, miniatures!\nAn area taking up the whole hexagon can contain 8 elements (bases of miniatures or terrain elements).\nThis area is saturated, it contains 8 elements\nAn area taking a half hexagon can contain 6 elements.\nAn area taking one third of a hexagon can contain 4 elements\nThis area is saturated, the Tarasque counts as 4 elements.\nBattle Dashboard\nThe Battle Dashboard combines all the elements of the current game that are common to all players: available resources for the turn, Doom dice, river cards. You also lay down the miniatures that were put out of combat after a fight. These figures will return to the battlefield if the Doom dice is favorable to them... or leave it definitively to join the cemetery if fate falls on them!\nPlayer Dashboards\n Each player has their own dashboard that allows them to manage their resources: activation cubes, experience tokens and myth tokens. In his turn, the player spends them to activate his units (cubes), to pay the cost of a Myth or Tactic card he wants to play (tokens Myth/Tactic) or the leveling cost of the hero he wants to level up (Experience tokens). At the end of his turn, the player may decide to keep his resources in the spaces provided for this purpose.\nSpecial Dice\nDuring combat, the players roll dice of different colours, in attack and defence.\nWhite engravings mean that these dice can kill\nBlack engravings mean that these dice are disruptive\nRed dice are the most offensive dice.\nBlack dice are the most defensive dice.\nYellow dice are the dice of the special effects.\nWhite dice are the most balanced dice.\nCards\nEach unit of miniatures has its own card, placed on the table in front of the player so that he can consult at a glance its characteristics. Heroes can level up during the game by spending experience points.\nRules\nWe will be uploading a pdf of the rulebook soon.\n The European Union, USA, Canada and Australia zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer  import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game Joan of Arc package that is roughly the same weight as Mythic Battles: Pantheon (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $25-$30 to most states. \nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $100 to most countries. \nASIA: $40 to China and Hong Kong. $50 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $30 to Australia. $65 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $25-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries. \nREST OF THE WORLD: $105.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the KS one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.\nWHO WORKED ON THE PROJECT?\nFrom left to right: Irek Zielinski, Olivier Thill, Beno\u00eet Vogt, Jake Thornton, Leonidas Vesperini, David Rakoto, Christophe Madura, St\u00e9phane Gantiez, Erwann Le Torrivellec\n  Pascal Bernard, author of the game, in front of the \"Joan of Arc house\" in Orl\u00e9ans, the house in which Joan spent the night during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans.\nOn top of the people from Mythic Games, a huge team of passionate professionals has worked on Joan of Arc.
