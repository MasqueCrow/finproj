We researched materials, incorporated alternative N95 bio-filters, and tested prototypes with our friends and family to bring you a mask that is comfortable, sustainable, and offers better protection than market-leading masks made from non-woven polypropylene or cloth. \nMarcelo is wearing the Light Warrior L1 (Large size) with white filter\nBarney is wearing the Light Warrior-L1\nLight Warrior -L1 (Large Size) - with Black Filter\n\n\nOlivia is wearing the Light Warrior-S1 (Small Size) with Black Color Filter and her own Gold Tattoos applied onto the mask with water.\n BEAUTY MASK + Skin Therapy Layer : \nHOW DOES THE MASK STAY ON YOUR FACE?  Our proprietary sticky material: Skin Therapy Layer with skin rejuvenating Chitosan. PLUS, the Skin Therapy Layer does more than just adhere directly to your skin. There's the added benefit of Skin Therapy Layer healing power: silicone integrated with Chitosan is a natural vegan polymer used for skin healing in medical and beauty products, keeping skin protected, hydrated, healthy, and smooth. Take a look at what happens to the skin of a banana: \nPLAY\n\nSEEUS95 PATENT PENDING HYDROGEL: CHITOSAN AND SILICONE MATERIAL. The same material that we use for the perimeter STL area of the mask, that adheres to the skin, was tested on this banana. After a few days the area protected by the STL material appears  smoother and preserved. Commonly used in anti-wrinkle patches, the Skin Therapy Layer (STL) on the perimeter of the mask allows the mask to adhere right to your skin so you can wear it two ways: with or without an air tight seal. There is the option of a quick release on the chin if you choose to wear the mask without the air tight function. \n We designed the Light Warrior Masks to be easily cleaned and sanitized in many ways. If you are on the go and need a refresher, just wipe with alcohol. If you're at home, just pop in the microwave for 3 minutes (but MAKE SURE YOU TAKE OUT THE FILTERS FIRST)! Doing a load of dishes? Take out the filters and put the Light Warrior mask in the dishwasher. With a dishwater, some water spotting may occur, but that's ok; just wipe off the water spots with a soft clean cloth and you're good to go!   \nPLAY\n\nSilicone is durable, more ocean-friendly than plastic/air spun polypropylene. It lasts longer, and stands up better against heat and cold than plastics. Our masks can be sanitized with a simple alcohol wiping, soap and water, or put in the dishwasher, and even put in the microwave for 3 min (remember to remove the air filter first). During the recycling process, silicone reverts back into its harmless non-toxic ingredients: amorphous silica, carbon dioxide, and water vapor, unlike plastic and polycarbonates. Its amorphous quality makes it like a second skin, flexible so it can have an air seal fit to the contour of all different faces. Silicone has NO BPA: which is found in polycarbonates which can be harmful to humans, environment and the Oceans.\nNEW ADD-ON CHILDREN SIZE XS1  EXTRA SMALL\nFor ADD-ON ITEMS: Increase your pledge to the amount of the item listed, and we will send a survey towards the end of the campaign to verify your items in your package, we ask that you keep track of what you have in your package and that the total of your pledge adds up correctly to include all Add-On Items you have selected.  \nBarney is wearing the Light Warrior L1 (large size)\nADD-ON Option: TATTOOS:  $8.00\n\n\n\n As a transparent mask, the eminent reality of condensation will occur when there is a temperature difference between the air inside the mask and the temperature of the mask material itself. SEEUS95 has an Anti-FOG coating on the inside surface of the mask which will prevent fogging. We also recommend using an alcohol wipe on the inside surface and letting that dry before putting the mask on to reduce condensation. As you can see in the photo above, you can still see the mouth and nose of Marcelo through the mask even with slight fogging. Once the mask acclimates to temperatures inside and outside, the fog disappears. \n MAKE IT YOUR OWN! Show Off Your Personality! \nOne benefit of silicone is that it acts like a second skin. Have fun, be creative, and tattoo your Light Warrior Mask. You can get any regular temporary tattoo and apply it to the mask; jazz it up and add warrior tattoos to unique\u2022ify, but still see your face and mouth so the hearing impaired can communicate with you. And when you're ready for a new look, no problem! Silicone is easy to clean. \nPLAY\n\n EARLY SILICONE PROTOTYPE VIDEO:  56 Prototypes were made in a small kitchen. \nPLAY\n\n *If you try this at home it will probably put you back about $200, ordering plaster, clay, form work, and medical grade silicone.

Learn more about her story by seeing her  TEDxTalk Here:\n Her designs have been exhibited at MoMA and have received accolades from:\n In February 2020, living down the street between the mayhem of two major hospitals, Alice witnessed the waste of 100,000 masks a day. As a Professor in Material Technology, she knew the one time use, non-woven polypropylene (plastic),  N95 masks were not recyclable and have a life span of 450 years. PLUS, these same masks inflicted pain and bruising on the faces of our warriors on the front lines: an air-tight seal means head harnesses and ear bands have to be so tight that it disfigures flesh with sinister wounds. For GOSH SAKES it's the 21st century! Do we really need ear loops? And head harnesses? Using her knowledge on sustainable materials (and her personal interest in skincare), Alice turned to Chitosan + silicone. These materials offer a natural skin-healing solution that also adheres to the face and stays put. In fact, Chitosan + silicone is commonly used on burn victims and used to treat scars!  \nIT's TIME FOR A CHANGE.\nNow we need your help so you can be the first to join the league of Light Warriors who's faces are seen and breath clean.\nWith new pathogens evolving for the past decades - SARS, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, H1N1, Ebola and now COVI0-19-we wonder, what will be next? What we do know, is that Luck Favors the Prepared. The SEEUS95 mask was designed on a napkin and prototyped in plaster, resin and silicone molds in a kitchen transformed into a lab. After 56 mold prototypes and 26 new forms for the air filter, the first prototype of the SEEUS95 mask was born. Our vision? Let's give two air filters instead of one and shift them to the cheek area. Let's use sustainable materials and help the planet. Let's be kind to our skin. Let's make sure that everyone is able to communicate during these scary times. Let's see us again ... \n10% of SEEUS95 proceeds will go towards giving our  SEEUS95 Masks and Solights to our non-profit partners and those in need. \n We Design for Quality, Safety, and Comfort\n and We think You're Beautiful. \nThe \"New Normal\" doesn't have to be a sea of the covered and the faceless. As we move forward into the many unknowns which the pandemic brings, how will we ensure that everyone is equipped to communicate, including the hearing impaired who may need to read lips? What about the social consequences of prolonged isolation? Do we miss a piece of ourselves when we can't share a smile with one another? Our identities and our humanity are linked to our faces. \nLet's Level the Playing Field by Celebrating our Individuality and Be Visible Again!\n\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a great track record for delivery on our last Kickstarters.

Simply add your own seeds and watch the magic unfold!\nAs blank Seedpads don't have the built in black cover layer, we recommend covering and adding weight to your seeds while they're in the sprouting stage for stronger & healthier greens.\n\n How does it work? \n3 Simple Steps...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Is It Powered? \nMicro and all of Agriolabs' future modular products will use the Powerplate.\nThe Powerplate and MICRO magnetically snap together, easily transferring power. Each Powerplate can power up to two Micros when used with any USB Charger and up to four micros can work their best when using the Agriolabs high power 3 Amp charger.\n\n        Want to power more? Stack another Powerplate on top of your fourth micro and keep growing!\nHarvesting Your Food Made Easy\nSimply take your Seedpad and cut the Microgreens with scissors or a knife. \n\nNo need to wash as there is no dirt and no chemicals used, just add your microgreens straight into your meal. Whatever you don't harvest can be left on the Seedpad to continue growing for up to 14 days*, ready for the next time you want to add something special to your meal.\n*leaving it longer may result in overgrowth/suffocation which can lead to premature decay.\nWhat Will You Grow With Your Micro?\nWhat will you grow?\n\n The possibilities are endless...\nIt\u2019s The Small Things That Matter.\n\nMICRO is your personal gardener and does all the caretaking for you so you can spend more time living. All you need to do is pour water once when starting a seedpad, or once per week until harvest.\nMicro\u2019s controlled environment prevents bugs, rodents, and other pests from easily getting inside and harming your crops. Built for humans, the magnetic drawer keeps even the smartest fluffy companions out.\nSay goodbye to invasive and unwanted lighting. The enclosed design makes even the largest collections of Micro's easy on your eyes.\nOur Custom, In-house LED Matrix\nEngineered for maximum food growth.  \nWe've tested dozens of light patterns with different diffusive and reflective materials. We\u2019ve even looked at different curvatures to come up with the evenest lighting we can get in a compact space. Our LED system guarantees that all your microgreens will grow to a beautifully uniform height for maximum yield.\n  Why Pink Light?  \nThere's a good reason you'll find pink lights in many indoor commercial farms, and Micro is no different. Using LED's that target the specific wavelengths of light where plants are the most efficient at their photosynthetic process allows us to be more effective with the lighting as well as use less power.\nThe Power of Modular Design\nEvery Micro has zero holes that you have to plug something into. Instead, they magnetically snap together, securely transmitting power to each other.\n\n        All this is possible because of the Power plate which is the base of your stackable garden. But wait... The power plates are stackable too! Magnetically snap another one and make your garden taller.\n The Story Behind Agriolabs and the Micro\n S T R E T C H   GOALS\nStretch goals are reward tiers that become available for purchase or are automatically applied to applicable rewards.\n\nIncluded Performance USB Chargers - Applied to Quad Stacks | Unlocks at $13,000\nWith the Agriolabs Performance USB charger, you can ensure that your quad stack will always be performing at its best without any dimming or loss of power. All Quad stacks and above will automatically have these added to their rewards when we surpass $13k!\n\nSeedpad Include Label Stickers - All Tiers Containing Seedpads | Unlocks at $20,000\nKeep track of whats in each micro, especially if you have stacks of them. We make these stickers in house, just like everything else. Every Seedpad will come with a label sticker.\n\nDishwasher Safe Water Drawer & Removable Drawer Fronts - All Micros | Unlocks at $30,000\nWanna keep an eye on your microgreens as they grow? Simply remove the front of the drawer after the microgreens have sprouted (doing this before may result in poor sprouting due to lower humidity). \nWhile the drawer water reservoir isn't that hard to clean with a sponge and some soap,  we'll make it extra easy by making it dishwasher safe. Just throw it on the top rack of your dishwasher and wash as normal! Easy peasy. \n\nTruly Wireless Powerplate - CAD$35 | Unlocks at $50,000\nThe Powerplate requires power via a USB-C Cable... Or does it? With the Wireless Powerplate, the Powerplate itself can be the power source for your Micro's. Simply charge it up, stack your Micro(s) on top, and it'll last you long enough to grow a delicious bed of microgreens. This add-on will allow you to have true freedom. Want to grow microgreens under your sink? Behind your toilet? On the top shelf of a secret closet? We won't judge, go wild, enjoy that absolute freedom.\nWe have some plans and drawings but haven't done all the calculations to finalize this design yet, but we'll make it happen if you make us!\n\nInjection Molded Shell - Automatically Applied to all Micros | Unlocks at $100,000\nThe Micro is full of intricate details that all work together, and most of those details are impossible to injection mold. The outer shell is not one of them. \nWhat's injection molding though!? Injection molding is type of manufacturing where plastic material is melted, and injected into a metal mold. The mold cools and a solid plastic part is formed. Injection molding is how much plastic items are made and is known to have good surface quality, depending on the machine/finishing process.\nAlthough our 3D printed build quality is not that far off from injection molded plastic, the outer shell of the Micro actually takes the longest to print. It's full of broad simple shapes that injection molding would do a fantastic job of creating. Thus injection molding our shell will result in a more consistent build, and quicker fulfillment. It'll also allow our specialized 3D printers focus on what they're good at.\n\nWant to see more stretch goals? We're open to ideas. Chat With Us\n\nLet's Go Hyperlocal... Wait, What Does That Mean?\nTraditional agriculture is one of the leading causes of carbon emissions worldwide. Growing \u201chyper-local\u201d means your food doesn\u2019t have to travel thousands of miles to reach you and cuts out unnecessary middlemen all while delivering you healthier, more affordable food. This is our first step to making hyper-local the new normal.\nDid you know the average North American throws out about $2000 of food a year?\n        A majority of that food waste is organic content which produces methane gas, which is 25x more damaging than carbon dioxide.\nHyper-locally grown food reduces the demand for less sustainably grown produce, as well as tasting better and staying fresh much longer, reducing the amount of organic waste going to the landfill.\nBeautiful, Sustainable Design\n  ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING  \nIs a term for when you add material when creating something instead of taking away material like subtractive manufacturing.\n\n        The most commonly known form of additive manufacturing is 3D printing, which is used in most components of our products with a special high-quality, high-strength version of the bio-polymer called polylactic acid (PLA).\n  SUSTAINABLE TO ITS CORE  \nYour contribution to less global waste doesn\u2019t just start at your first harvest. With additive manufacturing and high quality, compostable bioplastics, it begins the moment you invest in an Agriolabs product.\n  HOW DOES IT WORK?  \nLike nature, 3D Printing builds layer by layer, until the finished product is done. This efficient process allows us to use our material to its greatest extent and minimize waste which is good for the environment and our pockets\n    THE CHALLENGE.  \nTime. 3D printing takes a long time compared to more traditional forms of additive manufacturing like injection molding.\n\n        However, with our print farm growing and constant advances in technology, we are slowly reaching up to the speeds of traditional manufacturing processes.\n\n        We strive to have the best surface finish on all 3D printed parts, whether that means post-processing or working with our material supply partners & polymer engineers to source innovative materials to further improve the visual and structural quality.\n\nThe Humans Behind Agriolabs\nBragging isn't really our style, but we aren't lying when we say we've got the most amazing team ever. Agriolabs was made to tackle big problems by leveraging awesome technology and out of the box thinking. Everyone in the team is a natural problem solver in their own way and we all share the same mission to do good, sustainably. We start with the MICRO as our first step in our mission to get more people eating what they grow, reducing their waste output and carbon footprint. \n\nWhat we'll do with your support:\nYou've decided to support us with your hard earned money, you can bet that we'll use it wisely. From creating jobs, helping reduce food waste, or building vertical farms in the oceans, know that you're supporting a innovative startup that is willing to take massive action. \n Are you looking for the stretch goals here? You'll find them about 3 sections up :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy are seedpads Canada only?\n\nOur seedpads contain organic seeds embedded in hemp fibre mats and covered. This means that most departments of agriculture will NOT allow them to be imported as they are unable to identify the seeds easily, as well as the possibility of certain species being invasive, and other reasons. \nAt this time we are only offering our Canadian backers seedpads in order to keep fulfillment running as smoothly as possible.\n\n\nFulfillment time & process:\n\nWe're looking at being able to fulfill most units within the next 4-6 months of the Kickstarter completing. \nWe'll be fulfilling units of earlier backers first, so if you backed our project on the last day, that's still fantastic and you'll still receive your reward, but it may take longer than some other backers. \n\nWith the pandemic still going strong, please understand that there may be delays in the global shipping system. \n\nBackers's rewards will be organized and processed through our online store system, so you will receive details (such as tracking #'s) regarding your package and shipment by email or text from our site. \n\n\nThe more we raise the quicker fulfillment will be:\n\nSurpassing the goal by large amounts will allow us to bring more processes in house instead of sourcing them internationally. Allowing us to:\n- Bring bio-plastic resins in house where they will be processed, extruded, and used in manufacturing all under the same roof. \n- Get more, higher quality printers and exponentially increase production. \n- Create some jobs! We'll likely be hiring someone to help automate the assembly line, someone to manage our print farm, and another position as well. \n- Get some awesome universal robots to help our staff do all the heavy lifting & repetitive processes quicker and safer.\n\n\nFinal Notes:\n\n2020 has been an extremely unpredictable year so far, and we have no idea what to expect with our fulfillment window extending into 2021. \n\nNo matter what happens though, you had our backs and we'll have yours. Expect frequent updates and reports from our founding team. Our goal is to be as transparent and authentic with our backers as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe Micro has a extremely durable build. You probably won't be dropping your garden a lot, but if you do, it'll survive the fall. \nThe Micro is easy to clean with some soap, water, and a sponge. Allowing you to use and re-use it year after year.\nReusability and recyclability\nWith a durable build of over 85% biodegradable & compostable material, the micro will last as long as you will. \nHowever, if for some reason it ends up in a landfill, the Micro will decompose in as little as 5 years, compared to some plastics that take decades to decompose.\nSustainable materials\nThe main material used in the creation of the Micro is derived from Vegetable starches, usually corn and sugar cane. It is renewable, sustainable, and helps use by-product from other industries that would have ended up in the landfill.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe're a vertically integrated startup. We understand that it makes it a lot more difficult but it allows us to control every step of the process. From the sourcing of north american made Bio-polymers to manufacturing & packing our own products. \nThis ensures that we operate ethically and remain environmentally friendly. Our manufacturing facilities are also optimized to reduce waste as much as possible, and recycle waste product to be reused wherever we can. All in house.\nSustainable Distribution\nAll our products are packaged in recyclable/compost-able material. We ensure the contents of the package are safe while minimizing material required. Boxes contain at least 10% recycled paper.\nSomething else\nThe very nature of our product is carbon negative.

The problem is fabric mask itself, regardless cotton or polyester made one, does not have the capability to filter small particles. On average, fabric masks can only filter up to 20% of the airborne particles in the air.\nIn plain word, fabric masks alone is not good enough. Filter is needed to add the filtering capability to fabric masks. However, filters comes with different sizes and shape, which means you might need to pair a specific mask to a specific filter. \nEarth Filter Solution\nEarth Filter is created to add filtering capability to your current fabric masks, or any fabric you are wearing. \nEvery Earth Filter is made with 4 layers of top quality filtering materials, which provide filtering ability to N95 standard.\nWith our patented pending Earth Filter tap design, the mask can easily attached to your current fabric masks and add filtering ability immediately.\nEasily Uplift Your Current Fabric Mask\nEven on scarf!!\nWe need your support - and we are offering a awesome launch deal on Kickstarter!\nTo make Earth filter possible commerically, we need your support to reach a reasonable scale for us to negotiate with suppliers.

The dimensions are as shown in the image below. You'll be able to choose the size when we send out the backer survey at the end of the campaign!\nREWARDS\nITERATIONS\nWe devoted all our time and effort developing Blocc over the past four months. Thanks to 3D-printing, we were able to create a number of prototype iterations, conduct extensive product testing, and refine every aspect of the design to ensure comfort, style, and functionality.\nHELP US SPREAD THE WORD!\nWe need your help to spread the word about Blocc. Feel free to use the materials in our press kit. Every post, share, and pledge counts!\nOUR STORY : HOW BLOCC WAS BORN\nThe three wise monkeys using Blocc\nOur team is based in South Korea\u2014one of the first countries to be hit hard by the pandemic.\nWe often noticed people wearing masks and habitually touching their face out in public. After looking into this further, we found that the average person subconsciously touches their face 23 times an hour (source: https://bit.ly/2APII4I) and that this is an innate habit very difficult to break. Therefore, it only seemed logical for us to create a face shield that would block (hence, the product name) the hand from touching the face. We noticed that some people had already been using them, but none of them seemed to look comfortable or well-designed. This is why we decided to make one ourselves\u2014one designed for the average person to wear in public without feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable.\nOur sincere hope is that Blocc will help you become wary of your face-touching habit. With your help, we can make Blocc a reality.\n As one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management, and more.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign is unique in that it began with us delving into a current, universal problem. We sincerely want to see people using Blocc ASAP, meaning we will not deviate from our published timeline and stay laser-focused on reaching the finish line as scheduled.\n\nWe have 6 years of experience in designing, testing, manufacturing, and shipping products globally. Therefore, we can say with confidence that we know the entire process from A to Z.\n\nHowever, no project is without risk, especially if it involves unexpected occurrences. Should a problem arise that may put us off track, we will make sure to fully brief you of the situation through the backer updates section, act promptly to solve it, and brief you again in detail of the outcome.\n\n\n\nRegarding refunds and cancellation\n\nKickstarter is not a store and it does not issue refunds. When you back a project, you\u2019re supporting a creator\u2019s right to try to make something new\u2014and agreeing to go along for the ride. For more information, please read Kickstarter\u2019s Terms of Use.\n\nIf the project is still live, you can cancel your pledge before it ends. However, once the project has ended, and collection has started, it is no longer possible to cancel your pledge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "1x Blocc -

The cards are made with materials from FSC certified sources. Components are printed with eco-friendly water-based ink and varnish. Our premium components are made from wood instead of plastic.

So from this point on, fulfillment progress will vary by location.\nFor North American Backers: The games are being loaded onto a boat called ATHOS, which will begin its long journey across the Pacific Ocean on November 18th. The ship should arrive at port on December 12. Then, the games will travel by truck to the distribution center, Funagain Logistics, in Indianapolis. Shipping to your house will likely begin in late-December."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 3171, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roadtoinfamy/canvas-2", "project_name": "Canvas"}}, {"backer": "Marco Lienhard", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " #Growfromhome Movement is here! \nPico will help you take your first steps into the magnificent world of growing plants. Easy and affordable, it ensures your plant journey is a success from the get-go. \n\nKnow Your Pico  \n\nAs seen on \nGrowing plants indoors around the year can be tough because they require lots of direct sunlight to thrive. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t carry sunlight around to make sure your plants get the energy they deserve.\nThanks to Pico's multi-spectrum LED grow lights, giving your plant enough light isn\u2019t a problem anymore; with it, you too can #GrowLikeaPro.\nPowered by high-performance power-efficient LEDs from OSRAM, Pico provides all the necessary wavelengths of light to replace the sun completely, and allow you to grow plants all year round.\nThese powerful LEDs are chosen to support a wide range of plants and each color wavelength stimulates a specific biological function in plants.\n The LEDs are mounted on an easily-adjustable telescopic arm\u2014because plants grow like crazy under our LEDs!      Reminiscent of a vintage radio antenna, it grows alongside your plants. As they extend upwards towards the light, extend Pico by up to a foot in height.\nPower Pico through any USB Type-C cable. Included with your Pico are 2 cables to get you started, a short double-ended USB-C and a 3 meter (10\u2019) super-long cable, along with magnetic organizer loops to help route the cable around fridges, windows or anything else magnetic. You may use any phone charger to power the Pico and the optional Pico-timer helps you automate it. \nThe Aluminum heatsink makes the LED module rigid and lightweight; it also helps the LED chips last longer through its excellent heat dissipation.   \nWith its USB Type-C ports on both sides, you can chain up to 3 Picos together with a regular phone charger. Or build yourself an indoor jungle with 6 Picos powered through a 5V 3A charger! Just connect cables to either side, and each Pico will accept and pass-through power to the next one.\n\nRegardless of how busy you are, Pico\u2019s watering system makes sure your plants have as much water as they need\u2014no more, no less\u2014to sustain their health and beauty. All you need to do is top-up once a week. \nWatering too little can kill your plants, but so can too much. Getting it right takes time and experience. Not many of us have it. With Pico, that\u2019s all taken care of for you!\nThe transparent window lets you know when it\u2019s time to top up, typically once a week. Employing just capillary action and gravity, this design does not require any power supply or involve a motor or pumps. Your plants will also grow quicker and healthier due to root oxygenation from below, provided by the ventilation holes.\nPlant pots take up space. They often can only be placed on flat surfaces by windows, which limits your options.\n With Pico, any place is a good place to grow some plants.\nWork desk? Check. Fridge? Check. Wall? Check. Glass window, bathroom or even in a vehicle? Check, Check, Check. \nAll 3 interchangeable mounts are included with your Pico.\nWhy several mounts?  Because when it comes to plants, you can't have too many and you might want them everywhere.\n\nAnywhere is a good place to grow!\nGrow anything you like \nNo seed pods or subscription is involved and hence no recurring costs! Choose any seeds or growing medium of your choice.\n\nPlants Make You Happy\nResearch has long suggested that indoor plants have a positive effect on the human mind and body. Studies show up to 60% reduction in depression, over 40% in anger, and just under 40% in anxiety. And at work, plants have increased the productivity of the office by up to 15%!\nPlants have been proven to improve motivation and concentration, increase energy levels and decrease fatigue. And thanks to the transpiration and evaporation of water from plants, they increase the air quality and improve eye strain and skin health, and reduce the spread of airborne diseases.\n\n\nFresh Herbs Right In Your Kitchen \nAlways wanted to have fresh edibles at hand? Imagine being able to throw your own homegrown, organic basil onto that bowl of pasta, or some fresh mint on your chicken. \nNo more runs to the store for that missing ingredient, having to wash the pesticides and chemicals off of your leafy greens.\nGrowing edible plants can be a challenge. And while the end result is often worth it, it is a commitment most people find difficult to make. With Pico, we made sure to get all variables just right, so you can grow your favorite herbs at home without a hassle.\n\nYes, it's tough choosing a color.\n\n\n Stretch Goals unlocked!!\n Pico tool design credits to Daksh Savla\n\nWhat\u2019s Included\nPico comes assembled and ready to grow. Just take it out of the box, add some soil and water, and a few of your favorite seeds. Plug it in and watch your plants thrive!   \n What\u2019s in the box\n 1X Pico (preassembled and ready to use)\n 1X Power cable (with magnetic cable organizer) (1 meter - 3' 3'')\n 1X Daisy Chain Cable (3 meters - 9' 10'')\n 3X Interchangeable mounts (magnetic, velcro, wall mount)\n\nWho we are?\n We're Altifarm Enverde, a startup based across the USA and India. We strive to offer a healthier and wholesome way of life to all. We believe in Your Right to Grow, Anywhere, Anytime.\nOur design team behind Pico\n Our first campaign was for Altifarm, which led us to switch from a Product Design studio into building home farming products. Altifarm is our flagship home farm with grow lights, greenhouse and mobility packs.\n Last year we launched Herbstation, a more sophisticated compact indoor farm. We've just completed fulfilment to our Kickstarter backers around the world.\nCompared to the other two, Pico is a tiny\u2014but only in size and not in ambition. Our goal with Pico is certainly big\u2014to bring as many people as possible into the fold of Urban Farming. Now anyone can connect with nature and #GrowlikeaPro!\nThis year, we took Pico to CES 2020. We were excited by all the attention\u2014no one could get enough of it!  \n\n Why Grow at home?  \nIs it possible for a Pico to grow enough to replace grocery shopping? Certainly not! \nWith our products Altifarm and Herbstation, we help people grow a substantial amount of fresh produce at home, with soil-based and soil-less methods. If anything, most items that are consumed fresh\u2014the ingredients for salads, smoothies, soup, garnish\u2014Altifarmers grow enough to meet a family's requirements when planned and rotated well\nWith Pico, our aim is to bring up the conversation around sustainable practices in food, and by participation, to have a greater appreciation for fresh produce among family members, including children. \nYou don't need fertilizers or pesticides when you grow your food at home\u2014no transportation, refrigeration, or even washing is required. And certainly, no single-use plastic packaging is involved.\n\n Timeline \nProduct Development \nFor business Inquiries: info@enverdeworld.com\nSay Hi to us: hello@enverdeworld.com \nPICO is fully managed by The Crowdfunding Formula (TCF), the biggest digital marketing team responsible for the top crowdfunding campaigns.

Unlike existing consumer masks, the B2 features a flexible, patent-pending facepiece that provides superior protection and comfort. The B2 is the culmination of 4+ years of design and development, and is now ready to be mass produced.\nAwards & Recognition\nWe are proud to announce that we've been selected as a PRI recipient from the Venn Foundation and as winners of the Protolabs Cool Idea Award. \nDrawbacks of Existing Masks\nEach of these mask types suffers from the following three issues.\nPoor face seals: Existing masks don't always achieve an adequate seal on the face, resulting in decreased protection [1]\nHigh waste and cost: N95 masks are intended to be changed regularly, which is inconvenient and expensive in many use cases\nScalability of manufacturing: Face masks cannot be produced fast enough to meet the demands of both the health care system and general public\nIs the B2 mask right for me?\nThe B2 Mask is designed to provide excellent protection to those who are most at risk from airborne contaminants, whether due to increased environmental exposure or preexisting conditions. People who may benefit from improved protection include:\n The B2 Mask is not recommended for those who need protection against oil-based particles or chemical vapors.\n B2 Mask: Superior Breathing Protection\nThe B2 Mask addresses the problems with existing masks and offers clear advantages over competitive options. These benefits include:\n Comfortable, Airtight Seal: Flexible facepiece achieves Fit Factor above 100\n High-Efficiency Filters: 99% protection from contaminants down to .1 micron\n Reduced Cost & Waste: Scalable filter technology reduces waste and cost\n Durable, Reusable Design: Easily cleanable design provides years of use\nPLAY\n\nComfortable, Airtight Seal\nThe B2's patent-pending facepiece provides excellent comfort and protection compared to existing face masks. The facepiece is constructed from FDA-approved materials, folds in half for easy storage, and can accommodate a wide range of face shapes and sizes because of its flex-hinge design.\nHigh-Efficiency Filters\nThe B2 Mask uses the latest advances in filter technology that provides 99% filtration against a range of airborne contaminants down to .1 micron.\n Particle Filtration Efficiency*: >99.5% at 32 LPM \u2013 tested according in accordance to TSI8130 NaCl .1 micron particle size\n* Due to supply chain shortages, our 1st generation filters will not include melt-blown polypropylene. This does not compromise filtration level except for extended use in industrial settings. Refer to the following section regarding filter change frequency.\nIn addition to providing stellar protection, the B2's filters are easy load with a simple twist-to-lock filter cap.\nReduced Filter Cost and Waste\nB2 Mask uses the smallest, most affordable high-efficiency filters on the market. During normal use, the B2 filters offer 40-50 hours of protection before filtration efficiency starts to drop. How often you change them filters depends on how you use your B2 Mask. See the recommendations below:\n Low use (occasional use while going out in public): Change every 2-3 weeks\n Medium use (wearing consistently over the course of a week): Change weekly\n High use (wearing for multiple hours a day):  Change daily for best protection\nEvery B2 comes pre-packaged with 10 filters, or five filter changes (2 filters/change). You can purchase additional filters at the end of the campaign starting at $14 or only $2.30/month for 6 months of protection for standard users.\nThe B2's filters are small and can be produced more rapidly than N95 masks. This means the B2 can scale to meet the demand of people around the world in search of high-quality breathing protection.\nDurable, Reusable Design\nThe B2 Mask is designed to provide years of comfortable, sustainable protection. The B2's facepiece is constructed from durable materials and is easy to clean by hand or in a dishwasher. The overlay can be cleaned by hand or in the washing machine for easy maintenance. \nTesting & Regulatory Details\nThe B2 Mask is designed to offer best-in-class protection for daily use. Our team is working with 3rd-party experts to test and validate the two critical facets of mask protection: filtration efficacy and anthropometric fit factor.\nFilter Testing \nWe've selected a high-efficiency, electrostatically charged filter media that removes >99% of particulate matter down to .1 micron. The material has been tested for particulate filtration efficiency at Superior Felt and Filtration and at Nelson Labs.\nFit Factor Testing\nA well maintained face seal is critical to achieving high levels of protection. Initial tests using the FDA-approved Portacount 8030 system showed the B2 Mask had an average Fit Factor over 100 - the level required for NIOSH certification. Breathe99 is partnering with leading human factors design firm Anthrotech to conduct additional face fit testing with 25 participants that fill the NIOSH panel for face shape and head size \nRegulatory Approval\nWe have designed the B2 Mask to comply with NIOSH N99 standards per 42 CFR Part 84, but the B2 Mask has not yet gone through the regulatory approval process with either NIOSH or the FDA. In the short term, Breathe99 will work to receive through the FDA to receive Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n A note for international backers: Due to longer shipping times, we anticipate you will receive B2 Mask in July (barring any unforeseen delays with international shipping).\nStretch Goals\nIt is through your support - both backing and sharing our campaign - that we can release additional colors for the B2, introduce a travel case, and bring a kids size B2 to market.\n $50k: Second color (Shipping in July/August)\n $100k: Third color (Shipping in July/August)\n $250k: Travel case\n $500k: B2 Mask - Kids Edition\n $750k: All backers gets 10 additional filters per mask for free\nNOTE: New colors for B2 Mask will ship in August due to additional lead-time for sourcing color-matched fabrics and plastic colorants.\nBreathe99: Yesterday\nThe idea for a protective, lightweight, and stylish mask first took shape almost 6 years ago, while Max - our CEO and mechanical engineer - was living in Singapore.\nSince then we've gone through hundreds of sketched concepts, several major prototype iterations, and validated our design with quantitative flow testing. The result is a design ready to ramp up in production very quickly and bring high-quality protection to people around the world.\nBreathe99: Today\nNow we\u2019re a group of engineers and designers with a passion for public health and technology. Our team has over 10 years of experience in the medical device industry, and our advisers add extensive knowledge and experience in product development, atmospheric science, and business strategy.\nMax Bock-Aronson - CEO, Mechanical Engineer\nColeman Rollins - Full-Stack Engineer\nJulia Duvall - Product Designer\nPrashan Subasinghe - Mechanical Engineer\nDerek Mathers -  Sales & Business Development\nEmma Gavala - Marketing & Business Development\nHealthy Together: The Breathe99 Mission\nOur mission is to make the highest quality public health products available to everyone. We believe that each of us plays a vital role in protecting our neighbors and communities, and that it is through collaborative action we can create a healthier, more equitable world. \nKey Partners\nWe've partnered with industry-leading experts in molding, filtration technology,  and soft goods design and production. Each of these key partners are based in the US and are either ISO 13485 or ISO 9001:2015 certified. Partnering with these businesses ensures we can ramp up quickly and deliver the highest quality product on-time to our backers.\nWe also have partnered with other leading groups including the Venn Foundation, Anthrotech, and Worrell Design to ensure we are achieving the highest of quality as we seek to further our social mission of making high-quality public health products available to all.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing & Overmold Complexity\n\nWhile the B2 mask is an incredibly simple product to use, the facepiece involves a complicated overmolding manufacturing process. Our design has been evaluated and approved by material and process experts, and our manufacturing partners are ISO 9001:2015 certified for quality management. Still, this does not eliminate the risks associated with transferring to manufacturing, especially with the speed with which we're trying to move.\n\nRegulatory Approval\n\nThe B2 Mask is not yet FDA or NIOSH approved. We have completed bench testing for all relevant aspects of the B2 Mask, yet there are still risks. We are committed to pursuing all relevant certifications - including N99 certification from NIOSH - but working through these certification processes can take time. In the meantime, Breathe99 will pursue the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n\nShipping & Logistics\n\nThe B2 Mask is a global product that needs a global distribution network. This is why we\u2019re partnering with established 3rd Party Logistics group with experience shipping to consumers around the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe B2 Mask is constructed from tough, durable materials to ensure years of daily use.\n\nAdditionally, we're working with ISO-certified manufacturing partners who will sample and test the B2 to guarantee the highest quality product.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe B2 reduces filter waste and associated packaging by as much as 50% compared to alternative options.\n\nWe are also committed to minimizing environmental impact throughout our supply chain, including the use of packaging made from recycled post-consumer waste.\nSustainable materials\nBreathe99 is committed to constructing the B2 Mask from sustainable materials whenever possible.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nAt Breathe99 we are committed to working with manufacturing partners who share our sustainable values.\nSustainable Distribution\nWhenever possible, we will offer carbon-neutral shipping to our users.

Our unique, patented, two-candles-in-one design started with the idea that you could create a candle without the wasted wax left over from burning traditional candles. The idea is simple. Why not move the wick from the center of the candle out to the outer edge? Now you\u2019re burning the side of the candle that normally ends up in the garbage. As the candle burns, the sides flow into the middle leaving you with a cozy, wood wick candle at the end.\nWe started Spiral Light in our garage in 2017.  The demand for candles has grown faster than we could ever have imagined possible. This leaves us with no choice but to seek out a new, larger facility and create custom machines to help make enough candles to keep up with demand.  This Kickstarter campaign means we don't need to \"sell out\" to investors or handcuff ourselves to big banks/venture capital firms. This enables us to continue focusing on independent retailers and resisting the demands to put our candles in big box stores or on Amazon. Don't get us wrong, we like our \"Prime\" too. We just also like shopping local and our candles give stores an exclusive product they can sell without fear of being undercut.\nTo find out more about us and to try some for yourself, click Back This Project. Or read on to hear more of our story.\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\n Unique Design:\nSpiral Light's unique design burns in a circle for the first three hours, filing in its hollow core. This is our \"Party Trick!\"\nLong Burning Time:\nWhen the hollow center is completely filled and the spiral portion burns out, you're left with a wood wick candle that you can enjoy for over 40 hours. That's the \"Real\" candle.\n Clean Burning: \nWhat's the recipe for a clean burning candle? It's a highly refined, food-grade, edible (please don't eat it) wax perfectly matched to the right sized, 100% cotton wick. It is phthalate-free scent oils mixed with vegetable-based colorants finished off with a locally sourced, softwood wick.\nGreat Scents:\nWe work hard to make sure every candle smells great. It starts with a bit of an obsession, add a little love and just a touch of family disagreement and voila, you have our candle scents. Seriously, we work with some of the best scent companies in the United States to bring you great smelling candles without the nasty chemicals.\nHandcrafted in the U.S.A\nUnlike a lot of candles, ours are all made in the United States from raw materials sourced right here in the U.S.  While we've been able to modify equipment to help us pour our candles faster, everyone of our candles is still hand-manufactured by our family and employees in our facility in Minnesota.\n\n\nWe could have just been happy that one of our candles actually worked and set off to make a million of them but we didn't.  We have three different sizes and burn times so that everyone can afford to try a Spiral Light and make them their favorite \"go-to\" gift item.\n\nWe can climb the highest mountain and scream out all the great things about Spiral Light Candles. But, in the end, we are only as good as what our backers think.  We know we have a great product that people will love but it sure is nice to see it in writing.\n\nLoyal to the Local Store\nIf we had a dollar for every time someone asked us when we are going to \"Sell out\" to the big candle industry or show up on Shark Tank, we wouldn't need to look for backers. We are driven to remain the champions of smaller, independent retailers across the Country. We can do this without investors, without big box stores and without Amazon. Just our family, our friends and our backers making a great product for great people.\nManufacturing Capacity\nOur Existing Factory  \nWhen we started this adventure just over two years ago, we took a huge leap of faith and built out our current 2,500 square feet manufacturing space and small retail store. While it served us well at the time, It's already too small.\n\nThe New Space\nThis is the new home of Spiral Light Candles. At almost 8,000 square feet, we now have the space necessary to grow.  We need your help to bring in the new equipment and hire the people that will help us keep up with the growing demand.\n\nNot sure how this whole Kickstarter thing works? Read on.\nTo help us get the new factory up and running, you must become a \"backer\" of this Kickstarter project. To do that, you pick a reward tier to support the campaign - you will essentially be pre-ordering one of our candles or candle packages. In exchange for your support, you will get a special backer discount and deals that will not be offered anywhere else. \nShipping is expected to start in September of 2020, and your payment/credit card will not be charged until the campaign is over, which is May 5th, 2020. \nIf you would like to add something additional to your reward that is not listed above, you can do so by using the Add-On Menu below. Any item (or combination of items) below can be added to your pledge by manually increasing your pledge amount after you choose a reward level. \nConfused? Send us a message - we would love to help!\n We hit our goal! Thanks to your amazing support we hit it in less than a week. Thank you so much.

The good news is we have been making these candles for well over two years. We don't need your help to make a candle, we need your help to grow into a national brand without selling out to the big box stores or venture capitalists. While the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has created a complicated environment for a lot of small businesses, we have managed to stay lean throughout our entire growth spurt. We do this by paying for everything we use upfront and we have managed to stay debt free through it all. We will survive and with your support we will use this time to grow stronger.\n \nYour help ensures that we can grow to meet the demand necessary to stay independent and to continue to sell our super cool candles through independent retailers without the need to sell out. \n\nA lot of Kickstarter projects get tripped up during the shipping and fulfillment stage.

We do however get our long burn time by utilizing an extremely hard wax.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur unique candle design was invented with very idea that we could completely use all the wax that is normally wasted in a traditional candle. When burned correctly there should be nothing to throw away except a tiny sliver of wax and a recyclable steel clip. With no jar, there is no glass to dispose of and the light-weight, hollow design means our shipping impact is less than half of traditional candles.\n\nWe package all our candles in recyclable kraft paper boxes and ship only using starch based packing peanuts and 100% recyclable shipping boxes.\nSustainable materials\nOur packaging is manufactured from recycled kraft paper. Our wax is a food grade, edible wax (please don't eat it). We use 100% sustainable cotton and softwood wicks. Our scent oils and vegetable based colorants contain no toxins nor California Prop 65 components providing a very clean burning final product.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nOur new space uses LED lighting and a brand new and efficient heating and cooling system. We work very hard to keep our footprint as small as possible.\nSustainable Distribution\nOur light-weight, hollow design means our shipping impact is less than half of traditional candles.

According to these reports, viruses have been known to spread through fecal matter.\nUltraviolet (UV) light is lethal to germs acting like silver bullets to these tiny monsters.\nWhy? UV light scrambles the DNA deep within microbes like bacteria, killing them almost instantly. It\u2019s quick. It\u2019s easy. It\u2019s clean. And, best of all, this superpower now comes built into your toothbrush.\nAfter each use, Lumio kills 99.9% of germs using UV light technology. \nA single touch of a button and your brush head will be sparkling clean, thanks to the miracle of science.\nThe best part? You don\u2019t even have to think about it. We designed Lumio for people as lazy as we are. Lumio self-cleans automatically once retracted. Speaking of which\u2026\nLumio is the ultimate travel toothbrush because of its snazzy retractable head. Now it\u2019s easy to keep your brush head clean and protected! Lumio is an electric toothbrush made for those on the move.\nNo more ziplock bags. No more bulky toothbrush cases. \nTravelling is now light and simple.\nNo need to fret over toiletry bags or cases. Just toss it in your bag before you head out and you\u2019re good to go.\nBuilt for modern travellers, with speed and convenience in mind. Stay clean on the go. \nWe'll just say it: we love Apple's product design. That's why we created Lumio with a fully anodized aluminum shell - just like the iPhone and Macbook Pro.\nWith its clean, minimalist aesthetics, Lumio will feel right at home alongside the necessities of your modern lifestyle.\nLumio's high-quality aluminum build means it's bash-proof and dent-resistant, but also as light as other leading electronic toothbrushes.\nLumio is like a handsome viking bodyguard - rugged yet beautiful and ready to follow you anywhere, on any adventure.\nMermaids rejoice! Lumio is waterproof with its IPX7 water resistance rating.\nThat means Lumio can be safely submerged under water at a depth of 1 meter for 30 minutes and be completely undamaged. We're not sure why you'd do that, but we thought we'd give you the option anyway.\nLumio's battery lasts up to 2 weeks without needing to be recharged, making it perfect for travellers. It also comes charged right out of the box so you can get started living your new, cleaner life right away.\nAdditionally, Lumio's charger is small and discrete, so it will take up less space on your countertop compared to other toothbrush chargers.\nLumio cleans using ultra-sonic cleaning technology, meaning you\u2019ll get that icy white smile every time you use it. Each bristle vibrates at an ultrasonic frequency, destroying plaque like a hot knife through butter. \nLumio is a modern, first-class electric toothbrush with 3 cleaning modes that automatically turn off after 2 minutes:\n Clean Mode | A soft and steady vibration for daily cleaning (280 Hertz, with 33,600 vibrations/min)\n Whitening Mode | The vibration will alternate between fast and slow speed, polishing those pearly whites (250-300 Hertz, with 33,000 vibrations/min)\n Deep Clean Mode | A fast vibration to use when there\u2019s something stuck in your teeth (300 Hertz, with 36,000 vibrations/min)\nLumio brush heads are made with industry leading DuPont nylon bristles. We have placed each bristle in a way that optimizes both ultrasonic cleaning and the UV self-clean function - meaning both your smile and your brush will be clean & germ free! \nWhereas other toothbrush companies charge upwards of $20 for a pack of 3 and provide only 1 brush head with the toothbrush - we include 3 brush heads with Lumio.\nNot only that, but extra packs of brush heads are available for as low as $2.08 per head.\nWant to add more brush heads to your reward? Simply add $7 per 3-pack of brush heads to your total pledge price. Later, we\u2019ll send you an email to confirm bristle type (soft or medium), color and add-ons.\nIn the future, we\u2019ll have the brush heads available on Amazon, but for a higher price\u2026so stock up now!\nBACKING | Want to get your hands on a Lumio Brush?

Follow along with all our production news and updates at www.moft.us    \nPeople invented various sit-stand desks since many years ago. But these desks didn\u2019t change much more so far. They usually come with a bulky size and limited by the workspace environment. And some with cumbersome setup may let you go crazy.\nTo make people get a flexible posture wherever they are, we realized we\u2019d have to come up with the most convenient sit-stand desk ever.\nMOFT Z is a truly lightweight and versatile sit-stand desk at an affordable price. It\u2019s designed to offer THE HEAVEY LAPTOP USER a maximum comfort with maximum freedom on location.\n\nA Magazine-sized Desk with 4 Positions\nWith the origami-inspired Z structure, MOFT Z provides one mode for standing and three-mode for sitting.  It helps you develop a healthy sit-stand working posture in the easiest way, keeping you active and productive all day.\nWorking From Home with Right Postures\nThe ultra-versatile yet like a paper-thin desk body makes it friendly to any working environment, not only to be used in the office but also at home or co-workspace.  \nWe designed MOFT Z with a continuous one-piece structure. No tool is needed for setup. Stand it up easily when you need it, and unfold it back quickly when you don\u2019t.\nAll foldings finished in one structure\nMost people usually only want to take a short standing, not a giant stand on the desk all day long. As the same size as a magazine, you can store MOFT Z in any corner you like. Keep it \"invisible\" on your desk. So you won\u2019t notice it when you don\u2019t need it.\nIt follows the consistent design philosophy of MOFT: unseen, unfelt, unnoticed. \nCan you find it? Guess where am I\nSmooth & swift transition between postures\nMOFT Z is a fast-blade to open and close. It quickly switches your sit and stand posture and takes the stress off your back in seconds, letting you get a joyful and relaxing posture.\nSitting all day in the office can be stressful to both your body and mind. A quick switch to standing not only helps you stretch a bit for a relaxing back, but also refreshes your mind with a different angle to see your works.\nStanding Mode\nWhen you are standing, MOFT Z offers a natural height for your palms to rest onto the laptop, and your eyes to look at the screen with no strain or tension.\nSitting Mode\nSurely, you would want to sit back after a short break. Does MOFT Z stopped working by then? Absolutely not. We also prepared three modes to fit your own working style while sitting.\nDedicated flap limiter to stop your laptop from sliding.\n\n\n\n\nThe light-weight body foldable design makes MOFT Z the ONLY sit-stand desk that you can use on your laps.\nUsing MOFT Z on the laps\nWe didn't trade thinness for durability. Apart from the rock-steady Z structure and tri-angle bottom support, We used the fibre-glass to ensure the toughness of panels and a maximum of 22-lbs weight.\nSteady typing in the air\nThe magnetic flap to reinforce the frame, and the PU material to shield all the scratches and heat, while keeping everything soft and premium to touch.\nAs thin and light as it is, you can always take MOFT Z away like grabbing a magazine and work anywhere you feel like, in anyway you feel right.\nYou would never see a desk at the size of an iPad Pro. MOFT Z stays perfectly in your backpack. You can have a flexible working setup anywhere you go like never before.\nTo complete a product is not simply fixing the structure, we want you to feel good even if you aren't actually using it. The vast coverage of PU material makes everywhere you touch feels soft and smooth to your hands.\nThe color on the back not only adds an energetic vibe to your desktop, but also works as an indicator of how you act & use the product.\nA reliable structure also needs to fight the test of time, all corners and folding lines were reinforced to make sure you can always keep using it without wearing or tearing.\nMOFT always aim to make products that all people can buy without having to worry about the steep price. A good design should be everyone\u2019s design. \n\n\n\nPLAY\n\n$500K Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nWe would like to share some cool things: MOFT Z has been honored with the Red Dot Award Product Design 2020! And the 500K Stretch Goal was unbelievably reached, which means that the MOFT Z Leather Black is officially unlocked!\n\nWe found three biggest problems that other products have had: They were too big & heavy for such short time standing; They usually took even longer to store than the already tedious installment; They would still be there even if you don\u2019t want to use them again.  \nAnd we got three answers as well: Small & thin enough to help you forget it\u2019s there\uff1b Fast & easy to use just to save time; Disappear when you are done using it.\nBut a desk is much smaller & cramped than a room, which means we must shrink the size of a chair all the way back while keeping the same rigidity & stability.\nWe then chose fibre-glass as the basic structure for its toughness and flexibility\u2014it restores most deformation under 60\u00b0 foldings, much stronger than usual paper structure. It\u2019s a more expensive material, but it\u2019s more durable for the price. \nTo enhance the basic structure support, we also used 11 built-in magnets between joints to make it even stronger, and snappier when you fold it back and forth.\n\nPeople would still sit down after a standing break, that\u2019s why we must keep the triple angles for sitting position, offering much better usability than a usual standing desk.  \nTo wrap things up, we need to make it aesthetically minimalistic so that it looks and feels just like a MOFT product.\n\n\n\n\nMOFT=Mobile Office For Travelers.\nWe are a team dedicated to design & create products to help digital nomads to work better, healthier, more energized and focused.\nIn 2019 we have launched MOFT Stand and MOFT X Series, receiving hundreds of thousands of support from all around the world, and a whopping $3.2million+ sales throughout the year, making them one of the best-selling stands on the market.\nAnd now we are proud to announce that MOFT Stand has won the iF Design Award!\nThis time, we bring MOFT Z sit-stand laptop desk to you. We hope that all our research, work and creativity has produced a product that will make your office working better.

This is not a toy for children!  Keep out of reach.  Suggested for ages 15 and up. \nCoil, snap, uncoil, repeat. During our brainstorming sessions we could not put SuperCalla down.

We quickly realized that we were fidgeting with our cables for fun as much as they were charging our devices.  We cannot wait to see all the designs our supporters come up with!  Please keep in mind, this product is not only plugged into an outlet when charging, it contains magnets as well.  Please be cautious and keep out of reach of children.

The shipping charges shown are the estimated TOTAL amount you will be charged.  It is NOT a per cable charge. \nOur team researched charging cable standards and what goes into the same cables that come with your devices.  Not so we could duplicate them, but so we could make them better!  We tested hundreds of cables, connection types, magnets and silicone tubes ensuring our cables have superior quality while meeting USB requirements and international safety certifications. \n\u26a1Functionality is key to our patent pending product.

The top finial also features fine knurled details on the outside.\nThe standard stainless steel nib can also be upgraded to a titanium flex nib for an extra \u00a345.\nBronze pens are very hard to find and usually very expensive, which makes the Naos a great opportunity to add one to your collection. Every single part of the pen except the nib has been machined from CuSn8 bronze, the same grade used in high-end watch cases. This material is very heavy and will form an attractive patina with age. \nWe use only the best nibs, manufactured by Peter Bock in Germany. The Naos uses Bock 250 which is a large nib with a 6mm feed, commonly known as a #6 nib.\nYou can add additional nibs to your pledge. Your pen comes with a steel nib, but you can upgrade to more flexible material like titanium for greater line variation. The nibs use a screw-in assembly so you don't need any tools to change them.\nEach material has a different character. Titanium has significant flex (considered a semi-flex nib). Steel is very smooth but provides little flex.\nStainless Steel sizes:  EF, F, M, B.\nTitanium: EF, M\nTitanium Flex Nib - EF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Naos fountain pen can be used with international standard cartridges (short or long) or a refillable cartridge called a \"converter\" which has a piston mechanism inside to draw ink up through the nib.\n\nAs explained above, you can transform your Naos fountain pen into a rollerball and vice versa by changing its grip section (extra grip section required, add \u00a310 to your pledge). \nThe rollerball refill provided is the Schmidt 5888F in black with a fine tip, a very smooth writer that uses water-based ink which, unlike ballpoints, requires very little pressure to write. This reduces fatigue and cramping during writing sessions.\n\nKeep your pen safe with our custom sleeves which are made by hand from high quality leather that has gone through the natural process of vegetable tanning.\nSimply add \u00a310 to your pledge.\n\nYou can choose options like colour, fountain pen/rollerball, and nib size in a survey that you will receive at the end of the campaign.\nInterested in multiple pens? Pledge for a set and save more!\n\n\nWant to add extra pens? Apart from the sets we offer, you can add extra pens to your reward simply by adding the following amounts to your pledge:\nTo have two writing instruments in one, just add \u00a310 to your pledge to get one rollerball grip section with a Schmidt refill.\nAdd the following amounts to your pledge. The accessories will also be available to add in the survey at the end of the campaign.\n\n\nNamisu was founded by Adrien Cols and Maria Millan, two fountain pen enthusiasts and designers based in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have completed five large writing instrument projects over the past 5 years on Kickstarter and we will use this experience to successfully deliver your pledge.\n\nThroughout this time, we have developed strong relationships with experienced manufacturers which is crucial to delivering a high quality product. We are using similar manufacturing techniques as our previous five projects and have developed a production prototype to validate the feasibility of the design.\n\nWe know that there can always be some unexpected delays during production but we have planned for this and extended our production schedule accordingly. Raw materials like metal rods can arrive late during busy periods of the year; machines can break down and require servicing. These are minor delays that may require a small extension to the delivery date of the project, but which wouldn't affect our ability to deliver the project.\n\nAnother common challenge is fulfilling a project that exceeds its project funding goal significantly. To solve this potential issue we are working with large manufacturers that can produce our pens in any quantity realistically possible on Kickstarter. We do not anticipate any extension of the delivery date unless the project exceeds 2000 backers, at which point we would need to revise the manufacturing completion target date.\n\nWe are also working with a professional logistics and fulfilment company which will handle all shipping and packing operations to avoid any delays during the shipping phase of the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a339 or more", "title": "Naos Aluminium -

It\u2019s a new take on toilet cleaning. Every other object in your bathroom has modernised, become more convenient and more hygienic, except the toilet brush! \nThe design of the toilet brush has remained the same since the invention of the modern toilet, and most of us keep them within 1 meter of our toothbrushes.\nThis really has to change. The FlushBrush brings toilet cleaning into the 21st century.\n\nYou asked and I listened! Now we've hit \u00a350k in funding the DARK GREY FlushBrush will be available to choose during the address survey at the end of the campaign! \nFor backers ordering multiple units, you'll be able to decide on the colour for each of them between white and dark grey. \nThe FlushBrush is more hygienic in three key ways. \nThe silicone head repels water and waste, unlike bristled brushes. \nThe head is stored inside the toilet, with water passing over it with every flush; nothing that touches the inside of the toilet ever leaves the toilet. \nThe head can be replaced whenever you want to, making it easier to maintain your standard of cleanliness in the bathroom. \nTo use the FlushBrush, just pick up the handle from the base, push to connect the head in the cradle and lift it out to start cleaning. When you\u2019re done, position the head back into the cradle, and pull back on the handle trigger to release the head. The cradle has a magnet in it to keep the head secure. Replace the handle in the base and job done!\nTo install the FlushBrush in your bathroom, lift the toilet lid and position the cradle tightly under the rim of the toilet to ensure maximum water coverage. Once the forks of the cradle are tightly under the rim, fold back the flexible aluminium strip around your toilet bowl, moulding the FlushBrush cradle into place to perfectly fit your toilet. \nThe FlushBrush cleaning head is stored discreetly underneath the flow of water, cleaning the head with each flush. As you routinely use your toilet, the water passing over it will dislodge anything that wasn\u2019t repelled by the silicone cleaning surface, and the regular flows of water will prevent bacteria buildup by flushing the whole system each time you use the toilet.\nFlushBrush's silicone cleaning head repels water and dirt, and has been specifically designed to avoid having any dirt traps. Silicone is an extremely hydrophobic material, meaning water and dirty substances can hardly stick to it \u2013 it\u2019s often used in high quality cooking and medical tools to ensure the highest standards of hygiene. \nThis makes silicone the perfect material for FlushBrush's cleaning head.\nFlushBrush\u2019s handle only ever makes indirect contact with the inside of the toilet bowl. Anything that makes direct contact with waste stays inside the bowl, and is rinsed with fresh water every time you flush. No transferring of dripping toilet juices from bowl to holder like with a traditional toilet brush.\nWe\u2019ve heard stories of children and dogs running around the house waving toilet brushes, spreading germs and bleach all over the home. With FlushBrush, you can store the handle out of reach, and even if someone does get hold of it, you can be sure it\u2019s never made direct contact with the inside of the bowl. In addition, there\u2019s no need to routinely sterilise the handle in bleach, so there\u2019s no risk that anyone will spill a pot of chemicals (and poo!) over the floor of your bathroom...\nFlushBrush saves water. The silicone head is cleaned routinely during normal use of your toilet, so there\u2019s no need to flush especially to clean (as you might with a bristled brush). With each toilet flush using an average of 1.6gallons/6 litres of water, saving on those unnecessary flushes will really add up.\nFlushBrush saves on chemical usage. Traditional bristled brushed need to be regularly disinfected with bleach, which is flushed down drains and into the environment. FlushBrush uses the water already flowing over it to stay clean, reducing the need for disinfecting chemicals.\nFlushBrush wastes less plastic. When you want to change your bristled toilet brush, you need to throw away the whole thing - at least 100g of plastic straight into the bin. With FlushBrush, only the cleaning head needs occasional replacing, and it weighs just 2g of plastic. This means you can still maintain your standards of hygiene without all the unnecessary waste. \nWith FlushBrush, the only part stored outside of the toilet is the handle itself. Each reward tier comes with a free floor base stand, and we will make a wall bracket an option for all backers to add to their order once the campaign ends if we reach \u00a3100k!\nI first had the idea for FlushBrush in 2017 after \u201cinheriting\u201d a second hand toilet brush when I moved into a new apartment. I then began discussing with my roommate why we used such a disgusting and old fashioned tool for cleaning the toilet...\nA lot of thinking, testing and hard work later, we had the first prototype. I took it to a bathroom trade show Birmingham (UK) in March 2018, and spent 3 days talking to bathroom experts. At the show, I realised there were major improvements I could make to the design, and so it was back to work. \nFootage: BBC Dragons Den. Series 17 - Episode 1 (2019)\nAt that show, someone suggested that I should apply for Dragons\u2019 Den. I did, and thought nothing more of it. Development continued through our second and third prototypes, each an improvement on the last, but progress was slow as all the design work was funded just by me. Then, by February of 2019, I found myself auditioning for Dragons\u2019 Den with my fifth prototype. I never thought it would happen, but I was selected to film with just four weeks\u2019 notice. \nTogether, with my amazing design team, we pushed through a few more versions, making final tweaks to ensure everything was ready for me to appear on TV. Dragons\u2019 Den was a success, and I secured two offers from Sara Davies and Touker Souleyman. As many of you may know, not all projects that are funded on TV make it all the way, and ultimately launching a Kickstarter to get the FlushBrush directly into the homes of those that want it most was the best route to take. Since filming the show last year, I have made further design improvements, and am now ready to make FlushBrush a reality with your help. \nAfter almost 3 years since I first started working on the idea, I couldn't be more excited to begin the next stage with all of you aboard! \nClick to download the FlushBrush Press Kit\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7345037/Entrepreneur-TVs-Dragons-Den-unveil-UKs-self-cleaning-loo-device.html\nhttps://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/17889434.dragons-39-den-inventor-tom-keen-toilet-39-flush-brush-39/\nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dragons-den-review-new-dragon-sara-davies-was-feeling-flush-wr2jbpbvh\nhttps://www.realitytitbit.com/bbc/dragons-den/how-to-buy-the-toilet-flush-brush-from-dragons-den-episode-1 \n ^ An early FlushBrush demo video to round off the campaign.

We have been through many different iterations of the design and only have a small amount of tweaks to make ahead of tooling and mass production. In the weeks that follow the campaign, these small changes will take place and you'll be kept up to date on the progress every step of the way. \n\nAs you'd expect, we have our factory partners already lined up and ready to be given the green light, and from there production can get underway. There is always a risk that these partners fall through, so we have backups of everything in place and more than enough time in the delivery window to address any issues. As a backer of this campaign, you'll be notified during each manufacturing milestone of the FlushBrush!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWhile the cleaning head may need to be replaced periodically to maintain hygiene standards, all other parts of the FlushBrush are designed to last.

We design and make cool EDC products. After the success of YSMART 1.0 with 2500+ backers and over 8000 products fulfilled, we received a heap of great feedback.  Now we are glad to be back with our Kickstarter #3.\nMeet YSMART 2.0: The Magnetic Quick-Release Flashlight for Everyday Carry. \nThe \u201cPop-to-Light\u201d solution provides an extremely convenient, easy, fast way to use when you need light in a big hurry. The upgraded version is smallest, lightest,  brightest, more durable, and more convenient than ever before.\nSometimes you just need a strong light, fast. With YSMART 2.0 you get a handy, EDC flashlight that you can take it with you anywhere, and light up anything in an instant.\nNo more searching blindly around in the dark or fumbling around to unlock your flashlight. We\u2019ve done away with the need to twist your flashlight to turn it on/off. YSMART 2.0 provides a magnetic quick-release solution. Simply pull it off your keychain then the flashlight turns on immediately.  \nNever worry about accidentally disconnecting your YSMART2.0. Featuring a powerful magnet with 2.5kg/4.8lb of pulling force, you can place it anywhere without worrying about it falling off. \nExtending the light\u2019s functionality, the magnet can be attached to metal surfaces for hands-free. \n\nWith YSMART2.0, we\u2019ve created our most powerful micro flashlight yet. You get 100 lumens packed into a tiny, robust design.\nWe wanted to do better than the already-stunning original YSMART 1.0, so we upgraded our equipment to feature a state-of-the-art SUPER THIN SMD LED module, which offers maximum output for minimum energy consumption.\nYSMART 2.0 is small enough to carry wherever you go. WOW! Your sports bag, your jacket, and even attach to your keychain. Perfect match for any indoor or outdoor activities. It\u2019s in-interesting that your buddy finds out you\u2019re carrying such a mini but functional cool stuff.\n\n\nThis amazing design is made of signature black aerospace aluminum or solid ultra -tough titanium. YSMART 2.0 not only looks great, but is practically unbreakable.  \nThe main piece of feedback we received from YSMART 1.0 was that the flashlight itself has a magnetic base, but you need to twist it to turn it on and off\u2014so while practical and useful, at times it wasn\u2019t as convenient as it could be.  \nSo, we went back to the drawing board to determine how we could provide a solution to this feedback. How could we improve on YSMART 1.0 ? Make it easy to detach, with automatic on/off! And so, the YSMART 2.0 quick-release auto-lighting mechanism was born. We spent a year on research and development, refining our designs until we landed on the design you see today.\nSPECIFICATIONS\nWeight: Titanium- 12g / Aluminum- 8g\n Width: 1cm Length: 3cm \nMaterials: Premium Aerospace Grade Aluminum Alloy / Grade 5 Titanium \nBattery: LR41/AG3 Button Cell \uff08NOT INCLUDE\uff09\nType of Bulb: Micro SMD LED 2.0\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life.

Sometimes we ignore it, sometimes we cherish it. \nBut why is sound so important?\nWe spend everyday hearing and listening, it is part of our lives.  Sound is influential, it can be informative, educational, conclusive, emotive, and many other things for us.\nThe problem is people remember only 30% of what they hear. Smartphones can do the \u2018work\u2019, they are certainly not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSo why not try the better solution?\nBorn from a team of researchers and engineers who spend many hours in front of a computer, TileRec is our constant reminder to take a walk and \"stop and smell the roses\", so to speak.\nWe designed TileRec to exceed even our own extremely high personal standards.  \n\n Thin: Only 1/4 inch thin. Fits easily in the slimmest wallets.\n Small: As small as a piece of a chocolate bar ( 2.48 square inch).\n Light:  The same weight as a US penny (0.5 oz).\n Simple: Simple everything! Easy to use, easy to recharge and easy to playback.\n Long-lasting Battery: 24 hours on one charge. Designed to be used the entire day.\n Surround Recording: 360 degrees recording in a 15 feet range. Meeting, lecture or simple discussion - all sounds are easily captured with HQ clarity.\n Resistant: 100% recycled aluminum casing. Sleek design that blends discreetly in the everyday setup.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 1.6 inch in length, and 1/4 inch in height, weighing only 0.5 oz nothing else on the market comes close with the discreet portability offered by TileRec.  \nTileRec is so slim and small than it can fit almost anywhere you can think of. It blends discreetly with everyday objects - in your pocket or wallet, between the pages of an agenda, on your desk or even on your child's backpack.\nTraditional voice recorders were bulky and uncomfortable, limiting day-to-day activities.   \nThe idea of a voice recorder so slim and thin that it can be used as a  personal assistant is to improve the daily productivity of its user. And is practically indestructible.\nYou can drop it, step on it, even run the car over and then resume recording. \nThe aluminum casing ensures complete protection for worry-free use.\nWhen you combine these benefits with excellent audio quality, you get a voice recorder that is perfect for lectures, interviews, meetings, and dictations too! \nMost smartphones have a built-in voice recorder app that you can use anytime, so they can do the \u2018work\u2019, but certainly are not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSmall, discreet and efficient, Tilerec is the latest voice recorder designed by ATTO DIGITAL, created to encompass the ideal balance between form and function. \nSo, what makes TileRec so superior to smartphones when it comes to recording?  \nTileRec is perfect for anyone that wants to work simpler, faster and better \u2013 without compromising quality. \nTileRec is recording Hi-Q MP3, using a 128 kbps bit rate. You can choose to set it to record in continuous mode or in voice-activated mode to capture sounds in a 15 feet range (360 degrees).\nIn voice-activated mode, the ultra-performant sensor of the microphone will initiate ad start recording only when sounds are detected in the range of the recorder (15 feet) thus avoiding recording long silent periods and saving memory time.\nThe built-in Li-Po 3.7 V battery (240 mAh) needs only 1.5 hours to fully charge (DC IN 5 V 500mA), even when connected to a computer and will be up and running for more than 24 hours.\nRecord the entire day then just plug & play all your recordings. \n*no additional software needed\n TileRec can also record while charging so you will not miss any information that matters to you.\nLet\u2019s get nostalgic for a hot second. Reflect on a childhood memory, recalling an exact time or event \u2014 what you were wearing, who you were with, the sights, smells, tastes. Try to remember how you felt, specific noises like, I don\u2019t know, shrilling crickets layered under siblings\u2019 laughter or, the sound of your mother's voice.\nIt\u2019s difficult, right? Unless the event was recorded, the memory is likely pretty hazy.  \nTileRec is designed to record your daily meetings, activities, and ideas in a non-intrusive way and carries our belief that \u201cwear-ability\u201d is the utmost goal in the design of everyday carry technology. \nYou live in a fast-paced world where TIME is MONEY and you are searching for the best tool to improve productivity and save time?  \n Here are  some situations  TileRec can help you with:  \nThe perfect solution for professional use\nLawyers may use them to take voice notes while preparing cases, while criminal investigators record digital notes in the field, and doctors use it to record important info about cases. If you make a living in one of these fields, you may find a portable voice recorder invaluable.  \nUsing a voice recorder has never been easier. \nSo why not take the leap into the digital era? Stop wasting time and paper trying to keep track of all the information. \nJust slide one button to record and enjoy the Tilerec experience.\nUse the USB cord to connect your TileRec to any computer and select the audio file you need to playback.  It's just that simple: \nPLAY\n\nCheck on Soundcloud the audio sample recorder with TileRec.\nThe Li-Po built-in battery of TileRec is re-chargeable for more than 1000 charging cycles. It takes only 1.5 hours to fully charge the battery, then it can record continuously or in voice-activated mode, for more than 24 hours. \nHave you ever wondered how much paper we use yearly? \nAmericans use 85,000,000 tons of paper a year; about 680 pounds per person. The average household throws away 13,000 separate pieces of paper each year. \nUsing TileRec for your daily notes and meetings saves time, effort and also 1 tree/ person/ year from becoming paper. \nAll this while increasing productivity, saving time and keeping all your information organized with time and date stamp!\n\n Find a reward that works for you and your family, office or team, there's something for everyone.  We are particularly excited to offer fast shipping in the US and EU.\n This is ATTO DIGITAL's  2nd product launched via crowdfunding.  We always deliver. We've learned a ton over our first Kickstarter, helping develop a good sense of our capabilities and timeline.\nThe satisfaction of our users is paramount!\nThat is why we want to make sure that when you enter the ATTO  family you feel the care and support.\nOur Customer Service team is  24/7 available to offer support in more than 5 languages. And because we really do believe in the manufacturing quality of our recorders, we offer lifetime warranty for TileRec.\nWe, the ATTO DIGITAL team, have more than 10 years of combined experience in designing, producing and selling sound recorders and surveillance equipment.\nDownload Press Kit \nOur mission and passion are to listen, so it is also paramount for us to listen to our customers' feedback to better understand how the ideal mini voice recorder should be. \n Our team is ready - so is the manufacturing - now we just need you! \nIt has been a long adventure. From brainstorming to product design, engineering, and branding, it has been a trying, monumental amount of time, conviction and expertise.\nIt has been a stressful, exciting and thrilling experience to design a product from scratch. We want you to be part of our experience! \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working non-stop the for last 3 years developing this product and we feel that the amount we are trying to raise is realistic with what is needed for fulfilling the project. We know that the Kickstarter journey is a long one and that there might be several surprises along the way - including foul weather, or maybe even (shock!) our phones running out of battery.\n\nUnfortunately, there are always risks involved in getting a product from the prototype phase to the market, but we have done everything possible to minimize these risks for our backers. Extensive planning has gone into the costs needed for raw materials, labor and shipping and we feel confident we will be able to meet our outlined delivery goals.\n\nOur biggest challenge is the timely delivery of all of our components. In order to keep TileRec at such a small size, parts must be assembled simultaneously, meaning if one shipment gets delayed, our entire process may get slowed down. Hopefully, everything goes according to plan, but if not, we have multiple suppliers for each component, always ready with a plan B!\n\nThe second biggest concern is quality control. While we are using the best manufacturer in China who was the previous supplier for one of the top international consumer electronic brands, we need to inspect each TileRec to guarantee 100% satisfaction. This dedication to detail is time-consuming, yet necessary to ensure a quality product.\n\nWe promise to keep all of our backers informed if anything happens or our timeline changes! If we encounter anything that might affect the product, its development, and/or shipping date, we will make sure to notify you about it with frequent updates. This project is our #1 priority and we will do everything we can to bring the TileRec to its full potential.\n\n_\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe TileRec has a rechargeable battery that lasts more than 1000 charging cycles.

And that we throw 8 million tons of plastic waste every year into our oceans?\nPlastic situation in the ocean\nGravity Wave is a project created by young social entrepreneurs that have decided to act so that the numbers you just read start decreasing.\nGravity Wave team: Norberto, Amaia y Julen\nWe want to change how things work for good and we have a very clear objective: Empty ALL the plastic from the Mediterranean Sea. Not only we want to recollect it, but we want to transform that waste into valuable products.\nTwo years ago we founded our first phone accessories company. We were producing phone cases, ring holders, USB\u2026 and all of our products were made out of plastic. We realised that in the smartphone industry everything gets outdated very fast and especially phone cases, 1 billion units that are thrown away every year because of this (some of them even inside their plastic packaging!) We took the decision of turn the whole business around. How could we be contributing to this negative impact on our lovely planet?  \nPlastic recycling\nWe realised that oceans are full of plastic (8 million tons end up there every year) and it is causing the whole marine ecosystem to collapse. We started thinking about solutions, and how we could collect all this plastic waste, as 70% is at the bottom of the ocean and we do not have the resources to remove it. Moreover, thousands of species are dying because of this.\nImpact of plastic waste in animals\nWe needed people that had the knowledge and the way\u2026 Of course, the fishermen! We then spoke with some of them and realised that every day they collected marine litter but didn\u2019t know what to do with it, and that's when we met our now partner Lefteris Arapakis, founder of Enaleia, a sustainable fishing school that has been operating for more than 3 years in Athens, Greece, where they show local fishermen how to collect waste from the sea. When they go out to fish, they dedicate part of their time to fish plastic waste and afterward they bring it back to the harbour and drop it in our containers. We then pay them for every KG they extract and we take care of the rest of the process. \nWe already have more than 130 boats in Greece which are now called #plasticfishers and have collected over 50 tons of marine litter! Along 2020 we are will start to work with the fishermen in Italy and Spain so we can continue cleaning the Mediterranean Sea.\nSo far we take care of the collection and supply, but how do we transform it? We started working hand in hand with Crazy & Things, our partners in Spain, who have been creating, developing and patenting products for more than 10 years. Recently they created Tecnikoa 3D filaments, a project focused on developing and producing 3D filaments. We had been working together in our previous mobile phone accessories company for a long time developing products, and at that time we decided to go one step further becoming partners of Gravity Wave S.L.\nTogether we got the recycling factory in Alicante, where we select, clean and cut into small pieces that are ready to be reused for creating new products. We then send it to the Crazy & Things factory (also in Alicante), where we produce 3D filament and smartphone cases. \nWe already have the first prototype created in our 3D printer with a filament made out of Ghost Nets collected from the sea.\nPLAY\n\nWe have created a business model that recycles and reuses marine litter to transform it into valuable products. But how do we close the circle? Can we achieve a fully circular economy model?  \nThree step manufacturing process\nAll the cases that we sell, if the user no longer wants them, can bring it to our collecting points all over Spain and will get a great discount for the next purchase of Gravity Wave products. With all the collected cases, we again do the recycling process and give them many more uses until they are no longer recyclable, then we transform it into energy with a 0 emissions certificate.\nThe idea to create this Kickstarter campaign is to produce the 6 needed molds to launch the first 13 phone model cases. By offering more models we reach to more people to whom we provide a sustainable alternative creating like this bigger impact that allows us to collect more and more marine litter every day. \nIn Gravity Wave we create sustainable alternatives for our daily life products so that the consumer knows where all these products come from and how they impact the global climate crisis. But we are not selling charity, we are selling quality.\nTechnical specifications\nBuying 1 Gravity Wave case, you contribute to extract 3KG of plastic from the Mediterranean Sea, and moreover, you contribute to sustainable fishing, empower plastic recycling, support local production, local job creation and of course the development of social projects.\nNow we need you so that Gravity Wave becomes a reality.\nContribute to this campaign and be one of the people leading the climate revolution!\nJoin the Wave!\n ESPA\u00d1OL\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 \n1 funda = 3kg pl\u00e1stico\nELIGE TU FUNDA\nEdici\u00f3n GHOST NET\nEdici\u00f3n PLASTIC\nEdici\u00f3n GRAVITY\n\u00bfSab\u00edas que se tiran alrededor de 1.000 millones de fundas de pl\u00e1stico para m\u00f3vil al a\u00f1o? \u00bfY que vertemos 8 millones de toneladas de pl\u00e1stico al a\u00f1o en mares y oc\u00e9anos? \nSituaci\u00f3n del pl\u00e1stico en mares y oc\u00e9anos.\nGravity Wave es un proyecto creado por j\u00f3venes emprendedores sociales que hemos decidido actuar para que las cifras que acabas de leer sean cada vez menores. \nEquipo Gravity Wave: Norberto, Amaia y Julen\nQueremos cambiar las cosas de una vez por todas y tenemos un objetivo muy claro: vaciar todo el pl\u00e1stico del mar Mediterr\u00e1neo.

Nos dimos cuenta que en el sector de la telefon\u00eda m\u00f3vil todo es muy pasajero, y las fundas se quedan enseguida obsoletas, as\u00ed que las que no se venden, se tiran. El mercado de fundas para smartphone tira alrededor de 1.000 millones de fundas al a\u00f1o por no estar al d\u00eda de los modelos de tel\u00e9fono. As\u00ed que nos replanteamos todo nuestro negocio, \u00bfc\u00f3mo \u00edbamos a seguir contribuyendo nosotros a esta causa tan negativa?  \nReciclaje del pl\u00e1stico\nSe nos ocurri\u00f3 que en mares y oc\u00e9anos hay much\u00edsimo pl\u00e1stico, tanto como 8.000.000 de toneladas que se vierten anualmente y que adem\u00e1s el 25% viene de redes de pesca o \"redes fantasma\". Adem\u00e1s, miles de especies de animales est\u00e1n muriendo por causa de este desecho. \nImpacto del pl\u00e1stico en animales\nEmpezamos a darle vueltas y a pensar en c\u00f3mo pod\u00edamos recoger todo ese pl\u00e1stico, ya que el 70% est\u00e1 en el fondo y nosotros no pod\u00edamos dedicarnos a pescarlo, ten\u00edamos que contar con personas que conocieran muy bien el mar y salieran cada d\u00eda a pescar. \u00a1Claro, los pescadores! Quer\u00edamos empezar por nuestro mar Mediterr\u00e1neo, as\u00ed que hablamos con algunos de ellos y y fue entonces cuando conocimos a nuestro primer socio Lefteris Arapakis, fundador de Enaleia, una escuela de pesca sostenible que lleva operando m\u00e1s de 3 a\u00f1os en Atenas, Grecia, donde muestran a los pescadores tradicionales a recoger residuos del mar. Cuando salen a faenar, dedican parte de su tiempo a pescar pl\u00e1stico y una vez lo traen a puerto lo echan en contenedores, los cuales pesamos, y les compensamos por kg de pl\u00e1stico recogido. En Gravity Wave contamos ya con m\u00e1s de 130 barcos en nuestra sede de Atenas, Grecia, que salen cada d\u00eda a faenar y a recolectar pl\u00e1stico del mar, \u00a1y llevamos m\u00e1s de 50 toneladas de residuos recogidos! En 2020 comenzamos con los pescadores de Italia y Espa\u00f1a para seguir recuperando los residuos del fondo del mar.\nHasta aqu\u00ed tenemos la parte de recogida y suministro del material, pero, \u00bfc\u00f3mo lo transformamos? Comenzamos a trabajar mano a mano con Crazy & Things, nuestros socios en Espa\u00f1a, quienes llevan m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os creando, desarrollando y patentando productos. Recientemente han creado Tecnikoa 3D filaments, donde desarrollan y producen filamentos para impresi\u00f3n 3D. Llev\u00e1bamos ya mucho tiempo trabajando juntos y en ese momento decidimos ir un poco m\u00e1s all\u00e1 pasando a ser socios en esta aventura.\nJunto a ellos conseguimos la planta de reciclaje en Alicante, que se dedica a limpiar, seleccionar y trocear el pl\u00e1stico que enviamos desde Atenas en copos y granza (trozos muy peque\u00f1os). M\u00e1s tarde nos lo env\u00edan a nuestra f\u00e1brica de Crazy & Things situada tambi\u00e9n en Alicante, donde producimos filamento para impresi\u00f3n 3D y fundas para smartphone.\n\u00a1YA TENEMOS EL PRIMER PROTOTIPO IMPRESO EN 3D CON FILAMENTO DE REDES DE PESCA RECUPERADAS DEL MAR! \nPLAY\n\nCon estos pasos, hemos conseguido tener un modelo de negocio que recicla y reutiliza los residuos del mar para convertirlos en productos de valor, pero nos queda una \u00faltima cuesti\u00f3n: \u00bfc\u00f3mo cerramos el c\u00edrculo? \u00bfC\u00f3mo podemos conseguir un modelo de econom\u00eda circular completo?\nProceso\n\nTodas las fundas que produzcamos y vendamos, una vez el cliente quiera cambiarlas, podr\u00e1 llevarlas a puntos de recogida situados en toda Espa\u00f1a y una vez entregue esa funda, obtendr\u00e1 un vale de descuento para comprar un nuevo modelo de funda Gravity. Con todas las fundas recogidas, volveremos al proceso de limpieza y troceado para darle \"nueva vida\" a los productos de Gravity Wave. \nLa idea de crear la campa\u00f1a de Kickstarter nace para producir 6 moldes, necesarios para sacar 13 modelos de tel\u00e9fono diferentes. Haciendo m\u00e1s modelos llegamos a m\u00e1s personas, a las que ofrecemos una funda sostenible para su m\u00f3vil generando con esta compra un impacto positivo, ayudando a recolectar cada vez m\u00e1s residuos, \u00a1hasta que no quede ni 1KG de pl\u00e1stico en nuestro querido mar!\nEl primer producto desarrollado con este material es LA PRIMERA FUNDA PARA M\u00d3VIL HECHA CON REDES DE PESCA RECOLECTADAS DEL MAR MEDITERR\u00c1NEO. Fundas que no s\u00f3lo protejan tu m\u00f3vil, sino que contribuyan directamente a proteger el mar.\nEn Gravity Wave creamos alternativas sostenibles de productos que consumimos en nuestro d\u00eda a d\u00eda, para que personas como t\u00fa tengan toda la informaci\u00f3n de los productos que compran y puedan contribuir a resolver la crisis clim\u00e1tica. \nNos preocupa la sostenibilidad, pero tambi\u00e9n la calidad. \nCaracter\u00edsticas de nuestras fundas / Cover technical specifications\nComprando una funda de Gravity Wave contribuyes a extraer 3KG de pl\u00e1stico del mar Mediterr\u00e1neo, adem\u00e1s contribuyes a la pesca sostenible y responsable, fomentas el reciclaje de pl\u00e1sticos, la producci\u00f3n local, y por supuesto, la creaci\u00f3n de puestos de trabajo y desarrollo de proyectos sociales. \n\n\nEscoge el dise\u00f1o que m\u00e1s te guste y \u00fanete al cambio.

Upgrade your dental routine with high-end DuPont bristles with the perfect level of comfort. You'll have that crystal clear smile in no time.\nWe approached the design process bias-free to create something that truly reflects what people want - a product that has yet to be discovered by the majority; unique but in-demand.\nDental care is an essential part of our daily routine that is often overlooked. We invest more than ever in other health gadgets but our teeth are often ignored, despite the fact that damage to teeth is irreversible. To solve this, all you need is a portable sonic toothbrush that you can take anywhere.\neSlim provides a premium brushing experience for all, allowing you to simply & easily adapt its portability, aesthetics, functionality & performance to match your needs.\nMatching the look of the toothbrush to your modern lifestyle and elevating your brushing quality with DuPont brush filaments, three brushing modes, a convenient removable travel cap, and fine-crafted body tube \u2014\u2014 all seamlessly into one instrument.\nOur goal was simple - to design the world's best portable sonic toothbrush to make you feel confident using it in any situation and maintaining good oral hygiene.\n\nWe sought to create a certain aesthetic by combining simplicity, style, elegance, and glamour for the most exclusive product without sacrificing essential functionality. To achieve this high standard, three foundations were necessary.\n(1) Premium Material \u2014 eSlim is all about uniqueness and comfort.  The body is made out of 304 food-grade stainless steel / 6063-grade aluminum alloy that is very durable, and scratch-resistant.\n6063 grade of Aluminum Alloy\n304 food-grade Stainless Steel\n(2) Surface Treatment \u2014 eSlim impressed a valued client with its excellent finishing treatments, which includes vacuum ion sputtering (PVD), anodizing, andanti-fingerprint treatments.\n(3)  High-Quality Brush Filaments \u2014 eSlim's high comfort level is guaranteed. Dentists advise using what feels comfortable and encourage you to brush regularly & correctly. We took that to heart by using DuPont\u00ae nylon, which issimply the best.\nAttraction starts with the first impression\neSlim comes in vibrant colors with a rich satin finish. The brush fits into an elegant cap that encases the entire brush seamlessly for an even more streamlined look.\nThere are three cleaning modes available at the click of a button\u23af Cleaning, Massage, and Whitening\nSmart Brushing\nThe timing function helps you cultivate healthy brushing habits. A vibrating reminder every 30 seconds indicates when you have finished cleaning one area of the mouth, prompting you to continue to another area for a more consistent and thorough cleaning experience.\n\nExcellent Comfort\neSlim aims to provide the softest and most comfortable cleaning experience. DuPont\u00ae produces very high-quality brushes with a balance of consistent quality, wear performance and unmatched productivities in tufting and end-rounding by using DuPont filaments.\n\nHigh Vibration, Deep Cleaning\nWith the highest vibration speed at up to 27,000 vibrations per minute, the newly designed high-speed sonic micro-motor is user-friendly comfortable and efficient.\nVery Quiet\neSlim operates at just 60dB, which is considerably quieter compared to the high pitched buzzing of other sonic toothbrushes - allows you to brush with little disturbance to others.\nIP X7 Waterproof\nThe waterproof performance of the product meets the IP X7 Waterproof standard. This standard ensures effective performance even if the USB port is exposed to the environment for a long period of time. Most importantly, the Micro USB Port itself (while unplugged) is IP X7 water-resistant as well, which means even if water enters the port, it will not damage the toothbrush.\nComes with a waterproof plug\nVentilated & Deodorizing\nThe easy-to-open design easily snaps into place and keeps bristles straight for effective cleaning. Ventilated toothbrush covers protect the brush head and keep it dry between uses. The antibacterial coating keeps the cover clean as well.\nANTIBACTERIAL PROTECTION\nThese toothbrush covers will protect any manual toothbrush & help keep the brush head hygienic.

SomerSide towels have been designed to be soft against your skin so you can enjoy using it like any other towel. We've used the most innovative technology to create soft thread from recycled plastic with a 15% blend of Nylon for that extra softness.\nSomerSide towels have odor resistant properties so leave your wet towel in your bag for the day without the worry. \nSave space in your everyday bag and luggage. Weighing in at only 400 grams and rolling to the size of a small plastic bottle, SomerSide is the perfect towel for on-the-go, no matter whether you're a roller, folder or scruncher.  \nLeave the sandcastles at the beach where they belong with SomerSide's sand-free technology.  If you ever avoid the beach just because you hate the idea of having sand everywhere, SomerSide towels allow you to have your fun in the sun without worrying and the sand!\nSomerSide towels dry 3 times faster than a regular cotton towel so you can be ready from one adventure to the next.

This waste is largely related to consumer gifting, Australians alone throw out 20 million unwanted gifts and enough wrapping paper to wrap the earth's equator 4 times. Australia only has 0.33% of the total world population.... not even 1%.We want to help you and the planet by minimising waste this holiday season. Rather than gifting more plastic, gift SomerSide, a present people will love that helps the environment. \nFounder, Gabby giving some behind the scenes information on our manufacturing and timeline\nPLAY\n\nFREE SHIPPING TO ALL ORDERS IN AUSTRALIA & NZ\nNot the number or combination of towels you are looking for? No problems we can add them on manually. Please send us an email at support@somerside.com.au with the subject line 'custom reward' and we will get back to you ASAP! Expect a response within 24 hours. We want to make sure we deliver your order correctly and so we need to make note of all custom orders. \nFREE SHIPPING TO ALL ORDERS IN AUSTRALIA & NZ\nAll our early bird rewards offer discounted worldwide shipping for those backers that have supported us from the start. Our Santa Pack also offers discounted shipping because we want to help all the eco-gift givers out there. \nOur shipping base is located in Melbourne, Australia and will be mailed out from there. International transit will have a 7-21 Business day delivery time. Aus Domestic shipments will take 3-5 business days. We are a small business and unfortunately cannot offer free worldwide shipping at this point in time but we can offer you a great product at an excellent discount. \nCUSTOM DUTIES AND TAX\nCannot mark as gift, this is illegal, so we will not be able to do this. Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.\nOur terms of sale for international orders are FOB Destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter. \nI've always been an adventurous and active soul that can\u2019t quite commit to having my feet in one place. Having travelled for years and worked in the travel and sporting industry, the idea stemmed from the necessity to have a versatile and beautiful towel that could be used for every activity. Personal style has always been important to me and I've combined that with the functionality and versatility of the outdoors. \nSomerSide was created as a more sustainable product to keep plastic out of our oceans and forests. I took up surfing whilst living in Bali, and I quickly noticed how polluted the water was with plastic, it was everywhere. It hit me- literally. I've been hit by nappies, plastic cups, a bag caught on my foot and even have a small scar on my ankle from a sharp piece of rubbish that hit me in the water.  Protecting our environment is very important to SomerSide and myself and we will constantly strive to implement sustainable practices in everything we do. SomerSide is about doing more while using less. \nThank you for support!\nGabriella Samkova\n\nThank you to the Community Creatives for an amazing job in the photography and video production of this campaign", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike a lot of Kickstarter projects, we've put countless hours and our savings into manufacturing and testing SomerSide.

AvoSeedo has been developed to facilitate the germination process of avocados. It has never been easier to grow your own avocado trees!   \nAvocados have been grown as a crop plant since ancient times. Originating from Latin America, the enormous nutritive value of ahuacatl, the Aztec word for avocado, was well known amongst the indigenous population. But it was only a century ago that the avocado found a new home in (southern) Europe. Nowadays, the pear-shaped, alligator-skinned fruits are a common sight in pretty much every supermarket \u2013 and on our tables. Being outright tasty when consumed fresh and raw, they can also be refined with spices (resulting in the famous guacamole) or stuffed with any filling that pleases your tongue.  \nAlthough avocado trees like to be warm and cozy, they can handle lower average temperatures (as in central Europe, the US or Canada) quite well. The seed of every supermarket avocado can be made to germinate and grow to full size (up to 15 meters!). However, merely putting the seed in the ground usually won\u2019t work. Instead, the \u201cpointy\u201d end should be facing the sun (without being exposed to permanent, direct sunlight). At the same time, the flattened end should be wet all the time.  \nThe main challenge when growing an avocado is to keep it wet all the time. If the seed is left high and dry at any time, there\u2019s a chance that the germination process will stop permanently. And this is where AvoSeedo comes to the rescue. \nAvoSeedo is a revolutionary way to grow the perfect avocados without all the usual hassle that it takes to grow these fussy plants. But what\u2019s new with this version of the AvoSeedo?\nThis version will have your kiddies loving growing their very own pet avocados. The AvoSeedo is shaped like a bear, and comes with many different stickers so that they can customize the look of their little pet. \nIt also comes with a bowl for the AvoSeedo to swim in. There is a little cut out that comes with the pot so that kids can make it look like a pool or garden. So much fun!\nAvoSeedo is the perfect little gadget for kids and everyone who loves to grow plants. Avocados are known to be challenging to grow, but with AvoSeedo\u2019s nifty and brand new design, avocados will grow quickly and easily. \nWell for starters, it\u2019s the easiest way to grow avocados. Our new design is sure to capture kids\u2019 attention. The normally very demanding germination of avocados will be a breeze! \nAvoSeedo is a small, yet intricate tool, which works on the same principle as the toothpick method, only better.  Due to its low weight and high displacement, AvoSeedo will remain at the surface all the time. When the water level lowers, AvoSeedo will sink accordingly.  \nCompared to the original toothpick method, there\u2019s another advantage: the avocado seed doesn\u2019t need to be perforated, reducing the risk of damage and injury. \nDue to its smart design, success rates of germinating avocados will increase dramatically. Watering intervals will be reduced, as water levels only need to be checked now and then. \nAs long as some water remains in the pot or pond, the pit stays wet and there is little chance that the seed will dry out \u2013 thanks to the ground hole. It also allows the developing roots to grow and to expand freely. By the way, the hole is not simply round but has the shape of a heart instead. While this may as well add to the cuteness factor of the new AvoSeedo, it is also a functional feature. It makes sure that avocado seeds of all sizes will be held firmly in its place. Even if the seed cracks open during the germination process, it won\u2019t sink.\nThe brand new AvoSeedo is, without a doubt, the easiest way to germinate avocados, and kids will love their new \u2018pet\u2019. \nHere are the main benefits of AvoSeedo:\nEasy to use \u2013 peel the avocado pit, put it into the AvoSeedo and presto, it\u2019s ready to go.\nNo attention needed \u2013 due to the smart design of the AvoSeedo, it requires minimal care and will germinate without any hassles.\nGreat design \u2013 easy to use with a great design that will capture kids\u2019 imaginations.\nHighly durable \u2013 the AvoSeedo will last for years as it\u2019s made from super strong plastic.\nNon-toxic \u2013 it is BPA and DEHP free.\nAll in all, AvoSeedo is simply the perfect tool for you to grow avocado trees at home. The difficult germination period can now be mastered with almost no effort \u2013 giving your new trees an edge right from the beginning!\nAvoSeedo 2.0 is already in the works!\nWe are already working on the injection mold and start testing very soon. This is great news for you as this decreases the time until it arrives in your home dramatically. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risk is limited.

Therefore, I have named it, \u201cThe Hawk\u201d.\nOver the past 2 years, I have primarily been working on design & tested various type of knives. I have been working along this line with full commitment and throughout the whole process my priority have been to provide the best possible ergonomic handle and well balanced design for the ease of use. I want to ensure that this knife also meet the highest standards with specific guidelines such as blade, material & resources for better efficiency.\nBLADE:\nThe 330 Layered Damascus blade must impress you as the details are so sharp and beautifully attractive patterns. It is long-lasting due to its rustproof blade making it first choice for any professional chefs.\nHANDLE:\nWalnut wood is extremely tough and therefore, it is the best possible combination to go with Damascus blade. The straight grain retains the traditional look and feel with light to a very deep brown colour.\nI have been collecting knives for many years, I do understand the uniqueness and the highly customised process of creating it. From the design prospective to the actual product, it is where every knife will go through a comparable strength and sharpness test during production to provide you all with distinctive wavy pattern and durability to the blade. \nThe Hawk\nLove for small knives lead us to this creation, a perfect sharp & balanced knife which can be used with fully comfort, indoor as well as out door. \nThere are lots of cheap \"Damascus\" knockoff knives in the market. I have owned few myself previously and one can notice straight away how badly they are made. Most noticeable fact is that the metal has weak spots and is made up from poor quality materials.   \nMy own determination has been over the time to choose the right brand of Damascus and provide you all with something that is pretty and practical in terms of usage. With my knowledge and crafting skills, I'll use durable Damascus that takes time and meticulous attention to detail. Thats the kind of integrity I want to build on this platform.   \nThe Hawk ( 100% Damascus Paring Knife )\nI know the fact that its important to properly heat the Damascus as its vital part of the whole process. Also once its ready, I'll be making sure that every knife has quality the finish, baring in mind that it can rise my costs but it is also my job to provide you with great finish.   \nPLAY\n\nCutting ,chopping ,peeling ,slicing or even dicing with this mini beast.\nFor me, selling online on various e commerce platforms isn't pleasing as I don't feel well connected with the potential buyers. Therefore, I have chosen \"Kickstarter\" platform as my start, so I build upon my knowledge and a direct interaction with you all. \nSince it's my first project in line, consumer feedback is very important to me and thats why I have decided to keep the prices very reasonable. Though, I believe in providing quality, price is just for the hardwork which is going at the background. As you save, I build integrity, relationship and knowledge. \nThe Hawk\n100% Damascus paring knife; Designed & created to serve as paring knife, its simple, elegant & fully comfortable while in hands.\nHawk ( 100% Damascus Paring knife )\n With 330 Layers of steel, full tang & wooden handle \nI am introducing \"The Hawk\" in 2 sizes, (20cm & 24cm) as I feel that will give best combination. I have handcrafted and used traditional skills to come up with these designs. I have given a thought process and attributes which are key, such as;\nHand Forged Damascus Steel\nErgonomics & Well Balanced\nDurable Handle\nSuperior Sharpness\nThe Hawk Pair ( 24cm & 20 cm )\nErgonomically designed Walnut wood handle ensures a firm grip, comfort and add touch of elegance. \nThe Hawk ( Damascus Paring Knife )\n The sheaths are of this pattern more or less, the final look may differ a bit but is make of 100% leather.\n Walnut wood & brass pins adds grace to this knife\nPLAY\n\nThis item is produced in limited quantities only. This means that every piece is unique. Sizes & finish may vary lightly from piece to piece.\nPLAY\n\n Smooth cuts with no drag or food stick, easy to clean and stays sharp\n The knife is not a showpiece, its fully functional and heat-treated to take the impact.\nThe Hawk ( Damascus Paring Knife )\n Its designed to give comfort to the palm. \n Full tang blade (Its entirely a single length with no soldering ) \nBeautiful design with precious look & sharp with full tang all adds character to this hawkish knife and make it a real Kitchen Hawk. \n There are many things I want to achieve through this platform, For someone new, it does makes it harder to overcome certain aspects of the project.

Gone were the days of carrying your laptop charger, phone charger, power converter \u2013 replace all of these with a single Nimble. \n\n 1 Nimble - 6 devices \nOne adaptor to rule them all - The Nimble can accommodate up to 6 devices at the same time, without sacrificing any charging performance across its USB -A and USB - C ports\nWe rely on the broad range of electronics when travelling to keep us occupied during long journeys. That doesn\u2019t mean you should have to bring broad range of chargers that simply take up valuable baggage space.\n \nIs it the same as the Travel Adapter on Amazon?\nWe have picked some of the bestsellers on Amazon to show you why the Nimble is truly unique with a dedicated USB-C output unlike traditional adapter which will share power across output ports. \n\n\n\nIndependently Powered Ports - Quick Charge and Power Delivery\nImagine if everyone in a large restaurant shared one single waiter.\nThe same way traditional travel adaptors share power across all its outlets. Nimble however, offers each of your devices its own personal service. No compromise. No loss of performance.\nThe Nimble utilizes 2 independent circuit boards to power the main plug, the USB-C PD/QC and the 3x USB-A/1x USB-C output \u2013 resulting in  dedicated power through its USB-C QC/PD port to ensure optimized charging for all QC and PD compatible devices \u2013 traditional chargers will share power between all the ports resulting in slow charging.\n\n\n\nCompared With Other Travel Chargers \n\n\nTravel, Home, Office \nWhether you are travelling long distances or commuting between home and the office, the Nimble fits perfectly into your life without occupying noticeable space. Small and sleek, definitely a charger we are not used to.\n The 35W Power Delivery is perfect to replace those big clunky laptop chargers we are so use to. \n\nUSB-C to USB-C and USB-C to Lightning\n\n\nRewards\nADD On Menu: Because Your Nimble Deserves the Best \nOnce you\u2019ve backed the project, you can add additional cables.

The Nimble uses over voltage protection, current stabiliser and over heating protection - One less thing to worry about when you are traveling abroad. \n\n\n\n\nCharge Like A Local, Travel Like A Pro\nCharge like a local and travel like a pro, never worry about not having the correct adapter as the Nimble covers over 150 countries. Never be caught out again when travelling to another country.\n Prototype \nThe Nimble has been designed by a collective of travellers to be the ultimate travel gadget you need for any type of travel.

Off course you can enjoy with wasabi tube.\nThe wasabi-yama was created from the thought to have more wasabi more freely.\nWhen people ordered a plate of some mixed sashimi at a restaurant, a little amount of wasabi was offered on the edge of the plate and everyone shared it, picking it with their chopsticks. \nIt was not really comfortable thing to do for each people.\n\u201cAnd above all, there was too little of it!!\u201d\n\u201cHow could I have the delicious dishes with more wasabi, more freely, we wondered?\u201d\nThis \u201cwasabi-yama\u201d came out of these thoughts.\nWhile we were thinking about what kind of plate, people can enjoy more wasabi more freely then, we heard of this talk.\n\u201cPeople in Edo (Tokyo) won\u2019t allow wasabi to soak in the soy-sauce.\u201d\nPic2\nWe were inspired by it and tried to make a \u201cnew plate for wasabi\u201d and this is its shape.\nThe wasabi-lovers who might once have wished to monopolize the wasabi can do it with this one!\nSize: 11 cm diameter x 3.35cm height\nInstruction: Place wasabi on the top of the mountain and pour some soy-sauce around in the plate.\n\u25b2Hizen-yoshida Pottery details http://www.yoshidayaki.jp/process/#prettyPhoto\nIt is made on a one-by-one basis with great care.\nThe white porcelain in the Arita area has a beautiful white color as its character. \nThe whiteness of this plate comes from the clay itself and the glaze which has been used is colorless and transparent.\nSo, the natural whiteness from the clay appears and this pure white texture is there to see.\nFor obtaining this result, good quality raw materials have been chosen. \n\nFor a mass production of the white porcelain, the mold is necessary.\nThere are 3 types of mold, such as \n1 throw away mold (sample mold)\n2 case mold\n3 use mold (a mass production mold). \nThey are needed to be made depending on each stage.\n1. After inventing a design, a mold (\u2460throw away mold) which is used as a sample (master) is made.\n2. Make a mold (\u2461case mold) for verification \u2460abandoned mold as a model and then after checking the repeatability of the size and shape, produce the duplicate mold for the mass production (\u2462use mold).\n3. Pour the fluid viscos called mud in the \u2462 and make an original mold.\n4. Bake it as it is in the mold to stabilize it. (unglazed pottery)\n5. Pour the glaze on the surface of the vessel to make a film on it. \n During the bisque-firing, the glaze melts and vitrifies the surface. \n(glazing)\n6. Then, bake it for 12~14 hours with a temperature of 1300\u2103.\n(high temperature firing in a big kiln)\n *This is the important process which largely influences the glaze, the color of the paint and the gloss.\nThe work of this time is to produce a product made by using a mold, but it is a very delicate process which requires various adjustments according to the weather and humidity of the day.\nIf the glaze isn\u2019t put on evenly, the uneven color appears after a high temperature firing in a big kiln and it is a persevering work which is required to check the mold one by one during the firing.\nIt is the creative world in which the experience of the experienced craftsman is important.\nWe would like to create the enjoyable daily life using the tableware with which you can enjoy your meals.\nNowadays, we can enjoy the nice food anywhere, and we think that people are interested in what to eat, but they are not bothered in what tools to eat them from.\n\u201cWe would like people to eat the delicious foods together with the enjoyable tools.\u201d\nPLAY\n\nThe meals while having fun make daily life rich.\nWe really want to design these kinds of products from now on.\nAlso, we would like to create the environment and the way of economy for not only the hand-craftsmen who create things but also the ones who mine the raw materials and also the ones who manage mountains doing a wonderful work with a fair price through the \u201cproduct design\u201d.\nIt is a set that you can receive and can easily experience the wasabi-yama, just by your initial support as a kickstarter.  \nThe wasabi, wood and soy sauce bottle listed in the photo are not included in this set.

This is continuation of our original Kickstarter project - Sens the most minimalistic pen. We got ton of great comments to our project, which you can read below.\nAlso, a lot of our customers asked about the opportunity to choose body and cap colors separately, so now we have 12 colors (instead of original 4 colors).\nTo make even more personal touch, we added an opportunity to add Personal Engraving for leather accessories and pen stand.\nExample of Personal Engraving option on leather notebook cover, wooden pen stand and leather pen sleeve\nOUR NEW COLORS\n\n I think my previous backers will say better than me :) Haha\nTHE PEN.\n       Pen is the essential attribute of our everyday life. It is not just a writing instrument, it is tool for self-expression. It embodies soul and wisdom of its owner. Pen is an extension of your thoughts, goals and achievements.\n\n\n       Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\n\n\nSpecifications: \nMinimalistic design\nPerfect balance\nErgonomic design\nAnodized aircraft aluminum\nCNC-machined\nWooden pen stand\nSchmidt P8126 capless roller ball pen refill (0,6 mm)\nComparable with any Parker style G2 refills\n\n\nTwisting mechanism in work.\nDimensions & weight: \nLength 136 mm (5,35 in)\nDiameter at widest point - 11mm, at narrowest \u2013 9mm\nWeight \u2013 28 grams (1 oz)\n\nOur pen consists only from two solid metal parts, refill and spring.\n CHOOSE YOUR COLOR.\n\nPEN STAND. \n        We put a lot of attention to our packaging too, as it makes the first impression on product. Every pen will be packed in beautifully designed box. Also it could be a pen stand on your desk. We made stands in walnut, for perfect match with your interior.\nBlack Sens pen with walnut pen stand\nPackaging of a Sens pen.\nPEN CASE.  \n        To keep your pen safe, we made a minimalistic sleeve. It`s made from a solid piece of vegetable tanned leather, which will gain deep rich tint as time goes by. Every sleeve is hand sewn with great attention to every stitch.\nBeige, red, brown and black pen sleeves\nMinimalistic leather pen sleeve.\n REWARDS.\n\n\n\nADD-ONS.\n       The add-ons are added to your original EXISTING reward that you pledged for. You can add a pen sleeve or an extra refill to your current pledge. To add an add-on, simply include the amount in the pledge.\nFor example:\n        If you made a $39 SENS PEN pledge and you would like to add a pen sleeve (+12$) and an extra refill (+3$), simply add $15 to your pledge and enter \"54$\" without changing the reward category.\nDESIGN. \n               The pen was reinvented. Our pen is very simple, it consists only from two solid parts. A subtle teardrop shape, gives it a great balance to write, with comfort and steadiness. The pen fits nicely in a hand and does not slip.\nSens pen is perfectly balanced.\n\n\n\n\n      The pen is made from aluminum, known for its durability and lightness. Precision machinery and skillful workers are needed to create the perfect writing instrument for you.\nMachining Sens pen\nWRITING.   \n       Not only the pen looks good, it writes even better. We have tried and tested different types of ink and have chosen the best one for you. It is an innovative system for smooth and elegant writing. It combines the convenience of a ballpoint pen with the individual writing characteristics of a fountain pen. Every pen will come with Schmidt P8126 capless roller ball refill, perfect for writing, drawing and taking notes.\n       If you will need a replacement, you won`t have problems finding it. Our pen is compatible with any Parker-style G2 refill (more than 100), which is a standard refill for a variety of pens. So whenever you\u2019ll need it, there will always be a plenty to choose from.\n       We came a long way from first sketches to final prototype. Now we need your SUPPORT to start full production. We need funds for manufacturing, assembling, packaging and shipping to YOU.\nNOTEBOOK COVER.\nPLAY\n\n       To keep your pen and notebook together, we created a simple, yet functional cover. Under its minimalist look there are compartments for the notebook and pen, two slots for cards and a small pocket for some little things that may be handy throughout your day. The cover is also a stylish accessory that's hard to let off your hands, moreover to forget at home.\n       The cover is made from natural vegetable tanned leather to give it strength and a nice texture. It also develops a rich tint as time goes on. The leather is cut with a laser for precision and accuracy that are impossible to achieve while cutting by hand.\n      But the sewing is only done manually \u2013 it is far more difficult, but the stitches come out stronger and last longer. As a final step, we carefully treat the edges of the leather to give the cover its finished look and provide you with a product that is ideal in every detail.\n       Simple like everything ingenious, this set is great to have around. It gives an ability to write down, sketch, plan and organize your plans and ideas to turn them into successful achievements in the future.\nSpecifications:\nVegetable tanned leather\nNylon thread\nHand sewn\nPen sleeve\n155mm x 115mm ( 6,1 \" x 4,5 \" )", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have experience with 6 successful projects on Kickstarter, so process of production and delivery is well established.

Providing instant coolness and ultimate comfort.  \nSilver has been used by NASA, US Special Forces, and Olympic athletes to create germ free textiles. Bamboo charcoal\u2019s activated carbon absorb toxins, prevents mould growth and purifies air by absorbing harmful gasses.\nAir Cells increase comfort and breathability that is linked to sweating and snoring during sleeping. The combination of the textiles wick moisture away twice as fast as cotton, reducing the humidity in your bed by up to 50%. \nThe problem with traditional pillows is that they require porous materials to create a soft comfortable feel. In as little as 7 days, millions of colony forming units of bacteria can grow inside this permeable space where mold and other pathogens can thrive. This leads to allergies, skin irritation and many illnesses. \nAlpha's bamboo charcoal infused memory foam allows the pillow to mould into the shape of your head and neck, supporting the sensitive pressure areas to help you relax and help with insomnia. \nImpinged nerves can trigger migraines, ensuring that your spine is alined correctly in its natural position it will minimize nerve irritation. It will also help to relieve muscle tension around the neck area. \nAlpha allows your spine to be alined and it elevates your upper body, unblocking the airways and opening nasal passages so you can breathe easier. Alpha's Dimensions: 60 x 40 x 12 cm.\nSilver binds to essential cell components like DNA to neutralize their harmful effect. The process of minimizing the bacteria helps with eliminating odor, prevents allergies such as skin irritations, pimples, asthma, runny nose, sneezing and more.

Australia\u2019s long isolation and vast area has created an ideal setting for nature to express its incredible diversity. More than 90 percent of the 30,000 different plant species found in Australia are found only in Australia! Our aim at NativeRepublica is to bring some of those truly unique flowers and plants to the rest of the world. To share something that will grow and blossom. \nOUR STORY\n....................................\nJust over a year ago my husband and I travelled around Australia camping for 5 months. We set off from my hometown of Newcastle, Australia on what was to be the most amazing adventure. What really struck me about that trip, besides the vast size of the country, was the range of amazingly beautiful, vibrate and burley wildflowers. Colours and forms truly unique to Australia. Mid last year my husband and I moved to his hometown in Switzerland and I began to deeply miss the unique smells and sights of Australia. That was when I decided to bring a little bit of Australia with me. I started NativeRepublica to showcase and celebrate the joyful heirloom wildflowers of Australia and bring their beauty to the rest of the world. We have since been working on sourcing the best native Australian wildflower seeds to share with the world.\nVIDEO\n....................................\nOUR RANGE\n....................................\nWe\u2019ve selected six of the most unique Australian wildflowers:\nTHE PRODUCT\n....................................\nOur eco-friendly packets of native wildflower seeds are sold individually or as a gift pack of three. Each vibrant packet of seeds contains sowing and care instructions, native seeds and a sowing label.\nTHE GIFT PACK\n....................................\nOur gift pack of three individual seed packets. \nAs part of this Kickstarter campaign we are offering a special on our gift pack of Bottlebrush seeds, Kangaroo Paw seeds and Blue Rottnest Island Daisy seeds (special only available through KickStarter).\nNow that we have reached our streach goal we can introduce two new gift pack options!!!!\nTHE FLOWERS\n....................................\n1. Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea\nThe Strut\u2019s Desert Pea is the most iconic and unique Australian wildflower. Not only that, it\u2019s also the emblem of South Australia. I spent a good part of our trip intensely looking for this amazing flower in the wild. Originating from the deserts of South Australia and the Northern Territory the Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea eluded me. I can only imagine what Charles Sturt would have though seeing its distinctive elongated red flowers and piercing black eye on his 1814 journey into the depths of Australia in search of an inland sea. Nothing else in the world compares to the Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea. The red beauty looks like a tough customer but is actually very endearing. They love to be in frost-free positions with excellent drainage, either in a container or sandy garden bed.\n2. Bottle Brush\nThe vibrant red flowers of Bottle Brush played such an important part of my childhood. The memory of being fascinated by their soft bizarre brush head is so vivid in my mind. This magnificent flower is an iconic plant, well-recognised in Australia and increasingly in gardens throughout the world. It easy to grow, hardy and very adaptable. The vibrant red colour is a magnet for wildlife and birds, they just love it! This versatile plant in also known by indigenous Australians as a beautiful tea, what a superstar!\n3. Blue Rottnest Island Daisy\nAs if Australia was not isolated enough! This little beauty originates from the even more remote Rottnest Island, located off the coast of Western Australia. It\u2019s long slender strokes are topped a striking pincushion like array of petite bluey purple blooms. Insects love the pretty blue flowers including snails so be sure to protect them when they are juvenile. Blue Rottnest Island Daisies are super easy to grow so no garden has any excuse to be without them.\n4. Wattle\nIn Australia you know summer has arrived when you see those big blooms of glowing golden Wattle flowers. I can\u2019t remember a summer where I didn\u2019t stop and admire Wattle\u2019s vibrant presents. This plant has the amazing power of being able to immediately infuse happiness \u263a Glorious Wattle is our national flower in Australia. We even have \u2018Wattle Day\u2019 on September 1 every year! That\u2019s how much we love this plant. Wattle belongs to the same family as the more common Mimosa and Thorntree variety of Acacia. Staggeringly 950 of the 1300 Acacia species abound worldwide are native to Australia. This plant is not just a pretty face, although undoubtedly highly ornamental, wattle seeds plays an important part in ingenious Australians medicine. Easy to grow, this plant is a must in any garden.\n5. Geraldton Wax\nGeraldton wax is having a comeback moment. Its long been appreciated as a hardy plant with profusely long lasting pretty pink waxy flowers. It is an iconic Australian plant and one of the world\u2019s best cut flowers. The aroma when crushing the foliage between your fingers is to die for. This flower is super robust, fast growing and most importantly copes well with irregular watering so its perfect for the lazy gardener ;) Use the cut flowers in the home as they will last up to a week.\n6. Kangaroo Paw\nKangaroo Paw plant is stunning full stop. With its long elegantly flattened leaves and beautiful brilliant green flowers bloom that fans out like a cluster this flower is truly truly unique. Each Kangaroo Paw flower has a bright red ovary which, with the unusual paw-shaped flowers, gives the flower its very fitting name. Its paws are soft and velvety with fine brightly coloured hairs covering the entire surface. This fury little guy sturdy stem is a natural perch for birds. The blooms are long lasting and make amazing cut flowers.\nOUR PEOPLE\n....................................\nGreen thumbs who want a truly unique garden full of heirloom native flowers\nTravellers who want to bring a little unique magic home with them\nGivers of unique eco-friendly gifts. \nPeople who want something uniquely beautiful that will grow and blossom for years to come \nThe Goals\n.......................\nRaise $1,000 AUD to buy supplies and packaging\nThe stretch goals: $2,000 AUD introduce new wildflower varieties to the range $3,000 AUD introduce fruits, herbs and spice plants to the range.\nWILL THEY GROW?\n....................................\nAustralian wildflowers have evolved to fill every available habitat on the huge continent from hot dry to frosty mountaintops. Our range of wildflowers grow naturally in USDA hardiness zones 5-12. Outside of these zones they can be grown in a green house.\nBest of all most of our flowers are perennial! with the exception of Blue Rottnest Island Daisy it is erect annual or biannual. Re-propagation shouldn't be an issue.

Each country has its own rules about bringing in plant and plant products (i.e. seeds). It\u2019s always best to check with your country\u2019s customs and quarantine laws before making a pledge. Most countries allow non-commercial quantities to enter without any paperwork however some require a Phytosanitary Certificate. \nUNITED STATES\nIf you live in the United States, \"up to 50 seeds per species\" can be imported under the Small Seed Lots Permit without a Phytosanitary Certificate. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/permits...\nEUROPE\nSimilarly in Europe \"Small quantities of plants, plant products, foodstuffs or animal feed that their owner or recipient will use for non-industrial, non-commercial purposes or consume during transport\" do not need a certificatehttps://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/plant_health_biosecurity/non_eu_trade_en\nCANADA\n\"Small lots\" of seed, i.e., quantities of less than 5 kg of large seeded kinds such as peas, beans and corn or quantities of less than 500 g of small seeded kinds such as carrot or alfalfa, are exempted from providing an import declaration or a seed analysis certificate and do not require an ICA. Most seed imported by Canadian gardeners would fall under the \"small lot\" category. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/plants/seeds/imports/small-packet-seed/eng/1470410938949/1470410961778\nNEW ZEALAND\nWe don't recommend purchasing our seeds for delivery to New Zealand due to our strict quarantine requirements.\nARE THEY INVASIVE?\n..........................\nEach native environment is unique and diverse. Sometimes introducing a new species into the harmonious balance can result in disastrous results. Our mission is to enhance not destroy the local environment. Whilst each country has its own list, NON of our flowers are classified as invasive species in the US, Canada and Europe. \nUNITED STATES: https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/main.shtml \nCANADA: http://www.rbg.ca/archive/cbcn/en/projects/invasives/i_list.html\nEUROPE: https://www.eppo.int/INVASIVE_PLANTS/ias_lists.htm#IAPList\nBotanical names of our flowers:\nGeraldton Wax CHAMELAUCIUM uncinatum\nBottle BrushCALLISTEMON glaucus \nBlue Rottenest Island Daisy TRACHYMENE coerulea\nSturt's Desert Pea SWAINSONA formosa\nWattle ACACIA drummondii\nKangaroo Paw ANIGOZANTHOS flavidus \nNOTE: We don't recommend purchasing our seeds for delivery to New Zealand due to their strict quarantine requirements.\nSTRECH GOALS\n...................\nI'm happy to say we have reached both our stretch goals which means we can introduce three new seeds to our original range of six!\nFirst up is Billy Button!!!\nAvailable as a Combo 'Stretch goal -add on' reward and as part of the 'Multi gift pack' rewards\nAs part of the second stretch goal we are thrilled to introduce a new reward...Bush Fruits and Spice Seeds! Quandong and Old Man Salt Bush :)\nCurious as to how these taste? We've got a tasting rewards lined up as well. Receive these beautifully packaged native bush spices for tasting.\nFirst up is ground Quandong fruit: Funny name, delicious flavour! These sweet, glossy fruits, also known as \u2018wild peaches\u2019, are packed with vitamin C, protein, complex oils, iron and zinc. While you can eat them straight off the tree, our dried ground quandongs are great to add to cakes, juices and fruit salads or with fish and Asian food.\nAnd Old Man Salt Bush Milled leaf: Old man saltbush is salty! Many different varieties exist across arid regions of Australia. Traditionally used by indigenous Australians in dampers, this spices is great as a general spice and amazing with roasted potatoes. Contains 15g.

This 10\u201d track is sewn into the back of the belt to create over 40+ size positions to adjust with. This means you can adjust your Ultimate belt in \u00bc\u201d increments and achieve the perfect fit. So whether you just ate a big meal, or just started that new diet - your Ultimate belt is going to provide the perfect fit, every time. It's like a giant zip tie for your waist - only more fun to use. As a matter of fact, once you wear an Ultimate belt \u2013 you\u2019ll never want to go back to a traditional belt. To release or adjust the belt, just pinch the small tab under the buckle.   \n        After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nUltimate Belts (1.5\" wide) are constructed using 3 key elements. First, the exterior is a handsome nylon webbing test rated to over 500 lbs. Inside is a poly-urethane core center for added strength and stability to support gear, and yet flexible enough for comfort. On the inside is Super Fiber, a hybrid material that's both extremely durable and water resistant. These 3 elements combined make this the toughest belt you'll ever own and the last belt you'll ever need. \nUltimate buckles and nylon belts are interchangeable with ALL our other EDC (1.5\" wide) belts and buckles featured on our website.  \n\n                 See >>  http://www.KoreEssentials.com    \n                   After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!\n  At Kore Essentials creating innovative, quality products for men is what we do. Actually - it's ALL we do - it's our occupation. So we take it seriously and in doing so, strive to improve whenever possible. These unique, reinforced poly-core belts (1.5\u201d wide) are constructed using top-grade nylon webbing. The back of the belt is a Super-Fiber that's tough and water resistant. The buckles (2.25\u201d x 1.5\u201d) are a high-quality zinc alloy with a hardened gunmetal color finish. As always our products include a 30 day full money back guarantee and 1 year replacement warranty.  \nX3 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n           After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nUltimate belt comes in \u201cOne-Size\u201d that fits any waist from 24\u201d up to 54\u201d. When you receive your new belt, turn it over and locate your Pant Size using the printed ruler marks. Then add 4 inches and cut using sharp scissors. So for example, if your pant size is 36\" - cut your belt at the 40\" mark. Then snap the cut end into the buckle receptacle (teeth) and put it on.  If it's still too big - you can trim off more, an inch at a time. It's liberating to be able to adjust your belt up to 5 inches in either direction \u2013 in or out - in tiny \u00bc\u201d increments.  \n                     \"This is the best fitting belt you\u2019ll ever own.\"  \n   < Backer Comments From Our Previous Kickstarter Projects >\n\u201cI love my Trakline belt! I show it off to everyone. Great product, so glad I became a backer!\u201d - Mike Goodridge\n\n\u201cHave to say the Trakline belt is the best Kickstarter item I have backed so far. The quality is great and is now my favourite belt!\u201d - Thurstan Johnstan\n\n\u201cGot my two belts and buckles and they're amazing. The quality is top-notch.\u201d - Casus Belli\n\n\u201cI love the belt and the quality in manufacturing and design is evident in everything.\u201d - Scott Burns\n\n\u201cSeriously, I can't get over how much I love this belt. I totally forget I'm wearing it because it's so comfortable.\u201d - Thomas Ella \nDespite our success, we\u2019re still a small company and launching a new product requires a lot of resources and funds up front. This means we need your support to help pay for tooling and enough starting inventory to keep the costs down. In return, we\u2019d love to give you one of these awesome new belts, or several if you like. Either way \u2013 we promise you\u2019re going to love it.  \nX2 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   Once the Kickstarter campaign is funded, we will send out surveys to all backers to gather reward choices (buckle styles, leather colors, etc.) and shipping address. Once we get the surveys back we\u2019ll commence production. Based on the factories estimate, this process should take about 30-40 days to complete dependent on volume. We're going to make the belts at a responsible factory in China that we've done a lot of business with. One of our partners (Mauro) will personally be on hand to oversee and ensure that the best quality standards are met. Once the production is completed, we will ship the belts to our warehouse in San Diego, California (2 weeks) and then repackage individual orders to ship out to backers (1 week). So all in all, you should get your belt about 60-70 days after the campaign ends.  \n          After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nX3 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   A number of years ago my wife bought me an expensive belt for my birthday. Unfortunately, my waist was \u201cin-between\u201d the belt holes at the time. We\u2019ve all been there. This time I boldly decided to poke a few holes of my own in the leather and \u201cfix it\u201d myself. Bad idea. I completely ruined the belt. I learned several key lessons that day. First \u2013 belt holes are bad. Second, never puncture a gift from your wife. It never turns out well. The good news - it set us out on a journey to create a better belt for men.  \nOur original Kickstarter Trakline belt campaign from 2013\nFlash forward - after 18 months of designing, prototyping and testing we launched our first evolution of Trakline belts right here on Kickstarter in 2013. We were fortunate enough to attract over 4,000 backers and were on our way. So here we are\u2026 back again to introduce our latest incarnation our new Ultimate belt.  \nX1 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n  Karl Kozak: Sales & Marketing\nMauro Bove: Manufacturing & Quality Control\nSteve Olson: Product & Web Design \n\nThe three of us have been friends and business partners for over 13 years now. Here's a little of our background and relevant history. For the past 15 years Mauro has been in product manufacturing and quality control. As a result, he's manufactured a wide variety of high-quality retail products for some of America\u2019s biggest retailers. Steve on the other hand, is an all-around talented designer, who's been crucial in creating our product designs, drawings and the website. My background has been in business management and sales. Over the past several decades, I've successfully launched, grown, managed and sold several companies. Together, the three of us make a great, motivated team that\u2019s focused on creating and marketing great products.  \nOur Pledge Management Partner\n  X1 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n As of 2017 we have a total of 5 patents on our unique Trakline ratchet belts including one on a ratchet belt system with reinforced belt core to support gear. Why all the patents ? We\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money perfecting our proprietary technology and we'd like to keep it that way. \n   \n               Visit us online @  http://www.KoreEssentials.com \nGet Your Project Funded Today!\n                                THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME & SUPPORT \n           After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nX1 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X1 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X2 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X2 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X3 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X3 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n       After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\n\u00a9 Copyright 2017 Kore Essentials, Inc.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter campaign since we launched our original Trakline belt project back in 2013. Since that time we've managed to launch and successfully deliver 6 new products to over 15,000 backers. And I think we can say with some certainty, that we met, or exceeded, most backers expectations in regards to product quality, design and function. \n\nOf course, along the way we've learned a few valuable lessons. \n\nFor example, we make a habit of communicating frequently and openly with our backers regarding the manufacturing progress and shipping status. We do an update every 1-2 weeks after the project is completed. \n\nGoal # 1 is to deliver a well designed, quality product that exceeds Backer expectations and that backers love. As proof with past campaigns - after receiving their Trakline belts over 40% of the backers visited our online store to purchase a 2nd, 3rd and 4th belt .\n\nNevertheless, we understand moving forward this is a new project, with its own set of challenges and that past successes don't eliminate all the future risks involved.\n\nThe biggest challenge as always for us when creating a new product, is timing. We strive to get our projects completed on time, with no snafus. There are molds and tooling to create and we test at each step of the process. But if delays do happen, we keep backers \"in the loop\" as to what's going on and the new timelines. \n\nBased on our track record - we feel like backers can be confident and assured - they're going to get a great product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "EARLYBIRD >> 1 Ultimate Belt", "descp": "Includes 1 Buckle & 1 Belt.

We\u2019ve alleviated this problem by creating a compression bag that keeps clothes compact, organized, and folded.  Acteon bags maximize space because they use a separate compression zipper to flatten that bulky stack of clothes.\nThe struggle of keeping clean and dirty clothes separate disappears when using our packing cubes.  We engineered a gusseted divider between compartments that keeps clean clothes fresh by isolating them from worn smelly clothes.  This works pretty simply.  Start out your trip with all of your clothing on the clean side.  As your clothes get dirty, you move them one by one to the dirty side to keep them separated.  The expandable center divider transfers space from the clean side to the dirty side while not increasing the overall size of the packing cube.  In storing clothes separately, you can easily travel to multiple locations without worry. This also greatly simplifies unpacking.\nHow to use the Clean and Dirty Compartments\nPLAY\n\n  Without a compression cube, your clothes are going to shift and move during travel. This means you'll be left with a scattered and crumpled mess.  By using an Acteon bag, your clothes will remain in their space and have a better possibility of staying wrinkle free.\nHow to Pack and Compress a Cube\nPLAY\n\nPacking List: 7 mens medium t-shirts, 1 pair of shorts and 1 pair of 32x32 jeans.\n  Inspired by travel and the thrills of excursions, we created designs with geometric patterns that will appeal to anyone.  To keep organization easy and show that compression is key, we used colored zippers to easily differentiate where to place your clothes, and when it\u2019s time to compress.\nUltra Lightweight: 4.2oz (120g) Large and 3.0oz (86g) Small\nUltra Compact\nDurable Silicone Coated Ripstop Nylon Construction\nWater Resistant\nYKK Zippers\nSeparate Clean/Dirty Compartments\nNylon Webbing Carry Handle\nCompression Zippers to save even more space\nCorded Zipper Pulls\nSilicone Coated Ripstop Nylon is Water Resistant and Extremely Durable\n                  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBringing a product from the drawing board to reality is not an easy task.

An endless maze of mobile apps, smart switches, and other interfaces create a confusing and fragmented experience.\nWe believe there's a better way - Knocki offers the simplest, most natural, and accessible way to control the world around you.  You've never seen anything like it!\nThe Buzz\n    Meet Knocki\nKnocki is a small wireless device that instantly transforms ordinary surfaces (walls, tables, doors, furniture, countertops, & more) into powerful yet easy to access remotes for your favorite devices and software.\n  The Basics\nUsing Knocki is easy.  Just tap simple gestures anywhere on a Knocki-enabled surface to automate all kinds of useful actions.  Make your ordinary surroundings do more.\nWhy reach for a phone, a remote, or a switch to perform your favorite functions? There's another control interface that's always within reach - the world around you, and you can activate it with Knocki.\nCan your table turn on a TV or dim the lights?  With Knocki discreetly mounted underneath, the entire surface becomes capable and connected.  Knocki adds magical simplicity wherever you use it.\n  A Few of the Many Use Cases\n    Who is Knocki for?\nKnocki isn't just for people with smart homes or high-tech offices.  Knocki works well anywhere with a WiFi internet connection.  It allows you to \"tap\" into many powerful functions, even if your only smart device is an iPhone or Android phone.\nKnocki is the easiest way to add \"smarts\" to your existing home, without the wiring, installation, complexity and expense of many alternative smart home control systems. \nBut if you already have a few smart devices, you can immediately expand what Knocki can do, and transform \"dumb\" surfaces all around your home or office into intelligent interfaces.\nBottom line, if you'd like technology to work for you, instead of the other way around, you'll appreciate the power of Knocki!\nYou can put Knocki on, under, or behind surfaces anywhere!\nAttach Knocki on walls, under tables, behind shelves or nightstands, behind your front door, and more!  Knocki can be placed in plain sight, or mounted invisibly under or behind surfaces so only you know its there.\nEach Knocki includes a special mount featuring our patent-pending SurfaceLink\u2122 technology to ensure a solid connection to a surface for transmission of gesture signals.  Knocki's mount can be secured using the included 3M removable tape, or with screws (also included).\n  Setup is Easy!\nSetting up your Knocki is easy and just takes a few minutes. Start by connecting Knocki to your WiFi network and use the free Knocki companion app to link all your devices and accounts. \nAfter Knocki is mounted to a surface,  define the unique gestures to trigger your actions (up to 10 gestures), and you've instantly created a powerful smart surface!  The process is simple, and once it's done, Knocki will keep working (via WiFi) even if your phone is turned off or away!\nWith Knocki installed on a surface, the surface instantly becomes a powerful and programmable remote control, even many feet away from where Knocki is attached.\nKnocki uses non-acoustic sensor technology to detect gentle surface gestures even a distance away, but Knocki also has the intelligence to filter out random vibrations.  Therefore, Knocki works under busy breakfast tables and other \"high-activity\" surfaces.\nGently Tap or Knock\nKnocki reliably identifies simple gestures defined by taps or knocks on a surface. Gestures can be defined by a quantity (two, three, four, or more taps), or even by more complex patterns (two taps + three taps) for more secure functions.\nFor example, a double tap can be set to turn on a light, and a more elaborate sequence (two triple taps followed by a double tap) can be used to unlock a smart lock.\nOne Knocki can store up to 10 unique gestures, turning any surface into a remote control with many functions.  \nA gesture can trigger a single action (e.g. \"find phone\"), or a set of actions (e.g. \"door locked\" + \"lights off\" + \"home security armed\").\nOur Patent-Pending Technology\nKnocki's performance is made possible by our suite of patent-pending technology and sophisticated software & hardware algorithms:\nKnocki deciphers deliberate taps and knocks from random vibrations in the environment to minimize false positives. \nKnocki uses non-acoustic sensor technology that is NOT triggered by or affected by sound. Thus, multiple Knockis can coexist in the same room without conflict (as long as they are on separate surfaces).  For example, you can setup one Knocki behind your nightstand, and another behind the nightstand of your partner! \nAdvanced power-budgeting delivers over 12 months of battery life using AAA batteries. (Please always use mercury free batteries, or better yet, rechargeable batteries!  We like this planet). \nSome of the Platforms Knocki Supports:\nWe're constantly adding integrations with new smart home platforms, devices, and software. Our commitment is to make Knocki more capable over time, and connected to the leading technology of tomorrow.\nKnocki's capabilities will continue to expand as we add new partners, update the mobile app, and even push out OTA hardware updates.\n  What About Voice Control?\nVoice control is everywhere. Services like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa can simplify tasks, but often don\u2019t work as expected.\nHere are a few of the problems:\nBackground sounds:  Music or a TV playing in the background can render voice-control useless. Knocki uses non-acoustic sensors so it works just as well if you\u2019re jamming to music, watching the evening news, or if people are talking in the background.\nCan Disturb Others:  Voice control is problematic in quiet environments such as a shared office or in bedrooms where you don\u2019t want to disturb others. Knocki\u2019s advanced accelerometer technology responds to gentle taps that others won\u2019t hear.\nIt Often Misunderstands: Did you say \u201cwhere is Rome\u201d or \u201cnavigate home?\u201d Voice technology is finicky, especially with kids, elderly, and people with accents who might not enunciate in the required way. Knocki uses simple tap/knock gestures, and our patent-pending technology to perform reliably whether you tap fast, slow, hard, or soft.\nCan\u2019t use multiple voice controllers in the same space: Good luck putting a voice controller on your nightstand, and then another one on your partner\u2019s nightstand. You\u2019ll have both controllers responding simultaneously creating smart home chaos. Knocki recognizes gestures on a specific surface so you can have multiple Knockis in the same room or other space without conflict. Knocki allows you to personalize controls to the surfaces near you.\n  What about Smart Switches and Buttons?\nSmart buttons and switches can also automate tasks, but they have a few \u201cpressing\u201d problems.\nDon\u2019t blend in: Wall switches and buttons aren\u2019t so pretty to look at. Knocki can be placed under or behind surfaces, so you don\u2019t even have to see it to use it. But if you do mount it within view, it blends beautifully with your surfaces.\nMust be pressed or flipped: Physical buttons and switches must be within physical reach in order to be used. Knocki turns an entire surface into a remote control, so you can trigger actions from anywhere, without needing to visually or physically locate a specific spot. (Also great for kids, physically impaired, and elderly who can\u2019t reach a switch).\nNot as reliable or responsive: Most buttons rely on Bluetooth, so they require a phone to be turned on, paired to the button, and within range in order to function. Unlike smart buttons, Knocki uses WiFi to trigger actions directly, without going through a phone. This allows Knocki to work instantly without the lag of bluetooth, and even if your phone is off.\nLimited functionality: Many smart switches/buttons only perform a single on/off function, or are limited to only a few press patterns. Knocki can provide quick and easy control of a few functions for most users, but power users can go wild with up to 10 gestures per Knocki-enabled surface, allowing their entire tables, walls, furniture and other surfaces to control thousands of devices via IFTTT, SmartThings, Wemo, and more!\n  Beautiful Inside & Out\nHere's what you get with each unit ordered:\nKnocki: Made in the USA.\nSurface Mount: Featuring our SurfaceLink\u2122 technology, the mount helps transfer gesture signals from the surface to Knocki.\n3M Tape: Working directly with 3M, we've customized and tested a secure yet removable adhesive to avoid damaging surfaces.\nAAA Duracell Batteries: Mercury-free Duracell alkaline batteries provide over 12 months of battery life.\nOur Free Companion App (iOS & Android): Only necessary for device setup. The app allows you to easily connect Knocki to your WiFi and quickly add up to 10 gestures per Knocki device. You can manage multiple Knockis from one account.  The app also allows you to monitor battery life, connectivity status, and view activity logs.\nQuick Setup Guide: Get up and running in no time!\nMaking an Impact\nKnocki can make a difference in anyone's life. However, it can be truly life-changing for people with mobility or vision impairments who are unable to reach or visually locate a switch, button, or phone. Knocki also improves accessibility for children and the elderly. \n  Rewards\nWe are thankful, honored, and humbled by the overwhelming response by our backers. Your support enables us to reach the numbers required to place our first production order at a reduced cost per unit.  It also helps us maintain our company's growth and expand our team.  \nUpdate: In order to help get Knocki out to as many people as possible, we've decided to extend our popular Super Early Bird rate for a limited period of time.\nAfter the Super Early Bird rate runs out, you'll still be able get Knocki at the higher Early Bird rate (which is also discounted), but it's worthwhile to get the Super Early Bird while you still can.\nStretch Goals   \nThe response from backers around the world to our campaign has been absolutely amazing. Your feedback and suggestions have helped us introduce new features and options you'll love!  \nStretch Goal #1: HTTP Requests & Sonos Integration  \nThis highly popular stretch goal is officially UNLOCKED!\nStretch Goal #2: Knocki Black Edition  \nBlack Edition is UNLOCKED!  \nWhile our standard Knocki is designed to look gorgeous on walls and blend well with many other surfaces, Knocki Black Edition offers a stealthier style when mounted underneath tables or behind furniture, and also complements a wide variety of surfaces.\n How to Request Black Edition (instead of the standard design):  \nBy default, all pledges are for the standard design. However, after the Kickstarter campaign is over, you'll have the option to choose whether to keep the standard design, or swap your whole order for the Black Edition. There's no additional cost to swap.  \nHow to Get Both Versions: Standard AND Black Edition:  \nStart by selecting a pledge-level for the number of Knockis you'd like with the standard design. When calculating your pledge amount total, add an additional $79 for each Black Edition you want to add. If you select a multi-pack pledge, add another $69 for each Black Edition Knocki!\nStretch Goal #3: Open API\nOur open API stretch goal is UNLOCKED! \nOur Timeline\n  Our Story\nCo-founders Jake & Ohad have been friends for years, but their \"aha moment\" happened more recently over a family get-together.  They were watching one of their small children stacking up boxes to reach a light switch.  That observation led them to ask a simple question, \"Why not turn walls and other common surfaces into control interfaces?\" \nThat was the spark that set them on their path to develop Knocki, and this Kickstarter campaign marks an exciting milestone. Building a successful company, growing a talented team, and developing an amazing product is full of hard work and perseverance, and we thank you for supporting us as we bring Knocki to the world!\n  We Couldn't Do It Alone\nOur growing team has been working hard over the past year to develop Knocki, but we couldn't have done it without the support of others!\n  Our Team\nTalent, hard work, and a great idea are a recipe for success, and our team has all three.  If there's one thing our team could use a little more of, it's sleep!  Thanks to everyone on our team for the amazing work and dedication.\n     What People Think\nPLAY\n\n     A Special Thanks\nWe'd like to give a very special thanks to Poetic Systems, for helping us develop a scalable, secure, and delightful user experience.   We'd also like to thank Film Lab Creative for creating a beautiful video!\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKnocki isn't some far-fetched idea hacked together in a garage.

You lay everything out on the counter and reach for a knife - your favorite knife. The one that\u2019s dirty, but you stop to clean it anyway. The knife that makes you a more confident and creative cook. The right knife.\nWe\u2019ve made that knife. By combining the very best of eastern and western knifemaking, we\u2019ve created an incredibly sharp, beautiful, premium blade - and we\u2019re bringing it to you for a non-premium price.\nThe right blade\nYour chef knife is central to creating nearly every dish. Whether you\u2019re mincing chives, or cutting apart a whole chicken, the chef knife can do it all.\nHowever, your choices at the store are confusing. Cheap knives are clunky to use and dull quickly. Even if you're willing to spend more, unfamiliar features and a wide spectrum of prices can make the options overwhelming. Finding the right blade can be a frustrating experience, but we don\u2019t think that needs to be the case.\n An incredible knife for a fair price \nThe world of chef knives is out of date. The big knife brands are operating on outdated sales margins that inflate the price of knives sold at a retail store. By avoiding the traditional retail sales model and bringing our product to you directly online, we have created a great knife for a fraction of the price.\nDon\u2019t waste your money on a knife block filled with knives you\u2019ll never use. Get the one knife you\u2019ll reach for again and again.\nComparison of the costs that go into bringing you a knife\nOne great blade\nA good knife stays sharp and is comfortable to use. A great knife is the one you reach for.\nWe\u2019ve put a ton of attention into how people hold and use their knives, and we think we\u2019ve designed the ultimate hybrid. A knife that takes the best elements of western and eastern knifemaking, and combines them into one blade.\nAfter experimenting with dozens of blade profiles, grip shapes and types of steel, we\u2019ve created an incredibly sharp blade that feels right at home in your hand. A long deep belly helps with effortless chopping, while the lowered tip makes slicing and finer work more approachable.\n  Grip & Bolster \nThe grip and bolster are designed with intention. The contour of the grip makes it feel secure regardless of your preferred grip style or the the size of your hands. Olive Wood - a durable hardwood - keeps the handle grippy whether it's wet or dry.\nEven when holding the blade in a pinch grip, a thumb groove in the bolster makes for a more confident and comfortable grip on the blade.\nA well balanced blade.\n Layered Steel\nThe vast majority of stainless steel blades are made with soft steel that won\u2019t hold an edge. Our blade has a cutting core made of Japanese VG-10 steel. This innovative high-carbon stainless steel holds an incredible edge and won\u2019t corrode like other high carbon steels.\nThis cutting core is then sandwiched in 66 layers of alternating stainless steels. This technique - sometimes referred to as \u201cSan Mai\u201d which is used in traditional Japanese sword making - allows the VG10 to be used for the edge while the other layers form a jacket around it. This layering protects the cutting core, while providing a beautiful layered finish on the faces of the blade.\nHow sharp? Very sharp. \nMany knives on the market are sharp, but few stay that way for long. Being as sharp as possible isn\u2019t necessarily best, particularly if you\u2019re trading off the knife\u2019s ability to retain that sharp edge. A scalpel may be sharper than a kitchen knife, but it would dull quickly.\nIf your steel is too hard it becomes brittle, and if your edge angle is too fine it will dull quickly. We experimented until we found the right steel and edge profile that maximizes edge retention. The result is a blade that\u2019s razor sharp and stays that way.\nOur steel is hardened to between 57-59 rockwell hardness, which allows for a more finely sharpened edge. The blade is then tapered to a 17 degree edge angle, allowing you to glide through even the toughest of root vegetables.\n  Testing\u2026 Testing... \nWe\u2019ve tested our blade with both chefs and home cooks to develop something that feels intuitive for everyone. After more than a year of designing, prototyping, testing, and manufacturing samples we\u2019re ready to go to production. Dozens of revisions have helped us to develop a knife we can\u2019t wait to share with the world.\nStretch Goals\nCustom textured ABS Blade Guard.

As a result, many Japanese products such as copper and raw silk are collected in Yokohama for export to other countries. At the same time, the city is starting to incorporate foreign technology and culture, with even the streets becoming more modernized. In the shadow of this development was the presence of many Yokohama merchants.\nIn YOKOHAMA, each player is a merchant in the Meiji period, trying to gain fame from a successful business, and to do so they need to build a store, broaden their sales channels, learn a variety of techniques, and (of course) respond to trade orders from abroad.\nRahdo's Final Thoughts\n  Yokohama is the most exciting euro game for me (Michael Mindes) since playing Orl\u00e9ans, and I personally want a copy with all of the deluxe components.\nOur previous Backers for Orl\u00e9ans are extremely pleased with their purchase, and we want to make this deluxified style of game available again.\nThe additional cost for the deluxe components matches our cost with no additional profit, to make them and deliver to you the backer. For this reason, TMG expects to make this deluxe version only once. We will make enough for Kickstarter Backers, some replacement copies, and some convention sales.\nMan Vs Meeple Coverage\n  Upgraded Components\n  From cardboard to metal coins.\nImproved Graphic Design\n        UNLOCKED - $325,000 - Add silk screening to the silk pieces:\nUNLOCKED -  $425,000 - Upgrade Foreign Agents (mercs) to be wooden blocks with flag stickers\nWe really love YOKOHAMA at TMG, which is why we are publishing it. In fact, it is part of the reason that we worked diligently to license the game from Mr. Hayashi and Kickstart it within 7 weeks of first playing the game.\nOf course, we also really want you to buy YOKOHAMA, so I recommend you check out what others are saying.\nUndead Viking's Review:\n Thoughts From Folks At Origins\n  Yokohama is a game for 2-4 Players, and can be played in 60-90 min.\nA turn in Yokohama is very simple, you place 2-3 assistants, then Activate your President, choose to fulfill any orders you can, maybe activate a mercenary...turn over.  The beauty in this game is how much depth of play emerges from those simple choices in the game environment.\nUndead Vikings Setup and How To Play:\n In the video above Game Setup is covered until 7:40 after which game play is explained as well as details for each Area and Management Board.\nRahdo's Runthrough:\n  Click Here to read the Rulebook.\n The linked rulebook above is the current English rulebook, however TMG will be making a few edit's and changes. While the majority of the game play will stay the same, there will be a few very minor updates to the Two Player game.\nAll deluxe copies of YOKOHAMA will be pre-packaged at the factory with a layer of bubble wrap and an additional box for protection during shipping.\nWe have all had that bad shipping experience, and we don't want that to happen with your game... Depending on where you live in the world, we are getting your Deluxe YOKOHAMA to you in the best ways that we know how:\nUSA - YOKOHAMA will be shipped in bulk to Amazon, and then promptly sent out to you as a Backer.\nCANADA - YOKOHAMA will be shipped in bulk to Snakes & Lattes, and then shipped to you from them inside of Canada.\nEUROPE - YOKOHAMA will be shipped in bulk to Ideaspatcher in France (with VAT paid upon import) and then shipped to you as a Backer from France.\nAUSTRALIA - YOKOHAMA will be shipped in bulk to our shipping partner in Australia, and then shipped on to you.\nBRAZIL - YOKOHAMA shipping will be handled by our \"tandem\" publishing partner Kronos. Kronos will import all of the games, get Portuguese materials added, and then ship the games to you.\nASIA (CHINESE SPEAKING) - YOKOHAMA shipping will be handled by our \"tandem\" publishing partner Mr. Dexker. Mr. Dexker will get Chinese language materials added, and then ship the games to you from Hong Kong.\n SaveSaveSave", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTasty Minstrel Games (TMG) has delivered numerous games throughout the world.

Too bulky so we scratched that.\nFailed Prototypes in the early days.\nIt started with a college student who had too many devices in her flat. My laptops, camera, smartphones, power bank, table, stereo \u2026 they all need be plugged in, usually at the same time. There was really not much space to spare in my tiny apartment; the bulky power strips I used was just taking a lot of unnecessary space, not to mention the thick messy cables flying all around.\nAs a frequent traveller, I know that travel adapter is a necessity on the trip. But not many people realize that power strip, is also a necessity. We complain that there\u2019s not enough electric socket or USB charging port at the airport and in the hotel. The reality is, we need power strips while traveling, but we don\u2019t bring them. And the reason is simple: Power strips, or power cubes, are way too bulky; and they aren\u2019t able to adapt to different socket types. The fact is, there is no power strip on the market, Kickstarter projects included, that is able to keep its cord under control: cord storage and length adjustability are essential, but lacking in all the power strips out there.\nThe idea of MOGICS Power Donut (and Bagel, which is an universal version of Donut - UK, EU, AU, US) is to design something elegant and powerful. Integrating with the MOGICS Adapter, we are able to combine both the functions of a power strip and a travel adapter - both of which are conventionally big and bulky - to create the perfect travel solution, with added perks such as Integrated Length-adjustable Cord, spare Safety Fuse, dual USB ports supporting Fast Charge, as well as an ergonomically designed AC plug -- all this, light and slim enough to slide effortlessly in your pocket.\nOn the other hand, when I\u2019m not traveling, MOGICS Power Donut serves as the best power strip (or power ring) in my daily life; keeping my desk neat and impeccably organized. Sharing the power on-the-go, and saving the space when you're alone.\nIntegrated Safety Fuse \nApart from the integrated Safety Fuse we already installed inside, for added security, an additional spare fuse (also 6.3A) is stored within MOGICS Power Donut as well as Bagel. \nDual USB Fast Charge \nSupports 2.0A USB Fast Charge, and with 2 USB ports, MOGICS Power Donut and Bagel gives you a more efficient charging experience. \nLED Power Indicator\nA brilliant blue LED indicator lights up when Donut or Bagel is plugged into an AC socket source; when you see blue light, you'll know power is connected.\nRevolutionary Cord Design\nWith a rolling mechanism developed by MOGICS, AC cord storage has never been so compact. A 3 feet ( 92 cm ) Right-Angled Cord is integrated in Donut and Bagel, completed with unique Auto-lock Cord Stoppers to adjust the length of the cord to keep it all neat and organized. No more messy flying cords. \nErgonomic Plug Structure\nWe conceive and create MOGICS products to the finest details.

Maceration is a technical term that involves giving the various fragrance ingredients time to bond and react.

It's most commonly made from of the incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products such as tar; that's right, TAR! It's a product that is labeled as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\nInk isn't only made of pigments, a considerable amount of ink is made up of binders, carriers, and solvents. Most carriers are petroleum oil, while most solvents used in inks are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), all of which have detrimental human and environmental impacts.\nThe Solution\nDevelop an ink that is safe and sustainable. Living Ink is produced in cells using sunlight and CO2 from the atmosphere; its only byproducts are oxygen and clean water. This means Living Ink is actually great for the environment. Living Ink is the first step in weaning the world off of regular ink and moving towards a safe and renewable solution.\nIf you love science too, or want to know even more about the technical details behind Living Ink, shoot us an email. We\u2019re scientists at heart and we love talking shop, anytime.\nWhile researching and developing our sustainable algae ink to replace the regular ink we use everyday something unexpected happened\u2014the ink changed from one day to the next.\nAs scientists, we began analyzing the \u201cproblem.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long for us to realize that this \u201cLiving Ink\u201d was really cool.\nAfter sending Grandma Elle a Living Ink birthday card, seeing how much our kids loved drawing their favorite stories, and watching actual artists use it in creative ways, we knew we had to share it with the world.\nWe are here on Kickstarter because it\u2019s a creative community that supports art and science. Until this point, we\u2019ve been deep in the science (something to the tune of 10 years studying and researching algae). But, our goal has always been to see something useful result from all of that research.\nWe know that Living Ink will be incredibly useful to all types of people, but we need help to take this from R&D to actual product.\nThat\u2019s where the Kickstarter community comes in. The majority of funds for this project will go directly to manufacturing the world\u2019s first pen that writes in algae. The remaining pledges will allow us to purchase materials and produce components in bulk, in order to get the cost low enough to get Living Ink into the hands of all you artists, creatives, inventors, DIY'ers, and genuinely interesting people.\nEnvironmental Protection\nIf you haven\u2019t figured it out already, our Living Ink is made of Algae. Algae is the planet\u2019s superfood\u2014critical to the existence of thousands of species, the water we drink, and countless other life sustaining functions. It is our priority to ensure that our ink helps protect the environment through responsible business practices, and through educating our customers about the importance of maintaining a healthy ecosystem.  \nEmpowering Storytellers\nEven before we had ink, humans were sharing their past, explaining their present, and dreaming up their future through stories. The desire to be understood transcends all cultures and eras. It\u2019s our goal to continue to inspire and empower storytellers to excel at their craft.\nSharing Science\nWe believe that science is the most exciting way to improve our lives. We hope that our project will inspire the next generation of scientists to turn research into awesome products that advance society.\nScott and Steve are two scientists who have dedicated the last decade to developing new ways to use algae as ink, to replace the inks we see and use every day. Steve is the mad scientist. For him, if it\u2019s not a well-documented process, then it\u2019s not worth doing. Scott is the Clark Kent of Science. Sometimes he\u2019s just a normal nerdy guy, and then he turns into this scientific super hero of sorts. They teamed up with some of their smartest friends to help them pull off this Kickstarter campaign. Jared and Tyler are the creative force behind this campaign and the products we'll be shipping out. If you spot one of the many small details of awesomeness, it surely was their doing. David brought to the team his proven Kickstarter strategy that he has honed while \"monkii'ing\" around. He tells our story in a way that has propelled Living Ink as a brand and product to new heights.\nMost importantly, it took friends and family to fill in the gaps. Now, we look to the Kickstarter community to join our team and make Living Ink come to life!\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1. Ink formulation stability.\nWe have developed the first pen formulation that is capable of growing and we are really excited about this. We also have added other components to the ink so that you can see where you are writing as you make your masterpiece. These added components disappear from the page under an hour, so that your message becomes a mystery to anyone but you. This formulation has been quite a challenge for us to get perfect, and any deviation from this formulation may change the rate at which the ink grows. We\u2019re constantly working on ways to ensure that this isn\u2019t a problem when we ship out the product and this successful Kickstarter will help ensure nothing but the best product leaves our lab. \n \n2 Variability in growth conditions.\nWhile our inks can grow in low light and cool conditions, they\u2019d much rather have bright light and warm temperatures all day long. Here at Living Ink we are dedicated to clearly communicating how much light is required and the right temperature for your ink to grow the way we say it does. Low light conditions and cooler temperatures may cause your ink to grow slower than expected. While we currently use an algae strain that is sensitive to these changing conditions, we are also researching other species of algae that allow for a much wider range of light and temperature conditions.\n\n3. Shipping logistics.\nWe package living algae cells into the pens that are shipped to your door. These microscopic organisms are very robust, but conditions outside of their comfort level can cause them to die, which doesn\u2019t make for good growing ink. We believe that our scientists have developed formulations that prepare the cells to live in dark conditions for long periods of time, but problems in the shipping process and/or cold weather may cause the ink to improperly function once you start using them. Not to worry, though. We\u2019re on it and believe that when you get your ink, there will be more than enough live algae cells to make your images come to life, no matter how long it takes to get to your door!\n\n4.

As caretakers for kodama, the tree spirits, you must keep the forest a healthy and lush home for your little friends. Over three growing seasons, you must cultivate trees with the right mix of flowers, insects, and branch arrangements to make your kodama as happy as possible. Whoever cares for their kodama best will be remembered for generations!\nFrom the designer of the hit game Kigi, Kodama branches out into a fun new way to play! Grow your tree by placing cards in clever arrangements, being careful to leave room for future growth. At the end of each season, one kodama will award you points for how well your tree suits its needs. With beautiful art and innovative mechanics, Kodama is an inTREEguing game for the whole family.\nKodama: The Tree Spirits is the newest Small Box/Big Fun game from Action Phase Games, playing in under 45 minutes for 2-5 players. We encourage you to view the videos directly below for more information. Or simply peruse our rule book here.\n \nThe Deluxe Edition of the game includes the below components in addition to the ones above:\nThe story of Kodama is an interesting one indeed. Initially, we sought to publish Daniel's game Kigi, but felt we could help to develop a few elements of the game. Two months later, we realized that we had a much different game than Kigi and Kodama took seed! (You can read more about this here in Daniel's Design Diary.)\nWhile both games come from similar roots, Kodama provides a very different game experience from its predecessor.\nHere are the differences in Kigi and Kodama:\nTHEME: In Kodama, players cultivate homes (trees) for the kodama.\nPLACEMENT: In Kodama, there is no pruning, but rather a 10 point scoring cap for placement that encourages diversity while leaving players with a beautiful tree by the end of the game. Additionally, players now only place branches on their own trees.\nFEATURES: Not only are all of the features updated to help represent the theme, there are now six features as opposed to five.\nGOALS: In Kigi, goals came in the form of Commission cards that were shuffled into the branch deck. Now, players are dealt four kodama cards, three of which they will score over three seasons.\nSEASONS: Play is now divided into three seasons: Spring, Summer, and Fall. At the beginning of each season a Decree will be revealed which will add or amend a rule in the game--adding more replayability and strategy to placement. After placing four branches, players will select one of their Kodama cards to score. At the end of three seasons, players score a final Kodama card and a winner is determined!\nKodama: The Tree Spirits is the fifth project from Action Phase Games and was designed by the very talented Daniel Solis. With the successful execution of our first four projects, we have become experienced as publishers. We will confidently execute this project to the same high standard.\nThe deluxe edition, containing additional content and upgraded components, will not be available in retail.\nDaniel Solis has successfully designed a game that is accessible to gamers of all ages and levels of experience. Kodama is innovative while remaining easy to learn and play. Because of these factors, we have every confidence that this game will be played for years to come.\nPeople who have demoed and play-tested this game have uniformly loved it for its original mechanics, charm, artistic beauty, and accessibility. While the game takes under 45 minutes to teach and play, it offers a surprising amount of tactical depth and replay value.\nAll of the art assets (with the exception of the 3 Become a Guardian pledge levels) are complete.\nThe game is full of charming illustrations by the extremely gifted Kwanchai Moriya, with graphic design by the equally talented Scott Hartman.\nNot only do we offer free shipping in the US, but this project is EU friendly, too.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge.\nFor example, if you pledge $19 to help back the project \u2014 we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any over-funding goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. You'll get access weeks before it's made available to everyone else!\nPledge levels vary from just $1 to several hundred dollars. And each different level opens up a new creative reward.

In our first campaign, we encountered a handful of issues due to third-party partners and elements outside of our control.

Future pre-orders and add-ons can be made on our website.\nDesigned by Jamey Stegmaier (Viticulture & Euphoria) and based on the art and worldbuilding of Jakub Rozalski, Scythe is a 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) set in an alternate-history, 1920s Eastern Europe. Scythe tells the stories of 5 factions competing over an unclaimed patch of land surrounding the mysterious Factory.\nDuring Scythe's 750+ blind playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:\nthe dual benefits of the upgrade system (increase an action benefit and decrease a cost)\nthe distinctly different faction and mech abilities\nthe thematic choices presented by the encounter cards\nthe asymmetry and variability created by random pairings of faction and player mats\nthe twist to area control due to all resources being kept on the board\nCheck out the Scythe rules and playtest print-and-play files to see how Scythe blends an engine-building system inspired by Terra Mystica with a deterministic combat system influenced by Kemet. Renders of the 25 miniatures in Scythe are below the \"What's in the Box?\" image.\nTo add items onto your pledge, manually add the $ amount during the project. We don't use a pledge manager, so all pledges must be made in full by November 5. You can mix and match up to 3 total games (any version) and any number of add-ons. On the post-project survey, you will tell us the various items that comprise your pledge.\nEach player is represented on the board by a character and their animal companion (1 miniature). Each character miniature has a 25mm base and a height of 36-58mm.\nEach faction has 4 mechs in their faction color that can be deployed during the game. Each mech miniature has a 30mm base and a height of 26-36mm.\nThis is an example of a faction mat (the Rusviet faction). This shows your faction's special ability, starting military strength, mech abilities, and one-time recruit benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                        This is an example of a player mat (\"Patriotic\"). Each player mat is divided into four sections, each with a top-row action and a bottom-row action. Your actions improve as you build your economic engine.\nThe highly detailed game board for Scythe (full board on left, sample territory on right) depicts the areas near the mysterious Factory. This is a fully-formed world with a specific story, so the board is not modular (see FAQ for more details).\n                                             All promo items are included in every Kickstarter game for free and will be available for additional cost post-Kickstarter (there is no Kickstarter-exclusive content).

We'll even pay for return shipping.\nThe Factory promo pack contains 6 extra Factory cards for Kickstarter backers. The promo pack will be available for an additional cost to those who discover Scythe after the Kickstarter campaign.\nIt may not be these exact Factory cards that end up in the promo pack.\nThe custom metal coins  (80 total) featured in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games were designed specifically for Scythe. The set of coins is available for order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $22.\nThe plastic resource containers (4 total) in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games allow for easy storage, setup, and distribution of the various tokens and coins in Scythe. There's room for exactly 4 of these containers in the Scythe box.\nPlastic container with coin prototypes.\nThe board extension in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions slides next to the back side of the game board, creating a complete board with +50% bigger hexes (the content is the same; see Update 3). All units and resources in Scythe are kept on the board, so the larger hexes provide more space.\nThe game board is 624x818mm, and it grows to 818x936mm with the extension. It is available as an add-on to any copy of the game for $10 (every game board is double-sided) and will be available to order from our website by itself for $12 (+ shipping) after the project ends.\nThe realistic resource tokens (made out of resin or zinc) in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions replace the wooden resource tokens (there are no wooden resource tokens in those editions). They include 80 tokens (20 each) for food, metal, oil, and wood. These tokens are available in our treasure chests (one in each chest), as well as in an add-on to any copy of the game for $21.\nThe individually-numbered boxes in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions are randomly assigned. The limit of these boxes will be determined by the total number of backers at those levels.\nThe art book included with the Art Connoisseur Edition is a 100-page, full-color, hardback collection of the art featured in Scythe, as well as other pieces in Jakub Rozalski's acclaimed 1920s series. The book will measure approximately 250x290mm. It's available for pre-order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $23. The art book will be packed externally from the game box.\nThe wooden resource tokens aren't in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions, so if you want both one of those games and wooden resources (or if you just want extra resources with any version of Scythe), please add $10 to your pledge. This is for an external pack of 20 food/grain, 20 metal, 20 wood, and 20 oil tokens.\nSamples on the left; final colors on the right.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge (a mix of any 3 versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add more games beyond the first (or add-ons), manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nAn example of an encounter card. When your character reaches certain parts of the board, they encounter a situation that gives you a choice of one of the three options.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Jamey at stonemaiergames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information. After the campaign, you can reserve retail copies of Scythe by contacting our distribution broker: paul@greaterthangames.com\nAn example of an objective card. Each player receives 2 objectives at the beginning of the game and can complete one of them as a goal.\nJamey Stegmaier is the designer of Scythe, Viticulture, Tuscany, and Euphoria.

Chandler, and features original Scythe music composed by Micha\u0142 Wo\u017aniak. The gif explaining the board extension was designed by Bryce Walter and reduced in size for faster loading times by Bruce Alcorn.\nPlaytesters: The development process for Scythe featured over 750 blind playtests and 628 individual playtesters. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of them, especially to Barry Schmaling (who built the playtester forum) and all of the lead playtesters. They had a lot to say about Scythe, but here are a few of our favorite quotes:\n\u201cFarm your little piece of the world, spread out and colonise as much as you can, or rampage with mechs projecting lethal force over your opponents. This game has it all and with so many routes to victory, no two games are the same.\u201d \u2014 Stephen \u2018Azrael\u2019 Ogden\n\u201cScythe is an excellent blend of resource management and conflict which also manages to leave you with a delightful sense of having told a story.\" \u2014 Andrew Busam\n\u201cThe Automa is challenging, relentless, and at times unforgiving, but it's also a whole lot of fun. It's a worthy adversary that earns a begrudging respect.\u201d \u2014 Jeremiah Power\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory or unrelated products as add-ons through Kickstarter, we offer other Stonemaier products on our website. These items will ship right away and cannot be held until Scythe ships.\nViticulture, Tuscany, Euphoria, Between Two Cities, and our treasure chests are also available from your friendly local game store.\nJamey's book, A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide: Build a Better Business by Building Community, is available in a number of online and offline locations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Stonemaier Games, Jamey Stegmaier has raised over $1.4 million on Kickstarter and has delivered over 20,000 individual rewards to backers within a few months of the estimated delivery date (most are on time or early). He is an avid backer and gamer, and his book about crowdfunding was published in September 2015: http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/book/\n\nHowever, Scythe presented three specific new challenges: miniatures, shipping, and balance.\n\nThis is our first time working with plastic miniatures. We had heard horror stories about other projects involving miniatures, and we've experienced a few as backers. So we wanted to start early to avoid some of the delays that can occur as the result of miniatures. We started working with Jakub and his 3D modelers in March, using Shapeways to print each version of the sculpts to see how they worked on the game board. We also worked closely with Panda's team throughout the process to make sure the sculpts are feasible and durable. We've created the molds for the miniatures and are ready for production.\n\nWe've picked up and dropped fulfillment partners over time, keeping those who pack our games well and excel at communication. Because shipping is particularly important for Scythe\u2014a big game with a box that we want delivered in pristine condition\u2014we tested out two new-to-us fulfillment partners (Funagain in the US and Snakes & Lattes in Canada) on our previous project in preparation for Scythe. We add those two to Ideaspatcher in Europe, Good Games in Australia, and Agility in China, all three of which we've worked on in the past and have had excellent results.\n\nOne of the main features of Scythe's gameplay is asymmetry between factions. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game, so after we got Scythe to a good place with local playtesters, we ran 3 different waves of multi-player blind playtesting and 2 waves of solo blind playtesting. The huge amount of anecdotal and quantitative data we collected as a result helped us ensure that Scythe is extremely well balanced (and fun!).\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/full-list-chronological/ to see 160+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Scythe Modular Board", "update_content": "Hi!

We will be in touch with all backers shortly after the campaign has ended.\nThank you all!!\nThe ONELID Team\n\n\nONELID\nThe world\u2019s first truly universal multifunction lid that actually looks good and works like a dream. Once you try this - we promise you\u2019ll never want to go back to using your old lids. Well maybe for drumming that is...\nONELID was originally spawned by the ambition to make a lid that would minimize the risk of over boiling - but along the way we learned there were so many more annoying things related to the regular lids we use, like finding a lid that fits, burning hands and difficulties draining.\nMeet ONELID \n\nThe only lid that is :\nUniversal - will fit most of your pots (up to 22 cm/8.75\" diameter).\nReduces over boiling -  intelligent groove system will let out just the right amount of excess steam.\nHas an integrated strainer \u2013 draining a pot has never been easier or safer, just grab your pot or pan and pour.\n\nDoes not transfer heat - even when boiling for extended amount of time the ONELID handle stays cool to the touch.  \n\nMakes no sound - soft on the outside - yet sturdy on the inside makes for safe handling and silent operation.\nDanish Design at its best - we are pretty proud to have fit all these features into a design this modern, sophisticated and elegant.\nIs dishwasher safe - naturally...\nSo, if you are like us, and would like to get your hands on one of the first ONELIDS, please sign up - and we will do our utmost to make your cooking experience easier, safer and more enjoyable for years to come. For a little more in-depth knowledge - please read on...  \nONELID - HOW DOES IT WORK?\nSIZE - having trouble finding a lid to fit?\nNot to mention the cacophony of noisy metal striking metal when desperately trying to find the right lid inside your kitchen cabinet? ONELID offers 4 ingenious features combined with great modern design in one elegant lid that will fit all your existing pots (up to 22 cm/8.75\").\nEver experienced boiling over?\nDepending on what you\u2019re cooking, every pot will tend to over boil if you turn the heat up too high. The bigger the pot - the more steam is let out. ONELID greatly reduces this tendency by letting out just the right amount of excess steam. The intelligently designed grooves on the underside of ONELID are shaped to match the size of your pot and release just the right amount of steam to prevent over-boiling. Simple :) \nAnd you know the moisture that drips from your current lids onto the stovetop? ONELIDs patented convex underside ensures the drops that form will run back into your pot, so your stovetop stays cleaner.\nDraining  - no more burned fingers or spilled pasta in your sink\nTired of burning your fingers on metal/glass lids during cooking or while pouring? Ever tried sliding your conventional lid a little to the side allowing that boiling water to drain, but ended up soaking your pot holders and getting peas and pasta into the sink? Yeah - who hasn\u2019t!\n\nWell no more. Because of the unique air-vents doubling as strainer (draining) holes, you now have trouble-free draining. ONELIDs silicone surface ensures great friction against the pot so your ONELID will stay centered and safe \u2013 even when held vertically. Your peas and pasta will remain in the pot where they belong.\nPerfect for casseroles too. The ONELID handle have taken many forms to reach this final design. ONELID now boasts superior ergonomics - both for 1 and 2-handle pots. And with a diameter of 23 cm/9\" ONELID will cover all you pots up to 3,5 liters. (covering 90-95 % of all private cooking). \nJust check your old pot diameters before signing up.\nHeat distribution - cool to the touch\nThis FLIR-photo comparison shows how much better the heat distribution of ONELID works compared to a steel lid (and btw. glass lids are the same). Other than the hotter steam areas (away from the handles) the ONELID handle has the same temperature as the room and is barely affected by the boiling process within. No matter where you grip ONELID, your fingers are safe from burning. The better insulation will also save you power !\nEarly tests on temperature...\nPLAY\n\nCHECK OUT THE VIDEO BELOW HIGHLIGTING THE MAIN FEATURES \nPLAY\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\nThe initial idea behind ONELID was spawned by professional chef, and ONELID co-creator, Sylvester Vantore. He observed how chefs would use tin foil as a substitute for the right size pot lid. This simple technique furthermore had the adjustability to let out just the right amount of excess steam in order to reduce over-boiling. Although functional, it\u2019s not very practical nor pretty. Understanding that there must be a better way, Sylvester eventually came up with the idea of an oversized lid (to fit varying pot sizes) designed with under-lid grooves to allow excess steam to escape.\nSylvester brought this discovery to the attention of prominent Danish designer, Martin Sonne. Martin eagerly took up the challenge to make the 'perfect lid'. From that point on, the lid began to evolve, but it would be years before the form and function were perfected.\n\nCHALLENGES PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES\nWe knew we had to let out just enough steam to minimize the risk of over boiling without wasting energy so we added some more grooves and came up with the 'swing' to the channels so the vent holes 'adjusts' to the diameter of the pot. Small pot, small holes - larger pot, larger holes. It was only during early tests that we discovered that the vent holes provided the perfect effect for straining. And again - the bigger the pot the faster the water is let out so it was a win-win.  \nWe also came up with the now patented convex underside in order for the lid to fit multiple pot sizes. This had added benefits too: The lid will 'automatically' center on any pot and stay securely in place - and it takes very little effort to hold while pouring because it more or less 'hangs' from the friction created by the silicone. The condensed steam forming on the underside of the lid will flow back into the pot and not onto your stove top.\nEven though it didn't exactly made things easier, requiring the silicone surface was a big priority. The benefits are many: 260 \u00b0C (500 \u00b0F) heat resistance, non-stick easy clean-up, non-toxic, and very resistant to microbiological growth. Add to that, ONELID makes a fashion statement in any kitchen. It not only looks and feels great, ONELID provides exceptional ergonomics, because the friction created when the lid is on the pot is far superior to metal. You\u2019ll immediately feel the difference when you handle the pot - the lid just stays more securely in place.\nTHE PROCESS\nAlong the way we have tested several designs. Below is an array of the various designs and prototypes ranging from the first 360 degree design through to a more solid design - unfortunately proving impossible to make but leading the way to the beautiful final design we have today.\nTHE PRODUCTION\nFinally we have the details right - It did take us years of work and a skilled manufacturer. A true professional and we even needed to go to the other side of the world to find him. Kenny is his first name, KONG his surname. We call him \"King Kong\" as he helped us nail the final procedure. So we worked out a 4 part procedure to make a lid with 4 functions - makes sense :) \nStep 1 : Mold inner core in nylon with Stainless insert\nStep 2 : Full silicone overmold\nStep 3 : Mold lower handle in ABS\nStep 4 : Mold upper handle in ABS\n\nMount and UV weld, pack and ship to you guys in the sturdy packaging so you too can start enjoying the ONELID life ;)\n\nTHE IP\nONELID holds a patent based on the concave shape and the ingenious groove system on the lower side.\nMore to this we have applied for a design protection since we find it worth the money to try and  protect the signature design by Martin. There will be copies sooner or later - but we aver none with the qualitiy of our design, material composition and finish.\n\nMILESTONES\nSeptember         Kickstarter campaign launch\nOctober              Mold start-up\nDecember          Production 1 roll.\nJanuary 2016     Production start - start shipping\nFebruary  2016  Shipping done \nApril 2016          Shipping Glass lids\nABOUT US\nMartin Sonne - with more than 20 years of designing products and working with visual communication, Martin is still striving for the simplest solutions to the most complex problems. Designing ONELID has been a journey in just that - trying to fit all these unique features into a lid so simple and so clean that one would think it is just another lid. Staying within that comfort zone of what people expect a lid to look like and then add a little evolution on top seemed to be the right approach.\nSylvester Vantore - the man with the 1000 ideas. Sylvester is on a quest to make good things better; To find that little thing that will make a normal item become a unique item. Being a chef and having learned from the best (Rasmus Kofoed - world champion chef 2011) Sylvester knows what makes for good kitchen tools. So it comes as no surprise that he was the man to invent ONELID.\nWe couldn't have done this alone though. With great production expertise and patience from Lars Forsberg (from Danish company Fabrikators) we are now ready to move into production. \nWant to know more about Fabrikators go to www.fabrikators.com\n\nAnd Kenny Kong the man will make sure tooling and production is second to none once we get there. \nSo 5 years down the road and we are ready to let you guys take us the rest of the way. We can't tell you how much we want this to happen. We want to let the world try how cooking can be if you have the right tools. This lid is made like it should have been in the first place - ONELID - is all you need.

In Virgin Seas you control a fleet of ships in a race to discover and control islands in the uncharted oceans. Confront, and seize control, of your opponents vessels in this quick and strategic game of area control. But you are not alone in the ocean! Deep below the Kraken awaits, and when she arrives the game ends!\nEach player draws from their own personal fleet deck. Each fleet deck is the same. Most of these cards are ships, but there are three islands in each deck. Players control when and where these islands appear on the board and thus can place them to their own advantage. Islands simply have a set point value that players will score at the end of the game if they control the seas surrounding it. However, whenever you place an island card, you must draw an event card. Events often reward the player with a unique strategic action, but there are three Kraken cards in the deck, and when all three are revealed, the game ends immediately! \nMore game info below in the Overview Section, including a FREE Print & Play, Draft Rules Download, and a Tutorial Video!\nWhy Pledge Now? \nDiscount - By backing Virgin Seas you will get your copy at a nice discount.

Unfortunately he and his crew met their untimely end before being able to retrieve the precious gems! Now you must collect these gems to gain fortune and fame and be crowned king of the Virgin Seas!\nRed Beard's Booty is an exciting expansion for Virgin Seas that adds a fabulous red velvet pouch, 48 beautiful gems (same type used in Dig Down Dwarf), and an instruction mat, all housed in a reusable clam-shell case. Instead of each island being worth the set amount indicated on the card, players now draw random gems from the bag and seed the island. Players draw a number of gems equal to the number on the island card. Each gem scores in a different way and this adds a new layer of strategy and excitement to the game! \nIf we fund, we promise that Virgin Seas will be a thrilling and rewarding experience for you and your family and friends. However, if we over fund we will be able to expand the game in both quality and quantity. You see, the more we raise, the more units we will be able to manufacture. This equates to a lower unit cost.

Below is a nice chart that shows the dollar amount you need to add to your pledge depending on where you live and the shipping credit that is applied at each level. Whatever the cost is to ship within the U.S. becomes a credit that is applied to Canadian, EU, and International shipping. Example: It costs $7 to ship one copy of the game within the U.S. and it costs $13 to ship the same package to Canada, so $7 is taken off the cost for Canadian Backers, thus you only have to pay $6 for shipping instead of the full $15.\n                                                                                                     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur goal is to make a quality product and we understand the challenges of doing so.

At 10-20 times brighter than your average Christmas lights, it's the most adaptable, intuitive, and portable string lighting system ever created.\nUse it absolutely everywhere...\nTake a look at any lantern on the market today and you will just see a reboot of the lanterns people have been using for millennia.\nThen came Luminoodle\u2122 (yes, we are serious about the name): the world\u2019s first completely waterproof, flexible, ultra-bright ambient lighting solution that can be hung, strung, hooked, stuck to or wrapped around basically anything.\n Luminoodle\u2122 has 2 modes...\nWhat if some nice lantern mood lighting just isn\u2019t cutting it?! Well, just take it out of the bag and unwrap the 5 ft of LEDs and wrap it, strap it, magnet it, or loop it to whatever you have handy!\nCustom Noodle Ties\nLuminoodle\u2122 comes with 3 custom-designed Noodle Ties\u2122 which make it easy to tie around anything. They\u2019re tough, easy to use, and can be doubled up to wrap around larger objects.\nLight up your entire campsite.\nIt Has Magnets\nLuminoodle\u2122 comes equipped with 2 built-in heavy duty magnets (one at each end) and a magnet that can slide to any position. You can use the magnets to stick to your car, canopy, or anything else magnetic. Additionally, the magnets snap to each other making it simple and tangle-free to stuff into the bag for lantern or storage.\nBring light to your auto repairs.\nYou Can Loop It Too\nA utility loop on one end allows to you loop it over a nail or loop it around itself which just adds to the multiple ways you can use Luminoodle! \nLoop it around yourself and be seen on those dark streets.\nRip-Stop Nylon Bag \nIn the included rip-stop nylon bag, Luminoodle\u2122 acts just like a lantern by diffusing light and spreading it 360 degrees. It definitely makes for some killer mood lighting. Just wrap Luminoodle around the Lithium 4400 battery pack or any other portable USB battery pack, turn it on, and stuff it in.\nIt's Waterproof\nUnlike your average noodle, Luminoodle\u2122 won\u2019t get soggy when left in water. The LED strip is completely encased in a high quality single-piece silicone tube, and capped and glued with even more silicone to make for an IP67-rated waterproof light. IP67 means it can withstand submersion in water up to 3 feet, covering most activities short of SCUBA diving.\n If you don\u2019t already have a portable battery, or are in the mood for an upgrade, we\u2019re offering Luminoodle Plus\u2122 which comes with our most popular rechargeable battery pack, the Lithium 4400.\nWith this battery you can charge any USB device at up to 2A, and get up to 6 hours of lighting with Luminoodle. The Lithium 4400 also has a built in LED strip, making for easy luminoodle setup in the dark.\n                                                Our fascination with the outdoors and obsession with simplicity completely informed the design of Luminoodle\u2122. We wanted a lighting solution that we could use anywhere. \nLuminoodle is made with twenty six, 7 lumen 3528 LED lights on a custom 5V LED strip.\nSince we wanted to make a real light, not another Christmas decoration, we decided to go with high efficiency white LEDs on a flexible circuit board.  The silicon sleeve helps to diffuse and warm the light, while providing excellent waterproofing and durability.\nEarly concept drawings on the luminoodle and noodle ties.\nAs we worked, we realized we had something much bigger than we expected, and this was not just an outdoor lighting solution. So the next big challenge was coming up with ways that the luminoodle\u2122 could be attached in a wide variety of use cases. \n3D model of the noodle tie that will go into mass production.\nWe designed a custom rubber tie that allows you to easily attach the luminoodle to any branch, pole, or other stick like object.  We also made a custom rubber slider with an embedded magnet to compliment the magnets on either end of the luminoodle\u2122.  Lastly we added the utility loop, to give an easy straight-forward way to hang the noodle without any additional pieces necessary.\n3D prints and molds of noodle tie prototypes.\nAfter numerous prototypes and tests, we are proud to present a product that truly does deliver light unlike any portable, energy-efficient light ever has before.\nAt Power Practical, we love our gadgets and we take them everywhere. Whether we are in the office, out on the town with friends, or backpacking the Rocky Mountains - we want our gadgets to stay charged.\nWe've made it our mission to develop innovative, effective & affordable energy products that shape how people view and use power in their daily lives.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Power Practical\u2019s 5th Kickstarter project.

Sleep clinics prescribe thousands of audio based techniques daily and millions of us use audio to relax each day. For the first time we can listen to our music, audiobooks or sleep techniques comfortably in bed without fear that they\u2019ll wake us back up again.\nKokoon's EEG sensors and app give clinical levels of insight and the intelligence to help you improve your sleep.\nGreat for in bed at home, on a plane or train or even in a campsite! Just put them on and press play. Kokoon looks after your sleep, optimizing your ambiance and ensuring you have the peace you need to rest.\nGreat Quality Audio\nWe've partnered with Onkyo Corporation to ensure that our product has truly world class audio. We'll be working with Onkyo's acoustic engineers to craft the perfect audio ensuring that Kokoon will be a great pair of every day headphones as well. \nOnkyo Corporation\nKokoon headphones are a great travel companion\nKokoon\u2019s Patented FlexMould Comfort system\nYour average headphone is not designed for resting. If worn for too long they get uncomfortable, get knocked into odd positions and get hot and sweaty. At Kokoon we re-imagined headphones from the ground up to really focus on complete comfort. We worked through testing hundreds of prototypes in bed to find the perfect combination of acoustic performance, wireless technology and complete comfort.\nTaking inspiration from high-tech pillows and sport shoe technology we developed our patented FlexMould Comfort system. By molding the headphone to the natural contours of the head and spreading pressure away from the sensitive regions we were able to dramatically increase the levels of comfort.\nBy relocating the headphones electronics to the headband we were able to achieve the lowest possible profile maintaining the natural shape and characteristics of the head in bed. Combining this with gel cushioning enabled us to ensure that the headphone became in essence an extra pillow for your ears.\nThe Kokoon team is committed to undertaking 10,000 hours of comfort testing to fully optimize and refine these innovations and ensure they are incredibly comfortable for everyone (not just our team!)\nTo keep the Kokoon headphones from getting hot and sweaty, we developed a system of air circulation which maintained the acoustic seal but encouraged air to circulate about the headphone cushioning to reduce heat and moisture.\nKokoon Airflow system\nKokoon\u2019s EEG sensors & App\nEEG sensors are widely used in sleep clinics and hospitals and it is regarded as the way to accurately monitor sleep. Working by detecting the tiny voltages produced by our brains they are normally large and unpractical.\nAt Kokoon we have developed our own miniaturized dry EEG sensors which require no set up and discreetly sit within the headphones. By applying the power of modern smartphone technology our algorithms are able to give clinical levels of insight into your sleep and relaxation.\nThis level of insight enables Kokoon to become truly intelligent. Kokoon adjusts your audio volume and equalization as you fall asleep so that it doesn\u2019t disturb you once asleep. Also, it adapts your audio to block out external noises and disturbances which may compromise your deep sleep.\nThe app helps you understand what audio techniques work to get you to sleep so that you can better sleep the next time.\nPLAY\n\nWe all have a natural sleep cycle. An alarm clock will wake you up regardless of when is best for you. Kokoon\u2019s intelligent alarm identifies the perfect time for you so you can start the day feeling alert and refreshed. You can use the Kokoon app to perfectly optimize a nap to maximize restorative benefit and ensure you feel refreshed. \nSelecting an optimsed nap period\nThe Kokoon app also comes with a selection of audio sleep techniques developed with sleep scientists to help you relax when you are really struggling. This intelligent library will evolve over time as the community discovers which audio works best.\n Packing down to the size of a book\nDeveloper? Academic? Hobbyist?\nAs the world\u2019s first EEG headphone the new opportunities from Kokoon are fascinating. With the developer edition you will gain access to Kokoon's clinical grade raw EEG and Kokoon\u2019s sleep states.\nImagine Kokoon for:\n\u2022 Binaural beats; changing in real time in response to your brain frequency\n\u2022 Reactive music; music evolving to your EEG response\n\u2022 Sleep Hacking; measuring, refining and optimizing your sleep\n\u2022 Lucid dream control; \n\u2022 Polyphasic sleeping\n\u2022 Learning & education\n\u2022 Meditation\n\u2022 Focus training  \nApp ideas\n Low noise EEG signals\nPLAY\n\nWho are the Kokoon team?\nThe award winning team includes sleep professionals, academics, engineers, designers and developers collectively having over 100 years experience bringing complex medical and consumer products to market. The core team recently returned from China were they were a part of HAXlr8r - the most prolific hardware accelerator working with top hardware talent from around the world.\nThe Kokoon team\nProduction timeline\nWe need you!\nWe need your support to make sure that the Kokoon headphones can fulfill their potential and bring the world better sleep. We will use funds raised on kickstarter for:  \n+Testing: Between in-house testing and beta device testing by our (opt-in) backers, we will not ship the Kokoons until we have performed at least 10,000 hours of comfort and user testing.  \n+Quality: We also need to have dedicated engineers working with our factory in Guangdong province, China full time. To ensure the highest quality product is delivered every time.  \n+Tooling: Tooling and production costs.\nPlease join us in our mission to bring the world better sleep!\nStay up to date\nFollow us on Facebook @ https://www.facebook.com/KokoonTech or twitter @SleepKokoon https://twitter.com/SleepKokoon to see what the team have been up to.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Kokoon headphones are packed with a lot of brand new technology and to cope with the challenge of bringing this new technology to market we are committing as much effort as we can afford to user testing of the Kokoon headphone to guarantee we get it right first time.\n\nA long term challenge for us is to grow our user base as much as possible. In short, the more people that use the headphones, the more data and more intelligence we will be able to pack into our App. Learning what helps people the most and refining audio relaxation to perfection.\n\nBetween our mentors at the HAX Accelerator program and our partners at Onkyo, we have a strong support system that is committed to helping us succeed.

Over the past year Bluetooth LE (low energy) technology, has unlocked entire new categories of tech gadgets, one of which are small tracking devices. We think this technology is really cool but we have yet to find a tracker that we would use on a daily basis. Inspired by the potential of this technology, we decided to design and create our own device. We know people appreciate great quality when it comes to personal items. So we created Loopio, the World's first all aluminium Bluetooth tracker and also Loopio Sport, which has been inspired by the comments we recieced from Kickstarters since we launched our project. Both trackers use our smart antenna design to maximise signal performance and functionality.\nOur frustration with existing products\nHere are the current products available. Most of them are cheap, badly designed pieces of plastic. The truth is the majority of these trackers simply don\u2019t work well enough to be used in every day life. In tests we found the main problems were lack of signal and poor battery life. This is caused by failing to utilise the current low energy bluetooth technology to its full potential.\nWhat we did\nTaking all these factors into account we designed & developed a new device, something that's built for purpose. Loopio has been designed from the ground up to be stylish, high quality and functional.\nWhat makes the Loopio design so unique?\nThe Loopio is made from aluminium. To make this possible we needed a new way to incorporate the antenna, so we decided to add the antenna in the form of a loop. This loop also doubles up as the key loop, or by which you can attach it to anything you like. Our smart antenna design combined with the latest hardware enables Loopio to achieve optimal signal stability for up to a 50m (164feet) range. We then packaged this into the smallest design possible.\nHow the Loopio works\nLoopio is Innovation\nThe Loopio is small and compact\nThanks to its intelligent flexible loop design we also managed to make the Loopio very compact. This means that when you attach your keys to the Loopio, it folds with your keys taking up minimal space, making sure it fits perfectly in your pocket.\nSuper efficient\nThanks to the low voltage bluetooth technology the Loopio is super efficient. The battery lasts for one year and is easily replaceable by the user.\nDesigned to be tough\nMade from aluminium the Loopio is designed to be tough. It's lightweight too, weighing in at just 13grams, It's also water and dust resistant.\nDesigned with attention to detail, we believe in the small details\nThe Loopio has been designed with care and attention to detail. We hope you like the design as much as we do.\n Loopio Colors\nThe Loopio is currently available in silver or black, we will be adding more colors and finishes based on stretch goals and your suggestions.\nTech Specifications \nProject Timeline\nAbout us\nNow that you've learned about Loopio, we'd like to take a moment to introduce the minds behind this project. The loopio has been designed and developed in the UK. The Loopio concept, including the antenna design, has been designed by myself and the development and prototyping stages have been a collaboration with a UK technology & research company. The manufacturing will be outsourced to China, to meet our quality and price requirements needed in order to make this project viable.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe are so excited to share Loopio with Kickstarter before anyone else. The reason we have chosen the Kickstarter platform is simple. We have put a lot of time, effort and money into the design and development of our product and we know kickstarter has the potential to give our project the momentum it needs to succeed. \nWe recognise that kickstarter has an important community of gadget enthusiasts, innovators and creators. This is why we want to share our idea with you because we feel your opinions and suggestions can really help us make this product the best it can be.\nYour funding means more than anything to us, and we hope you can all join our exciting journey. All of the funding will go towards vitally important aspects of making Loopio a reality. We truly believe that our product will be in a class of its own.\nThank You!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt has taken us nearly a year to get to were we are today with the design and development of the Loopio. It has been a great challenge to achieve such great performance in such a compact sleek design.\nThe (BLE) bluetooth low energy technology that powers the Loopio is tried and tested, this inherently reduces the amount of risk still involved during the final stages of our project.\nThe largest of our hurdles left is to fine tune and get the antenna design ready for production. To help us with this we have partnered up with a world-class manufacturer leading in implementation of bluetooth technology.\nThe last stages of our project involves final development of our app and then bringing all these elements together including tooling, testing and production. \nThe last challenge will be shipping out the product to each of our kickstarter backers. We have already researched this and have found the right logistics partner to use. We don't anticipate any complications during this stage.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Serge Beynon\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nHi I'm Serge, a creative designer.

Each year, millions of barrels of whiskey are produced and sold. As part of the distilling process, the whiskey is aged in oak barrels.\nThe whiskey is aged in these barrels for 4 years. The used barrels are salvaged, the steel bands are removed, and the staves disassembled. Finally, the staves are cut into over-sized (7/8in. x 7/8in. x 5-1/4in. minimum) pen blanks.\nMy great grandfather, Stephen Ernest Whidden, was a carpenter. He ran a carpentry shop along with Mr. Decatur and Mr. Smith on the northeast corner of Broad Street and Lincoln Terrace in Peekskill, New York back in the 1920s. My grandfather, Ernest Richard Whidden, built airplanes for a living, but in his spare time he enjoyed carpentry.\nInspired by their legacy, I decided in 2014 to begin learning about woodworking. I purchased a lathe and began to make woodturned projects such as pens, keychains, winestoppers, and bowls.\nOne of the motivating factors at our woodshop has always been using reclaimed, salvaged, and sustainable wood sources. For the most part, I collect my own wood or purchase it from local salvage companies.\nThe wood being used to create the rewards for this campaign is from salvaged whiskey barrels once used by the Jack Daniel's Distillery.\nInitially, pen making started out as a hobby. It has grown from that and turned into a full time family business. We currently run an online Etsy shop and sell items locally, but that isn't enough to provide for our growing family of 6 (and 2 cats).\nKickstarter allows for global exposure and creates permanent relationships with people who are passionate about what we create and also with potential retail buyers.\nOur goal for this campaign is to raise enough funds to fulfill all our rewards, purchase a new lathe and drill press for our shop, and to provide for monthly expenses for our family.\nI enjoy creating unique projects with a story. Each of the rewards for this campaign include an authentic piece of American distilling history. Included with each reward is a certificate of authenticity and a story that you can share with your friends.\nRemember each item is handcrafted and unique! There may be variances in wood coloring and grain. Your particular keychain or pen may look slightly different than the one in the picture. If you would like more or higher resolution pictures of the rewards, please let me know!\n\nRewards will begin shipping in July and continue until completed.\nLevel 1 - $8 Reward: Whidden's Woodshop Tote Bag\nLevel 2 - $18 Reward: Wood Keychain\nLevel 3 - $28 Reward: Ballpoint Pen\nLevel 4 - $43 Reward: Ballpoint Pen & Pencil Set\nLevel 5 - $48 Reward: Rollerball Pen\n Level 6 - $50 Reward: Bolt Action Pen\n Level 7 - $60 Reward: Fountain Pen\nLevel 8 - $200 Reward: Ultimate Handcrafted Bundle\nPens from left to right: Fountain, Rollerball, Pencil, Ballpoint Pen, Bolt-Action, Keychain on top.\nAll of our pens come in a display box with a magnetic closure.

Stretch Goal 2.5: Beer Barrel Pen Reward\nWhite Cedar salvaged from the Ortlieb's Brewery in Northern Liberties before its demolishing in 2007. This reclaimed lumber was once an integral part of the beer making operation; the brew barrel. The lumber was reclaimed by Manayunk Timber to save for making furniture and other pieces of art.

There are just a few days left, support now!\nIntroduction:\nHello Kickstarter Community! I need your help to create the future of the water bottle: a sustainable, sleek bottle that filters your water as you drink it. \nStandard reusable bottles are great for the environment and save you money that would otherwise go to over-priced and environmentally costly bottled water\u2014but it\u2019s still on you to fill them with pure, great-tasting water. \nIt\u2019s time for a better solution. \nI\u2019ve designed the WELLY Bottle to be exactly that: an easy-to-carry, reusable, BPA-free water bottle with a built-in filter made from activated and carbonized coconut shells that purifies your water as you drink it. The compressible bamboo hand-panels on the front and back not only look and feel distinctive, but they also allow you to accelerate water flow when you need it most. \nNow I just need your help to get it off the ground! \nThe Inspiration\nWELLY\u2019s story begins with my mom Ellen (my Dad called her 'Elly'), who passed away in 2012 from liver cancer after a life filled with philanthropy and community involvement in my hometown of Pittsburgh. I saw first-hand the impact that the impurities and toxins that saturate so much of our lives can have on a person\u2014a person who also taught me a lifelong lesson in the importance of doing something good for the world.\nAs painful as this experience has been, it inspired me to make something that would help people purify their lives. I had already become frustrated with the incredibly wasteful bottled water industry and decided to create a bottle that is cleaner for your body and cleaner for the environment.\nThis inspiration comes together in our name. WELLY pays tribute to the wells that symbolize humanity\u2019s long relationship with water, as well as the kinds of wells that charity: water builds in the developing world. WELLY also stands as a statement of the power of wellness in invigorating life. Finally, and for me most importantly, WELLY honors and continues the legacy begun by my dear mom Elly.\nThe Design: Purity Meets Usability\nThis starts with the highly absorbent filter, made entirely from coconut shells, that strips away chlorine, odor and other impurities that contaminate the naturally pure taste of clean water. Our filter is independently certified by the stringent standards of NSF International, which has collaborated for years with the World Health Organization on global water issues. Each filter provides two months (or 40 gallons!) of clean water, and you\u2019ll be able to find replacement filters on our website individually or as part of a subscription plan.\nWe then designed our bottle to be a joy for someone who\u2019s serious about staying hydrated while active and on the go. We know from personal experience what it\u2019s like to crave pure water after a run, a session in the yoga studio or a long hike. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve built in a bunch of unique (patent pending) features such as:\nA mouthpiece that is protected within the bottle\u2019s cap, ensuring it stays clean, yet easily accessible by tapping the bottle\u2019s trigger\nBamboo hand panels you can squeeze to accelerate water flow\nA finger loop that makes carrying your bottle by hand or on a carabiner easy and secure\nFeet on the bottle\u2019s bottom for stability\nAn opening large enough to accommodate ice cubes\nA slim profile to minimize the space required to carry the bottle in a bag or purse\nAnd, of course, the entire bottle is absolutely BPA and phthalate free.\nOur Commitment: Purification Beyond The Bottle\nWe\u2019re delighted to put the ability to purify your own water supply in the palm of your hand, but we know that the issue of water purity is global in scope as 748 million people currently don\u2019t have access to clean water. That\u2019s why we\u2019re humbled and excited to link up with charity: water, one of the world's leading organizations working on global water safety today. charity: water\u2018s work has already impacted over 5 million people in 24 countries, they operate with full transparently, and with their help, we can show you exactly what projects your money helps to fund (like this one).\n$1 of every WELLY bottle sold, and a percentage of every future filter sold, will go straight to charity: water, where 100% of the donations will directly fund sustainable clean water solutions. \nOur Values: Sustainability At Every Turn\nWe crafted every element of our business model with a focus on sustainability. Our bamboo itself is one of the most rapidly renewable resources on the planet and a source of economic opportunity for over 800,000 people, and it comes only from suppliers using sustainable harvesting practices. Our filters are made entirely from coconut shells rather than the wasteful million-year-in-the-making coal filters found in many filtration systems today. Finally, all of our packaging is made with recycled content that dramatically reduces WELLY\u2019s carbon footprint.\nWe\u2019re done with the initial design and are excited to green light production\u2014we just need you!\nWe need your help to bring this vision of a purer world to life. By helping to fund WELLY Bottle, you\u2019ll not only be among the first to get this awesome bottle, but you will also be supporting:\nA world in which we don\u2019t need to settle for choosing either sustainability or water quality\nA business model that views sustainability as mandatory, not just nice-to-have \nThe fight against a major global humanitarian problem: the water crisis\nThank you for your support!\nWith sincerity and determination,\nBen and the WELLY Team\nConnect With Us:\nOther Pics:\nGet Your Project Funded Today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur primary remaining challenge is to make sure all parts fit with extreme precision in order to optimize usability and performance.

From the printer project, I re-evaluated my approach toward product design as a whole and began taking into consideration the full cycle of products; everything from how materials are first sourced to the manufacturing processes, as well as environmental foot prints pre and post-consumer use. Being inspired I ran with the idea of integrating alternative inks leading me eventually to the creation of the WINKpen!\nIn essence, the WINKpen was born from the desire to create a sustainable alternative to something that many of us use in our daily lives. Traditional pens are, more often than not, disposable products; once the pre-loaded ink stem is exhausted, they essentially just become empty plastic cases that inevitably wind up in a land-fill somewhere. With with the WINKpen, however, an ink reload can be found right there in your kitchen.\nReusable, sustainable, and long-lasting. Helps mitigate \u201cthrowaway\u201d culture and there's also the added benefit of having inexpensive ink available virtually anywhere!\nEveryone! My goal with WINKpens was to create an innovative and simple product people could use and re-use in their daily lives. In many ways, this pen can be a new addition to your creative arsenal, allowing individuals to experiment and express with untraditional mediums. It can be a unique purchase for the creative in your life or just as easily serve as an elegant and customed promotional gift for your business. It is a \u201clow-tech\u201d product that marries modern aesthetics and environmental awareness with traditional function.\nOver the last year and a half, I've devoted the majority of my spare time outside of work to the creation of the WINKpen. Like the creation of anything worth-while, it wasn't exactly easy! There was a lot of sleepless nights spent sketching, designing, and just tinkering in the shop; utilizing everything from 3D printing, sanding mock-ups, jumping on the lathe, using saws, sourcing various materials that were within reach, and reverse engineering. There was a lot of back and forth with sketching, prototyping, and testing. Whenever a prototype failed to meet expectations, I'd start again from square one. While I've poured a lot of my time, and personal finances into the project, I wasn't without support. I contracted others on board when necessary\u2014such as my engineer, who explained to me what was feasible and what wasn't\u2014all of which have aided me into bringing the best solutions into constructing the most user-friendly product possible. Thank you to everyone who's encouraged, advised, and helped me along the way... because without each and every single one of them, I certainly would not be where I am today.\nThe WINKpen is built to be as modular and user friendly as possible. All components fit snuggly together with the use of rubber o-rings, and can be easily pulled apart and pushed back together for ease of cleaning.\nA double-sided glass nib features an angled tip for calligraphy and also a conical tip for finer penmanship. The glass replaces the metal tips and ball-points in traditional pens, removing the risk of corrosion and making it easy to clean. Spiraled grooves in the glass nib elegantly feed ink to paper while also boasting a beautiful aesthetic.\nThe interior of the coupler is lined with an elastomer which acts to hold the glass nib securely in place. The elastomer lining, in combination with the fine feeding tube also aids in the steady flow of ink.\nDiplomat's piston design allows for a simple twist refill and ink release system, making it a simple process to controllably unload and load the pen with various inks of your choosing.\nOur logo will be beautifully etched on the outside of the glass housing. Customizable options will be available in the near future however, as part of this kickstarter you can get yours personalized NOW!                              \n** see pledge perks for details**\nCheck out WINKpens rewards for contributing!

I'm an industrial designer and contemporary artist located in Portland, Oregon. Creativity made its way into my life early on in a number of ways. Growing up, there was so much in the world that inspired me: nature, colors, and objects that provoked my natural desires to express and problem solve. It wasn't until very recently did my career of choice really begin to emerge to combine all of my experiences into my current path of becoming an entrepreneur.\nMy diverse background from teaching martial arts and personal training to business marketing, customer service, construction, freelance and design--has all contributed to the creation of product that I'm beyond passionate about. Martial arts instilled in me the fighting mentality to relentlessly pursue my goals, business provided the applicable knowledge, construction gave me the hands-on experience, and freelancing as an industrial designer and artist taught me how to better manage and deliver quality products. In a way, each major experience has been a stepping stone to who and where I am now.\nFor me, design is all about solution and utility, while art is expression \u2013 together, they provide endless opportunities and create stories of growth all their own. The potential to touch another person, to ignite that spark in them that might blossom into something great, and the daily opportunity to just provide new experiences is what eternally fuels the love for my craft.\nFrom the very bottom of my heart, THANK YOU for your support and sharing this project with your friends and family! \nAN EXTRA SPECIAL THANK YOU to this awesome crew for your expertise and support! \nMatthew Malone - Engineer \nKurt Rassos - Graphic Designer \nDonald Chan - Editor\nBlacklist Media - Film \n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the creation of any product that includes manufacturing processes and hand-made glass components, there can be a number of unforeseen risks and obstacles. As of the kickstarter launch, I have working prototypes and all of the technical drawings ready and approved by manufacturers. The current models are 3D printed to provide a functional dimensioned proof of concept; however, this funding will allow us to incorporate injection and overmolding, cover the costly upfront tooling costs, and utilize all the correct quality materials.\n\nWhen I first began this project, I set out to design the WINKpen with integrity. I've put my best foot forward since day one and adamantly refuse to compromise quality. I've hand-selected excellent companies and am constantly learning from mentors and other experienced professionals in an effort to maintain product progression and business growth. I will personally review each pen to ensure that it is the best possible product and will not ship them to you until the pens are at its best.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Exclusive backer update", "update_content": "PLAY"}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 229, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pop-local/winkpens-write-with-wine-juice-or-tea-get-creative", "project_name": "WINKPENS - Write with Wine, Juice or Tea.

It is awarded for groundbreaking design and is the top prize in the Red Dot Award: Product Design.\nPenxo is a minimalist 2mm lead holder pencil with no springs, buttons, or mechanical parts. It is beautifully simple, stylish and intuitively unique on its handling. Precision milled with a single block of aircraft grade aluminium, it pays homage to the traditional wooden pencils that have been used by designers, artists and students for centuries.\nThe main concept for Penxo was simplicity. We asked ourselves how we could reduce a conventional mechanical lead pencil into its elements and eliminate all the finicky mechanical bits. Next, we challenged ourselves to solve the problem that has plagued designers for years: How to release the lead faster and how to make it easier to tell which lead is loaded into the pencil without needing to unload the lead, peer through a semi-translucent window, or use those spinning knob indicators commonly found on drafting pencils. As well as, how to conveniently shows the lead usage. With the concept and challenges in mind, we went through numerous designs and concept sketches before we finally arrived at Penxo. \nFastest Lead Release on any lead holder: Push your thumb between the gap to release the clamp and the lead slides in & out.\nWhile gripping the PENXO, the Lead window gap also provides air flow underneath the fingers. This greatly reduces sweating and creates a less slippery grip.\nOn a conventional drafting pencil, they have a spinning knob indicator for identifying lead hardness. You need to turn the knob every time you switch lead so you won't forget what lead you put in. Penxo elminates this inconvenient step.\nLead Window: Since most 2mm leads have already labels printed on them, the lead window on each side allows you to read the lead color, brand, hardness labels, and check the amount of lead left. No more guesswork.\nLead usage indication\nSharpening the lead on the Penxo with our free mini sharpener (animation sped up 2x)\nThe flawless brushed aluminum fuselage is the first thing that demands attention. \n6061 \u2013T651 Aluminum \u2013 Used in aircraft construction, chosen for its perfect balance of lightweight, durability/strength and flexing properties.

As a designer, I have used numerous tools from paintbrush to the Wacom pen. However, the one tool that I come back to the most is the pencil. It is undisputedly one of the best tools for a designer.\nWith that in mind, I spent countless hours designing and refining the Penxo, hoping to inject some modernity while remaining true to its traditional form.\nI am incredibly proud of what I have achieved, and would like to share my passion with all of you. With your support, you will help me meet minimum order volumes required by the manufacturers and provide a jumpstart on the expensive tooling costs.

Its killer feature is the Max Pack Bag, which allows you to vacuum compress your soft items. This enables you to carry enough for a long trip in a 35 litre bag.\nGOB\u2206G\u2019s simple and robust design is engineered to last a lifetime. The outer bag is constructed from only two pieces of TPU coated ballistic nylon, a material commonly used to make inflatable boats. This \u2018less is more\u2019 design approach is continued throughout the product.\nThe Full Edge Zip is a 2 meter long, durable YKK zip that runs along the outer edge of the front and side panels. This means more of your gear is next to the zip; you'll never have to dig around at the bottom of your bag again.\nMore zip. Less hassle.\nThis feature doesn't need much explanation. It's the perfect size for 95% of the major airlines' carry-on, even Ryanair!\nThe Max Pack Bag is the GOB\u2206G's killer feature. It's a welded bag made from TPU coated nylon with an integrated vacuum check valve to compress all your soft goods. Just throw your gear into the bag, seal it and compress it. You can compress the bag by either using a vacuum cleaner or compressing it by hand.\nPack. Vac. Go.\nThe Max Pack Bag is fully removable. Just unscrew the check valve, release the attachments inside the GOB\u2206G, and pop the cap on, then you're ready to go.\nWe've had enough of those disposable plastic bags you get at the airport. Our integrated wash bag means an end to wasting time at airport security \u2013 your liquids and pastes are ready to go from the off. Just rip off the wash bag from its velcro attachment and you're good to go.\nWe've also designed an adaptable laptop harness that holds your notebook securely away from the edges of the bag. It can take care of everything between 11-15 inches. One less thing to worry about.\nShhhh... we've added a hidden pocket to the bag. Who doesn't love a secret pocket?! It's also quite useful for your money, passport and other secret stuff. \nHere's what some of our early testers have been saying about the GOB\u2206G.\nIts about to get a little detailed here, so skip this bit if you trust that we've used the best.\n1000d Codura Nylon is the ultimate in abrasion protection. We have placed it over the maximum wear areas like the base.\nTPU Coated Ballistic Nylon the ultimate waterproof material. This is the stuff that inflatable power boats are made out of.\nCarbon Steel G Hooks Forget those flimsy plastic buckles that you get on some bags. All of ours are made out of Carbon Steel. \nMonkey Fist Zip Pulls Made from high tensile strength para cord. A knot that a salty sea dog would be proud of.\nYKK Zippers Everyone knows that all the best gear uses YKK zips not some rubbish imitation.

He was traveling a lot between London and Scotland for weekend trips on Easyjet flights and was frustrated that he couldn't take everything he needed as hand luggage. His budget but functional solution was to pack all his clothes in a bin bag, vacuum the air out and zip tie the end. He thought \"There's got to be an easier way to do this...\"\nThe GOBAG was born.\nA picture of James' trusty Singer Sewing Machine, bought for \u00a320 on Gumtree.\nOver the last two years we have put the GOB\u2206G through rigorous testing.

We've spent over two years refining the GOBAG design and taking advice from UK based experts to minimise these risks.\n\nIf we find opportunities for improvement we will address them immediately with updated and improved design solutions. We will let you know if any improvements and alterations are made. These improvements will then be verified in the final testing stage in July 2015 when the first product articles from the production line will be tested. Final tweaks will then be made before the full production run in August 2015. We are experienced in sourcing and manufacturing in Asia and are therefore well prepared to deal with any potential issues.\n\nWhen the volume production run commences we will be present in China supervising all aspects of the production and the quality assurance. We are completely committed to ensuring that the GOBAG lives up to our high expectations of functionality and craftsmanship.\n\nWe have kept our reward tiers as simple as possible to ensure fulfilment goes smoothly.

For four hundred years, wallet designers have strived to balance design, functionality, and sleekness. The invention of the credit card in the 1950s gave rise to the modern wallet with its multiple slots to carry cards. Until 1996, wallets remained unchanged until the development of the first evolutionary bi-fold wallet, which reduced the bulkiness of its predecessors by nearly half its size. Many wallets have numerous pockets that are great for storing necessary items, but can also allow people to accumulate a lot of junk very quickly.\nHere at Bronxton Designs, we eliminate clunkiness by creating wallets that are minimalistic, fashionable and, most importantly, functional\u2014and we do so in a range of styles. Our focus: design accessories that help you carry all daily essentials in true minimalist style. We develop two types of leather wallets: the \u201c1222 Rule\u201d wallets and the Stasher wallets. The 1222 Rule wallets carry the recommended essentials: one ID, two credit cards, two insurance cards (car and health), and two $20-dollar bills for emergencies. The Stasher wallets are for people who prefer or need to carry more than the essentials.\nWith all our wallets we never rush, taking time to carefully design each wallet with our vision in mind. Using only the best materials, our products are designed and handcrafted from beginning to end in Park City, Utah, under our control. We have been successfully funded three times on Kickstarter since we fired up in 2014. With the help of our backers, we were able to purchase all the tools required to produce our wallets. Having our own tools allows us to keep everything in house from design to fulfillment. To expand our brand with new product lines, we need more tools for the job. That\u2019s where backers like you come in. Your pledges make it possible for us to get the equipment we need to grow our company with new, innovative products and to create and keep jobs in the United States.\n A Brief Understanding of Your Leather\nWhen purchasing a wallet or any other leather article it is important to understand what you are paying for; many companies sell genuine leather for the price of full grain. We use the only leather good enough for our wallets: full grain leather. The leather we use comes from the best tannery in the world, Horween, which has supplied quality leather hides for over 110 years.\nFull grain leather comes from the top layer of the hide, which has ALL of the grain, therefore, FULL grain. The natural surface of full grain leather burnishes and beautifies with use. Full-grain leather refers to hides that have not been sanded, buffed, or snuffed to remove imperfections or natural marks on the surface of the hide. This means each wallet will be naturally unique. No two wallets are alike! The grain remains, giving the fiber strength and durability. The grain also has breathability, resulting in less moisture from prolonged contact. Rather than wearing out, it will develop a patina over time. That means your wallet will wear beautifully and it will actually look better as it ages! This might be the last wallet you will ever need since it will last for many, many years to come.\nTop grain leather, the second grade of leather, is a split from the top layer of blemished hide, then sanded and refinished. This is how manufacturers get rid of scars and scrapes and light cow brands. Top grain leather does not age nicely with use.\nGenuine leather, the third grade of leather, is produced from the layers of hide that remain after the top is split off for the better grades. The surface is usually refinished (spray painted) to resemble a higher grade.\nThe tannery\n\nOur Wallets: We have One for You \nWe create all our wallets with careful design and craftsmanship; there\u2019s one for you in our line-up. The 1222 Rule wallets include the Entry and the Prospect; the Stasher Wallets include the Briber, Tri-fold and Main Street.\nThe Entry\nEven when filled with cards and cash, this wallet is so comfortable, that you won\u2019t feel it in your front or back pocket. The Entry is perfect for going out at night, walking long distances, simplifying your life, and carrying the absolute bare minimum. Though The Entry is minimalistic and affordable, we kept the elegance and quality of well-designed wallet made with Horween leather.\nThe Entry\nAt $25 ($20 for early backers) The Entry is the most affordable, minimalistic, handcrafted, full grain leather wallet you\u2019ll find. While we managed to make it very inexpensive, we did not cut any corners. The main difference from other wallets in our line is that The Entry is not hand-stitched; it is laser-cut, engraved, and machine sewn. Thanks to the backers of the previous project, we were able to buy a sewing machine!\nSpecs:\nFull grain Horween leather.\nTwo card pockets. Each pocket stores up to 3 cards, for a total of 6 cards per wallet.\nCash slot (in between card pockets) stores up to 6 bills folded in half.\nOptional Custom Engraving (add $10 to your reward).\nDue to how minimalistic this wallet is, it is not offered with RFID protection.\nMachine sewn.\nOffered in Dark Brown and Black.\nMeasurements:\n 2.25\" High by 3.9\" Wide\nThe Main Street\nThe Main Street wallet is made with leather and high-quality elastic. The elastic expands as needed while the leather keeps the wallet classy and elegant. The Main Street wallet offers 4 pockets: 2 front pockets, 1 middle pocket, and 1 elastic pocket. The front pockets are designed to hold ids and credit cards; the middle pocket is perfect for business cards, but can also be used for any cards or cash. The high quality, low-profile elastic pocket expands so it can hold from 1 to 10 cards.\nThe Main Street\nSpecs:\nFull grain Horween leather.\nThree card pockets. Each pocket stores up to 3 cards, plus some cash.\nElastic pocket holds 1 to 10 cards or anything else you can think of storing in there.\nOptional Custom Engraving (add $10 to your reward).\nOptional RFID Protection (add $10 to your reward).\nHand-stitched.\nOffered in Black with Black or Red Stitching and Brown with Brown or Tan Stitching.\nMeasurements:\n2.75\" High by 3.9\" Wide\nThe Tri-fold\nThe Tri-fold is not your grandpa\u2019s wallet! While it has a traditional look, it is not old school! Similar to The Briber, the main advantage of The Tri-fold is that all your cards are fully protected inside the wallet.\nThe Tri-fold - Closed\nThe Tri-fold - Open\nTraditional EMPTY Bi-fold vs. Bronxton's LOADED Tri-fold (as seen on the intro).\n Specs:\nFull grain Horween leather.\nTri-fold.\nFour pockets.

We\u2019ve sold several hundred of the Briber and have not received a single complaint or suggestion to improve it. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.

Red\nThread options\nOptional Add-ons\nEngraving\nWe recommend that engraving be placed in the front/back right corner on the bottom of the wallet; however, during the survey process, you will be given the opportunity to add notes and can request a different placement for your engraving. The engraving size varies with the word or initials that you request; we will ensure that it is proportional with the size of the wallet.\nFont Choices:\nRFID Protection\nWhat is it? Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a system that transmits the identity (in the form of a unique serial number) of an object or person wirelessly, using radio waves.\nAlmost all of our wallets now come with optional RFID protection! Most banks and credit card companies have been moving away from swipe card technology and issuing RFID-enabled cards and many places in Europe even have them embedded in personal identification documents.\nThe RFID Problem.\nUnfortunately hackers and others use technologies that can pickpocket that information from you without ever touching your wallet! Sometimes from several yards away! To keep your information safe, our optional RFID protection is made with 2 layers of anti-RFID materials that ensure no access to the information stored in your credit cards and documents. And as you can see in the video it works every time!\n  PLAY\n\nPast and Current PR and Blog Coverage:\nBronxton Coasters \u2013 Unlocked!!!\nEveryone with a pledge of $70 or more (before shipping for international backers) will receive a free pair of Bronxton coasters! If your pledge is $140 or more, you will receive 2 pairs of coasters, and so on. \nFor those who pledge less than $70, we\u2019ve got your back too! You can either bump up your pledge amount to $70 or add $14 to your pledge\u2014whichever is less money for you. \nFor those who simply want to support the project and what we stand for, there is a new $14 pledge to get the coasters. They will serve you well for many years to come and give your furniture a little extra protection while drinking in style.\nThe coaster manufacturing process: it takes nearly 4 thousand laser passes to make each one of the coasters. They are then dyed with a natural aging solution, left to dry under UV light, and then given 2 coats of clear satin to seal the coasters from moisture. Just like our wallets, the coasters are made in-house. \nThe coasters will ship at the same time as your wallets, at no additional shipping cost. \nBronxton Woodies - Unlocked!!!\nBronxton Woodies\u2014We\u2019ve kept this one under wraps. It\u2019s something that we\u2018ve been working on for a long time. Like all our products, these sunglasses are handcrafted. We\u2019ve been stress testing them for some time now, making all the necessary adjustments to ensure that, unlike other cheap wood sunglasses, these will not break easily. \nThe Wolf Creek:\nMade with two-tone Wood. Weighs only 0.9 oz (26g).\nMeasurements:\nLens Width: 54 mm  \nBridge Width: 21 mm\nLens Vertical (Frame Height): 49 mm\nFrame Width: 140 mm  \nTemple Length: 144 mm\nThe Deer Creek:\nMade with Zebrawood.

Glare is caused when light from the sun is reflected off of water or a solid surface. By neutralizing glare, polarized lenses help you see objects more clearly, and also help reduce the harmful effects of UV light. Polarized lenses are especially beneficial if you practice water sports including boating, fishing, etc. \n400% UVA/UVB lens protection. \nAnti-scratch lens coat. \nMade with 3 custom wood layers for extra durability. 2 horizontal layers and 1 vertical layer in the middle. \nCarved from natural woods, so no two pairs are the same.\nHard paper case and microfiber cloth is included.\nCome with one-year warranty against manufacturing defects, something that other vendors do not offer.\nIf you are already pledging for a wallet and would like the sunglasses as well, all you need to do is increase your pledge by $60! Bronxton woodies will ship in September, separately from the wallets, at no additional shipping cost to you. You will be able to choose the style during the survey process at the end of the project.\nAnyone, who just wants the sunglasses, there is a special $75 reward for you!\nSocial media sharing contest\nFor all those who have shared our project already, we want to say thank you! We appreciate your support more than you can imagine, and we want to reward you!

We hope to release another line of leather products within a few months, but we will not announce these product launches until the new products have passed our rigorous testing.\n.\nFEEDBACK\nWe value feedback, both positive and negative.

Richard and Lauren you are HUGE HEROS to us!!!!\n        A little lantern with a HUGE impact.\nVideo by Fredric King of Fountainhead Transmedia, Fountainhead.com\nThe SolarPuff is the ideal product. It's a patent pending solar lantern that packs flat and easily pops open into a charming cube of light. Beautifully designed with Origami technology to appeal to everyone from the most discerning design conscious hipster to a hermit living in the hills.It's perfect for emergencies, camping, hiking, boating, around the pool, in the pool, as a night light, in your car... You get the picture, its uses are endless, and it makes for a fabulous house gift.  \nSimply Put\nDesigned with sustainable and high-performance fabric specifically engineered for durability, flexibility and water resistance, and structured for adaptability and recyclability.\nIt's light weight, just 2.5 ounces.\nIt floats and can withstand complete immersion under water.\nFor as many hours as you charge it in the sun, it will provide light for just as long. For example, 5 hours of charging in the sun will provide illumination to light up a 10 X 10 room for 5-8  hours. Charge it for 8 hours and it will light for 8-12 hours.\nIt has a shelf life of over three years.\nHow It Works\nSOLARPUFF how to Open and Close\nPLAY\n\nAdd-On: Option\nTo add on to your pledge go to the top right of the page and under the green button, \"You're a Backer\", click the blue button \"Manage\" \n-If you add $25 to your pledge you can donate 1 SolarPuff to Nepal. \n-If you add $50 to your pledge, you can donate 2 SolarPuffs to Nepal.\nWe will send a survey at the end of the campaign, asking you to clarify what you want for your pledge. Just make sure what you want adds up properly, corresponding to the rewards listed.\n  It's Different\nOur  lantern distinguishes itself from other solar lanterns because of its modern flatpack pop-open design. The purpose of the SolarPuff's design component is fostering our belief in good design for all, in both the first world and third world countries. \nThe SolarPuff looks stunning traversing poolside to camp side to Subsaharan huts. Our product is engineered to flatten and then pop open into a clean, beautiful, modern cube lamp which is a critical distinction for transforming poverty into dignity. \nThis little light flat packs to 0.25 inches and can fit in any back pocket. It boasts 100 lumens and can fully charge in the sun in 8 hours lasting for 8-12 hours of light. If you only get to charge it for 5 hours, it\u2019s ok, it will still last for 5-8 hours of light. \nThe circuit contains a photovoltaic solar panel, 10 bright white LEDS and a lithium-ion polymer battery. Although the circuit is made in China, the special fabric of the expandable bladder which is the light disfusing element, is made in Connecticut. \nIt is specifically engineered to withstand extreme outdoor environments. This product is revolutionizing the way we light our world. It is a formidable champion of beautiful, mobile, modern, and sustainable lighting, simply using the limitless renewable awesomeness of our sun.\nAWARDS + PRESS\nA Little History\nBackground\nThis light was first developed by Alice Min Soo Chun for emergency relief after the Haiti earthquake. In 2010, while teaching at Columbia University, Alice returned from Haiti and converted her architecture lab into an innovation center for disaster relief. Alice shared her years of research on integrating thin film substrates with photo voltaics and the idea of an inflatable solar light with the goal of creating sustainable solutions for disaster relief. The first prototype for the SolarPuff, along with all other inflatable solar lanterns currently on the market, were born in her lab.  Alice holds four patents for the inflatable solar lantern and solar light assembly.\nWhere we are Today \nIt took quite a few prototypes to find the right fabric, best components and the unparalleled design.  We wanted to make sure the fabric was non-toxic (PVC free) to the environment and full recyclable. We finally produced the perfect combination this past summer (2014). \nIn September 2014, we signed a licensing agreement with a distributor in Japan who received their first order for SolarPuffs in December 2014. All have sold and they are awaiting their next shipment.\nIn March 2015, we signed a distribution agreement with a Caribbean distributor and we are currently speaking with other distributors in India, Belgium, UK, Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Nairobi, Singapore and Hong Kong for starters.\nWho \"WANTS\" A SolarPuff?\nThis superior solar inflatable light is great for the home, gardens, pools, boating enthusiasts, camping, hiking, corporate premiums and military applications. It is also the most ideal lantern for emergency and disaster relief, due to its light weight and it's the most hygienic since there is no need to use your mouth to inflate.The light weight design makes for lower shipping costs and its foldability allows for dense packing of 80+ units per box. The high tech fabric creates a delightful dispersion of light. Every household on the earth would benefit from owning a SolarPuff. It's the perfect gift for everyone.\nWho \"NEEDS\" A SolarPuff?\nThe IFC (International Finance Corporation) estimates that globally, over 1.6 billion people \u2013 possibly as high as 3 billion \u2013 are living without access to reliable electricity. \n According to figures from the International Energy Agency, at least 20% of the planet's inhabitants are still without the simple luxury of a light switch.\nSo how do they light their homes and cook their food? They are using kerosene, wood, crop waste, charcoal, coal and dung. Worldwide, over 500 million households use kerosene, for lighting.\nAccording to studies conducted by Dr. Evan Mills, founder of the Lumina Project, an initiative that promotes low-carbon alternatives to fuel-based lighting, \"kerosene (or as he refers to it, \"dirty lighting\") consumes 77 billion liters of fuel worldwide, costing its predominantly impoverished end-users a total of $36 billion annually.\"Kerosene costs 25 to 30 percent of a family\u2019s income \u2014 globally. The poor do not use kerosene because it is cheap \u2014 they are kept poor in significant part because they must rely on expensive, dirty kerosene. .\nWhat We Want to Do  \nWith your help, we can revolutionize how people are lighting their homes. We want people to be prepared with a SolarPuff in their home for when the next Hurricane Katrina or Sandy hits and we want to provide clean sustainable lighting to those that need it most. \nCalculated from research, if everyone in the United States used a SolarPuff for one hour a day instead of a regular light bulb, it would save over 11 BILLION tons of CO2 emissions from going into the air each year!! \nIn the United States 75% of the air pollution in urban areas is due to energy consumption from buildings. Solight Design wants to design and manufacture beautifully architected solar solutions that people will want in their homes and, at the same time, help eradicate pollution, poverty and excessive energy consumption!  \nWe don't want to stop there! We want to change the reliance on dirty fuels to light the homes of people living off the grid. Globally there are at least 1.6 billion people without reliable access to electricity. This lack of access to efficient energy becomes even more apparent in rural areas of developing countries where most lighting is fueled by kerosene, which is not only toxic but extremely expensive, creating a vicious cycle of poverty.\nThe HELIX vs PUFF:\nMany of our supporters have been asking how the Helix and Puff are different. Well the Helix is a Twist and a little more compact than the SolarPuff. It is made from recyclable TPU, a thermoplastic that has a unique memory for shape retention. you can see in the video here that a slight push will start the deflation process in motion and it will remember to flat pack back to a square. Also the light is more uniform than the SolarPuff since the SolarPuff has more a a spectrum of light. The SolarPuff has a ziplock pouch for packaging and the Helix has a paper packaging. The SolarPuff  light diffuser is made from a Sail Cloth Fabric that is made in the USA and the Helix light diffuser material (TPU)is made in China. Hope this helps!\nPLAY\n\nHelix\nHelix\nSolarPuff packs into a Polygon\nSolarPuff\nWho Are We?\nAlice Min Soo Chun and Stacy Kelly, Co-Founders\nAlice Min Soo Chun is a Co-Founder and CEO of Solight Design and the inventor of the Solar Inflatable Light: SolarPuff.

Whereas the SolarPuff, has a spectrum of light dispersion and is prism-like as the light transfers through the high tech fabric material. \nFolding technology - Both use origami principles yet the Helix is a twist fold and pack motion. The SolarPuff has a pinch and fold motion. \nCosts  - TPU is less expensive and allows us to produce a economical version of the SolarPuff.\nIn all other components and functions, they are the same. They both float as the solar circuit is completely protected in a vacuumed sealed bladder. They both recycle. They charge the same and have the same lumenosity. They have equal lighting and will last just as long. And, finally, both have three settings, low, high and flash.\nCheck out the video at the top of the page to see how we demo the SoalrPuff vs the Helix,\nPledge $5 or more \nThank you\nYou get a \"Thank You\" note and our immense gratitude!!

It is an amazingly efficient way to do laundry.  It is clinically demonstrated to be as effective as detergent and lasts up to 1000 washes!  Our goal now is Crystal Wash 2.0, the \u201cconnected\u201d version, which will make it even easier to use than it is already and give you a set of tools & features that will help you do your laundry better.\nThese days everyone and everything is looking to \u201cget connected\u201d to make things easier, provide greater vision and insight into the task at hand.  We know that doing laundry is not exactly exciting, but lets face it\u2026 everyone has to do it!  Crystal Wash is something that works and the truth is we really can make doing laundry easier for you, save you money and be better for the environment.  We will give you a brief explanation of how the current version of Crystal Wash works and then we will get into the details of what we want to accomplish with our Patent Pending Crystal Wash 2.0\u2026\nBackground on Crystal Wash\nCrystal Wash is a proven technology that literately lasts for at least 1000 loads of laundry.  It uses the power of Bio Ceramics from the earth, which naturally clean your clothes as effectively as laundry detergent.  It is better for your skin and more gentle on your fabrics.  It is also better for the environment because it reduces contaminated waste water filtered back into the water supply, saves water by lowering required rinse cycles, and effectively reduces CO2 production by requiring less energy than a traditional detergent based wash.\nThese special Bio Ceramics were developed using various minerals with very effective antibacterial and anti-oxidant properties.\nThe pH level of laundry water impacts the wash greatly. If the water is overly acidic or alkaline it can damage delicate clothes and fabrics, cause colors to fade and cause clothing to still seem dirty even after washing.  Most detergents on the market are a pH level of 6.5 \u2013 9, but they use chemicals to achieve these levels.\nThe key to Crystal Wash is the Bio Ceramics:\nAs the Bio Ceramics collect odors, dirt and waste from your laundry, they need to be \u2018recharged\u2019 in order to make sure the pH levels of the laundry water continue to be raised.   To recharge Crystal Wash you simply put them in the sun for an afternoon.  You only need to do this approximately every 30 days (or 30 laundry loads).  There is nothing else you need to do\u2026 Just a little sun and they will be just as effective as their first wash.   Lets face it, this process is simple but easily forgotten and if not done the effectiveness of Crystal Wash is decreased.  It would be nice, if there was a way to be reminded that it was time to recharge them.\nBy embedding a state-of-the-art pH water sensing chip and a micro-controller with Bluetooth capability inside the current Crystal Wash, we can give users accurate recharge alerts so that they don\u2019t have to remember when it is time to put them in the sun.   And while we are at it \u2013 why not give users several other tools and features right on their smartphone that will help make doing laundry easier & more effective\u2026\nWith the Patent Pending Crystal Wash 2.0 we will be able to illustrate the effectiveness of this great device and show the user the real time pH level of their wash.  We\u2019ll be able to give the user recharge alerts, wash cycle tracking stats, wash complete alerts and many additional metrics and tools to help each Crystal Wash user become a \u201cLaundryNista.\u201d\n  The Crystal Wash App Features:\nReal-time Wash pH Levels\nRecharge Alerts\nWash Complete Alerts\nWash Cycle Tracking Stats \u2013 Graphs, Counters, Social Sharing\nSavings Tracking\nCrystal Wash \u2013 Wash Cycle Counter \u2013 Time to order new Crystal Wash\nStain guide\nLabel decoder\n\n  Our development process has gone through a few prototyping phases.  Our biggest issues were figuring out how to engineer a miniaturized version that would allow us to fit all the necessary components inside the current Crystal Wash form factor.  And how to create a module to best withstand the harsh environmental factors present inside a laundry machine... like water, shock, and temperature exposure.\nUsing some of the most current prototyping tools available we have made good progress after a few versions, but we still had some major obstacles to overcome.  Below are some pictures of the prototyping and miniaturization progress we have made.\nPrototype v1 Addressed:\npH Reading & Calibration Control From Simple Mobile App\nElectrode Sensitivity Testing & Protection\nEnclosure Testing\nCurrently in the testing phase, our miniaturized prototype v2 is sending back pH data to a mobile device via Bluetooth and showing us first-hand the impact Crystal Wash has on laundry. We've developed an enclosure that is impact resistant. And have begun focusing on the temperature resistance aspect of the enclosure.  Addressing the rigors of a normal load of laundry gets us closer to a final module design then we ever were before. \nPrototype v2 Addressed:\nElectrode Miniaturization\nPrototyping Board Miniaturization & Simplification\nWash Basin Bluetooth Connectivity Testing\nWaterproofing\nShock Resistance\nThe v2 submerge tests show successful waterproofing and connectivity and we now look forward to moving on to our final module development.\nWe reached a milestone in our R&D process when we realized we could potentially do away with the traditional electrode.  Building on the idea of \u201clab on a chip\u201d and \u201cmicro-fluidics\u201d we began to see the possibility of engineering our own solid-state sensor, which would allow us to miniaturize the electrode and effectively eliminate the need for calibration.  Our team went to work researching the feasibility of this and found some really great resources for how to use these cutting edge techniques to bring our idea to reality.\nBy engineering our own sensing chip we will be able to minimize calibration requirements, reduce power consumption, and come up with our own compact logic board all designed to fit within the Crystal Wash form factor.\nThe response at CES was huge... with interest from the press, to retailers, to investors, and distributors...\nOur Next Steps: \n We\u2019ve come a long way.  We have a miniaturized prototype and are starting to get back real usable laundry data.  Now we need to refine the pH sensor design, work out our power consumption goals, build out the final mobile app.  We already have our manufacturing Vendor for the final product, but we still need to source our final vendors for the connected components.\nWe\u2019re close but need your help to bring this exciting, innovative device to fruition.  Help us get there Kickstarter, lets all help the environment, save money and become LaundryNistas!\nLaun\u00b7dry\u00b7ni\u00b7sta  /,l\u00f4ndr\u0113ni-\u0161ta/ noun one who has mastered the art of laundry and has obtained a sense of \u201claundry enlightenment.\u201d \nThe Crystal Wash Team:\nThe Crystal Wash team has combined a unique selection of expertise. Pooling resources from engineering, marketing, software development, art, and design backgrounds the Crystal Wash team has the technical, design, and entrepreneurial savvy that has already brought the current version to the market.  We are capable and ready to bring this exciting and innovative Version 2.0 to market.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any new innovative project there are inherit risks and challenges...\n\nWith Crystal Wash 2.0 the biggest challenge was how do we engineer the components to be small, efficient and robust. Traditional pH electrodes are large, expensive, fragile, and require constant recalibration. We needed to address all the above mentioned electrode issues and make a cost effective module small enough to fit into a 105mm x 19mm form factor.\n\nSupply and Logistics\n\nLuckily we have already developed many of the necessary supply and logistic relationships required to bring the original Crystal Wash to market. For Crystal Wash 2.0 our biggest hurdle is making sure all the new \"connected\" components are sourced from the best and most reliable vendors. We only want consistent and on time delivery allowing us to reach our production goals and distribute rewards to our loyal backers.\n\nWe have established relationships with experienced manufacturers and fulfillment vendors and are confident we will be able to reach our goals. \n\nThrough multiple prototypes we have come to a clear path of how to bring our vision to reality. We definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel. We are very close.

It doesn't require a password to connect to WiFi or a frustrating and tedious configuration process to install. It works right out of the box so anyone can set it up. Keewifi features the latest wireless standard 802.11ac and enterprise networking technology to ensure that your WiFi signal is strong, stable, and FAST. It's easy to use and powerful, too.\nThe World's Simplest Router\nIt's extremely easy to set up and use Keewifi. Just plug in the power and network cables and you're done. No complicated configuration or confusing software to worry about. And no more 192.168.1... nonsense. Keewifi is plug and play.\nConnecting devices to WiFi is even easier\u2014it just takes a tap. Simply hold any WiFi-enabled device close to the Keewifi syncing panel, and you'll be authorized in seconds. You don't need to enter a password that's too difficult to remember or too easy to exploit.\nSecurity Taken Seriously\nKeewifi uses proximity technology to authenticate devices as an alternative to standard WiFi passwords. Devices must come in close contact with the syncing panel in order to be authorized to join your network. This patented feature ensures that others cannot connect to your WiFi without this physical action so rest assured that your private network is protected.\nNo One-Trick Pony\nWe built Keewifi with the latest wireless technology in mind. Equipped with 802.11ac, it supports simultaneous dual-band transmissions (2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz) with WiFi speeds up to 867Mbps. Keewifi also features Beamforming technology which targets your WiFi devices and boosts signal strength in that direction. Instead of sending an equal signal in all directions, Beamforming enables Keewifi to broadcast a more direct, concentrated signal to your devices, which allows for lower interference and much better coverage. \nThe Zen Button is designed to resolve many common WiFi issues. Most consumer routers are not smart enough to realize when your neighbor's WiFi interferes with your own\u2014resulting in significant decreases in WiFi speeds (up to 90%!). Pressing the Zen Button will notify Keewifi to automatically detect and switch to the least occupied channel, maximizing your actual internet bandwidth.\nUnlike many other consumer routers on the market, Keewifi isn't based on some patchwork Open-WRT software. It runs a custom Linux-based OS with a heavily-modified, business-grade WiFi driver to ensure that your WiFi signal is incredibly stable and reliable.  \nAdvanced Features (for Everyday People)\nWe're developing the Keewifi app for both iOS and Android with features that everyone will find helpful. Device management lets users approve, forget, and ban devices remotely. A time restriction function allows admins to control WiFi usage times or even lock/unlock Keewifi so uninterrupted family dinners are a possibility again! You can also set when a device must re-authenticate to continue accessing your WiFi\u2014handy for public spaces like coffee shops or restaurants.     \nRouter management has settings for more seasoned users who may want to add, hide, or change multiple SSIDs (up to 6 per Keewifi). If you wish, you'll also be able to set traditional WiFi passwords, manually switch 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz WLAN channels, change the LED color around the syncing panel and more. \nAdditional Features\n- Linking several Keewifi routers together is simple. Once the first Keewifi is set up, the additional Keewifi(s) only need to be plugged into a power source so you can place them anywhere in your home. Use any device that's connected to your network to tap the additional Keewifi(s). They will automatically link to the existing Keewifi network and expand your coverage. You can also add additional Keewifi routers through our app. \n- Adding Keewifi as a range extender for your current router/network will significantly increase your WiFi coverage. Just connect Keewifi to a power source, tap it with your device, and a pop-up will automatically appear prompting you to choose the existing network you wish to connect to. Enter a WiFi password if necessary, and Keewifi will be linked.\nProduct Comparison\nDesign Matters\nWe looked at hundreds of iterations when prototyping our product. Most home routers are hidden, tucked away somewhere in the corner of the house (and rightfully so). We made sure that along with all the features that Keewifi offers, it had to be beautifully designed and packaged, too. Keewifi will be a device you'll be proud to display in your home. \nProduction Advantage\nOne of the biggest advantages for a hardware company based in Beijing is that the world's best hardware manufacturers are right in our backyard in Shenzhen. We have a team working full-time on-site at our main manufacturing factory to ensure that operations run smoothly. Not only do we have this geographically advantage, we're also able to communicate without any cultural or language barriers holding us back. We are working in tandem with our manufacturing partners to ensure that the best version of Keewifi arrives at your door.\nDemo\n1. Connecting Devices to Keewifi\nPLAY\n\n2.

The memobottle brings leak-proof hydration to a new level of style and efficiency.\nIn an effort to reduce the amount of single use plastic bottles being manufactured everyday, we have designed the memobottle; a durable, dishwasher-friendly, long life water bottle constructed from BPA-free Tritan.\nSingle use bottle consumption has gone bananas in recent years, with 1,500 plastic bottles being used and discarded every SECOND in the US. This has a damaging effect on both the environment, and our hip pockets. Bottled water is about 1,400 times more expensive than tap water and often less regulated. In response to this, many have turned to the more environmentally friendly alternative - reusable bottles. It\u2019s a common belief that plastic is The Devil, however, due to the monstrous embodied energy in Aluminium and Stainless Steel products (considering raw material to product) reusable plastic bottles are actually 80% more environmentally friendly than their counterparts.\nLay it flat, or stand it up - in all circumstances where the conventional bottle just makes no sense!\nThe memobottle is the balance between environmental responsibility and improved life convenience.\nLet's start a one bottle movement.\nWe are memobottle; a creative initiative based out of Melbourne, Australia and San Diego, California, working passionately to create the balance between environmental sustainability and improved life efficiency and convenience.\nPLAY\n\n\n \n   \"Think of handcrafted leather memobottle skins with pockets for perfect bound notebooks and sketch pens; A focus on bottle functionality and a seamless integration into the owner\u2019s life.

If the correct exercises are performed well and frequently, the back problems become far easier to treat and far easier to prevent.\nWith this in mind, my colleagues and I set out to develop a simple prop to enhance the exercises we prescribe in our clinic here in the UK.\nAfter many hours brainstorming we agreed on the need for a prop/support that would actively align, mobilize and decompress the joints of the lower back in a safe controlled form.\nCountless props were designed, built and assembled in a variety of materials before being tested within the clinic by our understanding patients.\nDuring the past 2 years, the original design has been continually altered by patient feedback and our clinical evaluation.\nTo date, our in house research & development has produced a highly effective back pain device that we intend to develop further by developing new sections for Bacrac users to add to the base model and so personalize and enhance the experience.\nBacrac components/assembly\n The modular design and simple assembly means that sections can be removed for smaller framed users, it takes a few seconds to undo the retainer and slide out the extra section.\nPLAY\n\nBacrac use/protocol\nUsing Bacrac is easy. However to get the best from this remarkable device we suggest you use it as often as you can. If work, family, studies prevent you getting 5 minutes during a busy day, then use it after work when your back can really benefit.\nPLAY\n\n1. Simply place on the floor (preferably on a carpet or rug). \n2. Lay down next to bac rac. (You may find a small head cushion more comfortable). \n3. Draw both knees up, raise your pelvis and slide bac rac under your back with one hand. \n4. Lower onto the support and ease into position. (This may need minor re positioning up or down). \n5. After a few seconds of adjustment, slowly rock your knees from side to side. This movement only needs to be in the 10-2 range. Continue for 5 minutes then relax in position. \n6. Finish by rolling off either left or right. Move onto your hands and knees before bringing one leg through to stand upright.\nN.B. Our Bacrac timeline has been edited to account for an unfortunate delay now resolved. \nN.B. Our Bacrac target has recently been revised from \u00a325,000 to \u00a315,000 to account for reduced tooling costs. \nKicking it Forward\nWe'll commit 5% of profits towards getting future Kickstarter projects funded!

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT GUYS !!!\n------------------------------------------\nThe Perfect Sketchbook\n(60 pages of Artist Grade 100% Cotton, watercolor paper) \nby Erwin lian & Bynd Artisan\n\nThe Story\nOver the past 14 months or so, I have been traveling around the world and sketching... France, Germany, Spain, Italy, across Asia and the list continues to grow. The term \"sketch-hunter\", coined by Robert Henri, describes me best. I sketch almost daily, noting down everything from interesting people to the places I have visited. Whether it is in a moving subway cabin, a car, a bus or on a Tut-Tut, I sketch.\nhttp://cherngzhi.tumblr.com/\nme, my sketchbook and world travels\n\nMy passion has led me to try out numerous sketchbooks and I have tried using everything available in the market. With the need to perfect my watercolor sketches, I began to search for that perfect sketchbook. One that should be hardbound, compact, binds well, opens flat, and filled with  Artist Grade 100% cotton paper (makes it strong but pliable). Unfortunately, I couldn't find such a sketchbook out there... so, I decided to make one.\nI went on and searched for quality sketchbooks manufacturers and discovered Bynd Artisan\u00ae; a premium leather and paper label in Singapore. The people behind this brand have been in the book-making business for more than 70 years, and were very receptive of my ideas on a sketchbook. They agreed to collaborate on this project, and their sincerity & earnestness to create the Perfect Sketchbook moved me beyond words.\n\nThe Perfect Sketchbook is a top-of-the-line sketchbook made with quality materials sourced from around the world.\n\nStay updated with our Facebook page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theperfectsketchbook\n_____________________________________________________________\n      PLAY\n\nphotography by Erwin Lian\nThe ability to assess + establish correct values are two of the most important skills required in painting. Chroma inherits values and this is why many painters will first complete an under-painting (with only values) before applying chroma. Having a value chart with you, allows for you to place it against the subject to properly assess values.\nMost artists hold their sketchbook in a certain way to keep it flat. The value chart was designed for ease of use for both left- and right-handed Artists. So if you are a left holder, you may flip to the left for the value chart and if you are a right holder, you may flip to the right for it. While this could be more user-friendly with a portrait- format book. The decision for a landscape-format was strictly based off reliable data which informs us that users who use a book of this size would prefer the landscape-format. Of course, given a chance in the future, I will release a series of different sizes and formats\nLocating the right value with a value chart\nYou may be able to upgrade the existing value chart by punching holes on each step. As seen in the image above, I managed to pick the right value for the grass by hovering my value chart over it. Squinting your eyes helps a little with the assessment process. However, this would entail that your sketchbook be less aesthetically pleasing, and this is why The Perfect Sketchbook that you will receive will not come with these punched holes.\n___________________________________________________________\n\nGRAIN DIRECTION IN PAPER.\nThe Perfect Sketchbook requires up to 3 full sheets of watercolor paper. Why so many for such a small book? Well, that\u2019s due to proper grain direction.  \nWhy paper grain is important?\nIf the grain is wrong, many undesirable things will happen:\n1) The book will not open very well. \n2) The paper will crease and buckle (due to paper expansion) 3) Stress is put on the stitching and could even break it; \nAn illustration to the utilization of paper with proper grain direction:\nAs there would be more paper wastage when we consider grain direction, I am working on possibly re-cutting the waste to create paper swatches that can be inserted into The Perfect Sketchbook's inner pocket. The Artist can make use of these inserts to test their colors prior to actual application. This suggestion has yet been finalized, and I will keep everyone updated.\nMany sketchbook-makers may not consider the grain direction in order to reduce cost of production. However, this will result in poor quality.\n                                                          Please note that Singapore-based backers will also enjoy the free shipping offered to America-based backers.

I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Time-Based Media Studies from the Columbus College of Art (2004) and completed my Master of Arts in Design Development from The Ohio State University (2009).  I lecture at the Film Media Studies department in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore.\n\nI travel extensively with my sketchbooks, recording the visages of the people who I meet, places I have been to and cultures that I have personally experienced. Through my craft, I hope to inspire and share the peace and joy I feel whenever I create and paint.\nI painted all the paintings,shot all the photographs and did part of the computer animation featured in this kick starter project. The entire project was completed by me and two students, Jason Yong and Jacon Lim from DVFX, Ngee Ann Polytechnic\n\n(www.cherngzhi.com)\nBYND ARTISTAN | Partner & Manufacturer\nThe Goy Liang Book-Making Company had its first true home in 1945 when it was set up in a little shop house along Mohamed Sultan Road. It was a family-run business that served a genuine need and it gradually grew beyond the boundaries of Singapore and Malaysia.\nThrough the intervening years, the business of book-binding has moved inexorably with the progress of technology. Yet at its heart, each and every book had its beginning much like in the days of old - hand-designed and prototyped by a small band of craftsmen who grew up in the trade.\nBynd Artisan was conceptualized to celebrate the joy of traditional paper and leather making.  Bynd Artisan hopes to write its own history through the remarkable output of Singapore\u2019s greatest practicing craftsmen.\n\nThe Company has manufacturing facilities both in Singapore & Malaysia.\n(http://www.byndartisan.com)\nGrandluxe is the parent company of the Label Bynd Artisan\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated Time Schedule\nThe thicker the arrow = more funds goes there\n\nThis really is a project derived through an impulse based on personal need. Due to the requirement of new materials that was unavailable at the manufacturer, the cost of materials would be very high if I only made enough for personal consumption, so I decided to open up the availability of this pet project so that supporters may enjoy the same high quality that I personally demand while driving costs down for all of us. Kindly note that funds are subjected to 5% commission from Kickstarter and 5% from Amazon for credit card transaction fees. I have made most of the graphics and shot the photographs myself.

COOLMATERIAL\n\u201cIt easily competes with the best midrange names like the Jawbone Mini Jambox or Soundmatters FoxL DASH 7, which were my favorites until today.\u201d CNET\nThe product won the CNBC TechCrowd competition with 79% of all votes.\nIt all started in 2013 when a designer from San Francisco teamed up with a group of acoustic experts and manufacturing veterans, with the vision of creating a line of portable speakers that would challenge the trend of a booming Bluetooth speaker market that packed lots of features into products, but lacked focus on acoustic performance.\nWe launched NudeAudio last summer with a line of fashion forward portable speakers in three sizes. L for around the house, M to grab and take to the park and S to leave attached to your snowboard jacket or backpack. \nThe launch was received with fantastic feedback from the tech, fashion and design communities. Less than a year after launch, we found ourselves selling products in over 40 countries.\nThe grab-and-go size of M proved to be by far our most popular, so for our next and most ambitious development to date, we decided to explore how far we could take the acoustics in the M size. The result is Super-M.\n4 full-range, high-performance neodymium drivers are tightly packed on both sides of the Super-M, with each pair complemented by a passive radiator, totalling 6 drivers.\nThese are driven by highly efficient amplifiers and a powerful Lithium-ion battery. A state-of-the-art Bluetooth 4.0 chipset ensures the best signal and efficient battery use.\nThis innovative and unconventional set-up means Super-M can pump out incredible, 360\u00ba sound and keep the party going for 8-hours straight, all from a package that fits in your jeans pocket.\nThe final step was sealing the whole package for IPX-5 waterproof rating and sand-proof so the Super-M can be taken anywhere.\n\u201cTom asked me to audition the NudeAudio Move range in S, M & L against the big-brand competition and I was astonished with the rich, natural sound. I blind-tested the M and a competitor three times the price and the M won hands-down. Super-M takes this performance to the next level.\"\n\nHugh Padgham - Record producer for artists such as David Bowie, Genesis, The Police and Sting.\nPLAY\n\nPeter Riering-Czekalla, Chief Design Officer, is the creative lead of NudeAudio and is looking after all elements of design and brand experience. Trained as an industrial designer in Germany, he worked at IDEO for almost a decade. During that time, he led teams to develop design and brand strategies for fortune 500 companies like Samsung, Nike, Microsoft, etc. NudeAudio is a reflection of his passion to create simple, yet playful products for the everyday.\nTom Dudderidge, CEO, a serial tech and hardware entrepreneur, spent the last 10-years leading the business that built the largest docking station brand in Europe, GEAR4. Many of this team make up the Hong Kong and China engineering and operations for NudeAudio. Tom\u2019s father Phil is the Chairman of NudeAudio. He started out as live sound engineer for bands such as Led Zeppelin in the 1970s. He then founded Soundcraft, which invented the modern mixing console, and is now Chairman of Focusrite & Novation, leaders in professional audio interfaces, synthesisers and DJ gear.\nAt NudeAudio we are passionate about our fair price policy, so we're offering a wide-range of rewards where no backer will pay more than $99 - delivered - for a Super-M on Kickstarter, wherever you come from, and whichever colour or collaboration you select. \nUPDATE: FREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPING (NO EXCEPTIONS!) - OUR PLEDGE TO YOU!\nBecause of the overwhelming response from international backers, we have now announced that we will ship anywhere in the world with no exceptions. It's always been our intention that nobody pays more than $99 for a Super-M, wherever they come from, and because of the initial success of our campaign we feel we are able to make this pledge ourselves. \nPlease note that pledges in California will be subject to sales tax, so please add 9% (pledge $108 for $99 pledge) or we will have to eat it ourselves!\nYOU CAN EXTEND AN EXISTING PLEDGE BY SIMPLY ADDING AN AMOUNT AND SENDING US A QUICK NOTE.\nWe introduced black this spring for our entire product range with great reception. What better color than monochromatic black to launch our Super-M with?\nWe are introducing seasonal colors in alignment with the latest fashion trends. This fall, we have Petrol, Pine and Plum. Complex but muted in monochromatic style.\nMany of you asked for it so we added a Kickstarter edition. Black body with iconic Kickstarter-green cord.\nWe've also collaborated and handful of our friends and supporters to deliver some Kickstarter exclusive Special Edition designs, which we will be launching during the campaign. Don't worry about your color or Special Edition choice for now, you will only need to decide when we email you later after you've backed us. So keep watching our updates during the campaign to see the different collaboration options as they are released.\nThe last but certainly not least collaboration we are presenting is with the Kickstarter community itself. We announced to create a community color as a $500K stretch goal, created and decided by the backer community. After many suggestions from everyone, we visualized 9 options and put them out for a vote. Black and Coral was the clear winner. (please note above image is a computer visualization)\nAs a business centred on our passions for design and music, we like to think that NudeAudio is a contributor to the arts. Our collaborations with other artists and brands are a great opportunity to work with other people's passions too.\nDavid is a London street artist who travels the world, painting murals and creating objects and canvasses. His work can be seen in the streets a few blocks from Kickstarter HQ, as well as in villages in Africa, projects in Kosovo, in Cape Town, Japan and Rotterdam, to name just a few places.\nDavid came to OUR UK office a few weeks ago and painted an amazing mural on the wall. He also agreed to hand paint 20 sets of grilles of Super-M to create a David Shillinglaw Limited Edition especially for Kickstarter backers. These will each be bundled with Limited Edition 'Kingless Kingdom' print.\nLimited Edition David Shillinglaw Hand-Painted Super-M plus 'Kingless Kingdom' Limited Edition Single Colour Screenprint (from run of 100)\nEXISTING BACKERS PLEASE LOOK AT FAQ BELOW\n\nBelow is a short video that we made while David was painting the mural in our offices, I hope you enjoy it and David's unique character.\nPLAY\n\nWe are talking a lot about protecting the technology inside the speaker against its environment. But let\u2019s not forget that we first need the environment to enjoy the speaker in. So let\u2019s try help protecting it, a little bit at the time.\nIntroducing the Cuipo special edition. With each unit sold, we will purchase 5 square meters of rain forest for you to own and keep protected against deforestation. You will receive documentation and the geolocation of your personal 5 square meters. Interesting fact is that there is a population of one monkey per square meter. But no, you will not own 5 monkeys!\nThe main body is kept in a safari green with a contrasting bright red cord to make sure you don't lose it in the jungle.\nWe are partnering on this with Cuipo, a lifestyle brand dedicated to preserving prime rainforest around the globe. Cuipo was created to inspire the preservation of our planet's most vital ecosystem by empowering individuals and institutions to act and become responsible trustees of our planet.\nWe are very excited to announce a new Special Edition Super-M collaboration with UK star-DJ, MistaJam.\nWorking closely with Peter, he designed the duotone black and turquoise Super-M with a slice of colour peeping through the grill, exposing both the MistaJam and Speakerbox logo. The MistaJam presents Speakerbox logo has also been screen printed to the base, and of course finished it off with our trademark NudeAudio cord in turquoise. \nClick the video link below to hear what the man himself has to say about it: \nPLAY\n\nWe're pretty excited, and hope you like this new option as much as we do.\nIn addition to the special editions that we will continue to announce during the campaign, we are delighted to announce an exclusive Limited Edition today, live from Miami, Florida. \nIn celebration of late night parties, sleeping in, weekend getaways, staycations, singing in the shower and breakfast in bed, we are stripping down and teaming up with one of our favorite hotels, The Standard, to bring you a custom speaker evocative of our worlds. \nWith their devotion to design and innovation, The Standard are at the forefront of the industry with five properties in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami. And in true Nude style, The Standard's Limited Edition Super-M is in the buff, colored monotone nude.\nThe Standard X Nude speaker is available to all of our Early Bird backers, (select it when we ask for your color choice), and there are only 100 limited edition pledges available so pledge quickly before they disappear.\nYelle is a recording artist from France, currently touring the USA. They have released 2 albums, Pop Up and Safari Disco Club, with a third album, Compl\u00e8tement Fou, eagerly anticipated. NudeAudio loves their brand of dance floor friendly European disco-pop, and the band have designed their Yelle Special Edition Super-M in a standout bright blue with red silk screened logo on the base to match their album cover.\nPLAY\n\nWe've had a great number of requests for a bike mount for Super-M, so we decided to offer one. Since it hasn\u2019t been designed yet, it\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for a collaborative design project. Join us for the ride by pledging $124 which includes the bike mount plus Super-M.\nAbove picture is a functional prototype to proof the idea. Look and feel is to be designed in the coming weeks.\nTHE PROCESS: We just started thinking about the design and what you see on the picture above is only our first prototype. We will facilitate the process gathering your input and translating it into ideas that will be shared with you to feedback on. Please share your initial insights and ideas, as well as feedback on the first prototype here. Based on your thoughts over the next few days, we will be iterating on the design and present new iterations before the end of the campaign.\nTHE DESIGNER: NudeAudio partnered up with Adam Reineck, ex IDEO, bike design superstar who helped design the Faraday bike as well as the Spurcycle Bicycle Bell. Both of which gained a lot of appraise across the bike and design community.\nWe had a lot of comments on ideas for additional colors. Extra thanks to Henri who even sent some designs over. Every color has a minimum order quantity and while we always liked to have more colors, we had to draw a line. \nIf we reach 500K, we'll add one color and have YOU design it. We will invite everyone to tell us their color idea, collect them all and visualize the most popular suggestions. At the end of the campaign, we'll put them out for vote to all backers and produce whatever turns out to be the community favorite.\nEarlier in the campaign we revealed that there was a candidate for an upgraded driver for Super-M. Packed with four, even a small cost increase is multiplied 4 times, and the potential cost increase to include the upgraded drivers was high. But there was a noticeable improvement and we set a stretch goal at $550k, as we need the volume to get a good price from the supplier and justify the margin hit.\nWe're pretty certain that we'll hit the goal, but we're uncomfortable leaving you guys hanging and wondering whether or not the upgrade is coming. Furthermore, while we are doing parallel tuning processes for both driver types, it's important that we lock it down soon so we can ensure we don't have any procurement hiccups.\nSo we've decided today that we are going to guarantee the stretch goal now, which will make you guys happy, whilst reducing supply chain risks, and make communication easier over the coming days.\nTom & Peter demonstrate and challenge the IPX5 Waterproof rating\nPLAY\n\nPeter takes a look at the hardware and explains some of the functionality.\nPLAY\n\nOK, you got this far, so we figured you're really interested (or have time on your hands). Either way, here's a 5 minute video of Tom unboxing and reacting to the latest prototype, demoing the simple functionality, and describing the final steps of development, all in a single (first) take!\nPLAY\n\n  It's a cruel world, and the conventional way to launch new brands and products in this very crowded market takes a lot of effort and money and can be very risky.\nWe know that when people hear our philosophy and our story, when they see and hear our products, it really resonates. Every NudeAudio owner that we've talked to is a big fan. But we don't have the resource to market in the traditional way with advertising and big in-store presence.\nKickstarter, and you, our crowd, seems to be the very best way for us to spread the word. By offering the product at a very fair price, with shipping included worldwide, we hope that you guys will give a a little back by sharing with your friends, giving us great feedback, and joining our mission for better sound.\nEntering mass production for a high-volume consumer product like Super-M is a big investment. We need to raise at least $75,000 to fund the balance of our minimum production run (hence the target), and we've got access to parts for up to 10,000 units immediately if the campaign is big success, before hitting long lead times for additional parts.\nWe'll use you pledges to get into mass production and use the residual funds and the momentum of the campaign to get our brand out into the big, bad world and stand up to our big-bucks competition. Thank you!\nDisclaimer: There is no disclaimer. We decided to give everyone free world wide shipping!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the time of writing, Super-M is very close to pilot production, with virtually all hardware parts developed. The audio tuning process described in the video above is commencing. At this stage of development, the risks associated with the development project have been almost entirely eliminated.\n\nThere are also inherent supply chain risks which need to be managed, but we have secured parts for the first 10,000 units of production so these risks are controlled at least for this level of production. Our contract manufacturing partner is a large, experienced company with members of our respective teams have long-lasting relationships going back 10 years.\n\nQuality is also something that needs close management in any manufacturing process. Our quality team, based in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, follow professional processes to ensure that quality is managed throughout the design, development, supply chain and manufacturing process.\n\nDisruptive Hong Kong, parent company to NudeAudio, will take responsibility for fulfilment of all product pledges, which will be shipped direct to our backers worldwide directly from Hong Kong as soon as production has been completed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Update correction!", "update_content": "Dear NudeAudio friends and backers,\n\nToday we received confirmation that the Yelle and MistaJam collaboration Super-Ms have arrived in our Hong Kong warehouse, and are ready to ship out to our distribution centres world-wide.

During these commutes I'm regularly faced with the challenge of carrying stuff while biking. Everything from phones to packages and bike locks there are many challenges to carrying and accessing stuff while biking.\nIn this project I wanted to design simple solutions for some of these everyday bike commute problems. Over the last year, I\u2019ve come up with over 50 designs and 30 functional prototypes. Sketch after sketch, proto after proto, I\u2019ve narrowed it down to 3 simple designs I call TYNY Tools Collection 1.\nKEY CLIPS\nOriginally designed to quickly locate and access my bike lock keys, Key Clips can be used to attach anything onto your bike or backpack. You can use it indoors for electronic cord management or bundling stuff together. Made with super strong industrial silicone and a unique swivel carabiner design you can use one or multiple units to strap down many many things. Comes in 3 great colors and 2 different sizes.\nPerfect Keychains\nBike Rack Straps\nBackpack Attachment Straps\nYoga Mat Straps\nAvailable in 2 sizes / 3 colors\nSmall Length 7 in\nMedium Length 11 in\nSWIVEL CLIPS\nI took the unique swivel carabiner design from the Key Clips and joined it together with a twin. Two carabiners merged into one simple design that swivels, expands the functionality over the traditional carabiner. Hang, store, clip and organize anything you want. Comes in 3 great colors and 3 different sizes.\nKeys\nClip Water Bottles to Backpacks\nHang Lanterns\nAvailable in 3 sizes / 3 colors\nSmall 1/2\" x 1 1/2\" \nMedium 1\" x 2 3/4\"\nLarge 1 1/2\" x 3 1/2\" \nLOCK BANDS\nMade with the same industrial silicon material as the Key Clips, the Lock Bands come with a small locking clip perfect for wrapping your bike pump around your bike tube, attaching your smart phone onto handle bars or wrapping any electrical chords together. You can join multiple rings together for the right size you need. Comes in 3 great colors.\nManaging Electrical Chords \nAttach Phones to Bike Handle Bars\nAttach Frame Pumps to Bikes\nAvailable in 3 colors\nDiameter 2 3/4\"\nWHAT WE NEED\nNow that we've completed the design process, we have to navigate the expensive process of manufacturing and producing this product. While we're close to entering production, your contributions will help fund the final tooling molds and material costs. Combined, these expenses make it difficult for a small company like Tyny Tools to design and produce an innovative product. With your help we can meet our goal of $15,000 and be well on our way to bringing these amazing products to market for you!\nREWARDS\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nInternational backers will be responsible for applicable tariffs and customs fees.\nPRODUCTION SCHEDULE\nWe\u2019ll ship in Summer 2014.

We have spent 5 years tinkering, problem solving and innovating to reach the stage we are at now\u2026.and we are proud of the results from our labour. Through an innovative and unique fold-a-bowl design, the RMDLO Colander is capable of folding closed to a fraction of its in use size, making it a modern kitchen utensil ideally suited for anyone with space saving in mind.\nThe Fold-A-Bowl Tech\nObsessed with origami and geometry, we were convinced the humble colander could be folded up. So we came up with RMDLO\u2019s Fold-A-Bowl technology (patent pending). This design concept allows several stainless steel sheets to be effortlessly collapsed in on top of one another at the flick of a wrist.\nStorage Made Easy\nThanks to the Fold-A-Bowl technology, the RMDLO Colander is very easy to store, especially when compared with its more traditional cousin. Closed, the colander is just 1.6cm thick and can be easily slid into a cutlery drawer, back-pack or alternatively, hung (using one of its O handles) from a nail or peg on the wall. What better way to enjoy the RMDLO Colander\u2019s contemporary design then by prominently displaying it on your Kitchen wall for all to admire! \nFlexibility for the Chef\nAnother problem that RMDLO set out to solve was the complete inflexibility that plagues the rigid design of the more traditional colander. Imagine the scene...your pasta has been properly strained and then you try to guide it onto your plate and...it slides out in one big mass, spilling everywhere! So frustrating! Thanks to the RMDLO Colander\u2019s flexible design, it is possible to squeeze it together with your fingers, forming a basket shape which will allow you to simply guide the food onto your plate.....with no messy margins for error!\nSimply squeeze together in order to pour into small containers.\nSafe and Easy to Clean\nWe take the safety of all our designs very seriously. The RMDLO Colander is made from non-toxic kitchen grade materials. The stainless steel is specially heat treated before being rolled to remove any impurities. The O rings are made from BPA free non pollutant plastics. The colander is easy to clean either by hand or thanks to its corrosion free properties and compact size, it is also dishwasher ready.\nAre Looks Important? Absolutely!\nAt RMDLO we believe so. The RMDLO Colander encapsulates everything that we hold dear in our brand \u2013 quality, design and especially, space saving. Precision cut stainless steel sheets infused with beautifully crafted plastic rings, allow the RMDLO Colander to put the \u201cCool\u201d back into colander. Taking pride of place on your kitchen counter or mounted to the wall, it will never look out of place in any kitchen.\nFor whom?\nThanks to its space saving credentials, the RMDLO Colander is ideally suited towards people with limited space in their kitchen. Whether in a caravan, shared or perhaps just smaller kitchen, the RMDLO Colander will effortlessly slide into a drawer or conveniently hang on the wall using up as little precious space as possible. Alternatively, its versatile and portable design, allows it to be taken out and about with you for picnics, festivals or any other outdoor pursuits. Easy to clean and safe to operate, the RMDLO Colander can be used by people of all ages.\nPledges Explained\nPost Kickstarter Plan?\n55% - Design refinement, tools & moulds\n45% - Manufacturing, packaging & delivery\n0%   - Filling the office fridge (or an office...)\nThe first thing we want to make clear is that no funds will be wasted on salaries, marketing campaigns, filling an office fridge - even an office for that matter! Or any other irrelevant and expensive activity that does not directly benefit backers or improve the product. The key areas where the funds will be spent are as follows \u2013\n\n- Engineering Development \u2013 a large proportion of funds raised will be spent on a three month further development programme with a world class engineering firm. Their job is to make the product the very best it could be from a functional and visual perspective.\n- Tooling \u2013 we need to produce hard tooling to lovingly cut, bend and mould the components required to assemble each colander.\n- Manufacturing \u2013 setting up production line, assembly, packaging & quality assurance.\n- Logistics \u2013 we want to ensure that our deliveries to our backers are as quick and efficient as possible.\nMarket Testing\nWe don\u2019t get to go out much but we decided to take the RMDLO Colander on the road and ask a few people what they thought. In practice the \u201cfew people\u201d turned into hundreds and honestly, it is hard to quantify the positive reaction! Not a single person that we showed and tested the colander on walked away without a smile on their face or agreeing that they would \u201cdefinitely buy one of those\u201d. Some of the most commonly used comments/questions were as follows \u2013\n\u201cWhere and when can I buy one of those?\u201d \u2013 All in good time my friend.\n\u201cNow that is cool!\u201d \u2013 Indeed.\n\u201cIs it stainless steel? \u2013 Yes, only the best will do.\n\u201cIs that a sex toy?\u201d \u2013 Errrmmmm, I need to go now!\nNo, we can\u2019t produce statistical evidence but please do watch the video above.\nWho is Behind RMDLO?\nRan, Industrial designer/Co-founder\nHola! I\u2019m Ran and the inventor behind the RMDLO colander. In my career I've had a chance to design many different objects, from shoes & toys up to mobile phones & TVs. I've had the pleasure of working for Samsung, Dyson and Speedo as part of their innovation teams. Working directly for Dyson's founder, Sir James, was the best of all where I was able to learn so much about what makes a great and functional product. I have taken these lessons with me and ploughed them into the making of the RMDLO Colander. My responsibility @ RMDLO is designing our customers a perfect product :)\nFred, Commercial director/Co-founder\nBonjour, I am Fred. I have been working in product based businesses for the last 8 years. I am obsessed with cool looking and innovative products, an obsession which lead me to co-create RMDLO with my buddy Ran. My responsibilities @ RMDLO are the operational and business aspects of the project, so it is my job to get the products produced and to your door step as quickly and efficiently as possible!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Product\nThe colander in its current form is market ready but not to the highest standard that we expect at RMDLO. Therefore it will go into a final design for manufacturing stage with an engineering firm in the 3 months following our campaign of further development work on the product in order to address a small list of design issues that the product currently has. There is no guarantee that the engineering firm will be able to fix all the issues.\n\nReassurance: Rest assured that the issues are minimal and the engineering firm who would be contracted are one of the world\u2019s foremost firms in the field of product development.\n\nDelays\nWe will of course do our upmost to ensure that we hit delivery dates, however, as with all pre-order programmes, we must remind fellow pledgers that often delays can occur as a result of unforeseen circumstances. Ships sinking \uf04a, parts turning out incorrect etc, are all potential risks that if realised will create delays to the project\u2019s deliverables.\n\nReassurance: Rest assured however, we have a great team with substantial manufacturing experience so the delay risks are minimised.

Most tape dispensers are purely functional products and do not really make you smile. Other \u2018design dispensers\u2019 loose there functionality in being cool or are just too expensive. I hope you agree that I have found the perfect balance. A tape dispenser that is everything Dutch design stands for: timeless, smart and beautifully simplistic.\nMany, many prototypes to get it just right.\nThe dispenser\nAfter many design sessions I found the ring shape of the tape itself to be the perfect form. This ring is made out of flexible plastic to allow the tape to be clicked into the dispenser. Simplistic, playful and very easy to use. \nClickTape dispenser: ready to role!\nThe shape and production are fully optimised over a period of many months. Making one dispenser now only requires 12 grams of plastic. Sustainable it is!\nThe ClickTape dispenser is designed to stand out on your home or office desk but it is also very portable.\nClickTape: the ideal travel companion\nNew available Colours\nWe have selected Black and Blue as our main colours and Turquoise,  Kickstarter Green and Red to be our Backer specials. Check it out!\nThe colours samples below are from our supplier, this will give each ClickTape dispenser a rich color. \nColor samples (red to be added shortly)\nHow to use it\nAlthough the project video covers it all, you can find the individual usage steps below.\nAdding tape\nThe ClickTape dispenser is made out of plastic and is designed to be flexible. A role of tape can simply be clicked into the dispenser.\nPLAY\n\nUsing the tape\nThe dispenser is fitted with a stainless steel blade for durability and quick action. A small step in the blade helps you to get hold of the tape.\nPLAY\n\nRemoving the tape\nBecause of the flexibility of the dispenser it is easy to push or pull out the tape or remaining core.\nThe tape\nThe ClickTape dispenser will be sold with a role of 'invisible' tape, but also fits all other tapes measuring (like Scotch or Staples) : \nTape width 19 mm (3/4 inch). \nCore width 19mm (3/4 inch)  *some 19mm wide tapes have a smaller core width, this may not fit the dispenser.\n Internal diameter of core 26 mm (1 inch) \nThe ring shape is designed based on a 60mm (2.36 inch) diameter, which equals a tape length of about 33 meters (1296 inch). It will fit smaller but results in less magic.\nRewards\nAll rewards include free shipping :-)\nInvestment\nKickstarter is the ideal platform to get products that require a large investment, like the ClickTape dispenser, to market and available for you!\nThe 9.500 euro funding does not include any profit and will be used for:\nTooling\nProduction tooling for injection moulding the dispenser.

If we are able to reach our goal, tooling will be initiated in June. The tooling of the metal moulds for the dispenser will take up most of the lead time. Once the tooling is completed and fine-tuned production can be started.

We felt from the start that Kickstarter would be the ideal place to launch The TravelCard\u2122.  Support and feedback from the Kickstarter community on The TravelCard\u2122 and future products will be invaluable.\nGO DESIGN was founded with the aim of producing products that provide problem-solving solutions for busy people.  The TravelCard\u2122 and other products we have on the drawing board accomplish this goal by taking a simple-is-better approach to functionality, without sacrificing design elements.\nBrian Neufang's background is in sales and marketing of consumer products. He was also a producer on the Kickstarter-funded indie hit movie, \"Ingenious.\" Our other partners/employees have extensive experience creating and sourcing successful products for national retailers, including unique houseware items, animated watches and computer accessories. \nWe hope to build the business by becoming known as the small company with big time saving ideas.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce The TravelCard\u2122 concept was found to be feasible, we located an ultra-thin Lithium battery source. Then we methodically sought out an experienced Apple certified factory to produce The Travel Card. The Chinese factory we selected has been in business over eight years, has 450 employees and has gone through an extensive certification process to become Apple MFI (Made for iPhone) 6.0 licensed. Apple approved our factory's initial design prototype in November 2013. The final step in the approval process will be Apple signing off on a production sample and issuing a MFI license. There is always the possibility that Apple could want modifications made before approval. But according to the head engineer at our factory, this is unlikely since Apple has already approved the design. Our factory has had a close working relationship with Apple, having produced over forty MFI products.\n\nWe feel we've allowed ample time for pre-production, and once production is under way, we are confident that our factory has the capacity to keep up with demand.\n\nManufacturing delays could occur, but our sources tell us our factory is very reliable. We believe this to be the case or they wouldn't be Apple certified.\n\nShipping to our backers around the world in a timely manner presents a challenge because of the increased restrictions on products with batteries.

We know that Nanotips will be a great addition to your lives. If you missed the Kickstarter, no worries, you can buy it direct from our website at www.Nanotips.ca!\nThe liquid solution to your everyday problem.  If you wear gloves and own a touchscreen device, Nanotips is for you. \nWhat is Nanotips? It's a conductive polyamide liquid solution that can transform your ordinary gloves into touchscreen ones. Formulated using nanotechnology, Nanotips mimics the touch of human skin. It was designed with functionality and durability in mind making it great for all lifestyles. \nWhy Nanotips? How many pairs of gloves do you own? How many of them are touchscreen compatible?  Nanotips is the most cost friendly and effective solution that will transform all the gloves you own into touchscreen ones.  Upgrade your existing gloves or choose from a wider selection without being limited to style, comfort, and functionality.  \nLong lasting. Our formula is designed to last. Each application can last from a few weeks to a few months. It all depends on what you use your gloves for.  If it wears off, simply re-apply!\nRestoring functionality. Touchscreen gloves eventually stop working from daily wear and tear. Nanotips has the ability to restore the functionality and value to these gloves.\nMultiple applications. We have put enough liquid into each bottle to treat multiple gloves.  Nanotips Blue can treat an average of 15 fingers while Nanotips Black can treat up to 30!  So go ahead. Share with a friend or turn all your gloves into touchscreen gloves!\nFreedom to choose. With the huge variety of gloves on the market, why should you be limited to the select few that have touchscreen compatibility? Nanotips gives you the freedom to choose the perfect glove while not having to worry about touchscreen functionality.\nNANOTIPS is for everyone. From the cold winter months to the hot summer days, Nanotips is functional in every season.  Military gloves, running gloves, biking gloves, construction gloves, golfing gloves and even the thickest snowboarding and skiing gloves can now all be made touchscreen compatible. \nWinter Sports. Extremely durable and weather resistant. Nanotips will work in any weather and accept any abuse you throw at it.\nEveryday. Never limit yourself to certain styles. Give yourself the freedom of choice!\nWork Gloves. They don't make touchscreen work gloves because the touchscreen material would wear out too quickly. Our unique formula allows it to withstand even the roughest conditions. If it wears off, just re-apply.\nOn the go. Music and Lifestyle apps. Stay connected.\nYou might know this feeling if you ride a bike...\nWith simplicity and functionality in mind, we set out to create the quickest and most effective universal touchscreen upgrade ever. This formula has been created to last in any condition and takes less than 2 minutes to apply.   \nAPPLY\nDRY\nUSE\nWe have formulated two solutions to meet your specific needs: Nanotips Blue and Nanotips Black.\nNANOTIPS Blue\nFor use on fabrics ONLY. Nanotips Blue is designed specifically for fabrics.  This solution dries to a transparent blue which makes it practically invisible on colored fabrics. This formula soaks into the fabric creating a conductive bridge between your finger and the touchscreen device. Treats up to 15 fingers per bottle depending on material.\nNanotips Black\nNanotips Black is specifically tailored for leathers, rubbers, and other thicker materials. This formula works for all materials, however it may alter the texture of your fabric gloves. This formula can work in two ways. A) It creates a conductive layer on the surface of your glove B) It soaks into the fabric and creates a conductive bridge between the finger and the touchscreen device. Treats up to 30 fingers per bottle depending on material.\nGet your exclusive Kickstarter Nanotips T-Shirt before its too late!

Details in the updates!\nCONDUCTIVE CIRCUIT\nDraw and create your own circuits with Nanotips Black!\nResearch and Testing\nWe began testing different formulations that would meet our specific requirements.  We started in a garage, carefully mixing and testing each solution with Durability, Simplicity, and Functionality in mind. We came out with a product that is finally ready for the market!\nOur design progression\nTechnical Details\nNanotips Black. Quite a bit of work has been done in the development of this product. Comprised of evenly dispersed ultra-fine conductive nanoparticles, each particle is carefully prepped and made to interlink with one another; this helps to form a conductive grid-like film on the surface of the material. Because your glove undergoes constant flex, abrasion, creasing, and natural elements, our formula allows the materials to remain in grid formation even under extreme conditions. This helps to create an evenly distributed conductive channel on the surface of your glove. \nNanotips Blue. Comprised of evenly dispersed ultra-fine conductive nanoparticles, each particle is carefully prepped and made to interlink with one another.  These particles are suspended in a solution which allows the nanoparticles to remain chained to one another even under extreme physical stressors. When applied to fabrics, Nanotips Blue soaks into the material and effectively creates a conductive chain, bridging the gap between your finger and the touchscreen device. The sacrifice for transparency over conductivity was made for Nanotips Blue which is the reason why this solution only functions for fabrics.\nBottles. Our bottles are made from glass. We chose glass over other materials because it allows the liquid to achieve a longer shelf life as it remains sealed in the bottle. The brush is a Dupont nylon brush. Using the brush method of application means that each individual would be able to precisely apply the solution to the targeted area.\nThe hard part is done and the working prototype is complete. We now have a product that we feel will revolutionize this industry. We need your help to get this product to market. Our production partners are ready and we need your pledges to help initiate the first large scale production run! Jump on board as one of the founders of Nanotips. Each dollar backed will help make this product a reality! \nManufacturing Plan\nAs soon as we reach our funding goal we will begin production. The total production time from the time we reach our funding goal is approximately 2.5 weeks.  The sooner we hit our goal the quicker we can get Nanotips into your hands!  \nThe breakdown...\n>> Orders will be placed for Labels, Bottles, and Boxes. Production and shipping time for these products takes roughly 1-2 weeks.\n>> Raw materials used in the formulation of the liquid will be ordered as soon as we reach our funding goal.  They are local companies which makes it convenient pick up within 5 days.\n>> Once all the materials have arrived, we will begin production.  Getting Nanotips into your hands as soon as possible. 1-2 weeks.\n>> The formula will be produced using a large batch method.  Every 100 grams will be thoroughly tested to ensure consistency throughout the batch.  \n>> Delivery of the product will be managed by our logistics team.  We will have the product shipped out to you as soon as it is tested and ready. Shipping time 5-7 business days depending on location.\nIf our campaign is successful, we would like to continue our research to expand in these areas. Feel free to leave any comments or suggestions on how you would like to see our product developed!\nPROSTHETIC HANDS.  During the creation of Nanotips, we had discovered that many prosthetic limbs are unable to interact with capacitive touchscreen devices. Because touchscreen technology is such an integral part of our society, daily interactions for anyone with prosthetic hands becomes a challenge. We would like to expand in this field by testing Nanotips on a variety of prosthetics; our goal is to give them the ability to easily interact with touchscreen devices. \nJump to 3:00 to see how difficult it is to use a touchscreen device with a prosthetic.\nTRANSPARENT SOLUTION.  We are constantly working towards making a fully transparent universal solution. The idea is to create a touchscreen liquid that would work with all materials and is invisible to the naked eye.

JUMP creates a new category of product \u2013 one that fulfills these previously ignored aspects of the user experience.\nWe have therefore developed a new solution: something that is thoughtful, intelligent and efficient by design.\nJUMP is not just a charging cable; it also provides your smartphone with a substantial power boost wherever you are, without ever having to remember to charge it. Perfect for work, play, and travel.\nJUMP Delivers\nWe managed to pack 800mAh into this compact form factor that weighs less than two AA batteries. This provides over 3 hours additional talk-time: more than enough time to get you out of (or into) trouble.\nJUMP charges itself every time you charge your smartphone\nJUMP is your everyday charging cable that syncs and charges your smartphone. The 19 inch (48 cm) cable supports high-speed data transfer.\nUnlike power banks, JUMP charges automatically every time you charge your phone, giving you complete reassurance that whatever situation you are in, there\u2019s always power in your pocket.\nWe developed intelligent technology called AutoCharge\u2122 \nAutoCharge\u2122 is an efficient circuit prioritization system that detects when the battery inside your smartphone is full, and automatically redirects the power to charge the batteries inside JUMP.\nIt's always ready and charged\nJump provides a significant power boost to your smartphone when you need it most.\nIt's compact and lightweight\nJUMP fits easily in your coin pocket. (50mm x 50mm x 13.6mm)\nWith it\u2019s compact size, JUMP is small enough to hold behind your phone as you call.\n JUMP is case-friendly\nIt even fits with the official iPhone case\nWe designed JUMP to be your everyday charging solution. One of the priorities was to ensure it is small and compact, no bigger than your average rolled up cable, allowing you to take it with you wherever you go.  \nThe cable management system enables you to carry JUMP easily and neatly; no more messy cables thrown into your pocket or bag.\nPrecision-engineered channels securely hold the cable, allowing you to pull out the desired length during charging, as well as fastening whilst on the go.\nIntelligent design that is robust, compact and portable\nQuality of the components are extremely important to us \u2013 we wanted to create a device that cannot only withstand the stresses of everyday use, but is also something that looks and feels really good.\nWe custom made cables from a hard-wearing resistant nylon, resulting in cables that are durable and long lasting. We wanted to use materials for the casing that would ensure strength and longevity; therefore, we selected a thermoplastic blend of PC and ABS.\nThis is what we have been waiting for.\nFeatures Overview\nThe Design Story\nToday's Working Prototype\nElectrical evaluation of the first working prototypes have proven AutoCharge\u2122 and we are confident that JUMP will provide substantial additional charge to an iPhone 5s as we move forward towards production.\nWhy Kickstarter \nWe wanted to share JUMP, our latest product, through Kickstarter first. We recognize that Kickstarter hosts an important community: artists, innovators, and the intellectually curious. We wanted to share the background and development of JUMP with you because we value your opinions and support. We believe we have started a new product category within the portable charging market; one that we hope you would like to follow the progress of.

They all said the same thing: \"Our customers don\u2019t care about domestically produced products.\" We call bullsh*t, but we need your help to prove them wrong.\n Let's give American Manufacturing its own yellow ribbon... a wearable way to show your support for the war they're fighting daily.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Bluelace itself: We asked one of America's very last shoelace manufacturers to produce the very best shoelace they'd ever made. \nAdding extra pressure to the pot, we promised them that if they could develop something truly impressive, it had the potential to become more than just a simple shoelace; it could become a symbol! \nAnd this symbol could do more than just help their business, it could help break the ongoing cycle of outsourcing, offshoring, and making things cheaper, faster and worse. It could help ALL American manufacturers. \nWe said that if this shoelace was amazing enough, and we get it into enough shoes and tied to enough wrists, it would let retailers know that cost isn't the only thing driving their customers' buying habits, and that if they stocked the right domestically produced goods, their customers would be willing to give them a chance. \nTHEY CAME BACK WITH A SHOELACE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'D EVER SEEN: A triple-dense, double-waxed canvas lace, tipped in Aluminum. Could they be the everlasting gobstoppers of shoelaces? They're certainly light-years ahead of whatever cheap lace came pre-loaded in your imported sneakers. \nSo how do we know THE BLUELACE is better? It's a good question. Truth be told, we weren't sure how to test 'em either. So we called our friend, American strongman Matt Mills and asked if he could put them through the ringer. We wanted to see if he could rip them like a phone book. He said he had a better idea though. \nWith nothing but a single pair of BLUELACES linking his harness to a set of ultra-heavy duty tow straps, he was able to pull a 13,000 pound truck!\nIf they're strong enough to pull a 13,000 pound truck, they're probably tough enough for whatever you'll put them through... they just might be sturdy enough to pull us all together!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy lace up blue at all? \nLacing up blue lets retailers know that you're willing to give a second look to domestically produced products. \nLacing up blue lets American manufacturers -- the men and women fighting to innovate and bring better-built products to market at a time when their competitors undercut them by cutting corners abroad -- know you appreciate the war they're fighting daily. \nEqually important, whether worn in a sneaker, boot, or tied to a wrist, lacing up blue is fun, bright, bold and vibrant.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhether or not you decide to take the plunge and lace up blue, we'd love it if you kept the following in mind this holiday seasons:\nAccording to printed reports, the United States has lost a staggering 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, every $1 spent on American made products fuels another $1.40 in spending elsewhere in the US economy. \nAccording to The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, on average, 1,276 manufacturing jobs were lost every day for the past 12 years.\nAccording to Diane Sawyer and ABC World News, if each of us spent just $64 on American made goods during our holiday shopping, the result would be 200,000 new jobs.\n For this particular project though, per $5 contribution\u2026\n$1 goes to Processing fees (10% of all money received is paid directly to New York City-based Kickstarter and Amazon for processing the transaction)\n$2 goes directly to our shoelace factory in Portsmouth Ohio for manufacturing the laces using American materials and shipping them to our warehouse. \n$1 covers shipping, this includes the stamps purchased from USPS and the envelope bought in bulk from our Texas-based manufacturer.\n$1 is paid to our Henderson, Nevada warehouse for packing each individual order (likely a set of BLUELACES plus whatever additional goodies we decide to throw in the pouch).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur stretch goals are all about helping to spread the word and telling OTHER American Manufacturer's stories.  \nWhen Flint and Tinder first launched on Kickstarter a little more than a year ago, we found that what drove the success of our underwear project was a simple idea: For the first time in a very long time, by telling their story in the video below, we connected the buyers with the makers in a very powerful way. \nIt was exciting stuff! And that connection ultimately helped us to keep 100 people employed and the factory doors open for far longer than anyone had forecasted. \nNow, with your support, we want to tell OTHER, amazing American manufacturing stories through video with the hope that we can make an even larger impact on their businesses...\nStories like the Fortune 500 CEO who gave it all up to revive a New England wool blanket factory. \nStories like the American machine shop that used old-world gearing techniques that helped to land the Rover on Mars. \nStories like the young, energetic team who bought a hat factory and are making the old cool using a mix of modern marketing and classic style. \nFor the first 5,000 backers and every 10,000 there after, who lend a hand to make THE BLUELACE PROJECT a reality, we'll produce another video and distribute it direct to your inbox.\nKnow of an amazing American manufacturing story?

Thanks to you, our backers, we have reached an amazing 800%+ of our goal! \n The Finex team and I will strive to live up to the level of confidence you have shown for us and the product. \n Please stay in contact by going to www.finexusa.com to continue to get information, and sign up for our newsletter. \nAgain: THANK YOU! \nMike Whitehead\n                                                                       A NOTE to the media: A full press page (with full resolution images) is available at www.finexusa.com/press-resources\n    Why did I start this?\nI love cast iron skillets but the well-finished ones are commanding an outrageous premium on Ebay, and they still have the old-school integrated handles that are too hot, too flat, and too small to use effectively. \nYou see, the newer skillets are just quickly cast and then tossed out for sale.  The insides (where the action happens!) are rough and build up a kind of gross burnt-food surface -- completely different than the wonderful carbon-based, inherently low-stick surface that a great cast iron skillet gains as it seasons.\nYou see, the inside of the newer cast iron skillets are NOT machined - they are left rough and rugged, which is a problem for serious cooks. They just don't release the food easily (leading to 'fractured foods'), nor do they allow that wonderful crispiness that forms on the bottom of skillet-cooked food to be picked up by a spatula and be transferred to your waiting plate. \nI decided that I needed to machine the inside of my skillets - despite the cost - because the surface finish on the skillet equaled the finish on the food.\nRe-designing a classic can seem brash\nI've completely re-worked the design. But, fear not! I've kept the best parts and then carefully added just the features that were really needed to upgrade this classic.  And, I got to use the best of current casting and machining technologies to really put it a 'step-above'!\nMade in the Pacific Northwest\nSourcing locally:\nOne design goal for me was to source everything in the US and to keep the sources close to my home city of Portland, Oregon. \nThis allowed me to use my existing sources of supply from my 'day job' (the ones I knew could, and would, perform well), and it let me keep a close eye on things and intervene with an on-site visit when needed (or when I wanted to watch industry-in-action!)\nPortland is known as a design and food-lovers destination - perfect for this skillet!\nIt's really hard to not love food when living in Portland. We've had the highest ratio of restaurants to population for decades. And, we were one of the earliest places for startups in the micro-brewery industry.\nInnovative Octagonal Shape\nThe octagonal shape lets you put the skillet on its side (like for drying it after washing) and it won't roll around like those 'other' skillets.\nPlus, it gives 6 directions that you can pour from, because each 'corner' becomes a pour-spout - it's a little bit like magic.\nThose flat sides also allow a spatula to slide in easily for getting under pancakes, fried eggs, etc.\nSpring Handle for Cooling and Comfortable Grip\nThere are three problems with the old-style skillet handle:\nThey are too small\nThey are too thin for comfort\nThey stay hot too long\nFinex has solved these problems!\nThe Finex spring handle harks back to the classic woodstove handles that kept us from burning our hands when stoking the fire. The spring design is both tried-and-true and brilliant.  \nThe spring handle has lots of air space so it cools quickly after being used in the oven or on a gas-burner stove-top.  \nPlus, its naturally curved shape fits in your hand giving a secure and comfortable grip, which is important when pouring or moving it around the kitchen with food in it. \nAnd, of course: it looks great!\nYou'll see that the handle is heavy-duty - it's made from 1/4\" diameter stainless steel. That makes it solid and easy to grab, yet open enough to cool quickly. \nThe bronze end-cap is a signature part of the skillet. It will also put up with anything you can throw at it in a kitchen environment. Bronze melts at 1,742 \u00b0F so unless you cook like my friend Charles, you'll be fine. (just joking about Charles' cooking!) :-)\n\nHere's a video of the prototyping prove-out run that we did at the spring house:\nCNC Machined Smooth Interior\nThe inside of the FINEX Skillet will be CNC machined. What this means for you is the inside will be very smooth - this makes it naturally less-stick, and easier to clean.\nPlus, it won't build up that scary-looking burnt-food 'ruggedness' that cheap import skillets grow over time - instead, it will season to a beautifully smooth carbonized surface that will cook like nothing else in the world.\nThis is what separates the great cast iron skillets from the 'cheap-os'. It adds cost and complexity to the manufacturing process but the results are stellar!\nManufacturing the Finex Skillet:\nThe Finex skillet will be cast using the oldest method around: SAND CASTING.  It may be the oldest method, but it's still the best for short-runs like this skillet! \nThe first-article pour will be streamed LIVE!\nOf course, over the last 2000+ years, sand-casting has improved dramatically, as have the alloys of cast iron. I'll be using one of the Northwest's premium sand-casting houses to pour these beauties, and I'll be on hand for the first pour, which we'll be streaming live as it happens. \nHere's a quick overview of how sand-casting is done:\nFirst, the design must available in digital form. Since the skillet was designed in CAD, that's already done.  \nThen, the CAD file is turned into toolpaths for a CNC vertical machining center to mill the pattern from a solid block of aluminum. \nUPDATE:\nThe Finex Skillet mold is being made from a polyurethane block that will then be embedded in an aluminum plate. Willamette Pattern chose to use the polyurethane board because it machines more easily and for the skillet it is a better choice.\nHere's a video of the mold being machined on Nov 5, 2013:\nAfter it is machined, the finished pattern mold is placed between two casting frames (called the flask, consisting of the the cope on top and the drag on bottom) and has the sand rammed in around it. The aluminum becomes the negative space that the molten cast iron is poured into.\nProject Timeline:\nThe Finex Coaster - a 'Thank You!' for our supporters\nWith over 90 craft breweries in the Portland area, it's hard for us not to appreciate a great coaster, and cork is the classic material, just like cast iron is the classic material for skillets.\nI offer these as a 'Thank you!' for supporting this project at $25.\n This cork coaster will be offered ONLY through Kickstarter for our backers.\nYES!  All Finex skillets will be lightly pre-seasoned\nSince launching the project many people have asked: \"Will it be pre-seasoned?\" The answer is \"Yes!\":\nYour Finex skillet will arrive lightly seasoned and include instructions for maintaining or re-seasoning it at any time.\nThe Finex skillet is seasoned with nature's ultimate oil - organic flaxseed oil that is cold-pressed and unrefined. Flax seed oil is fantastic at creating a hard, slick surface on cast iron that is the essence of cast iron's naturally low-stick cooking surface.\nIf you burn something in your skillet or a guest scrubs it with steel wool and soap (yipes!) - DON'T WORRY. Just use a little extra oil the next time you use it. When the cooking surface is this smooth it really takes the mystery out of seasoning the surface - that's one of the reasons we will be CNC machining the inside!\nHow much will the Finex Skillet weigh?\nThis is another question we've been getting and it points out that the (all-too-common) cheap import skillets are heavy! \nWhy? Because they use inferior alloys of cast iron, less fine-grained sand for casting, and don't machine the inside.\nAll of those bits of extra attention to detail and specifications will make the Finex Skillet weigh in at around 6 to 7 pounds vs. a 'cheapie' skillet at 8+ pounds.\nWe don't have exact numbers yet because the first round of actual cast iron casting will take place (with YOUR support!) in mid-November. But we can assure you that the Finex will be much easier to handle and work with on a regular basis than the cast iron skillets you can buy off the shelf currently.\nWe can tell you that the CAD system calculations say the skillet is right about 6.75 pounds and we've weighed the prototype spring handle at 1/2 pound, so that's a total of 7-1/4 pounds without the bronze knob at the end of the handle. \nThat's comparable to the weight of the best old-style skillet ever made, the Griswold 12\" (which has the problematic handle).  So, the Finex with that lusciously large handle will be a breeze to maneuver!\nIs a lid being planned?\nYes! A Finex skillet lid is being planned and we will announce it sometime after the first of the year.\nWe are making absolutely SURE that we do a great job of supporting our backers on this skillet before we take on more projects! \nHowever... we are excited about the lid as the Finex 8-sided design allows the lid to out-baste our competition with it\u2019s almost air tight fit and it doesn\u2019t have any air gaps where traditional pour spouts leak steam. \nMany people have asked about it scratching a glass stove top...\nCast iron is absolutely wonderful on smooth top ranges (glass and inductive heat).\nThat said, you are working on glass so I recommend minimizing how much you drag, slide or drop any cookware on glass topped ranges.\n A little bit about the team behind the Finex Skillet:\nDavid Lewin - Finex Industrial Designer\nDavid Lewin\nMike Whitehead approached David Lewin (http://www.lewindesigns.com/) with a gift of probably the hardest challenge an industrial designer could ask for -- create the ultimate functional product, using natural materials and local labor. Something that will literally last forever. \nDavid undertook shaping the skillet with respect to the traditions, added skillful insights and empathy for the everyday user. The result is a skillet that is elegant, versatile and a practical contribution to chefs everywhere.\nThank you, David!\n.\nKip Buck - Finex 3D modeler and drafter\nNike, Adidas, Keen, FILA, Lewin Design,Specialized, I Generator, ARIAT, Leupold are companies that Kip has had the pleasure to work with.

Visit our website at productofgir.com to get your hands on the Spatula and keep track of the latest from GIR.\nTHE STORY BEHIND IT ALL\nIt started with a common spatula\u2026 or more accurately, with a drawer of spatulas. For a tool that's so simple it's nearly two-dimensional, but integral to any cook's toolkit, we felt let down by every model we put in our hands.\nWooden handles burned on the edge of the pan and warped in the dishwasher. Metal handles were hot to the touch. Detachable blades and superfluous nooks and crannies trapped oil and food particles, which made cleaning a chore. Some were floppy, others so inflexible they couldn't scrape a bowl. And anything but a silicone blade had us worried that we'd ruin nonstick pans or be eating plastic out of the skillet if we turned around for more than a few seconds. Out of a collection of over a dozen, not a single one \"got it right.\"\nWe figured it was time for a change. So we designed a spatula that solved every one of those problems. Our small improvements to otherwise run-of-the-mill utensils have added up to an innovative, multi-purpose kitchen tool. And after several months of testing and prototype design, we're ready to rock and happy to introduce the patent-pending GIR Spatula: a single piece of molded silicone, heat resistant to 464\u00b0, easy to clean and easy to hold, flex- vs. structure-optimized.\nCORE DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS & KEY BENEFITS\nSAFE & HEAT RESISTANT\nThe Spatula does not get hot to the touch and it does not melt or burn: its heat resistant silicone withstands temperatures to 464\u00b0F (and you can deep freeze it to -40\u00b0F if you're in the mood).\nAN INCREDIBLY VERSATILE KITCHEN TOOL\nThe heavy-duty silicone rubber and strong but flexible blade make it easy to maneuver food, liquid, dry mixes, wet batters... you name it. Suitable for containers of all sizes: bowls, pots, hot pans, and plates.\nFOR HOME & PROFESSIONAL USE\nWe like to think of the Spatula as the ultimate kitchen tool, friendly and approachable enough for beginners at home, as well as super sanitary and multipurpose enough to serve as the go-to tool for experienced chefs at work. Lightweight but sturdy, non-slippery with a comfortable handle and grip, the Spatula was designed with both the occasional cook and seasoned chef in mind.\nCLEANS THOROUGHLY & EASILY\nThe Spatula\u2019s solid body construction doesn't trap food or oil particulates. It's quick and easy to clean by hand, so you can get right back to cooking. And of course, it's dishwasher safe. We put it through hundreds of cycles to make sure it didn't degrade or wear over time. And it performed just beautifully.\nECO-FRIENDLY & LONG-LASTING\nMade of eco-friendly, non-toxic material, the Spatula is designed to spend a lifetime in your kitchen.\nPATENT PENDING\nThe Spatula's novel design and construction make it a one-of-a-kind kitchen implement. So we can add another cool item to its highlight reel: Patent Pending.\nWITH YOUR SUPPORT\nWe've come a long way. The Spatula graduated from idea to prototype, and now it's ready for the big time. We're gearing up to launch a full-scale manufacturing run, and we can't do it without your help.\nSo where are we now? We've:\n- Finalized the Spatula's design, from handle to blade\n- Tested a range of material combinations\n- Built and tested five generations of silicone prototypes\n- Tested a production run of units in every color\nBy supporting this effort, you'll be the first to get your hands on a game-changing spatula unlike any other.\nWe're on track to deliver the first batch to our Kickstarter backers by early December 2012. We think they belong in every kitchen in the world, starting with yours.\nWHAT WILL YOURS LOOK LIKE?\nWe bet you have a drawer or bucket of subpar (or uninspiring) spatulas just like we did. If we may be so bold: throw them all away, and get the Ultimate Spatula. We wouldn't blame you if your next purchase was a trophy case.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe spent the better part of a year designing, developing, prototyping, testing, and beating up the GIR Spatula. If we were going to claim it as the \"ultimate,\" it HAD to stand up to the wear and tear of daily use\u2026 as well as some more extreme treatment.\n\nHere were some of the biggest challenges:\n\u2022 Refining the design of the polymer core so that we'd hit the optimal flex level\n\u2022 Selecting the appropriate food-grade silicone to use \n\u2022 Running test batches of silicone in each Pantone color until they looked right\n\u2022 Testing each color's durability with 7+ hours in simmering tomato sauce \n\u2022 Finding a manufacturer willing to work with us to produce smaller prototype orders so that we could get our models in the kitchen and test them (and test them, and test them\u2026) \n\u2022 Destroying almost every other spatula we owned to uncover any weaknesses we'd overlooked (RIP, stainless steel pan with melted plastic spatula all over it)\n\nWhat we came up with was unique enough to merit an application to the USPTO. So our intrepid little spatula is Patent Pending.\n\nWe're really proud of the amount of design, brainpower, and cooking that have gone into this project. We've put up some real investment dollars of our own to get it to this stage, and nothing would be a better reward than seeing you (and your friends) try it out for yourselves.

The one-cup-at-a-time handcrafted brewing process (without paper filters, electric mechanisms, risky balancing acts or fussy coils and plungers) results in a clean, yet full-bodied cup that has captured all the flavor of the beans and nothing else.\nThe Impress Coffee design is almost complete. We just need to make a few final revisions from our last prototype, invest in tooling and get moving on a pilot run. To thank you for joining in on the fun and being one of the first people in the world to own an Impress, we'll throw in some incentives, like Impress Coffee brewers, delicious coffee beans - and stickers!! \n3 Easy Pieces - No Mechanical Plungers & No Mess!\nThe Impress is a 2-piece nested press with a to-go cup lid that brews a full-flavored great cup of coffee in 3 minutes or less. After placing fresh grounds in the outer cup and pouring in hot water, you let it brew to your taste\u2014we suggest 3 minutes (our coffee experts have tested it and we agree). Then,  simply push the inner cup (reverse-flow filter inspired by the portafilter) all the way down, and clean full bodied coffee flows up into the vessel as the grounds get pushed down. That's it - you're done! Put a lid on it and go. The grounds stay at the bottom and out of your coffee until you are ready to pull the inner cup filter back out to clean it. The filter technology keeps the grounds from brewing any further after the coffee is pressed, so you only get the 3 minute brew you intended, even if the coffee stays put for a while longer!\nInsulated Outer Vessel, Nesting Inner Filter, To-Go Lid\nThe Specs\n\u2022 PIECES: double-walled outer cup, nesting inner cup with removable filter basket, to-go lid\n\u2022 SIZE: 6\" tall, 3.375\" diameter (approximate)\n\u2022 VOLUME: recommended 13 oz (max = 14 oz)\n\u2022 MATERIALS: 304 Stainless Steel, food-grade Silicone\n\u2022 MICRO-FILTER: 304 Stainless Steel, removable for washing\n\u2022 CARE: Top-rack dishwasher safe\nHot Forever\nThe outer cup is double-walled stainless steel for maximum heat retention while remaining cool to the touch. Early testers have consistently been impressed by how long their coffee stays hot \u2013 many of them pour their coffee into their favorite mugs just so they can cool it off.\nInsulated Outer Cup Keeps Coffee Hot\nMicro-Filter\nThe inner stainless steel cup is designed as a reverse flow filter that is pressed down after the appropriate brewing time and nests inside the outer cup. It is inspired by the portafilter, so it allows you some flexibility with the grind size.\nTiny Filter Holes Inspired by the Portafilter\nClean & Full Flavored Coffee\nThe Impress is uniquely designed so that brewing stops completely once the inner and outer cups are fully nested. The tiny filter holes work well with any grind size, and the filter traps the grounds below the finished coffee so it can\u2019t overbrew or let sediment in. No more overbrewed bitterness or muddy sediment of traditional press pots! With a stainless steel construction and filter, you can rest assured you will only be tasting the flavor of the coffee itself.\nTake It To-Go\nBecause of the double-walled outer cup and nested inner cup, the Impress is a triple-insulated to-go vessel full of delicious coffee. Arrive at work and coffee is still as hot, clean and full flavored as when you left home. You might even decide to share some of your coffee with a co-worker. The Impress makes 14oz of coffee, enough for 2 people to share.\nDrink Straight Out of the Vessel - Coffee Hot, Fingers Not.\nCleaning is Easy \nBecause the Impress is made of simple parts rather than intricate coils, filters, mechanisms and plungers, the grounds and oils can't get trapped in little crevices. Just knock out the grounds and give a quick rinse to be ready for your next delicious cup.\nThe Idea\nA few years ago, we found a bit of time to dive into the world of fine tea and explore the need for a good one-cup tea infuser. After a few years worth of tea times, we were able to bring The Teastick, a one-cup tea infuser, to market. We were simply floored, and humbled, at how well received the design was and how much people loved the simplicity, as well as the great cup of tea The Teastick infused. Since the day it was released, we have been asked if we could create a one-cup-at-a time coffee maker.\nOf course, coffee and tea are very different, so a coffee product had to be a brand new concept. It took us a few more years after the Teastick to find the time to dedicate to coffee, but we LOVE coffee, so it was a sacrifice worth making.\nBeing very regular coffee drinkers, we naturally had a number of different coffee brewers at the office, from electric drip brewers to pour-over options to press pots, and various inventer-versions of all of the above. Although many of them made a nice cup of coffee, there was still something missing. Press pots are known to overbrew the coffee and get muddy as it sits there. They are also difficult to clean when finished. Pour-overs have to work with a different mug and need a paper filter. And most of the inventer versions just felt, well, too inventery. AND, none of them kept the coffee insulated or worked as a brewer and to-go vessel in one. These points became our design criteria. With the prototype of Impress Coffee, we now know (if we didn't before) that there's nothing better than a clean, full-flavored cup of piping hot coffee that stays clean, full-flavored and piping hot all day long.\nLaunching with Kickstarter\nWe are community-minded and community-driven people. To find an online tool that cultivates and grows our community is exciting and intriguing to us. We see Kickstarter as a great way to help us launch the Impress. If we are fortunate enough to realize our goal, we will quickly move forward with a pilot run of the Impress Coffee brewer. If we are even more fortunate and surpass our goal, we will increase our production quantity, add new colorways and patterns to the outer cup and get started on a multi-cup version. Please help us make the world a better coffee place one Impress at a time. Thank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe major challenges of any pilot run of a product is finalizing the product and working with the manufacturer to make sure the production is as the design intended. Fortunately, we do this every day for our clients. Aly Khalifa, the owner of Gamil Design and designer of Impress Coffee, is not only a product designer, but an engineer as well, with 20+ years of experience working with factories on tooling, sampling and manufacturing. We have already determined an appropriate factory and have received prototypes and samples from them to prove that they are equipped to handle the job. We have also worked with client product launches as well as with our own product, The Teastick, to launch, process and fulfill orders at first adopter stage, regular every day times and media blitz bumps.

We are beyond appreciative!  Thank you so much!\n  Great Performances Depend On Great Drums\nSince 1989, we at the Sacramento Taiko Dan have dedicated ourselves to bringing amazing taiko performances to the Sacramento area.  We take great pride in our shows, combining awe-inspiring drumming with carefully crafted movement to bring our fans an experience they will remember for years to come.  The Sacramento Taiko Dan performance drums are an integral part of this experience, providing the foundation from which Sacramento Taiko Dan shows are built from.  This fall, we are trying to raise money to repair these drums.  Properly maintaining these drums will help us continue the work we do and enable many more years of great performances.\nThe Sacramento Taiko Dan Performance Drums Are In Need Of Essential Repairs\nOur goal with this fundraiser is to raise money for much needed repairs to our performance drums. Gradual wear from many years of use has begun to deteriorate the drum heads. Some of the skins have formed holes, and a few of our drums have been temporarily decommissioned until their skins can be properly replaced.\nThese drums are provided to us through the generous support of Asano Taiko in Japan. Based in Ishikawa Prefecture, Asano Taiko has been hand crafting beautiful, high quality drums since 1609, passing on their skill and knowledge from generation to generation. To honor Asano Taiko's support, properly maintaining these drums is our due responsibility.\nIf we meet our Kickstarter project goal this fall, you will help us pay to have staff from Asano Taiko replace the heads of these drums.  Sacramento Taiko Dan will host an Asano technician here in Sacramento while the repairs are made, (this option is less expensive than shipping our drums to their shop Japan).  Your contributions will also help us pay for the raw materials needed for the repairs, such as the tacks and skins prepared by the Asano Taiko shop.\nWho We Are And What We Do\nFor the past 23 years, Sacramento Taiko Dan has been an important non-profit arts and cultural resource for the Sacramento metropolitan community.  Our mission is to study, preserve and promote traditional and contemporary styles of taiko drumming.  We seek to provide the people in the Sacramento area with opportunities for greater cultural awareness and understanding of this traditional Japanese art form through performances, classes, and public education programs.\nPerformances are the mainstay of Sacramento Taiko Dan.  We average sixty to eighty performances each year at cultural events throughout the Sacramento and Bay areas, including the Sacramento Pacific Rim Festival, the California State Fair, local Obon festivals and bazaars, art expositions, and many others.  We produce two major showcase concerts each year in Sacramento, and take part in the Annual International Taiko Festival each fall with the San Francisco Taiko Dojo. Our performance drums are an essential part of every one of these shows, (this is why these repairs are so important to us). \nSacramento Taiko Dan also teaches classes year round for people interested in learning and playing taiko.  We provide youth and adult classes for all skill levels, from beginning to advanced.  Students learn traditional songs and rhythms, as well as basic music and performance skills, and develop self-discipline and confidence through learning to perform on stage.  \nWe also reach a few thousand local K-12 students each year through our Taiko In Schools outreach program.   With our Taiko In Schools program we bring highly interactive assembly programs to Sacramento area schools, where children learn about traditional Japanese culture and folk music.  This program is free to participating schools through our coordination with the California Arts Council\u2019s Exemplary Arts program.\nYour Help Today Is Important to Us\nLike many other arts programs around the country, Sacramento Taiko Dan has been adversely affected by the recent events of the economic downturn.  In the past, Sacramento Taiko Dan has received critical grant support from the Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission and the California Arts Council.   In the last few years however, these organizations have been hit hard by the recession, and as a result our grant funding has diminished significantly.  This year we received only 18 percent of the funding we were awarded just three years ago. \nDespite this setback, Sacramento Taiko Dan is committed to continuing its work in the local arts and cultural communities.  We invite you to join us as we continue forward in our mission.  By contributing to this Kickstarter Project today, not only will you help Sacramento Taiko Dan pay for essential repairs to its performance drums, you will be backing an invaluable arts and cultural program in the Sacramento area.

Imagine a world where you don\u2019t have to send your files through the network-of-tubes that is the internet \u2013 imagine that you could just \u201cgive\u201d the files to others, even if you just met them on the street. Imagine a world where you can do these things when there is no TV, no WiFi or no power outlet. We're here to solve these problems\nMeet airbridge\nThis is airbridge. It\u2019s a plug-n-play device that allows cordless iOS mirroring. In English, that means that when you snap the airbridge handheld piece to your iPhone or iPad, and plug the base station into a TV or projector \u2013 your screen will show exactly what\u2019s happening on your device. No app or setting configuration. No networks. No power needed. No wires keeping you tethered to a screen. That simple. And you don\u2019t even have to be giving a presentation to use airbridge \u2013 imagine killing pigs, chopping fruit, racing F1 cars, or creating content in your favorite app \u2013 all in Full HD, lossless sound, no lagging and on-the-go.\nWhat if there is no TV or projector, or somebody in your audience wants to view your presentation on their device without having to squint or crane their neck? There\u2019s an app for that. airbridge devices can stream your presentation over WiFi (AirBridge Pro will even make one when there\u2019s none) to other iOS devices, with or without a screen connected. App users can take a snapshot and write out some notes if they want to, and store those snapshots for later review; or even record the presentation to a video file. Pretty handy, huh?\nWant to share a worksheet or data file to go along with your presentation? That app we just talked about also does that, without even needing the device. The app will detect who is close by, and you can just drag a file to the face of the person you want to give it to. Or if you want to give it to multiple people, just drag it to the \u201cdropzone.\u201d It's as easy as that. You don\u2019t even have to be connected to the same network to share files.\nWant to dig deeper? Check out the following FAQs:\nWho is airbridge for?\nWhat are the in-depth features of airbridge?\nJust the Facts\nIf we get funded, and barring a zombie apocalypse, we\u2019ll be offering two editions of airbridge: airbridge Pro, and airbridge Lite for iOS devices. Both editions will be made for people who want things to simply work. airbridge Pro is the complete version of our innovation. It\u2019s made for everyone, including professional users and serious presenters. Airbridge Lite has one feature less (it does not group broadcast) than the Pro and is made for everyday casual users. Check out this FAQ for a full breakdown between Pro & Lite - airbridge Pro vs airbridge Lite\nThe Dream & The Passion\nOur dream: We want technology to play effortlessly well with other technology. We want it to act like a silent servant \u2013 reliable, durable, and making lives easier, and in a way that's not frustrating, unnecessarily difficult or complicated to use.\nOur passion: We want to help our local economy by creating jobs in the US. Airbridge will be produced in the US, and put food on families\u2019 tables. We want to be a pioneer in local economic growth by starting a movement that will help rejuvenate other nations by inspiring other innovators and entrepreneurs to step up and step out and make a like difference in their countries. If curious, see FAQ - How and where will airbridge be made?\nWe need you\n------------ Magnetized cover for seamless closing and easy carrying ------------\nIn order to see our dream and passion come into reality we need you. Though we have prototypes built, we want to make the final version sleeker looking and more compact. Additionally, in order to complete the development and make the project production ready, we still need to finish app development, work out fabrication, design circuit boards for the final product, perform final testing, etc. Sounds like a mouth full, but all these things can be done in a matter of 4 months or less. Yet, without financial backing, none of these things can happen.\nLike our dream and passion? Awesome. We love you. But we\u2019d love you more if you helped our dream and passion become a reality by sharing this kickstarter campaign with your social network and funding our project.

Ben, Devin, and Nand here.\nThank you so much for checking out our first Kickstarter project!  We believe the iClip\u2122 is an innovative product that will find a number of uses in your everyday life.  We truly appreciate your interest and support.\nWhile driving one day, the idea came to Nand for a simple, inexpensive product that would allow someone to clip their iPhone to the visor of their car. After doing some research, he came to find that no one had yet made a product that met his criteria.\nWhen Nand approached Ben and Devin with his vision, they immediately saw the potential for much more.\nThe team has been diligently working on the design and detailing of the iClip\u2122 for several months at this point, and has produced dozens of rapid prototypes to flesh out the iClip's\u2122 simple yet versatile design.  Two months ago a limited run of 1500 iClips\u2122 was produced from a temporary mold.\nSo far, everyone who has had the chance to test an iClip\u2122 has said the same thing: \"Where can I get one of these?\"\nEarly on in the process it became apparent that we were onto something with true potential, a product that they had never seen before.  Naturally we wanted to protect it, and have recently filed applications for both utility and design patents.\nAt this point, all of the front work is done, but the team can't finish the race without your help. With the funds raised through Kickstarter, we can purchase permanent molds to begin production and international distribution.\nWhat exactly does the iClip\u2122 do?\nWell, obviously, the iClip\u2122 clips.  \nThe integrated clip allows you to attach your iPhone to a variety of objects that are less than 5/8\" (16mm) thick.  The driving force behind its design was for use on you cars sun visor to make hands-free calls.\nAnd the iClip\u2122 stands.\nThe patent pending arm design allows the iClip\u2122 to hold your phone vertically and horizontally in a standing position without using any moving parts.\nThe iClip\u2122 also reclines. \nThe patent pending design allows the iClip\u2122 to hold your phone vertically and horizontally in a reclined position.\nThe iClip\u2122 even helps to keep your headphones tidy.\nThe clips arm features an integrated wire catch which allows your headphones to be neatly stowed.\nIn how many colors is the iClip\u2122 available?\nThe iClip\u2122 will be available in five colors during it's Kickstarter campaign. We think they're pretty sweet.\nWhere can the iClip\u2122 be used?\nIn our time with the iClip we've found a multitude of uses for it, here are some of our favorites.\nIn the car; for hands-free calling.\nOn a plane; the two horizontal reclining positions are perfect for watching downloaded content or reading your favorite E Book.\nAt home; the vertical standing position is great for facetime.\nIn the office; the vertical standing position keeps your phone in plain sight so you catch all of your important updates.\nAt home; as an alarm clock stand and charging station.\nThe iClip\u2122 is awesome for air travel.\nTray tables are less than 5/8\"!\nWhere will the iClip\u2122 be produced?\nFrom the very beginning of this project, manufacturing and packaging the iClip\u2122 in the USA has been a top priority.  The team is very proud to say that this product was designed and will be manufactured in Southern California.\nDoes the iClip\u2122 support any other devices?\nThis model will only hold an iPhone 4/4S.  However, after this project is successfully funded, we have plans to produce iClips\u2122 for many other devices.  We have already designed and prototyped  iPhone 3G/3GS and iPod Touch models of the iClip.  We have plans in the future to expand our line to support the iPhone 5, iPod Touch 2, the iPad, the Samsung Galaxy S2 and S3, and several HTC smartphones.\nHow will the iClip\u2122 ship?\nPlease be sure to add the shipping costs below when making your pledge.

The Porthole can be used to create striking cocktails, oils, teas, dressings, lemonade, coffee, or any other type of infusion.  \nNick's Lemonade\nThe Story:\nThe idea for the Porthole was born during a conversation with bar chefs preparing for the opening of the Aviary. We were discussing \"fast infusions\" -- cocktails evolving during the course of the time it takes to serve them -- and it occurred to me that what we're really looking for is a window into another world, space, and time. An image of the submarine porthole in Karel Zeman's 1958 movie 'The Fabulous World of Jules Verne' came to my mind and the design direction was set.\nSubmarine Porthole in The Fabulous World of Jules Verne.\nA small batch of the Porthole vessels was hand-crafted at Crucial Detail design studio. At the Aviary, it is used to create, display, and serve a variety of time-lapse infusions for seasonal cocktails. \nTequila Ginger Apricot cocktail at the Aviary.\nSince its debut a little over a year ago, the Porthole has gained significant attention.  Aviary cocktails displayed in the Porthole have been featured in dozens of magazines and blogs, including the cover of Food Arts magazine. \nMany Aviary guests have requested to purchase the vessel, including some who, when told they couldn't buy one, have taken it upon themselves to \u2018liberate\u2019 them from the lounge. That's when I realized that the design and functionality of the Porthole resonates strongly with people. The enthusiastic response to the piece has driven our decision to adopt the Porthole for production. \nAdaptation:\nThe technology used to produce the original small batch revolved around our in-house capabilities, utilizing methods suitable for small-scale production. The cost of each unit in the initial batch was over four hundred dollars. In order to make the Porthole more accessible, we have sought higher volume manufacturing technologies and have completely redesigned the components to achieve our target price of less than $100 dollars. The finished Porthole is dishwasher safe, durable, and easy to use. We have gone through a rigorous manufacturer selection process and identified a partner with the capacity and experience to produce the Porthole to our high standards.\nWe are now ready to pull the trigger. We've gone a long way towards our goal of bringing the project to life outside the Aviary but we're still facing a $ 28,500 investment for molds, first batch manufacturing, and associated expenses. By pre-ordering your Porthole, you help us get it off the ground.\nPlease check out the backer rewards on the right and help us make it possible to bring this artful service piece to your home.\nSpecs:\nThe Porthole holds 390ml (13 fl oz) of liquid.\nIt is made of precision ground and tempered Low Iron Glass, food grade Delrin,  food grade Silicone, and Stainless Steel.\nWhat is Included:\nOne Porthole.\nThree photo-etched stainless steel filter screens of varying densities.\nOne flexible silicone cap to seal the contents for longer term infusions.\nA set of thumbscrews that can be used as an alternative to the countersunk screws for faster assembly.\nPorthole use tips:\nThank you!\nMartin Kastner and the Crucial Detail team\nSpecial Thanks:  Lara Kastner, Grant Achatz, Nick Kokonas, Micah Melton, Christian Seel, and everyone at the Aviary in Chicago.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Happy Holidays!", "update_content": "Hi everyone.\nI hope you\u2019re enjoying your Portholes.

This film reveals Louganis\u2019 evolution from childhood diving prodigy to Olympic champion, and from pioneering openly gay athlete with HIV to a sometimes forgotten sports icon. His recent return to diving as a mentor to US Olympic divers competing at the 2012 London Games provides an exciting new chapter to his life-story.\nOur film is an independently-produced project.  We don\u2019t have the backing of a production company, a TV channel, or a big film studio.  We're counting on donations from people like YOU who are willing to help us bring this important story to the screen.\nWHY ARE WE MAKING THIS FILM\nGreg Louganis\u2019 story is so inspiring and his life so extraordinary -- we really wanted to watch a documentary about him to learn more. But that film didn't exist. We are in the process of changing that with BACK ON BOARD GREG LOUGANIS.  \nGreg's story is connected to so many important moments in American history including the Olympics, the AIDS epidemic, the gay rights movement, and even the recent housing crisis. His return to diving, after a long absence, gave us a natural way to tell his unique story and explore his enduring legacy. What is really great about Kickstarter is that we can share the experience of the making the film that tells this important story with others.\nOUR GOAL FOR THE FILM\nThis is a film with a message of hope and against-the-odds courage. It is a story that will inspire all those who see it.  In order to make this film a reality, we are looking to involve many of Greg\u2019s fans, documentary film aficionados, divers, athletes, and members of the LGBT community. \nWe are confident that Louganis\u2019 legacy will become even more powerful as this film travels throughout the world affecting the lives of the next generation. Louganis\u2019 life has touched, and been touched, by so many of today\u2019s important social issues; LGBT issues; HIV/AIDS; bullying; the housing crisis; dyslexia; adoption; depression; and domestic violence, to name a few. As filmmakers, we are committed to using this film to do educational outreach in connection with the distribution of the film.\nWHAT WILL THESE FUNDS BE USED FOR?\nThe funds will go directly toward the making of BACK ON BOARD GREG LOUGANIS. Expenses include: \nair travel for crew and production team to shoot with Greg at events in late summer and early fall of 2012\ncamera equipment rental\nsound package rental\nhiring a camera person\nhiring a location sound recordist\ntransferring rare archival clips of Greg from his personal home video library\narchival research\nhard drives to store and back-up our footage\npaying the editor to work her magic with our extraordinary footage\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\nFinishing this film is only going to be possible with your help.\nSupport our Kickstarter Campaign! \nSpread the word!

Our goal is to submit to film festivals and secure a wide release in 2013 - the 25th anniversary of the 1988 Seoul Olympics. We will explore all distribution options including theatrical and broadcast. We plan on taking the film to film festivals around the country and beyond.  If all of our filmmaker dreams came true we'd also have a theatrical release and a national TV broadcast!

A self that has been suppressed for many \u2014 and by many \u2014 for ages. Together, we can experience the beauty of  being who you truly are.\nAbout The Film\nGENDER BLENDER: A FILM ABOUT GENDER DIVERSITY follows the life of Lauren, a person who identifies as \u201cgender neutral,*\u201d as well as the life of others who exist outside the binary gender structure of female and male. Take an intimate journey through the physical, emotional, and spiritual changes Lauren and others undergoes just to be themselves.\nSee how simple things like choosing which public restroom (or changing room) to use is a challenge and part of every day life.\nThis positive and empowering film will highlight what individuals must go through to fulfill their ultimate life-long dream: to feel comfortable and natural in their own skin. Intimately travel with Lauren and others through their extraordinary journeys and witness the beautiful lives of gender diverse individuals.\nAfter hearing \u201cour truth\u201d, you will never look at gender the same way.\n\nPlease note that there are gender neutral pronouns, such as hir/ze. These will be addressed in the film. Lauren does not mind being referred to by male, female, or neutral pronouns, although other genderqueer people have different preferences\u2026\n*Please also note: There is little consensus over the difference between terms such as agender, genderless, non-gender, gender neutral and neutrois. These terms are often used interchangeably or defined differently by individual writers in ways that do not necessarily match the self definitions of others using those terms.\nAren't there only two genders?\nWe have been conditioned to only recognize two genders: male and female (this is known as the gender binary). There are, in fact, many more genders. There are a spectrum of various gender expressions that exist beyond the binary.\nEverything in life exists on a fluid continuum\u2026 and gender is no exception.\nWhat will the money be used for?\nYour funds will go towards getting the film made and seen, from pre-production all the way to submitting it to film festivals and marketing it around the world.\nWe have assembled a talented, accomplished team that we will be introducing to in the coming weeks. It is important that this documentary be shot with broadcast quality equipment and crewed by professional camera operators, sound mixers and editors, so that it is seen by as many people as possible, used in educational settings, and presented at film festivals. Every penny of your money goes directly to the funding and distribution of this film, including:\nShooting with a professional crew\nEditing and post-production, including professional sound mastering and mixing\nClosed Captioning\nLicensing the rights to news footage and music\nLegal and production insurance\nFilm festival and registration fees and filing\nMarketing and distribution\nHow Kickerstarter Works\nKickstarter is an \"all or nothing\" platform. Therefore, each donation plays an intricate role in the making of this entire project. If we do not raise the full amount, we receive no funding... and we will be unable to document this process that we believe so strongly in. If you wish to pay with PayPal (which Kickstarter does not currently accept), click here. PayPal payments will not be added to the Kickstarter total, but we will make sure that you still receive the rewards listed for your contribution level.)\nHow Will We Use Extra Money?\nIf we raise money above our goal, we will use it to help with extra marketing and distribution. Our goal is to get this seen by as many people as possible.\nFilm Festivals\nWe intend to enter this film into the major indie and LGBT film festivals. We believes its subject matter is unique, powerful, and extremely provocative. Very few (if any) movies have documented the journey of one \"female's\" transition to become third-gender. If you are able to help with the marketing and distribution of this film, please get in contact with us at hello@genderblendermovie.com.\nFinal Words From Lauren\nI wish to share my story, experiences and life with others like me and unlike me. I wish to educate others about a population of us who have been misunderstood and often times rejected... simply because we fail to see someone beyond the labels we place upon each other.\nIt is a privilege and an honor to be who I am, but most importantly to share this love with all.

We had a very successful period during pledge matching that helped bring us closer to our our $15,000 stretch goal.  With just minutes left to go in the campaign for Nekko, we would love to make it all the way to the stretch goal so that we can bring enhancements to the project like a live score and superior quality camera lenses.  Please continue to spread the word, make sure to enter our Facebook giveaway, and be sure to check out the latest update to hear a bit from all of us!\nWhat is Nekko? \nNekko is a short film being developed by a tight knit group of talented young filmmakers with experience ranging from feature films to music videos and commercials. The title of the film, \u201c\u6839\u3063\u3053\u201d, pronounced \u201cnekko\u201d, is a Japanese translation of the English word \u201croots\u201d that captures the important role that both physical and familial roots play in the film. The story, which has been in development for nearly a year, has blossomed into a passionate tale that appeals to all ages. \nStory:\n Set on a remote farm in Feudal Japan, nine-year-old Kue wishes to be free from the strict regimen of manual labor imposed by her widowed mother. When strange roots begin to overrun their crops, Kue\u2019s mother mysteriously disappears, leaving Kue to revel in her newfound freedom. She finds an unlikely friend in a magical origami hummingbird, but when the sinister roots steal her new companion, Kue decides to attempt a rescue. Descending into a subterranean world below the roots, Kue is confronted by a reality that is more complex than she ever could have imagined.\nProduction:\n The ambitious nature of this project is matched with a talented team of creatives and careful planning has gone into researching the best way to tell this story with as little artistic compromise as possible. Three sets (the house, garden, and underground lair) have been designed to be historically accurate and are currently being built. Principal photography will take place at the Marion Knott Studios using these sets. A separate mountainside location in Northern California has already been chosen as the virtual \u201csetting\u201d for the film. By building the sets to match the exact dimensions of the Northern California location, wrapping those sets in blue screen, and then shooting footage (or \u201c\u2019plates\u201d) of that mountainside after-the-fact, the visual effects artists will be able to composite the actors and sets shot in Orange County with the photography of the mountainside in Northern California. The mountainside footage will be digitally enhanced with Japanese details to fully realize this fantasy world. \n In addition to creating the setting, visual effects play a large role in other areas of the project. Kue\u2019s friend, the hummingbird, as well as many other origami creatures will be entirely computer generated and are currently in production. Bringing these original CG characters to life will require 3D modeling, animation, and compositing to be done in entirety from the ground up. These characters will seamlessly interact with live actors to produce a cohesive visual language. \nOne unique aspect of the film is an entirely animated segment which transitions Kue from the normal world to the dark and magical world of the paper roots. The animation and textures will be highly stylized to emphasize the rush of emotion that Kue feels in this sequence. We are excited to be using this mixed medium approach in order to create a more abstract and impressionistic sequence within the film. \n The production has already obtained a significant amount of resources. Access to a soundstage, camera package, lights, grip supplies, and electrical equipment, as well as insurance will be fully provided by Marion Knott Studios in September and October. On the digital side, visual effects artists are hard at work already designing characters on state-of-the-art computers utilizing the latest hardware and software. \nWhile much of the production is accounted for, there are significant costs that we do not currently have the funds to cover. First, we do not have the money to cast or compensate any of our actors. Second, without over 2000 square feet of chroma-key bluescreen, we will not be able to place our actors and sets into a virtual environment. Though the funds needed for blue screen and cast are not insignificant, the vast majority of our budgetary need is due to the high cost of materials needed for building our historically accurate and elaborate sets. Creating the physical sets for the farm, home, and underground root caves from scratch will be a massive undertaking, and though we have a full production design team consisting entirely of unpaid volunteers, the simple cost of materials is daunting. We want to create an immersive environment for the viewer, but doing so practically will not be feasible without help from the Kickstarter community.\nFrom The Director:\nWhen I was first shown an early draft of the script, what interested me the most about the story was the striking relationship between Kue and her mother. Hidden in the heart of this crazy-cool Japanese fantasy adventure was a simple story about the way our relationships change during childhood and the difficulties of growing up. After a great deal of research, we chose to set the film in Feudal Japan. I have had a fascination with Japanese culture since a young age. My parents worked for a Japanese company while I was growing up, and as a teenager I was lucky enough to do a Japanese exchange program which gave me the opportunity to live with a Japanese family on the island of Kagawa. Though my time there was brief, the value of respect and the aesthetics of simplicity left lasting impressions on me. \nOn their small farm in Feudal Japan, with no man and little money, Kue and her widowed mother are barely able to scrape by. In those times, a season's harvest could be the difference between life and death and because of this, Kue is forced to work constantly by her mother. Simultaneously, Kue\u2019s mother tries to teach Kue the skills and behaviors that will enable her to marry up out of her situation. Kue loathes what she feels is a double standard imposed by her mother and it is this resentment that burns at their relationship. It is very important to me that the film not only be universal in its message, but authentically Japanese in its content. For that reason, all of the dialogue in the film will be in Japanese and we are working with translators and advisors to ensure accuracy and artistry.\nAs both a director and cinematographer, my passion in film has always been for visual storytelling. Whether it's in the performance, framing, or editing, the magic of watching a story unfold without words or explanation is what for me separates cinema from all other media. For this reason, screenwriter Dag Shapshak and I chose to rarely utilize dialogue, focusing on progressing the story nonverbally. Dag and I have been constant collaborators for over six years now, and this project is the culmination of our work up until now. \nIt is impossible for me to discuss collaboration without introducing the incredibly talented team of young creative professionals who will be helming this project beside me. At the center of the project from its inception have been Hunter Schmidt and Phil McGuire, the visual effects supervisors. Both prodigies in the fields of 3D modeling, animation, and compositing, the two of them are responsible for bringing the magic in the story to life. Production designer Alex Lubow has an equally daunting task: building both the environments of Fuedal Japan and an entirely fantastical underground world through physical sets and props. Composer Trevor Doherty, who just recently finished his undergraduate degree in music composition from The Juliard School has collaborated with me on every film I\u2019ve ever directed. A music scholar as well as a composer, Trevor\u2019s knowledge of Japanese music combined with his talent for composing for film will be a fundamental asset to the emotional resonance of the film. As a cinematographer myself, I\u2019m looking forward to be teaming with Brian White, the most dedicated DP I've ever met.

Inordinate amounts of time and energy was contributed by countless people to ensure that what made it to your screen today (and soon to your mailbox) was something we, as well as all of you contributors, can be proud of. From months of writing, more months of pre-production, weeks of fundraising, more weeks of building, even more weeks of rehearsing, to a grueling 9 days of shooting, all before embarking on a post-production journey lasting more than eight months and consisting of an amalgam of editing, sound recording, and scoring, not to mention the seemingly limitless quantity of compositing, animation, and color correction; we have finally arrived here. Phew! Not just at the end of a run-on sentence, but at the moment where the life of the film really begins: with you. There were numerous challenges, set-backs, and even missteps along the way, and one of the largest has been the long overdue completion and delivery of this project. I apologize for the delay and all I can hope is that you feel your experience was worth the additional wait. As for perk delivery, DVDs, Blu-Rays, as well as all other physical perks will be mailed in the next week.

We hope you had a little bit of fun with our animation.\nAfter I purchased my iPad, I had to put up with missing cables, missing chargers, and having no access to my cool gadgets when I needed them the most. There was no way to organize everything in one place. I finally reached my tipping point (and my tolerance level is usually very high), so I determined that I must come up with a solution.\nFrom that point, I started prototyping an iPad pouch that could safely keep and organize all my iPad accessories and personal belongings while having the best protection for my iPad.\nIntroducing tabu tablet Pouch \n360 view of the Pouch\nMemory Foam for Maximum Protection\nSome may ask, what is it? It is high-density foam that has incredible shock absorbency. Invented by NASA to protect astronauts during rocket takeoff, now it is more widely used in beds and pillows. Are you wondering, \u201cMemory foam beds? The foam must be thick.\u201d The answer is, \u201cNope.\u201d Our pouch is light and thin, with the perfect amount of foam that protects your iPad against drops and bumps.\nhave fun with the unique memory foam texture\nWater Resistance \nThe body of the Pouch is made with polyurethane fiber which makes the Pouch durable and water resistant. It keeps the gadgets safe from rain drops and splashes. Great for beach side visits.\nTranslucent Zipper Pocket \nIt secures all your accessories in the front of the Pouch. No more digging inside your bag and searching for your small items (a hair clip, USB flash drive, or anything small). You can see them at a glance.\nMagnetic Closure for Convenience and protection\nSix industrial grade magnets secure your iPad safely inside the Pouch. The magnets are covered with memory foam, and microfiber lining protects your iPad from zipper scratches when you insert or remove the iPad from the Pouch.\nAuto screen cleaning \nYour iPad screen will be cleaned automatically by the microfiber lining when your iPad goes in and out of the Pouch. No more dirty finger prints on your screen!\nSlim design\nBack Cases and Smart Cover compatible \nWe designed the Pouch so that it will fit even if you have a back case and Smart Cover on your iPad\nWorks with Smart Cover and Back cases\nThis very simple solution saves you from a lot of hassels! Our goal is to improve everyone\u2019s experience with their iPad and accessories without sacrificing desk space and wasting precious time.\nColors\nYou can choose from two colors: blue or grey. We would love to come up with more colors for the Pouch and that\u2019s why we need your help, Kickstarters.\nFundings\nFunding Your funding is very important for us to pay for the initial manufacturing and mass manufacturing cost. We have received quotations from several different factories. It takes $5000 to order material and manufacture the Pouch at a reasonable price. In addition, we also want to expand our color collection, so all of you can be happy with a wide range of colors in the future. \nWhy can\u2019t you just buy a small pouch for your accessories? \nWhy waste money buying two carriers when you can pay a good price for just one? Also, our tabu tablet Pouch is a lot more convenient and safe to use with the extra memory foam protection. It not only gives mobility to your iPad, but it also keeps your crazy fun accessories together!\nThank You for Supporting Us! \nThank you very much for your time and money, Backers! We will start manufacturing once the project is funded.
