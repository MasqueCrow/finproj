[{"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What is Dungeon Alchemist?\nDungeon Alchemist is an AI-powered mapmaking tool for both players and dungeon masters. Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

No 3D modeling experience required!\nCustomizable Rule System (~$225k USD / 1,911,404nok)\nWe will add a customizable engine which will arm players and GMs alike with all the information they need during play.

Our aim is to get rid of everything that gets between you and your stories.

Thanks to their support and feedback we know what still needs building, and what needs polishing. The community has really shown us how far they want us to take this.\nYour support will get us to Early Access. There is a solid 8 months of fulltime work to do and this Kickstarter will make that happen.\nFrom there we will take our solid base and expand it even further, once again grounding our moves in the needs of the Early Access community in the same way we have been with our Alpha community (HUGE LOVE TO THE TALESPIRE DISCORD GANG, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE :D).\nMost importantly we believe that, for this game to be made without compromise, it needs to be independent of publishers. We have looked around and whilst this idea seems to be obvious and has clearly been discussed for decades it has never been made in quite this way. We feel that is almost certainly due to how risky it would be to do it 'right'.\nDespite bringing a pile of experience to the table, we are still a new company and we knew it wasn't right for us to ask for your money until we knew exactly what this needed to be, and could prove we could do it.\nWe have a working alpha, active userbase, over 20 updates shipped and we publish multiple developer logs per week. Even before the alpha we were experimenting with a pile of different prototypes so we are confident with what we need to achieve.\nIn short we have been doing this for some time now and we know we can keep it up.\nThe primary goal of the Kickstarter is to fund TaleSpire's development for 8 months. This includes full time wages for the core developers, server costs, creative tools and legal services required to bring this game to Early Access.\nThe timeline is aggressive. 6 months to the Beta and then 2 months to polish for Early Access.\nWe will start the timer from the end of the Kickstarter campaign. As the two full-time developers live in Norway we will have to comply with laws regarding the mandated amounts of leave companies must provide, so that will be factored into the delivery dates.\nThe goal is that the Beta will ship in February and the Early Access in April.\nEarly Access will fund and guide the next stage of TaleSpire's life. We will keep talking to you about how you play and where the game needs to expand to serve your stories.\nWith the start of the Early Access we will also begin releasing asset packs at fixed, regular intervals and ALL of those will be free. Post-Early Access the packs are how we plan to fund our future.\nIf we are so blessed as to reach the stretch goals, we will begin developing them once we reach Early Access.\n\nTaleSpire has a lot within its walls; let's go on a stroll through the main features.\nBuilding and play are one\nTaleSpire is a place where building and play happen throughout the whole play session. Want to destroy a wall to reveal a secret passage? Do it! Want to rain down piles of gold from the heavens? Sure! At any moment the GM (or GMs) can jump into building mode and change anything without interrupting anything else.\nYou will be able to build anything from tiny one shots to sprawling campaigns. Each board can be up to 30km across and 10km tall. We will be looking to make them even bigger post-Early Access.\nA campaign can have as many boards as you can build, and you can copy entire boards \u2014 which makes it easy to create alternate versions in various states of disarray if that is what your story calls for.\nBuild together\nBuilding doesn't have to be a solo activity. Grant other people GM rights to your campaign and build your world together.\n\nGorgeous sculpted scenery and miniatures\nTaleSpire gives you assets that look so good you'll want to claw them out of your monitor. \nRoll Call! Click for higher res version\n\nControl the atmosphere\nA necromancer is performing a poignant resurrection that deserves something special! With a click you can dim the lights, bring in the music and captivate your players. \nAs the GM you can store lighting, weather and music into 'environment pillars'. These let you swiftly change the mood of a moment.\nRain, snow, night and day are coming and you can wield them.  \nCustomizable dice with HEFT\nIn game dice that not only look great but feel great to roll. \n\n\nFrom play testing we found out players would do it so much that we needed a way for the GM to grab control at important moments in the story. Speaking of which\u2026 \n\n Cinematic Mode\nA foolish dwarf steps on a pressure plate \u2014 suddenly the camera snaps across the room and a necromancer strides into view.\nAs the GM you are armed with Cinematic Mode. Set up camera angles and take direct control of what every player is seeing. In that moment they cannot move their pieces and you are free to narrate the perils they have stumbled into.\nSetting up shots\n\nTools! Rulers, indicators, compass, etc\nPoint to point distance? Diagonal movement? Area of effect? No need to estimate when you can use our built in tools to tell you exactly what's what.\nGMs can do this privately or share it with the group so all are in on the plot. \nAn example size indicator used when placing tiles\n\nGM Requests\nCertain player actions request approval from the GM. This means events can\u2019t be unveiled accidentally before they make sense in the story. \nTurn based mode\nChoose the line-up, orchestrate the rounds! Keeping track is easy when you can switch to turn based mode at any time. When in this mode only the player whose turn it is can command their creatures. \nPLAY\n\n\nName and tint your creatures before bringing them into the game\nNo need to wait until reaching the board to set up your hero. Before jumping in, prep as many creatures as you like and assign them their campaigns. \n\nChanging your mini's base\nVariety == spicy life. \nWe know it's a subtle thing but dang it some days maybe your base should match your armor. \n\nFog of war\nThis powerful system keeps the path ahead obscured in a shroud until it is time to reveal it. \nPLAY\n\nNote: This video shows one of our fog of war prototypes. We are introducing a visual representation for the fog in the Early Access.\n\nScaling creatures\nNeed a bigger troll? Shrunk by a spell? The scale feature is at hand to help you. \nEmotes & spells\nSometimes waggling a piece just doesn\u2019t cut it: pick from a selection of actions and unleash sounds, animations & visual effects to really let that fireball spell send its message. \nFilter your session history\nDid Jeff move 10 feet or 15? Settle it with the session history!\nUse filters to see only what is relevant in the moment. \nGrant access with the smack of a button\nInvite codes let you easily grant people access to your campaign and are copied straight to the clipboard to they are ready to be thrown into your chat client of choice. \nShare slabs of tiles effortlessly\nSharing a slab is trivial in TaleSpire. Copied tiles are immediately available to paste as text outside of TaleSpire making it trivial to share useful chunks. Naturally this works in reverse, copy the text and paste in TaleSpire to summon the slab to your hand. \nMusic and sound effects\nTaleSpire will come loaded with mountains of sound effects, ambience, and a full soundtrack. From dripping caves to rowdy taverns, we have you covered.\nHere is an early sample from the soundtrack:\nModding! Add your own tiles, minis and more\nThe mods are fun and numerous: take this!\nTaleWeaver is the tool we use to bring content into the game. Import your models and apply the magic that lets them work in TaleSpire. \nWith the Early Access we will also ship the base of the scripting layer. To begin with, this will be focused on controlling tiles and props, but the system is going to grow in a big way as we continue to expand the game.\nYou and your players will be able to get mods from our official site (not yet live), but also from collections created and maintained by other modders. This means the power stays with the community.\nBookmarks\nBookmark Panel Prototype\nA light to guide you when all other minds go blank\n...by which we mean, save any point of the board as a bookmark and jump there with a click of the mouse\nFoam scenery blocks\nPlacing tiny tiles to build a hill is tedious; use the foam blocks to lay out large tracts of land.\nTunnel through them to make a perfect lairs for creatures favoring the dark.\nPowerful prop system\nYou can scatter not just tiles but props across the land. Props can be attached to tiles in myriad ways, and they respond sensibly when a player pushes into them. Make your rich settings without worrying about any details blocking play.\nAsset & feature suggestion sites\nWe will have official places to submit ideas for assets and features. These will be used to help guide the future of the game. We also promise not to destroy the focus by trying to include everything.\nGM Overlay: Notes, Hidden tokens/chests containing stuff useful for running a campaign\nKeep track without being swamped. As a GM you have an overlay mode where you can leave yourself notes. Place tiles, minis and prepare scenarios, all out of sight of the players.\nAnd plenty more!\n\u266b The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began \u266b\nCheck out our roadmap to see a high level overview of our plans.\n\n\n\n Concept Art\nThe following is the concept sketches for the Kickstarter Exclusive Minis and an in-game first pass at the dice.\nSee these updates for more info:\nDice: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bouncyrock/talespire/posts/2587520 \nMinis:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bouncyrock/talespire/posts/2586452 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe big one is of course time-frame. We have done a lot of experimentation to know what we need but it remains a lot of work in a fairly short period of time. We will need to leave polish and feel of some systems to late in the cycle. We can't reduce the amount of work to do so instead we will simply be as open as we can as to how things are progressing so that nothing comes as a surprise.\n\nThe other is subtler. Making things simple is complicated. There are many 'obvious' ways to do things which make for a worse or inconsistent experience. We need to keep focused and stay true to the *feel* that we are going for even if that means not supporting every imaginable feature, and especially if they seem trivial.

It's been completely rebuilt from the ground up in Unity. Read on to find out what this all means and why we are excited for this project.\nFantasy Grounds is a popular system for playing a host of different roleplaying games online.  It is used by more than 130,000 gamers worldwide to connect and play popular games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, and more.  This type of program is commonly referred to as a virtual tabletop, or VTT, due to their ability to emulate various part of an RPG session in a digital form.\nWhat makes Fantasy Grounds different than competitors is how we expose character sheets and automate large portions of gameplay specifically for each system we support.  This is done through rulesets.  Your experience playing Deadlands Reloaded will differ from D&D and will be unique to that environment, contain custom graphics, character sheets, and automation specific to that game system.  \nOne feature shared across most game systems is maps.  Some may use hexes while others use square grids and some may not use grids at all.  Facing is important in some and less so in others.  While FG has featured maps for many years, they have been primarily focused as reproductions of maps in existing adventure modules from our many licensed publishers. We believe that we can enhance these to provide dynamic line of sight, fog of war, and even map building support with painting and tiles.\nWhat you get for backing this project will be a license for Fantasy Grounds Unity (or FGU). This new game engine has all the great features of current version of Fantasy Grounds (soon to be called Fantasy Grounds Classic) along with new enhanced features. \nOriginal Features Supported:\nMultiplayer support for playing tabletop games of Dungeons & Dragons (2E, 3.5E, 4E and 5E), Pathfinder RPG 1, Pathfinder RPG 2, Starfinder.\nBuilt-in content for D&D 3.5E, 5E and Pathfinder 1\nOfficially licensed add-on content available for D&D, D&D Classics (2E), Pathfinder, Starfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, Basic Roleplaying, Castles & Crusades, Mutants & Masterminds, 13th Age, W.O.I.N., Traveller, and Rolemaster Classic\nGeneric system support through our CoreRPG ruleset\nBrilliant Campaign Management\nIntegrated character sheets with lots of automation built in for playing and leveling (depending on ruleset and content owned)\nCombat Tracking\n3D dice\nFantasy Grounds Unity Enhanced Features Include:\n64-bit support to allow for more content (quality and quantity)\nNative support for Mac, Linux and Windows PC\nNetwork lobby for easy hosting and joining of games (no port forwarding required)\nTile based map building\nEnhanced Drawing Tools\nAdditional Dice Macros support\nA new FGU only skin\nDynamic Line of Sight with enhanced toggle blockers\nPaint with images, such as walls\nAnimated image effects\nBackward compatibility with all existing campaigns and DLC from FGC\nIn addition to these features, we are now poised to add even greater functionality going forward. We have lots of ideas for new features and this rebuilt engine will make it easier for us reach those goals and deliver consistent updates for free. \nTile based Map Building\nDynamic Line of Sight (LOS) and Fog of War (FOW)\nLine of Sight - Doors and Terrain\nMap Fx Layers\n New Grid Options\nAdvanced Dice Expression Support\nWe have already devoted over 4 years and 10,000 developer hours to this project. Any funds raised will help us push it over the edge and begin work on new features and functionality. If the project does exceptionally well, this may even allow us to add even more resources to the team.\nWe have over 1200 existing DLC and add-ons. Our goal is to prioritize these by popularity and work on enhancing as many of these as we can. Without enhancements, they will continue to function as they always have in Fantasy Grounds Classic. You will be able to add dynamic line of sight to maps and begin using the new features straight away. As we work through this large back catalog of DLC, we will do all the enhancement and upgrade work for you so you can just load it up and begin using the advanced features without having to define any Line of Sight blockers yourself. \nLink: www.fantasygrounds.com\nGreat! We anticipate that a large number of our backers will already be fans and users of our software. For you, we have added discounted Upgrade tiers available to get you up and running on the new engine as soon as possible. A lot of the time spent building the new engine was devoted towards making sure that everything you've already bought or created will continue to work in FGU. The only difference is that now you will be able to further enhance them.\nOver time, we will begin going through older products and enhancing them for you. Just look for the Update Available button to light up and stay tuned to our newsletter for regular updates on which products have been newly Enhanced. \nWhich Upgrade option do I choose?\nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license in 2018 or 2019, then pick the Rookie Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate. \nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license before 2018, then choose the Veteran Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate.\nIf you are on a subscription, then you will be able to subscribe to the new version once it is released on the store. If you want Beta or Alpha access, then you would need to get a Newcomer tier option on the Kickstarter. \nHow do I upgrade multiple license keys?\nIf your account has multiple license keys, it is possible that some of them are newer and some are older. Pick the tier that best fits your main license key that you personally use and then increase your pledge level for each additional license you have based on the age of that license.  Our survey system and fulfillment will allow some corrections there later on and we can always help on a case-by-case basis through our support email at the time of fulfillment.\nDo I need to pay a subscription going forward?\nOur newcomer tiers are 1-time purchase licenses for Fantasy Grounds Unity. No further subscription is required. If you had a subscription to Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may want to maintain that as long as you want to continue using that version. \nYes, Fantasy Grounds Classic will remain a viable product for many years to come. While the data is backward compatible, we chose to separate the data paths for FGU and FG Classic so that changes to one won't be reflected in the other. You can copy campaigns over to FGU to try things out there and maintain your original copy back on Fantasy Grounds Classic. \nOver time, we expect most users will migrate fully to FGU.\nDo I get access to Fantasy Grounds Classic if I buy Fantasy Grounds Unity?\nNo. If you already have a license or subscription, then you can continue to use that. The licenses will be different even though they share the same add-ons. \nStandard licenses can host or play in a game with other licensed users. An Ultimate license allows the GM to host a game for any number of players and those players can use a free Demo license of Fantasy Grounds. Initial copies will go out to backers only, but we will try to  send out the demo license links to backers at some point prior to launch so those can be shared with players for your game.\nWe have over 1200 DLC items available -- an entire gaming bookstore worth of games. It's too much to feature in the Kickstarter, but we have a select list of bundles below that you can choose from when we send out the backer surveys. Just increase your pledge amount for the add-ons you want from the list below. \nAlso -- Anything you already own on your account at fantasygrounds.com will continue to work with FGU, so you won't have to re-buy any of those. In fact, you can go shopping at fantasygrounds.com if you see anything on sale there during or after the Kickstarter and those items will unlock automatically for your account once you gain access to FGU during the Alpha or Beta.\nWhat if I bought my add-ons from Steam?\nYou will be able to use those in both versions: Fantasy Grounds Classic and Fantasy Grounds Unity. Our system will know what purchases you have made from either location. \n*Note: We have some unknowns about how the Steam Store will reflect purchases across the two versions of Fantasy Grounds. If you bought bundle items on Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may need to buy new additions to the bundle there instead of on the new FGU store page on Steam.  \n\nNew portraits commissioned from the Ultimate Gamemaster level by amazing avatar artist, Mates Laurentiu! \nArtist Bio: Born in Dracula's lands, Mates Laurentiu is a Romanian freelance artist with a love for fantasy, horror and science fiction.

We have booted tracks, webbed tracks and bear track currently but we would look to expand this out fully and maybe make a bloody tracks version as well.   For a follow-up we could even take suggestions or votes on what other sort of tracks you would like to see. Dragons? Great Purple Worms? Ooze slime trails? \n #7 Darkwoulfe Tokens Sample Pack\nNew tokens from amazing artist, Riley Owens.\n\nArtist Bio: Riley Owens or Darkwoulfe in the realms of fantasy, has been interested in creating top down tokens since seeing the photo-realistic maps and tokens created by users of early dungeon mapping software. I'd been searching for as realistic as possible, top down tokens for my own RPG gaming. One of my players suggested that I stop searching and make my own and it's been quite a roller coaster ride ever since. It is my hope that you find something to create awe and immersion for your gaming table in my offerings. I'm always trying to make an indelible mark on my player\u2019s imagination and create something that brings them back for more!! I also create Character Packs to help players better visualize the character that they have created to play. Happy gaming and see you in the dungeon!! \n#8 Free Modules!\nAn adventure from Frog God Games for 5E and a set of adventures from AAW Games for 5E, Pathfinder and Savage Worlds.

Instead, we gave general responses that we would be looking into that and other features once we completed the initial port to Unity.\nI am now happy to announce that we have released this feature into our TEST channel for people to play around with and experiment.

The GM can then approve or reject movement on a per token basis. Once enabled on a map, any attempted move by players will need to be confirmed by the GM.

Peel back paper from Wham Bam Magnetic Base adhesive, line up with one edge of your bed, check position, then peel back rest of paper while rubbing down.\n4.  Clean your Wham Bam Flexi Plate with alcohol and apply your Wham Bam PEX Build surface just as you applied the Magnetic base.  Remove the protective film from the PEX. Pro tip: For extra grip scuff your PEX surface with 000 steel wool. \n5.  Slap your Flexi Plate on the Magnetic Base and you are good to go\nsee full detailed instructions on installation and preparation below:\nWham Bam was created when Peter Solomon, a long time inventor, award-winning designer, maker and 3D printing addict realized that many of his personal modifications to his printers would be very useful to all 3D printers. \nPeter has been contributing to the community for years by posting his models to thingiverse,  his how-to videos on youtube, and his advice to many forums.   He became obsessed with resolving first layer adhesion as this is one of the issues that affects every 3d printer, and then needed to find a way to get prints off the bed easier.   When he made his first prototype and shared on social media nearly everyone wanted one,  and BAM - \nWham Bam was born.\nWham Bam will be making many other products, and always following the same mission:  Making 3D printing Easy, Productive and Fun!\nWham Bam has been through a year of product development, testing, refinement, material engineering, further testing and design. \nFor the last month we have been going through a Beta Test Round with select testers on various machines.  Each beta tester prints for different reasons and with a range of materials.  \nWe have taken their comments and suggestions and improved our product,  we have established production and supply and already created our test samples and prototypes with the same factories who will execute our production orders.\nWe are ready to go! In order to be able to offer competitive pricing on these top of the line materials we need to purchase in mass, we also need to create some simple tooling to cut materials to size and shape and to create our new robust packaging. With the Kickstarter funding we can get this into production in as little as 3 weeks from the goal met date!\nsee what our Beta testers are saying about our system!\nRob R.  \"I honestly stopped using my printer for a while because my prints stuck so well that I'd ruin them or break the glass trying to get them off. The Wham Bam System has got me heavily into 3D printing again. Thank you guys!\"\nRobert B. \"Great product! Very impressed. keep up the great work\"\nBryan H.  \"All component materials are high quality and manufactured very well!!!  Installation is easy and straight forward. Magnetic binding, spring steel performance and initial pex performance are all top notch. You have the product, service, and customer service at the highest level, praise I never an able to give.\"\nJames P.   \"The fact that the magnets are able to withstand higher temperatures puts this system in a class of it\u2019s own. Capable of using a wide range of materials that other companies cannot claim without damaging their magnetic sheet permanently.\"\nCarlos P \"I\u2019m liking how the prints look. Super smooth on the bottom. And I love that it just pops off. No more spatula. My installation experience went pretty smooth\"\nBryan V. \"Man, thats amazing, you saw that was super super easy to remove. And check out that super smooth finish on that first layer, so nice. The prints still stick when they're supposed to and they are super easy to pop off when done. \"\nJohn R.  \"Beta Test for Wham Bam. Great product! Want more plates in the future, and much more reasonably priced than you-know-who. \"\nPatrick L.  \"Wanted to share my experience so far. This is actually my first print with the new bed and it worked great! The bottom layer is the smoothest and shiniest I've ever had and everything stuck perfectly. Even the base of the supports was glass smooth. So far, this is exceeding my expectations\"\n We need your help and support. \nWe are almost there, we cant wait to get this flexible build kit on every machine possible and help the 3D community out by making their lives simpler and more productive.  \nCheck out our Stretch Goals!\nIf we surpass $50k of sales we will throw in a free extra PC build plate to every kit ordered.\nAnd if we surpass $100k we will throw in an extra PEX build surface to every kit ordered.\nSo if you want these freebies, please spread the word, get your friends to see our campaign and help us to get the message out. \n Please make your pledge, if you have one machine - order early and be one of the first to get one.

The more experience and power the Survivors earn, the more Xenos invade the facility!\nThis sci-fi interpretation of Zombicide is as sleek as ever, playing fast and furious. The rules have been optimized to reduce setup time and make the game flow quickly, focusing the action on the struggle between the Survivors and the Xenos.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Dark Side / Promo Xenos / Plague Survivor Pack / Orphans Survivor Pack / Kabuki Survivor Pack / Tiles Set / Plastic Token Pack / 3D Plastic Doors / Deck Holders Set / Counter Base Set.\nThe game's character artwork was created by renowned artist Adrian Smith, and brought to life as miniatures by the talented team at BigChild Creatives.\nThe Survivors in the PK-L7 outpost came from all walks of life to aid in the Xenium mining operations, and are divided into two types: Civilians are incredibly resourceful, being able to find useful gear in any room of the facility, on the downside they tend to not be very well protected. Soldiers, on the other hand, usually wear heavy combat armor which give them an edge against the invaders. However, their military training means they'll only find gear in specific Security rooms.\nExplore the Survivors more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres. NOTE THAT MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED. CLICK THE IMAGE TO SEE A HIGH RES ALBUM\nWith some luck, Survivors may be able to use some advanced machines to aid their struggle. If you can find the right remote (or are a tech wiz) you'll be able to control the Falchion Sentry Gun to mow down Xenos, or maneuver the Peacekeeper Bot in coordinated attacks.\nIf they manage to last long enough, Survivors can become formidable fighting machines. The more Xenos they kill, the more experience they get, allowing them to unlock new skills as the game progresses. The equipment they find is arranged in their plastic dashboard, with slots for Hand weapons, armor and other gear that can be carried on the body, and a Backpack to store those things you may not need right now.\nSurvivor plastic dashboard.\nPrototype weapons are amazing silent killing machines, but they require an attached Energy Cell to use.\nSurvivors will need all the help they can get to face the Xeno invasion. These mindless creatures come in several different types. Workers are numerous, but manageable. Hunters are deadly fast predators you need to be always on the lookout for. Tanks can take a beating, and dole out an even worse beating. Keep your distance!\nThe different types of Xenos.\nXeno Worker figures 3D renders.\nXeno Hunter and Tank figures 3D renders.\nCertainly the worst of the Xenos is the hulking Spoiler Abomination! This nightmare can only be put down by concentrating your fire, or literally disintegrating it with Hellfire! Don't be fooled by its size, this thing can run you down when you least expect it. While its spawn cards give it extra activations, it will also leap forward if you ever run out of miniatures. The other Xenos may be threatening, but, make no mistake, this is the last thing you'll see before you die.\nSpoiler Abomination figure 3D render.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the Spoiler Abomination also fills any room it moves into with a terrible alien substance we call Mold. This thing eats through doors and walls, completely destroying the room and changing the layout of the map. This Mold may spawn even more Xenos, but worse yet, if it spreads too far, the base will be irrevocably lost (and so will you). Burn it down before it's too late.\nExplore the Xenos more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nUse a flamethrower to burn that Mold to a crisp before it can consume the base!\nThe base at PK-L7 is all you have. Walking out into the planet's surface may be necessary at times, but it's a dangerous endeavor. You'll need to get an Oxygen tank in the Supply room if you want to walk out the airlock. And you better arm yourself with a melee or energy weapon, since the outside atmosphere keeps bullet weapons or flamethrowers from working.\nThe tiles feature several different Zone types, like Exterior, Oxygen Supply Room, Airlock, Security, and Corridor.\nZombicide: Invader comes with:\n9 Double-sided Game Tiles \n72 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n6 Dice \n125 Mini Cards \n15 Mold Cards \n50 Tokens \n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nThe journey into the unknown doesn't end here!\nThe Zombicide: Black Ops expansion raises the intensity to new heights while bringing new challenges for an elite group of Survivors! The Soldiers of Black Squad can be added to your roster, allowing you to play the game with up to 12 players at the same time!\nThese battle-hardened soldiers have been called in to deal with the situation on PK-L7, and find a base already being consumed by the Mold. The 10 new Missions utilize 3 new tiles containing zones already filled with Mold. That means extra Xeno spawning, and a more imminent threat of the base being lost for good. These Mold zones also feature glowing pods of an altered form of Xenium, which may be fired at causing a Hellfire explosion! As dangerous as that sounds, it may be used for our advantage, if we're careful.\nThe Black Ops tiles feature explosive Xenium Pod Zones.\nThis dilapidated base is also under threat of a new type of Abomination we call the Juggernaut. This thing is as ugly as it is unstoppable. Upgrading your weapon won't work, concentrating your fire won't work. I guess we'll just need to lure it into one of those sensitive Pod zones.\nBlack Squad brings some of its own elite equipment to the mission, including the hard-hitting XN35 \"Crawley\" Bot, the devastating Meteor Sentry Gun (a rail gun that can hit multiple zones), and an arsenal of powerful Starting Equipment and other gear.\nExtra arsenal for the Black Ops.\nExplore Black Ops more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nZombicide: Black Ops comes with:\n3 Double-sided Game Tiles \n9 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n29 Mini Cards\n10 Mold Cards\n39 Tokens\n1 Rulebook \nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China and Thailand, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n\u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n\u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n\u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 30th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is May 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde, with wave 2 shipping soon.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, and HATE, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Zombicide: Invader.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Or perhaps you tried anyway but in the end you ran away screaming in frustration because you found it too difficult and/or time-consuming?\nHave you tried existing mapping software and been frustrated with the learning curve, the cost, the interface, and/or been disappointed by the results?\nIf the answer to any or all of those questions is \u201cyes\u201d, then my brand new MapForge application is probably just what you\u2019ve been searching for (and possibly waiting for for years).\nWhat will make MapForge special?\nEasy to use\nThe goal is to make MapForge really easy to use, and for a user to be able to start making maps on Day 1 without even bothering to read the User Manual. And by extension, to never feel like you need to re-learn the software even if it\u2019s been many months since you last used it.\nSupport for Add-Ons (both free and commercial)\nMake your maps using top-notch professional Add-On content, or using your own content, or a mix of both.\nLow-cost/Inexpensive\nI\u2019m making the software itself very affordable, so that you\u2019ll have plenty of money left over to purchase a bunch of Add-Ons.\nVersatile\nAlthough it\u2019s primarily intended for creating battlemaps (in any genre), the program will provide enough flexibility that, given the right content, you\u2019ll also be able to create other types of maps, ranging from area maps to deep space. You can use the program to make high-resolution maps for printing, or lower- resolution maps for use in your favorite virtual tabletop software.\nGorgeous and user-friendly interface\nThe user interface for MapForge is thematically generic, but very attractive and modern. And it should appeal to you whether you\u2019re the type who prefers to click on buttons and choose menu commands to get things done, or of you\u2019re the power-user type who likes to use hotkeys to get things done that much quicker.\nCross-platform\nWhether you\u2019re a Windows user or a Mac user, MapForge has you covered. And if you have a MapForge license and someday decide to switch platforms, you can just request a new license code for the new operating system, free of charge.\nHigh-quality results\nThe output is crisp, detailed, and (optionally) high-resolution.\nEmpowering, but with a shallow learning curve\nMapForge will help you unleash your creativity. It\u2019s not intended just for the artistically or technically gifted. It will allow anyone, regardless of their art skills or technical skills (or lack thereof), to create gorgeous, detailed battlemaps. With MapForge, you\u2019ll be able to produce Photoshop-like effects such as bevels, drop-shadows, strokes, glows, blurs, and color adjustments without the steep learning curve that producing such effects normally requires.\nOffers a free level of use\nYou\u2019ll be able to use MapForge to make nice maps even if you haven\u2019t purchased a license. Even use free and commercial Add-Ons without a license (though commercial Add-Ons will require registration). I\u2019m confident that MapForge will earn a place in your mapping toolbox, and I\u2019m optimistic that you\u2019ll find it so useful that you will get a license eventually, in order to unlock the software\u2019s full potential.\nQuicker Map Creation\nWith MapForge, I want to help GMs reduce their session prep time, not increase it. You shouldn\u2019t have to spend several hours or even days creating a decent map for your game session. Using keyword searches and tags, you\u2019ll find that elusive content you\u2019re searching for in no time. My goal with MapForge is to enable you to whip up a great map in under an hour. Sometimes even two maps.\nAnd the most important element of all...FUN!\nOther map-making programs on the market can be a chore to use. It just feels too much like work. MapForge intends to make map-making FUN! Because if you aren\u2019t having fun, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\nThe initial inspiration for this project came from using commercial mapping tiles for tabletop RPGs. I found that the tiles themselves looked fantastic, but that the actual act of putting together a map layout, particularly for large layouts, was painstaking and rather tedious, even though I happen to be well-versed with a professional image editing program (Photoshop).\nGMs who want to print out map tiles that they purchase online or create themselves aren't the only ones affected by this \"technical barrier to entry\". Many people nowadays use virtual tabletop (VTT) software to play RPGs remotely, but VTTs are far from optimal map-making tools. They can be wonderful for having a few objects on the map that the players can interact with, but crafting entire map layouts from dozens or even hundreds of map elements is hardly their forte, and the time and effort required to do so would be inordinate.\nSo I decided to create an easy-to-use computer program that would be the best possible tool I could dream up for the task of stitching together pre-made map tiles and and then populating them with decorative elements (e.g., furniture, treasure, debris, etc.) to suit a GM's particular needs. I'm calling the program MapForge. It is intended to allow anyone, regardless of their art skills (or lack thereof), to create gorgeous, hi-resolution battlemaps. \nWho Is MapForge For?\nMapForge is for any GM who wants to create a drool-worthy tactical-scale battlemap for any genre of RPG. It's also suitable for tabletop miniature games and wargames.\nWhat MapForge Isn't\nHave you tried other mapping software and been frustrated with the learning curve and/or the results? That may be because the software tried to be too many things, and ended up not excelling at any one thing.\n\u2022 MapForge is not a general-purpose mapping app; you probably won't be using it to map out continents or entire worlds. It\u2019s narrower in scope, focusing on tile-based and grid-based mapping at tactical combat scale (typically 1\u201d = 5 ft., or 1 hex = 3 feet).\n\u2022 MapForge is not a general-purpose paint program, nor a CAD program. It\u2019s more of a layout and design tool, intended for anyone to use, not just the artistically or technically gifted.\n\u2022 MapForge is also not just a simple \u201ctexture-stamping\u201d program. Some of the planned features are geared towards producing Photoshop-like effects without the steep learning curve that producing such effects normally requires. The software will allow you to create maps by drawing rooms and corridors with straightforward drawing tools (with optional snap-to-grid functionality) and then applying \"styles\" to the walls and floors, including special effects like bevels, glows, strokes, blurs, and drop shadows, and (optionally) textures (e.g. stone, brick, cement, cobblestones, etc.). Some \"general purpose\" styles will come included (pre-configured) with the app, while other styles you will create or tweak yourself to achieve a very specific look.\nTo ensure that great content would be available for use in the program, I formed an alliance with some of my favorite content creators in the field of mapmaking for RPGs. All of them are A-list artists who are well known and respected in the map-making community. They, too, saw the need for such a program, and decided to add their support. Collectively, their published work comprises a vast library of top-notch content that should cover the indoor and outdoor battlemap needs of most RPGs.\nLord Zsezse Works - Zolt\u00e1n B\u00e1r\u00e1ny (see samples)\nBlack Scrolls Games - Antal K\u00e9ninger (see samples)\nHeroic Maps - Joe & Sarah Bilton\nStudio Wyldfurr - Jason Cordwell (see samples)\nDungeonArts - Greg Taylor\nGabriel Pickard - (see samples)\nSteve Gaudreau, Map Alchemists - (see samples)\nBogie\nKepli\nIn addition to your Pledge Rewards, during this campaign you may pledge for the following items.

This is only for backers who are getting a MapForge license AND/OR paid content Add-Ons. See Update #9 for details. This one-time setup fee is a flat rate, and covers all Add-Ons you get now or in the future. It is being offered so that no one has to buy a 2nd license for themselves or purchase a 2nd copy of their Add-Ons. You may NOT use this allowance to permit someone else the use of your paid Add-Ons.\nGifting a MapForge license to a friend:\nAdd $25 to your pledge (at any pledge level) to get an additional MapForge license for a friend. When the email survey goes out at the end if this campaign, be sure to include your friend's email address so that I can get them their license code. You can even order more than one license to gift, if you desire. Note that any content Add-Ons that you get for yourself will not also be applied to your friend's license.\nAs MapForge's userbase grows, I fully expect that additional Add-Ons will be developed and released in the future, both from the above content providers and from others that will want to service the MapForge community. The above selection of Add-Ons is just the \"first wave\", but should be more than enough for the time-being.\nIf by chance you have already purchased some of the above content in the original PDF or PNG format, you should be able to use it in MapForge, albeit without some of the added convenience provided by the Add-On format. Some of the content providers might be willing to allow free registration of the respective Add-Ons to customers who've already purchased their content in its original format and can show proof of purchase.\nI want the MapForge software to be extremely versatile and user friendly, something you can use without first having to read a dense user manual, or resume using without a hitch even if it's been many months since you last used the program.\nThe user interface will be modern, gorgeous (despite being thematically generic), and will look the same regardless of whether you are running the app on Windows or on macOS. Should you happen to switch operating systems someday, you will be able to continue using MapForge without missing a beat.\nClick to enlarge\n  Click to enlarge\n  I also want MapForge to offer a free level of use, so that it\u2019s usable by anyone, even those who have not purchased a license (albeit with a reduced featureset and a few other limitations). This should allow the MapForge userbase to grow very rapidly, which in turn will make the platform more appealing to content publishers, who may want to make their wares available in MapForge.\nIn addition to using content from pre-packaged Add-Ons, MapForge will also allow you to use your own artwork (either created by you, or downloaded from elsewhere, such as the Dundjinni user forums or rpgmapshare.com).\nI don't expect too many people to back this project on faith alone. Many of you have likely been disappointed by prior map-making software, so a healthy degree of skepticism is expected. That is why I have put together a MapForge demo/prototype, which you can download and try out for yourself, in order to evaluate it and take the program for a short spin to see if this is going to be the program you want/expect it to be.\nClick here to download the MapForge prototype for Windows (Zip, 71.8MB)\nClick here to download the MapForge prototype for Windows (7-zip, 30.8MB)\nClick here to download the MapForge prototype for Mac OS X (Zip, 74.3MB)\nA great many features have yet to be implemented (that's what this crowdfunding campaign is for, after all!), but there is enough there for you to evaluate the proposed user interface, the planned featureset, the performance, and the ease of use. A few bugs are to be expected, as this has not seen general release until now. If necessary, I will update the prototype during this campaign to iron out any show-stopping issues encountered.\nHere is a video that walks you through most of the features in the MapForge prototype. You should probably watch this even if you download the prototype demo, since this explains things you might otherwise miss.\nIMPORTANT! Please do not misinterpret what you see in the prototype app or in the video. Just because it only shows maps being assembled from tiles, that does not mean that it is the only thing the final MapForge application will do. MapForge will be a full-fledged map-making program, offering several different methods for creating maps, and those methods can be used individually, or in conjunction. If you prefer to make your own maps from scratch, that will be possible, too. The prototype and the video both show a paid Add-On being used, which is not included with the base software. If you want that particular Add-On, it's called \"Dark Crypts\", by Black Scrolls Games.\nPlanned Features\n\u2022 Quickly assemble existing map tiles into a large map layout.\n\u2022 Support for layers (to adjust the stacking order of items on a map).\n\u2022 Group layers and show/hide/adjust the entire group as a whole (e.g., the contents of a given room), for greater project organization.\n\u2022 Randomization features for textures (to avoid repeating patterns) and for placed items (e.g. randomly scatter trees, automatically varying their size and rotation).\n\u2022 Adjust the location, scale, rotation and opacity of any placed item.\n\u2022 Toggle between day & night versions with the click of a button.\n\u2022 Media Types: Tiles, Tile Overlays, Items, Textures, Walls, Masks\n\u2022 Ability to mark media that should only appear on the GM version of a map (e.g. room key numbers, traps, secret doors, etc.).\n\u2022 Apply bitmap filters, for special effects such as Bevel, Glow, Drop Shadow, Stroke, Color Adjustment, Brightness/Contrast, etc.\n\u2022 Convenience of the MapForge Add-On format: The software knows how large each tile should be (in grid squares), where the exits are, what tiles can be placed next to it and connect properly, and makes it easy to find content via tags and keyword searches.\n\u2022 Export the entire map at once, or just the parts you want.\nI've spent a month and a half so far to get the program to the stage it's at in the downloadable prototype. I need to devote another 3-4 months to complete the program, and this Kickstarter campaign is intended to finance that development time, as well as the development of the various Add-Ons.\nI have an established track record developing virtual tabletop software for over a decade, with over a hundred releases to date. As a software developer, I have a reputation for being accessible, communicative, open to feedback and criticism, and prolific. I've always provided timely technical support to all users of my software. In short, I deliver, I'm in this for the long haul, I have an established reputation to uphold, and I'm passionate about my products.\nThis project has a relatively short completion/delivery time (about 4 months for the software) because I will be able to re-use a fair amount of code from prior RPG-related software I\u2019ve developed. This puts me in a unique position to deliver a robustly-featured program in a relatively short timeframe, and thus for a relatively low basic funding goal. I will be working on this project full-time.\nI expect the first release of MapForge (v1.0) to be ready sometime in July 2017. There will likely be a couple of alpha and beta releases in the months prior to that.\nMost of the content Add-Ons for MapForge should be released shortly thereafter (and in fairly quick succession), but there will definitely be at least a few Add-Ons available at the time of launch, since I'll need them for testing purposes, anyway. I will prioritize the production order of the Add-Ons based on how many people pledged for each one.\nThe bulk of the money raised by this Kickstarter will pay for the development time that I have estimated it will take to complete the MapForge software and the Add-Ons that will be released for it. A very small part of the funds (a few hundred dollars) will cover necessary software upgrades and software license fees, another few hundred will pay for a nice, quiet place to work at a shared office, and a similar amount will be earmarked for advertising and marketing the final product.\n  All Stretch Goals unlocked (again!)\nSocial Media Goal: Any backer Sharing or re-Tweeting my campaign launch announcements and/or my Updates to this Kickstarter campaign on Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ will get early access to a Kickstarter-exclusive Add-On. To be eligible for this reward, you must be following Battlegrounds Games on either Facebook, Twitter, or Google+.\n  In short, this campaign will finance the development of the MapForge software for a minimum of 4 months, working on it full-time (Edit: The funding achieved will now allow me to devote nearly a YEAR to MapForge and Add-On development!). I need your support to make MapForge happen. Help me create the most useful mapping program to visually enrich your RPG game sessions while reducing your prep time. GMs already have plenty of work they need to do to prepare for each game session. Making maps should not eat up most of that time.\nWhether or not you choose to make a pledge to this campaign, I would greatly appreciate it if you could mention this project to friends or family members who might be interested. I've made it easy to do so; just click on one of the buttons below. Help spread the word far and wide.\n      Last but not least, I'd love it if you would follow Battlegrounds Games on any or all of these social media sites, so you can stay apprised of all the latest news and developments.

I think you're really going to like the additional speed boost I've achieved. In prior releases, whenever a tile had to be drawn on a map, MapForge would take the original asset artwork, apply scaling effects to it to account for the map's resolution, rotate the artwork as needed, apply any mirror/flipping effects to it, and then draw the result to the map canvas. But with v1.1.5, I'm having the app dynamically create temporary \u201cproxies\" of the stamped tiles at the current working resolution. These proxies already take into account any scaling/flipping/rotating of the tile, so when the app needs to redraw that particular section of the map after an edit operation, it just loads the proxy and stamps it in place. This reduced work load makes a huge difference when editing your map layouts, which is most noticeable when working with the 3300x3300 pixel tiles in the (e.g. ), because it means that if you\u2019re working at a resolution of 50 (rather than the artwork's native resolution of 330), the app will only be redrawing a 495x495 pixel area of the map when you edit a tile.

It has two main offerings:\nBattlegrounds: RPG Edition (aka BRPG) is for playing roleplaying games. Originally released in 2006, Battlegrounds has incrementally been honed and improved over the course of a decade to become one of the most well-respected and long-lived VT programs around.\nThe newer Battlegrounds Gaming Edition (aka BGE) is custom-tailored for playing boardgames, wargames (including tabletop miniatures games), card games, and dice games.\nBoth programs are system-agnostic (i.e. permit the use of any ruleset) and allow games to be played either live online with up to 16 participants, or in face-to-face game sessions (generally using a projector or an HDTV). A fuller explanation of each program can be found by clicking on the animated images below.\nClick for more info about BRPG\n           Click for more info about BGE\n    PLAY\n\nHowever, both programs are currently at the end of their v1.x update cycle. The time has finally come to take the programs even further. But in order to move forward, a massive rewrite of portions of the apps needs to happen in order to update the underlying technology (the development environment). This overhaul will pave the way for powerful new features and substantial improvements that couldn't possibly be added in the current incarnations.\nThis Kickstarter campaign is intended to fund the development of Battlegrounds Ultimate (aka BGU) virtual tabletop software, which will be a next-generation fusion and enhancement of our two already-available and mature virtual tabletop programs. BGU should be considered to be version 2 of BRPG and version 2 of BGE, all rolled into one. BGU software releases will be in a \"v2.x\" format.\n  How many of these goals can be met will depend on the total level of funding achieved by this campaign.\n 1. Restore full Mac support\nAlthough both BRPG and BGE were initially cross-platform (Windows and Macs), changes to Mac OS X in recent years have rendered the programs unusable on modern Macs running recent versions of OS X. Updating the development environment is crucial to restoring Mac-compatibility to Battlegrounds, and is one of my main goals for this campaign. The resulting software will not only be faster and more full-featured, it will also be more future-proofed, to ensure that users on both platforms can get many more years of use and enjoyment from the software.\n2. A vastly enhanced user interface (UI)\nThe new UI will be gorgeous (despite being thematically generic), and will look the same regardless of whether you are running the app on Windows or on macOS. Should you happen to switch operating systems someday, you will be able to continue using BGU without missing a beat.\n3. Unified code base (Stretch Goal #1)\nI want to merge BRPG and BGE into a single program that encompasses the functionality of both programs. Depending on which license/s a particular user has, the program will operate in the corresponding mode. Since Battlegrounds Games is a small independent developer, having a single codebase would allow for significantly faster development and testing, so that new features and bug fixes can be rolled out to users up to twice as fast.\n4. Freemium model (Stretch Goal #2)\nI want BGU to offer a free level of play, so that it\u2019s usable by anyone, even those who have not purchased a license (albeit with a more limited featureset). This will allow the BGU userbase to grow exponentially, which in turn will make the platform more appealing to game publishers, who may want to make their boardgames and RPG modules available for BGU.\n5. Localization (support for multiple languages) (Stretch Goal)\nWouldn\u2019t it be great to break away with the current English-only interface, and offer other language choices such as German, French, and Spanish (and potentially more)?\n6. New features, of course (Stretch Goal)\nI also want to add many, many new features to make the software even more powerful, versatile, and user-friendly. Although many of these features are ones I've already got planned (some are briefly mentioned in the project video), many will also be new ones suggested by backers of this campaign. Backers are going to help guide the development of BGU by voting on proposed features, by suggesting new ones, and they will often decide the order in which the new features get implemented (except in cases where one feature is a pre-requisite for another). If you're looking for a project where your involvement isn't just in the form of providing financial support but one where you become a part of the creative process, you've found it.\n7. Support Materials (Stretch Goal)\nThese can include video tutorials, written PDF guides, and/or free artpacks and game files. Regardless of whether you are into RPGs or boardgames, there will be something for both crowds.\nBGU in General Terms\nIn keeping with the tradition established by BRPG and BGE, BGU will endeavor to offer top-notch visuals, a deeper level of immersion than competing VTs, ease-of-use, and a very high level of customizability, so that you can play your games exactly the way you want to (especially if you use house rules). Nor will you ever have to do any programming, scripting, or XML editing of any sort. The client software will also continue to \u201cbe it\u2019s own server\u201d, so you will never have to rely on a central server being operational in order to use the software, nor will you require an internet connection for face-to-face or LAN use.\nRegarding compatibility: Existing content for BRPG and BGE (such as artpacks and game conversions) will also work in BGU, or will be updated to work with BGU (should changes to the file formats be required that can't be auto-updated). It may be necessary to issue new registration codes, but this process will be automated to a great extent.\nBGU compared to other VTs\nBeing a stand-alone client, BGU will be better suited than competing VT solutions that try to shoehorn your web browser into being a suitable gaming environment. Although subscriptions will be an option for those wanting to test out the full-featured software, they will be an exception, as most users will either use the software for free, or pay once and never have to deal with recurring subscriptions or bandwidth and upload limits, nor be subject to server downtimes or the developer going out of business. BGU's 2D (rather than 3D) approach, aside from allowing for faster and more efficient gameplay, has the added benefit of not draining your laptop's battery in record time or kicking your cooling fan into overdrive.\nI have an established track record developing virtual tabletop software (BRPG alone has had 93 releases over a 10-year period, and I have never charged for any of those updates!). By being able to build atop my already-finished \"version 1\" programs, I can shave years off the development time of BGU.\nAs a software developer, I have a reputation for being accessible, communicative, open to feedback and criticism, and prolific. I've always provided timely technical support to all users of my software. In short, I deliver, I'm in this for the long haul, I have an established reputation to uphold, and I'm passionate about my products.\nI expect the first beta release (v2.0) of BGU to be ready sometime around May 2017. There will likely be a couple of alpha releases in the months prior to this. If funding permits, more features will be incrementally added to make the software increasingly powerful while maintaining (or more likely increasing) the ease-of-use, while enhancing the efficiency (meaning your gameplay will proceed faster).\nEach of the numbered Stretch Goals reached will require about two months of additional work to deliver, but these will be released as free updates to v2.0, so these will not impact the May 2017 delivery date.\nThe bulk of the money raised by this Kickstarter will pay for the development time that I have estimated it will take to complete this project, including the various Stretch Goals, if those are achieved. A very small part of the funds (a few hundred dollars) will cover a necessary software upgrade (Adobe Director 12, the new authoring environment), and a similar amount will be earmarked for advertising and marketing the final product.\nPlease don't get confused or intimidated by the number of pledge levels. Some are strictly for owners of the original BRPG or BGE software, so if you are new to Battlegrounds, you can safely ignore those pledge levels. Conversely, if you already own BRPG and/or BGE, you can completely ignore several pledge levels that are strictly for newcomers.\nFor those of you who are new to Battlegrounds, this is your chance to save some money on BRPG and/or BGE licenses. These are a one-time purchase (although monthly subscriptions are also available, for those who prefer).\nEarly Access\nAll backers pledging $10 or more to this campaign will be given access to the already-available BRPG v1.9 beta, and to the BGE v1.8 beta as soon as it is released (to download and evaluate; this does not grant you a license if you don't already have one). Early access to the BGU alpha and beta releases will be provided only to those backers who pledge for a BGU (GM or Player) license or upgrade.\nIn addition to your Pledge Rewards, during this campaign you may pledge for the following items. Simply increase the amount of your pledge by the cost of the Add-On/s you desire (you may also purchase Add-Ons multiple times). A post-campaign survey will be sent to collect additional information and clarify exactly what items you pledged for.\nDeluxe GM Bundle: $45 (normally $52) - This includes a GM Client for BRPG ($39), plus Base Map Pack 1 ($9), plus Component Dungeon Pack 1 ($10). Get this if you want a deal on the v1 software. Sold separately, these three items would cost $58.\nGM Client for BRPG: $35 (normally $39) - Get this if you want a deal on the v1 software for GMs. This license allows you to host game sessions, or join someone else's game session as a player.\nPlayer Client for BRPG: $15 (normally $19) - Get this if you want a deal on the v1 software for players. This license allows you to join game sessions that someone with a BRPG GM Client is hosting.\nFloating License for BRPG: $15 (normally $19) - Add this to your BRPG GM Client to allow someone to join your game sessions using just the free BRPG Demo. In effect, you are paying on behalf of the player. How many Floating Licenses you need to get depends on how many non-paying players you wish to support.\n5-Pack of Floating Licenses for BRPG: $70 (normally $79) - Add this to your BRPG GM Client to allow up to 5 players to join your game sessions using just the free BRPG Demo. In effect, you are paying on behalf of five players.\nFloating License for BGU: $20 (normally $25) - Add this to your BGU GM Client to allow someone to join your game sessions using just the free BGU Demo. In effect, you are paying on behalf of the player. How many Floating Licenses you need to get depends on how many non-paying players you wish to support.\nUpgrade a BRPG Floating License to a BGU Floating License: $10 each (only possible during this Kickstarter campaign) - This Add-On may of course be purchased multiple times.\nUpgrade a BRPG Floating License 5-Pack to a BGU Floating License 5-Pack: $45 (only possible during this Kickstarter campaign)\nBattlegrounds Gaming Engine (Gamer-8 Client License): $22 (normally $30). The license being offered here comes with 7 free Player Slots, allowing for 8 participants in a game session with only the host needing a license.\nDevin Night Token Pack Mega-Bundle: $85 (normally $89) - A collection of 27 themed artpacks containing a total of 1915 tokens. If you missed out on our prior Kickstarter, this is your chance to pick up this incredible collection at a slight discount (an average of $3.19 per artpack).\nSocial Media Goal: Any backer Sharing or re-Tweeting my campaign launch announcements and/or my Updates to this Kickstarter campaign on Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ will get early access to a couple of new BRPG-specific releases and a new game conversion (ie, boardgame module) for BGE. This content will not be available for other Battlegrounds users for at least one month from the end date of this campaign. To be eligible for this reward, you must be following Battlegrounds Games on either Facebook, Twitter, or Google+.\n$31,500 (Stretch Goal #5): Backers vote on what to add next: new features, multi-language support (if still not implemented), or support materials (if still not implemented) (delivered about 2 months later as a free update)\n$35K: All Game Boxes currently available on the BG Store will be available for FREE to all backers of this campaign.\n$50K: All backers of this campaign with a BGU GM Client license will receive Devin Night's Token Pack Mega-Bundle (27 artpacks containing 1915 tokens) free of charge.\nVirtual tabletop software caters to a very niche market in a very crowded field. BRPG has over 70 competitors in the RPG market, and BGE has around 30 competitors in the board gaming market. To complicate matters, a great many of the VT programs are free (created as hobby projects, rather than businesses). It is nearly impossible to have a commercially viable product at an accessible price point, especially given the abundance of free competing software. I feel this project is ideal for Kickstarter because that's a large part of what this site is about: to bring projects to life which might not otherwise be economically-viable endeavors.\n  In short, this campaign will finance the development of the Battlegrounds Ultimate software for a minimum of 4 months, working on it full-time, and hopefully for a year or more, if sufficient Stretch Goals are met.\nAlthough BRPG and BGE were self-funded (Kickstarter wasn't even a thing, back then), this time around I need your support to make BGU happen. If you do pledge, I encourage you to be actively involved in the program's creation and evolution, and join what I hope will be an amazing community of avid gamers. By supporting this Kickstarter campaign, you'll have the chance to \"get in on the ground floor\" and to help shape the future development of the BGU software.\nAlthough I have a well-defined vision for where I want to take this in the future, I also want to hear from all the current and prospective users. Tell me what features you want and need to make your game sessions run more smoothly, more efficiently, and with less effort on your part. Help me create the ultimate tool for your RPG and tabletop gaming needs.\nWhether or not you choose to make a pledge to this campaign, I would greatly appreciate it if you could mention this project to friends or family members who might be interested. I've made it easy to do so; just click on one of the buttons below. Help spread the word far and wide.\n      Last but not least, I'd love it if you would follow Battlegrounds Games on any or all of these social media sites, so you can stay apprised of all the latest news and developments.\nFollow Battlegrounds on                    Facebook           Twitter           Pinterest            Google+\nThank you for checking out this campaign!\nDisclaimer:\nWhen I first started contemplating creating a version 2 of my software, I made it clear that owners of v1 would be offered a discounted rate if they upgraded to v2, in other words that there would be a discounted \u201cupgrade\u201d price, rather than having to purchase the software all over again. THIS KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THAT OFFER OF A DISCOUNTED UPGRADE. Once this campaign ends, the upgrade pricing will never be offered again. So if you are a v1 user of BRPG, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity, because if you don\u2019t and you later decide that you DO want to get BGU, you will have to pay full price.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUpdating my software to a more-modern development/authoring environment (from Macromedia Director MX 2004 to Adobe Director 12) imposes some real technical challenges, but my research and preliminary R&D efforts have not discovered anything insurmountable.\n\nDelays are always a possibility but I believe I've been somewhat generous in my time estimates to minimize the possibility of a late delivery.\n\nShipping won't be a factor with this campaign, since all rewards will be digital downloads, so that's a non-issue.\n\nThis project will be a full-time endeavor for me, not some tangential side project, so backers can rest assured that I will be devoting my full attention to ensuring a timely delivery of a high-quality piece of software.

We have a dedicated team located within an hour drive from the manufacturer so that we can deal with issues that may arise in person and in real time. Our team is staffed with experienced professionals in the sourcing and hardware manufacturing industries. Our expertise and proximity to the factory should be able to mitigate any of the manufacturing issues that may occur. TL Lim has successfully launched multiple media boxes called the Popcorn Hour shipping over half a million units to date while Johnson Jeng has been through the entire manufacturing process multiple times with his other consumer electronics companies. Our combined experiences and issues we have faced in the past allows us to maneuver around problems that may happen during production.\n\nSupport\n\nPINE64 will be released as an open platform project allowing others from all around the world contribute and build upon. We have a dedicated forum (http://forum.pine64.org) built to address questions and concerns. We currently have tons of beta testers that are willing to share ideas and help solve problems as a community. \n\nWe have asked industry specialists such as Daniel Kottke, #12 employee of Apple, and Kai Kreuzer, Founder of OpenHAB to help with contributing to our forums. Our experienced technical staff is always available via email at support@pine64.com to assist you with any questions or concerns.\n\n\nGlobal Logistics\n\nWe are working with highly experienced logistic partners to help us mitigate any issues that may arise with our fulfillment. If shipping issues come up, their expert knowledge will help us navigate through difficulties and help us get PINE64 into your hands.

(And Mac and Linux!) \nHere's an EARLY in-engine visual exploration that our art team's been working on. It\u2019s still work-in-progress, not final\u2026 but we just had to show you guys!\n> WHERE\nThe BattleTech Universe is one of near-constant warfare and feudal political intrigue, where great noble houses vie for dominance of a vast region of space known as the Inner Sphere. It's a universe of flawed heroes, fallen empires and grey moral realities. Great families vie for supremacy, with alliances and betrayals constantly shifting the balance of power.\nThe Inner Sphere, circa 3025.\n> WHEN\nOur BATTLETECH game is set in the popular 3025 Succession Wars Era of the BattleTech Universe - often referred to as \"Classic BattleTech\".\nClick to view a timeline of the Inner Sphere. (2271 - 3025)\n> WHO\nThe project is led by:\nJordan Weisman, creator of BattleTech and MechWarrior, Shadowrun, Crimson Skies, and more.\nMike McCain, Creative Director of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed series of Shadowrun games.\nMitch Gitelman, Producer of the classic MechCommander series of tactical 'Mech combat games.\nOur studio, Harebrained Schemes, has delivered three successful Kickstarter campaigns - Shadowrun Returns / Dragonfall, Golem Arcana, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong - to rave reviews and very positive responses from our Kickstarter backers. Kickstarter allows our studio to remain independent and to focus on making games directly for our fans.\n> WHY\nBecause we love BattleTech, and there hasn't been a turn-based, classic BattleTech game on PC in over 20 years! Above all else, our goal with this project is to deliver an authentic BattleTech experience. Accomplishing that goal isn't just about designing great 'Mech combat - it's about fully realizing the BattleTech Universe, its characters, its factions, and its stories.\n> HOW\nWith your help! CONGRATULATIONS ON REACHING STAGE 4 - PVP Multiplayer!\nYou did it!\nBATTLETECH is in development for PC, Mac, and Linux in English and will be delivered in standard and DRM-free versions on Steam, GoG, and Humble stores. The game will also be made available in German, French, and Russian (with localized text, and audio subtitles) in a post-launch update. Other platforms and languages may be announced later. BATTLETECH is expected to launch in early 2017.\nBATTLETECH is set in a universe at perpetual war, fought by militarized factions utilizing huge, mechanized combat vehicles called BattleMechs.\nFollowing centuries of space colonization and the rise of six Great Noble Houses, treachery undermined the Star League and toppled its First Lord. The rulers of the five remaining Houses each proclaimed themselves the new First Lord, and so the Succession Wars began - hundreds of years of mechanized armies, scavenged technology, and political machinations.\nNow, in 3025, each faction is near its breaking point. An uneasy stalemate sets in as the Houses scrape to rebuild their holdings, reinforce their worlds, and restock their 'Mech armies. But the conflict continues as the nobility drives their agendas forward covertly through the use of mercenaries\u2026   \nWhether maintained by a House army, or passed down within a MechWarrior family from generation to generation, BattleMechs reign supreme on the thirty-first century battlefield. These massive weapon platforms - ranging from seven to sixteen meters in height, and twenty to one hundred tons in weight - form the backbone of the Great Houses' interstellar armies.\n'Mechs are rare, and often passed down from generation to generation within a noble family.\nOver the 200 years of the Succession Wars, attrition has eaten away at the resources of the Great Houses, and the number of working BattleMechs on the field has dwindled. By 3025, field-ready 'Mechs are a precious commodity, and keeping them running is a tactical necessity.\nWe're excited that Piranha Games, creators of MechWarrior Online, are sharing their incredible roster of Inner Sphere BattleMech models with us for BATTLETECH. Not only are their 'Mechs wonderfully detailed, using the same models adds to the continuity of the BattleTech Universe.\nWe\u2019re also very happy to be working closely with Catalyst Game Labs, publisher of the BattleTech tabletop board games and novels. Even though Jordan created the BattleTech Universe over 30 years ago, the talented folks at Catalyst have been the keepers of the flame for years, and we appreciate their help in ensuring that we deliver an authentic BattleTech experience.\nBecause we\u2019re an independent game studio with big dreams for an amazing game.\nWe know that to do 'Mech combat right will be a substantial investment - in fact, Harebrained Schemes has budgeted over a million dollars to self-fund the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME (see below), and we've already started pre-production. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve scoped the project appropriately, and that we can deliver this version of the game without any Kickstarter support.\nBut, we also know that BattleTech isn't just about big stompy robots battling it out. There\u2019s so much more we\u2019d like to include in this game! A full single-player campaign. Full control of your career as a mercenary. PVP Multiplayer. That\u2019s where you come in!\nThe scope of this project expands in the four major FUNDING STAGES below - so that no matter which funding level we attain, we\u2019re sure to deliver a great game worthy of the BattleTech name. Help us co-fund BATTLETECH and let\u2019s see how big this game can get!\nNaturally, 'Mech combat is the cornerstone of any great BattleTech game, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting development. HBS is self-funding a complete 'Mech battlefield experience in the form of the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME.\nOur goal is to craft a combat system for BATTLETECH that\u2019s the perfect blend of tactical depth, speed of play, and meaningful unit customization. As we did with our Shadowrun games, we intend to capture the *spirit* of the original tabletop rules, while designing the best PC game we can. That said, Shadowrun and BattleTech are very different games! For one thing, Shadowrunners like to hide behind cover, while \u2018Mechs\u2026 squash cover. Expect turn-based combat in BattleTech to feel very different than a more cover-based combat system like Shadowrun\u2019s\nOn the battlefield, you'll command a Lance of four 'Mechs in turn-based combat. We\u2019d like a typical skirmish to be complete-able within about 30 minutes, without sacrificing the tactical depth that any BattleTech game demands. All of our systems will be designed with a \u201clayered\u201d approach in mind - surfacing the information you need for quick decision-making, while also allowing you to drill-down into detailed stats and unit management options.\nThink of the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME like a personal 'Mech command simulation - you\u2019ll be able to set the parameters and difficulty level of each skirmish game, challenging yourself to defeat larger and larger AI-controlled enemy forces over more and more difficult terrain. Or, choose from a variety of pre-built combat encounters created by our design team.\nBetween skirmishes, customize your BattleMechs in the 'Mech Bay. Choose from over twenty-five 3025-era Inner Sphere 'Mech chassis, and configure the weapon loadout, armor, heat sinks, and paint scheme for each. If you want to dive even deeper, tweak their engine, gyros, actuators, and shock absorbers - all of which will impact the 'Mech\u2019s battlefield performance in different ways.\n\nIn the Ready Room, select the best pilots for the 'Mechs you\u2019ve configured. Each MechWarrior will have their own 'Mech and weapon specializations, as well as certain special abilities that can be used on the battlefield. \n\nOh, and one more thing: we want to put the PUNCH back into BattleTech. This game will include MELEE COMBAT and DEATH FROM ABOVE!\n\n>>> STAGE 1+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$250,000 - Combined Arms: We'll add a healthy roster of non-'Mech AI opponents to the Base Skirmish Game including tanks, hovercraft, support vehicles and more. But be careful - even the lightest of combat vehicles can still wreck your 'Mechs under the right conditions. \n$400,000 - Expanded Mission Objectives: We'll add a variety of mission types to the Base Skirmish Game including Escort, Capture, Defend, and more. \n$500,000 - Expanded Environments: We'll add a wider variety of battlefield environments to the game, including time-of-day and atmospheric conditions that affect both movement and combat. Confront enemy forces in the low-visibility conditions of a blizzard on a frigid ice world, or carefully manage your heat in a battle across volcanic fields.\nThe BattleTech Universe is all about stories - of nobles and MechWarriors, fighting to protect their people and their homes. Of mercenaries, surviving from battle to battle in a war-torn universe. It\u2019s a dynamic science fiction setting filled with intrigue and cutthroat politics that spans centuries. It\u2019s a shared universe that has evolved over 30 years, in tabletop miniatures games and sourcebooks, novels, comics, and dozens of computer games. We want to honor that history and make this perennial game setting come to life with a killer single-player story campaign.\nOur STAGE 2 STORY CAMPAIGN will put you in command of your own mercenary outfit, as you find yourself inexorably drawn into a bloody dynastic conflict set in the Periphery of the Inner Sphere. Over the course of the campaign, you\u2019ll manage the finances and logistics of your mercenary outfit - from the modifications and loadout of your 'Mechs, to the salaries and skill growth of your MechWarriors.\n\nA mercenary Lance of MechWarriors prepares for battle.\nAt the end of the day, the life of a mercenary is all about money: the money needed to repair the damage your 'Mechs took in combat, to pay your MechWarriors to keep fighting, and - if you\u2019re lucky - the money to put towards buying new 'Mech chassis and weapon systems. Fortunately, 'Mech components salvaged from the battlefield can be both cheaper and better-performing than the oft-refurbished parts available for purchase.\n\n>>> STAGE 2+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$1,100,000 - Cinematic Transitions: We'll add short cutscenes for various events in game - such as deploying your forces to the battlefield - and for key moments in the single-player story.\n$1,200,000 - Player-Character Origin Stories: In BATTLETECH, you\u2019ll create your own mercenary character to star in the story. If we hit this funding level, you'll be able to choose one of six origin stories for your mercenary commander's career. Are you the only heir of a once noble family that has since fallen from favor? The bastard child of a famous MechWarrior? You decide.\n$1,350,000 - Voice Acting: We'll record a cast of talented voice actors to act as your advisers, provide mission briefings, and record battlefield emotes. We\u2019ll also add voice acting to the animatics for important moments in the story.\n$1,550,000 - 3D MechWarrior Portrait Customization: We'll build a complete 3D portrait customization system for you to customize the look of both your MechWarriors and your own Mercenary commander.\nThe STAGE 3 EXPANDED MERCENARY CAMPAIGN puts you in full control of your life as a Mercenary. The campaign becomes open-ended, allowing you to charter JumpShip transport for your mercenary outfit when needed - travel to various hot-zones across the Periphery and Inner Sphere. You\u2019ll be able to choose your contracts and alliances, with both the Great Houses and other subfactions within the Inner Sphere.\nThe emblems of the five Great Houses of the Inner Sphere.\nOver time, the missions you choose to accept and the objectives competed in those missions will determine your reputation as a mercenary. Your reputation will affect the contracts and contract terms you may be offered in the future. But be wary: each Great House - and in some cases, each House representative - can have their own agendas, sometimes leading you into bad deals or deadly betrayals.\nTheir negotiations complete, a Davion liaison officer briefs a merc outfit on their mission.\nTo support this open-ended Mercenary career, STAGE 3 adds a wide variety of \u201cside-contracts\u201d in addition to the story campaign, as well as a procedural contract-generation system to ensure that you always have fresh contracts available, wherever your Mercenary career may take you.\n>>> STAGE 3+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$2,000,000 - Customizable Home Base: As part of the ongoing campaign, you'll acquire a home base (likely in the form of a derelict DropShip) for your mercenary outfit to call home. At this funding level we'll also allow you to adjust its appearance, repair and upgrade its functionality, and grow and evolve your base as your outfit grows and evolves.\n$2,150,000 - Legendary 'Mech & MechWarriors: In addition to the game's standard 'Mechs and customizable, procedurally-generated MechWarriors, we'll include rare legendary 'Mechs to find, and rare hero MechWarriors to hire - including some famous characters from BattleTech history. Such legends may not stick around for long, but will be well worth hiring if you can afford them.\nThe neutral planet of Solaris VII is home to the Inner Sphere\u2019s most famous gladiatorial 'Mech combat arenas. Here players can challenge each other to casual PvP battles or enter our matchmaking system to be matched against an appropriately experienced opponent. \nEach Great House maintains an embassy and a namesake arena on Solaris VII and each has very different gameplay features - from the Roman-inspired Steiner Coliseum to the frozen glaciers of Davion\u2019s Boreal Reach (or one of Davion\u2019s many other holographic environs).\nTournaments and Leagues will reward the victor with various prizes and Leaderboard fame.\nJon Everist, composer for the award-winning Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut and Shadowrun: Hong Kong, is creating the music for BATTLETECH. We\u2019re very excited to continue our collaboration with Jon and you can hear his first BattleTech tune in our Kickstarter video!\nInstead of throwing a bunch of random tchotchkes into this campaign, we've focused our physical reward efforts on two really awesome reward levels that we know we can deliver (in addition to all the great digital rewards we've created.) This focus will allow us to devote more of your funding towards making the best BattleTech game we can!\nClick the image to see all 6 Great House sets!\n                                     Click for larger Flight Jacket image.\nTo encourage everyone to get involved and share their passion for the BattleTech Universe, we've created a set of missions for you to collectively complete, listed below. Each mission accomplished by the Global BattleTech Community (GBC) earns a point. Earned points unlock cool content in the game and fun rewards for Backers (also listed below). \nNote: For more details about the Final Week Bonus Missions, see this Kickstarter Update!\nPosts to share & pages to Like/Follow:\nAnnouncement post on Facebook\nAnnouncement post on Twitter\nHBS on Facebook\nHBS on Twitter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know there are BattleTech fans that have been burned by other crowdfunding projects, and we\u2019re really sorry you had to go through that.\n\nHarebrained Schemes has delivered solid Kickstarter projects three times.

We're building an all-new codebase in Unity 5, with lofty visual and gameplay goals - and we know that really nailing the feel of BattleTech will take time and iteration. We\u2019ll need a few new team members, too, but we've proven that we have a pretty damn good track record for hiring talented, dedicated people who go the extra mile.\n\nSo, the standard game development caveats apply. Some new features may take longer to make than we thought. Some piece of gameplay may not be as fun as it sounded on paper and we\u2019ll need to revise it several times until it works.\n\nBut that's part of the fun of making games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "CAMPAIGN COMPLETE - THANKS AGAIN!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED - Season Pass Complete!", "update_content": "Hey everyone, long time!

A relentless, overwhelming enemy has emerged to abduct your people. There's no time to colonize planets, negotiate with alien races, or build an empire. You're outnumbered, out-gunned, and low on resources. Knowing when it's time to fight or flee will be the key to saving the human race. \nCommanding your fleet and managing resources is only part of your job. You'll also need to lead a variety of personalities as you gather and protect a flock of civilian ships. Who you choose to elect onto your council will affect the entire fleet and alter the options available to you. Your leadership will either inspire loyalty and sacrifice, or drive your people to treachery and sabotage...\nGameplay\nXO is a single player game.  Newtonian physics govern starship movement in a 2D plane. The game unfolds in real-time but you can pause the action and issue commands. Most of the gameplay is procedurally generated, including events, weapons, star systems, and personalities. These rogue-like elements ensure XO will be replayable and unique during each session.\nEmerge from jumpspace near a planet where you will begin rescuing ships, gathering resources, and defending against ever-stronger waves of enemies until you judge it is time to evacuate the fleet.\nNavigate a complex political system as the war brings out the best and worst in people. Promote the finest in your fleet to your council. Heed their advice or face the consequences.\nChoose the next planet to jump to based on limited intel, taking into account the resources you need, reported enemy strength, and refugees at each possible destination. Spin up the fleet's jump drives and lead your able ships to the temporary safety of jumpspace.\nIn jumpspace, use your resources to upgrade ships, manufacture weapons, and make critical repairs.\nContinue this cycle until you amass enough firepower to defeat the enemy mothership and escape with as many people as possible.\nStretch Goals and Backer Missions \n[Note: our backer missions are now closed, thank you for your support!]\nOne of the best ways you can help XO succeed is by sharing the Kickstarter campaign with your friends. By leaving comments on Facebook, YouTube, and of course inside Kickstarter, you\u2019re directly increasing XO\u2019s visibility.

Once unlocked, these extras will be available to all backers!\nSee all backer submissions here!\nFinal result: 8/19 at 6:00PM PST\n The Enemy\nThey're not talking. They're not negotiating. They're not even showing their faces. Hell, they might not even have faces. Your enemy has only one goal: mass abduction of the human race.\nBecause of that, the enemy is not destroying your ships. They're disabling them, to be extracted by a fearsomely powerful ship called a Harvester. Your people are being carried off... to an unknown fate.\nAnd as gruesome as it may sound, you may be able to use disabled ships to your advantage...\nTriage\nYou won't be able to save everyone. As fleet commander, it's your job to make the call: do you save the damaged military destroyer to add more firepower to your fleet, the tanker that will extend the fleet's range, or rescue a freighter loaded with enough food to keep your people alive?\nEvents\nAt the heart of the game are procedural events \u2013 the things that happen to you every time you jump in to an area. You'll encounter ships under distress, desperate refugees, greedy merchants, wreckage and caches to loot, shipyards and stations, enemy traps... and much more. We have about a hundred different basic event types that we hope to have in the game, each of which will have variations. Most of our event system is already finished.\nCombat and Weapons\nTo initiate combat, your ships need only move within range of an enemy ship. There are several types of weapons at your disposal, including flak cannons, point-defense cannons, lasers, missiles, and a unique defensive tool called the sandcaster - which forms a cloud of particles that blocks laser fire and damages ships that blunder into it.\nMovement, Flanking and Formations\nTo keep things simple, ships fly on a 2D plane, but real physics like inertia and thrust keep the tactical action realistic and intense.\nPlotting a course works by selecting one or more ships, then choosing one or more waypoints. Each course line is visualized with an Estimated Time to Arrival (ETA). Waypoints are draggable and course lines are adjusted in real time displaying the actual course that is possible for the ship to fly given its thrust, rotational capability and current vector. Your navigational computer will also automatically display different course options to assist you in tactical planning. \nWe then give you the power to adjust the time it takes for each ship (or formation of ships) to arrive at their endpoint with an ETA slider. As you drag the ETA slider you\u2019ll see course lines change in real-time, allowing you to experiment and make adjustments on the fly as befits the situation. This allows you to coordinate multiple groups to arrive at the same time at a particular location. Hover your pointer over a ship to assign tactics like flank, intercept, attack, follow, lag behind, or protect another friendly ship.\nUnder the strain of battle, some will crack under pressure while others will rise to greatness. Each situation will require thoughtful leadership. Demands, urgent calls for help, and interesting opportunities will present themselves, often at your most trying moments. You must decide what is best: do you reassign that annoying complainer to damage control, throw them in the brig, or abandon them to their own fate? Do you risk the safety of the fleet to pursue a sudden opportunity? \nSome people will actively work against you. The Sympathizer will try to convince ships to surrender. The Politician will seek to undermine your authority and break away with as many ships as possible. We want to add several more unique dissenters to the fleet.  With your support, we can add even more dramatic scenarios!\nMutiny and Civilians\nYour fleet is comprised of both military and civilian ships. As long as you have sufficient air, food, and water your military ships will maintain a high level of duty. The civilian ships, however, are not used to being bossed around (even when it\u2019s clearly for their own good). Keep an eye on morale and watch out for deserters and mutineers; humanity needs all the force you can muster.\nWe have many things we are hoping to add to the game: abandoning ship to lifeboats, booby-trapped ships that self-destruct, and rogue human warships to name a few. We'd like to add more ship types, both friendly and enemy. And we want to dedicate a great deal of time to polishing and balancing the experience.\nYour Council\nSelect the best in your fleet to join your trusted group of advisors. Each member gives you special options as events unfold. For example, a Counselor will give you negotiation options, while a Marine will give you more... direct choices \u2013 like boarding parties. Having both gives you more flexibility, but if you ignore the recommendations of a council member too many times, they will turn on you. We hope to add many types: Intelligence Agent, Newscaster, Assassin, each giving you unique tools for your journey. We even envision a Prophet \u2013 a sage leader who will calm your people but whose guidance will be the most perilous of all to avoid.\nYour exodus will take you to many worlds. As in the real universe, you'll come across gas giants, airless rocks, frozen wastelands, hellish molten planets and rarest of all, habitable worlds. \nWith your help, we can add more features like scout ships. These units will gather vital information about a destination, giving you advance warning before committing your fleet into unknown dangers. We'd also like to add rival factions, pirates, and other mysteries to a larger starmap - and you can help us achieve these goals by completing the backer missions listed below!\nResources\nResources are plentiful; time, however, is not. In order to keep your fleet going, you'll need food, water, air, fuel, and raw materials. You can find these resources at space stations, depots, abandoned starships, and nearby planets. The time it takes to collect what you need may require the sacrifice of hundreds of brave souls. \n Air: Helps your people, you know, breathe. Runs out the fastest, but easy to find. \n Water: Humans are also fond of drinking now and then. \n Food: Lasts a long time, but much harder to find. \n Fuel: Easiest to find. Used for nearly everything too, from weapons and drives to repairs. \nRaw Materials: Blocks of rock, mineral and ice laser-hewn from asteroids or planets and used for repairs and upgrades. Storing them takes up a lot of space.\nReplication\nWhile exploring star systems, you'll come across parts and schematics from various places, such as space stations and abandoned ships. If you have enough resources you can manufacture weapons and upgrade your ships.\nYou'll have access to the replicator during your time in jumpspace. You'll be limited on what you're able to create not only by the resources available, but also by time.\nJumpdrive Studios is a small, dedicated team of game developers based in Portland, Oregon.\n \"They operate out of a chic Eastside office building, in a single room that might be mistaken for a utility closet were it not for the clusters of computer monitors and a giant whiteboard filled with mathematical formulas.\" - Ben Coleman, The Portland Mercury\n#XOwhiteboard\nRewards\nApprox 6\" long, printed in color!\nEucl3D brings your game to life!

We've all agreed to take meager salaries (or none at all) and forego other projects to bring this game to life. The trailer represents actual gameplay, but we are a long way from the finished, polished game we all want. The extra funds raised by Kickstarter will go towards the features we don't yet have in the game: additional sound design, a fully realized soundtrack, more events, more starships, more characters, more things to do.

We are accounting for 5% for Square Enix Collective, as part of our agreement with them.\nSquare Enix Collective\nEarlier this year, we announced XO on Square Enix Collective: a curated platform that enables creators to post ideas, and gamers to judge whether those ideas should become reality or not. The community voted in our favor, and now the Collective has decided to support us during our Kickstarter - while allowing us to retain our IP and full creative control.\nTo be clear: we're not getting money from Square Enix.\nThe Collective is good for us because we\u2019re a small team with limited resources. They\u2019ve provided guidance on XO\u2019s production, and helped us refine our marketing strategy.\nThe Collective is good for you because they put us through a detailed assessment review.

Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our two Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2014-2015 longshoreman west coast work slow down that delayed all of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event did not occur in either of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount of the model.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #110", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

We have a list of new features that our community has requested that we feel would have a really positive impact on the game. In order to give us more time to work on these features, we'd like to pay our second artist for their time. I understand what it is to be an artist, especially one that works for free, and I want them to know their work is appreciated. \n I have heard overwhelming requests for this feature. Most of the people I have talked to want the ability to import their own models for tokens, tiles, objects, etc... This means I will need to write additional software to handle the importation of third party models and allow them to easily be included among the other assets within the game. It will require me to learn new libraries and integrate them seamlessly with the game. \n Now this is an awesome feature. Lets say your party goes off of your plot rails (which I know never happens), and all of the sudden your party finds itself in an unexplored cave, a backwater planet, or the castle dungeons for whatever reason. While Virtual Table Top is already quick and easy to use, how nice would it be to just apply a few settings and have the dungeon you need at your disposal, with little effort. This is by no means meant to replace the artistic finesse of building your own dungeon from scratch, but it could be a nice tool for GMs who's players constantly derail the plot, or for beginner GMs who aren't sure where to begin. \n Now, bear with me on this one, many of you have expressed your interest in stat tracking and character sheets. I want the game to remain as accessible as possible to all types of table top RPG gamers, but I know we have a few core groups that we are supporting who need to keep track of a significant amount of data. This is what I think the best possible solution is: A node based character sheet would allow Game Masters to design their own character sheets from scratch, with absolutely no coding involved. It would be a visual editor that allows them to create and hook up propertied for their characters using nodes that modify those values. They would also be able to share their character sheet templates on the Steam Workshop, which means the work for each game would only ever need to be done once.\nA mockup of the Character Sheet Designer\nWhat is Virtual Table Top?\nIn short, Virtual Table Top is a networked, interactive simulation of your game master's kitchen table (minus the stock pot full of mac-n-cheese).  It is a program designed to help your game master communicate visual information about your game's environment quickly and effortlessly.\nTraditionally, these kind of projects involve two-dimensional characters on a two-dimensional map.  This kind of interaction severely limits the type of information a GM can show to his players.  Virtual Table Top, on the other hand, helps your GM create a fully immersive, three-dimensional environment complete with lighting and sound.\nMost importantly, what sets Virtual Table Top apart from games like it in the past is the ability to quickly create your maps on the fly.  Virtual Table Top is a powerful suite of creative tools that lets you quickly and painlessly create sprawling, multi-layered maps.\nCreating dungeons is fast and easy!\nWhat Rule-sets will it work with?\nThe beauty of Virtual Table Top is it is not specific to any rule-set.  It is no different than playing at the kitchen table or your local comic book shop.  You pick up a token and move him where you want.  In that spirit, you can play with whatever rules you want to play with.  Anything from chess to your most complicated pen-and-paper rules!  And, while there is a standard size 1\" grid supplied by the art direction, you are by no means forced to stick to that grid.  A measuring tool will be provided to let you measure in whatever units work with your game.\nA planned science fiction tileset.\nFeatures\nPLAY\n\nCreative Tools  - The Game Master's Client of Virtual Table Top includes out-of-the-box tools that will make it quick and easy for you to create detailed, sprawling environments.  Creating a room is as simple as clicking and dragging the mouse.  You can then populate that room with all manner of objects and baddies. If you like the layout of that room and want to re-use it in another dungeon, you can create a prefab out of it and stamp it as many times as you like!\nCreate on the fly - We all have that player that likes to go WAY off the plot rails.  They may see solutions to problems that you've never considered.  In the past, and in other programs, if it wasn't already in your campaign, it was tedious and difficult to add.  Virtual Table Top allows you to create your dungeons while you are playing them! You don't need to create maps in third party programs and import them any more.  If you didn't plan for it, just make it up!\nConcept artwork for outdoor tilesets.\nWhat you see is what you get - Game Masters have the power to tell their story the way they want.  All of the information they need can be provided visually.  Boxes, barrels, chests full of gold... all you need to do is place it in the world and they can decide for themselves what things to pilfer!  Braziers and fireplaces emit light and crackle with sound.  You can also affect the overall lighting by changing the angle and intensity of the sunlight, or density and color of the fog.  You decide how you want your world to look and sound!\nCustom Tokens  - Its happened to all of us:  You rifle through your GM's bag of tokens trying to find one that fits the character you're playing, but if it has the right weapon, its the wrong race; if it has the right pose, its the wrong gender...  Well NO MORE!  Now you can create your token!  Pick the race and gender you want, choose from a long list of poses, and outfit your character with whatever weapons and clothing suit your character best.  You can finally find the perfect token!\nYou choose how you want your tokens to appear!\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE - There are still so many features that I am very excited about: Stealth, Fog of War/Line of Sight, Dice, Voice over IP, Pinging, Health bars, and status effects...  Some of these features are not implemented yet and some of them depend greatly on the financial success of this Kickstarter campaign.  So tell your friends, your GM's, and your players, and lets get this game finished!\nHow will the Kickstarter funds be used?\nMuch of the funding will go towards new hardware, and software licensing.  The base funding costs\nNew workstation to accommodate software requirements\nUnity Pro\nKickstarter Exclusive Dragon Token for our $250+ Backers!\nHow much will the game cost?\nI want the game to be reasonably priced.  The last thing that I want is for a Game Master to purchase the game and force their players to purchase an outrageously priced player client. If you want to host a campaign, you will need to own a copy of the Game Master's Client.  Players, however, will only need a copy of the Player Client, which will retail for significantly less.\nI will hammer out the details of what's included in the initial launch of the game for each client on a later date.  I plan for it to be enough for you to create most everything you need for standard campaigns in Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and Modern settings.  I plan to release more art packages as downloadable content as I create them (There will be no day one DLC, I promise!).\nHere is our Associate Producer with a friendly announcement.\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is only one person working on this game from a production standpoint.

I don't have an ETA on the release of more keys, it will just be whenever I feel like the game is up to snuff.\n\nI know this isn't the most inspiring update, but the truth is, being your own boss is hard.  Much harder than I ever thought it would be.  Especially for a project this long and this involved.  In the beginning, there were huge landmarks that showed that I was making progress, but now all of the gigantic things are behind me and it feels like I've just been inching along.  Its extremely frustrating to want to be finished with a project when you feel like you are making little to no progress.\n\nI think I'm going to continue my absence from social media for a while longer.  I just need to focus on the game, and the art and making those things good as opposed to worrying what everyone else thinks of it.  I'll make another post soon about some of the upcoming changes to the game.  I've made a few decisions regarding the direction of the game in my alone time, and I think its going to make for a better game in the end.\n\nAs usual, thanks for all the love and support."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "Still in discussions", "update_content": "I know I've been quiet for the last couple of weeks, its because I've been working on a few surprises for everyone.\nBETA BEGINS!!!11one\nAs of a couple of weeks ago we are officially in Beta.

After making really cool sculptures in ZBrush, the next phase is making the models game ready.  This can be a very tedious process.\n\nThe kinds of sculptures made in ZBrush usually are too high resolution to use directly in the game.  So my first step is getting the number of polygons down to a managable level.  This step is called retopology.  Zbrush includes some tools to help make the process easier, but they are often situational and don't always work out the way you want them, and for any model that has to bend and move, making functional joints is pivital (see what I did there?).  This usually means that I have to do a manual retopology.

Early Access will be PC/Mac only.\nFeatures:\nA vast, merciless, uncaring universe: It's filled with bloodthirsty fauna, enigmatic aliens and mysterious ancient artifacts, in a setting reminiscent of classic sci-fi games like Star Control II and Master of Orion.\nA motley crew with unique traits and talents: Recruit and train a crew of characters whose idiosyncrasies can mess with your plans, unlock story events, challenge your patience, or delight you with their special combat abilities.\nHard decisions and tough battles: Deep tactical combat for both fleet and ground combat means you'll need to use all your strategic thinking and your officers' special abilities to gain an advantage.\nExplore, expand, exploit and exterminate (sorta!): Inspired by classic strategy mechanics straight out of your favourite 4x games: rebuild your starbase, construct facilities, research tech, explore star systems, mine resources, build ships and fight to survive.\nEmergent storytelling: Tons and tons of storytelling embedded in the game system. Whether you want wacky, lighthearted events or intense life-or-death situations with high stakes, Halcyon 6 is going to have it all!\nBase Building: Spend resources to build station facilities (modules) to enhance your production and technological capabilities, or build ships to help you control more territory.\nExploration: Assign your fleets to other locations in the galaxy, where they can handle emerging enemy threats, do missions for alien factions or secure bonus resources.\nCrew Management: Assign crew to station facilities to greatly improve their output efficiency, or to ships where they can contribute in unique ways to combat, missions and events.\nCombat: Engage in tactical fleet or ground combat to resolve hostile events, create a foothold in the sector and ultimately defeat the enemy mothership!\nStory Events: Based on game criteria (station modules constructed, alien diplomacy scores, officer traits/skills, etc.), the game produces story events that lead to combat, bonuses/negatives, officer attribute changes or any number of crazy in-game scenarios.\nFULL RELEASE\nHalcyon 6 full release will be available for PC (Windows), Mac and Linux. The PC and Mac version will be released first with Linux following. We're aiming for a Steam release as well as DRM-free download.\nEARLY ACCESS\nEARLY ACCESS will be released on Steam only. Early Access will be available for PC initially and Mac will follow. Linux version will only be available at Full Release.\nDRM FREE Option\nWhen the FULL GAME releases, all backers will have the option to choose between a STEAM key or DRM-Free download. (EARLY ACCESS will be STEAM ONLY)\nOther Platforms\nWe are considering other platforms (Xbox One, PS4, PSVita, 3DS, iOS, Android) and some will appear as stretch goals depending on the success of this campaign and interest level. \nUnlimited Replayability: Each playthrough has players dealing with a new randomly generated derelict station, surrounding galaxy, crew recruits, and alien factions.\nMotley Crew: Each crew member has unlimited potential for acquiring unique behaviours, traits and abilities, for better or for worse. Making the best use of your dysfunctional crew will be one of the keys to success. Who should be your main Science Officer: the insomniac that works insane hours, but has an addictive personality or the agoraphobic mad genius?\nEncounters of the Weird Kind: There are currently five alien factions in Halcyon 6 and they are all quite different with varying objectives and personalities. Only your wit and your crew\u2019s skills will help you navigate the diplomatic waters to gain key allies and valuable trading partners.\n Others\nApart from the primary race factions, there will also be a collection of hostile units that are itching to tear your officers\u2019 faces off.\nWhether it\u2019s crazed ancient robots or mindless deep space fauna, there\u2019s going to be tons of terrifying monster encounters for the player to deal with.\n Why Are We Using Square Enix Collective?\nWhat\u2019s great about the Square Enix Collective program is that it gives indie developers like us a nice boost in marketing, something that is harder and harder to do as a small team these days.\nTo be clear, we\u2019re not getting any money from Square Enix. They are purely helping out on the marketing and PR side of things.\nThe only requirement was to have a game and a team that passed their Team Assessment review.\nThankfully both our game and team passed with flying colours.\nOllie Sykes from Square Enix said this about our team:\n\u201cMassive Damage are a smart and ambitious team with a proven track record not only in developing and delivering games, but in engaging with their community. With an engaging visual style and deep and rewarding gameplay, Halcyon 6 looks like it has all the ingredients to make a splash once released.\u201c\nIf you\u2019re interested, you can read the entirety of the Team Assessment report here.\nAll of us at Massive Damage would like to give a hearty THANK YOU to the Square Enix Collective team for running such an awesome program for indie game developers!\nThe Halcyon 6 team is made up of six seasoned game developers (plus one LA-based film composer) at Massive Damage, a Toronto based indie game studio. We started the studio 4 years ago with a hit location-based zombie MMORPG called Please Stay Calm and have released 4 more games since.\nMassive Damage's hit game, Please Stay Calm, was released to critical acclaim in 2011. Please Stay Calm has been downloaded over 2 million times and won the Editor's Choice award from 148apps.\nKen Seto\u2019s our fearless leader, and the CEO/Co-founder of Massive Damage. In the last 7 years, he's started 2 mobile companies, designed and launched over 5 apps and 7 games.\nPeter McLaren is the lead designer, producer and writer. Peter has done art direction, writing and design for over 4 games including Please Stay Calm.\nLucky Bremachandra is the lead developer, expert in all things Unity 3d. A veteran game developer who's worked at Koei and Gameloft, Lucky has led development on over 8 games.\nJeff Elliot is the chief technology officer, and assists with technological planning, problem solving, and a lot of game design. Jeff is an old school software engineer with decades of experience building large complex systems.\nLinda Tran is our UI Designer/Office Manager superstar. Part artist, part designer, part office Mom, all awesome. Linda has worked on over 7 games and led design on 3.\nJuan Carlos Solon is the lead artist and pixel master. You can see more of his beautiful artwork in these games: Zombie Puzzle Panic, Dragon Kingdoms and Please Stay Calm.\nSteve London is a successful film composer living in LA.\nAdd Ons!\nIf you want a couple of extra copies for friends that can't pledge, you can do so easily by following these instructions.\nDuring checkout, add the amounts manually to your total pledge. If you've already backed us, go to \"Manage Pledge\" and add the appropriate amount (or more) to your total. Be sure to keep your original pledge tier the same. \nAfter the Kickstarter is over, we will contact you and you can specify your desired add-ons based on the extra amount added. Extra copies of the game are treated the same as the Crewman tier.\nAdditional digital copy of the game: add $15 \nOriginal Halcyon 6 Soundtrack (download only): add $10\nEarly preview by Steve London: https://soundcloud.com/steve-london/sets/halcyon-6-game-music-ideas\nHalcyon 6 T-shirt: add $40 (worldwide shipping included)\nDesign an additional officer (similar to the 'Design A Character' pledge reward from the $99 Captain tier, but for those who wish to add a family member or friend to the game): add $75\nAdd your last name to the generic officer name generation tables (we'll have highly-randomized, generated officers to fill in the gaps between backer-designed officers. With this addition you'll have the ability to add yourself to their list of names, which means there would be a small chance that your name might appear in any given playthrough): add $10\nWhy We Need Your Help\nOur earlier success with Please Stay Calm really helped build up our company, giving us the opportunity to put together this unique, exciting game concept.\nBut we can't do it on our own. As you can probably tell from this campaign, we have HUGE plans for Halcyon 6, and the only way for us to get there is with YOUR HELP.\nThe core H6 team consists of six people, and we know we can make the main game with this team. However, with a larger group, we could start working on our big, ambitious stretch goals sooner, which would really kick the project into high gear.\nThank you again for your interest and your support. All of us at Massive Damage can't wait to collaborate with you on this one-of-a-kind project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeyond catastrophes on a global scale (\"the internet stops working forever\", \"the world is consumed by a black hole\" or \"zombies\"), our game is going to be made. \n\nThat being said, game development is hard, and unexpected setbacks can fall on your head at any minute. We've been in the business long enough to know that servers can fail, funds can fall short and 3rd party delivery mechanism changes can sideline the plans of tiny and huge developers alike.\n\nBut we're a dedicated, scrappy group. We work long hours, fueled by the passion we have for this project. We have multiple devs on staff who have spent their entire professional lives designing and implementing highly complex systems similar to the ones we're building for roster management and event generation. Our front-end team is hard at work, and our combat prototype is ahead of schedule.\n\nThank you again for your interest and your support.

We'll see you there!! \n*Allow us a few weeks to get it ready*\nNOTE TO FANS: This is a VERY EARLY demo of our prototype. Please overlook the 2D/3D inconsistencies, and missing animations for now. \nThe above video was filmed and edited by 2 Dark Dudes Productions. Performances were done by the talented Tonez the Prince (ToeJam) and the funky Greg Brown (Big Earl). Animation was done by the awesome James Farr. \nThe MP3 of the production is available here (right-click and \"Save As\").\nSo what\u2019s this all about? My name is Greg Johnson, and I am one of the two original creators and owners of the ToeJam & Earl property. I, along with some bright and talented friends, are finally going to make that ultimate ToeJam & Earl sequel that the fans have been asking for all these years.\nOur newer look based on fan input\nnotice the brighter pallet and the old-school shadows\nOh right, I almost forgot... and we'll have funky music, and more funky music, and... then we'll add in more funky music.\n                           Funky Bass by Cody Wright\nGame One Gameplay:  As you can see we're going with a game one rogue-like play style.  We'll have the stacked, randomly generated levels, and all the old Earthlings and presents, plus a pile of new ones.\nA New Look:  We're going for a retro vibe with this game. That's why it all looks like underground comics from the 90's. Neat, huh? That's all thanks to our awesome artist Nathan Shorts. .\n3D Terrain:  Don't worry we won't make you sick and confused with an over-the-shoulder POV camera like we had in game 3. Nevertheless, 3D terrain will let us do some really FUN stuff. We can zoom in to see characters better, or zoom way out to see the stacked levels.  You can now see the levels way below you, and when you fall, where you land on the level below makes sense. Also, we'll have hills!  So what?  I can answer that with 2 words... ROOOCKET SKAAAAATES!!. \nCareful in the dark!\n Game Two Elements : As we said, this is mostly like game one, but we'll be bringing back some of the things you've asked for from game 2. Things like the Jam Out, hidden presents, and buttons and coin meters. Maybe we'll even be able to bring back the Hyperfunk Zone!\nPlatforms:  Initially we are focusing all of our efforts on the PC (Windows, Mac, and Linux). We hope to eventually put this onto all platforms but this will, of course, depend on what funding arrangements we can line up and on meeting our stretch goals.\n4-Player Coop Play:  Toejam and Earl is a multi-player game at it's heart.  We're going to allow for 4 coop-players, and online play.  We will have split screen.\nMeta-Play: Unlike the original TJ&E game, we now have elements that carry over from game to game, and players can gradually build up as they play repeatedly.  We'll be introducing the idea of secret winged presents.  Find and catch these to introduce new presents into the game.  Collect hats that you keep from game to game, that boost your stats or give you abilities.  \nTHE STORY: ToeJam and his homeboy, Big Earl go out for another joyride in their RapMaster Rocketship, and this time Peabo and Lewanda and a few other friends come along.  Of course, TJ and Big E. have to take their friends to see Earth, where all the craziness started.  While in orbit around Earth, TJ can't resist showing off and pressing a mysterious new button on their ship called \"Black Hole - DO NOT PRESS!\"\nThe Earth now breaks apart in one of those Time-Warp-Black-Hole-Displacement thingies.  Who could have guessed, right?  Well, TJ,  Big Earl, and their playable-character-friends must once again put that darned ship back together. \n                  A strangely familiar bassline - by Cody Wright\n              ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a kick starter backer you probably already know that video game development entails some risk. Still, there are good risks, and not-so-good risks. This is one of the good ones. Here's why...\n\n1) I've (Greg) been making games as an independent developer for 34 years now (\"How is that possible when he looks so young,\" you say?) And I've run a studio for a few decades.\n\n2) I'm a big supporter of experimental games, but this isn't one of those games. There's a ton we want to get in, but it's pretty well understood territory. Also, I have a pretty good track record for being on time and on budget for my projects. (Check out the list of past games up above) \n\n3) I will be personally designing and managing this project and not doing any other projects.\n\n4) My plan for this project is to keep the team size as small as possible. This is really an indie project. More dollars will mean more time for us to add features and content, polish, and play test. Lots of pay-testing from an early date is the key to a truly fun game.\n\n5) I'm working with some great people, who are passionate about this, just like I am. TJ&E has always been a game of the heart for me. It holds a special place that no other game does. This particular game is sort of a love letter to the Fans.

Any remaining models will only be available at special events and conventions.\nEach of the superbly detailed boards provided was designed to immerse you totally in the game. (Each board will have multiple scenarios attached to it, so that you can forge any number of  adventures!).\nThe Inn for example, is an iconic location for any self-respecting adventurer, the one place where all it takes is one wayward comment to get fists flying. Bar stools, tables and benches add more tactical options to your fights.\nThe Pictish village is inspired by the Conan story \"Beyond the Black River\" depicting (ahem...) a confrontation between Conan and the savage Picts.\nThe pirate ship scenarios are inspired by Conan's days as a pirate, when he sailed with B\u00ealit, Queen of the Black Coast. Savage boardings, ruthless ship to ship combats and plunder are the order of the day!\nThe infamous fortress is where you will be under siege or, perhaps even more frightening, where you will have to face the terrible Thog, an ancient god linked to the nightmarish legend of Cthulhu. Coming soon...\nThe Barbarian of legend is the most powerful warrior in the Hyborian Age. As stretch goals are met, you will be able to choose between different versions of Conan, each with their own skills.\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron\nShevatas, King of thieves, makes a mockery of even the most complex locks; his feline agility allows him to evade the grasp of his foes without breaking step.\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon\nAs one of the few sorcerors that Conan trusts, Hadrathus' arcane power provides invaluable assistance to the group. His mystical shield makes him very resiliant, he can also magically shift from one place to another, and cause his enemies to burst into flames.\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron\nQueen of the Black Coast and captain of the infamous pirate ship Tigress, B\u00ealit is a charismatic leader who knows how to drive her crew (or any adventurer, such as her faithful warrior N'Gora) to victory.\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by Yannick Hennebo\nB\u00ealit's right-hand man N'Gora is a seasoned fighter, able to take the fight to the enemy (in close combat or at a distance); he is also very good at defending and protecting his allies.\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon\nShe may appear frail and weak but don't let this fool you. Zelata the witch uses her arsenal of magical potions as well as her giant lupine bodyguard to deadly effect!\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by Gr\u00e9gory Clavilier and Elfried Perochon\nConan's trusted companion, Valeria is a swordswoman without equal. While lacking Conan's raw power, she more than makes up for it in precision and efficiency!\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by Yannick Hennebo\nThe character sheets allow you to keep track of your heroes' most important resource: their stamina gems, as well as their abilities, strengths and weaknesses.\nFor each action attempted, you roll an amount of dice equal to the sum of the stamina gems you have invested in the action, plus any bonuses. Each character rolls a certain color of dice for different types of actions. There are 3 types of dice: Yellow is the weakest, you have less of a chance to hit and will obtain fewer successes. Red is the strongest dice whereas Orange is in between.\nThree kinds of engraved dice\nEach Hero begins an adventure with a certain amount of equipment cards: Weapons, Shields, Armour, Potions... This equipment gives you bonuses to your rolls or allows you to execute certain special actions. A weapon for example, will allow you to roll additional dice during an attack. A sorcerer hero will use Spell cards that give him special abilities, such as teleportation.\nThe majority of the players will control Conan and the other heroes, the player pitted against them is known as the Overlord. This player controls not one but multiple groups of models, both mindless henchmen, powerful villains and terrible monsters. The book of Skelos allows him to keep track of all these models as well as his own stamina gems and activation track.\nThe Book of Skelos\nA classical evil-doer, The Necromancer can revive and control the dead. He may seem frail but beware his nefarious aura, it has been the end of many an adventurer who has come too close and gazed into the eyes of death.\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by Elfried Perochon\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by Thomas David\nIllustration by Adrian Smith, sculpted by St\u00e9phane Nguyen\nDice Tower Preview:\n Undead Viking Review:\nGaming Rules: Conan by Paul Grogan:\nThe Rules:\nExample of a full game:\nBarry Doublet review:\nThe draft rulebook, as well as other elements including a P&P pack are available below. Please remember that these are ALPHA VERSIONS. \nHero Manual\nOverlord Manual\nSkill sheets\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nPrint & Play pack\nConan has been heavily tested, with over 500 people having participated in the playtesting. The rules were finalised at the last possible moment so as to incorporate as many suggestions and fine tunings as possible. Nevertheless, please note that this is still an Alpha version of the rules and may be subject to change.\nApart from being huge fans of Conan and Robert E. Howard, we have been working in the gaming industry for many years now. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Henry is the author behind some incredibly successful games such as The Adventurers, Timeline and The Builders. Erwan and Lo\u00efg Hasco\u00ebt are the founders of Bombyx, a respected publishing company with many great games in their catalogue such as Takenoko, The Builders and Abyss. Monolith was created so that we could make the game of our dreams: Conan. HeroQuest was a big part of our gaming culture as kids and we wanted to recreate the joy and immersion we felt for that game back then. So as to stay as true to Robert E. Howard as possible, we hired Patrice Louinet as a consultant, a world renowned expert on this author's works. This gives us a degree of authenticity that is almost unheard of in a product like this. Patrice has approved all the contents of the Barbarian and King box sets as well as most of the stretch goals. Please note that some KS exclusive add-ons to the game will take inspiration from a few non-canon areas which were only mentioned by Robert E. Howard but not fully developed. Patrice was not consulted about those and thus they don't have his approval seal. This being said, we have always kept the spirit of Howard's work in mind and worked under the strict supervision of Paradox Entertainment, owners of the Conan property.\nOn top of the people from Monolith, a huge team of passionate professionals have worked on Conan. Here\u2019s a complete list:\nGame Author: Fred Henry.\nArtwork: Adrian Smith, Brom, Paolo Parente, Kekai Kotaki, Xavier Collette, Naiade, Georges Cl4renko, Alex Tornberg, Per \u00d8. Haagensen, Fang Wangli.\nSculptors: St\u00e9phane Simon, Jacques-Alexandre Gillois, Thomas David, St\u00e9phane Nguyen, Yannick Hennebo, Arnaud Boudoiron, Gr\u00e9gory Clavillier, Elfried Perochon, Rafal Zelazo, Ga\u00ebl Goumon,  Viktor Dragosani, Gautier Giroud & Laslo Forgach.\nGraphic artist: Lo\u00efg Hasco\u00ebt.\nConsultant: Patrice Louinet.\nCommunity manager: Jamie Johnson.\nVideo trailer: Fabien Delarue.\nGame videos producer and presenter: Monsieur Phal\nGaming Rules: Conan: Paul Grogan\nScenario Designers: Antoine Bauza, Ludovic Maublanc, Croc, Bruno Cathala, Laurent Pouchain, Pascal Bernard, Adnane Badi, Jos\u00e9 Chaves, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Soffietti, Itai Perez, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Pinget, David Bertolo, Julian Lemonnier, Philippe Vill\u00e9.\nCommunication: L\u00e9onidas Vesperini\nArtistic director and project manager: Erwan Hasco\u00ebt.\nFrom left to right: St\u00e9phane Simon, Fred Henry, Adrian Smith, Jamie, Patrice Louinet, L\u00e9o Vesperini, Lo\u00efg Hasco\u00ebt, Georges Cl4arenko, St\u00e9phane Nguyen, Adnane Badie, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Pinget.\nConan has had a lot more money invested in it than the majority of board games. If we were to apply the margins of a classic development cycle, the cost of the box set and the stretch goals would be far too high, around $250. The process of desintermediation that is inherant to Kickstarter allows us to reduce this price down to something far more manageable and in line with other large board games. It also allows us to take the product directly to our target audience.\nShipping costs will be applied once the Kickstarter is over so as to allow us to calculate the exact costs when taking into account all the unlocked stretch goals and optional purchases. We have reached an agreement with Asmodee for deliveries in North America and Philibert for Europe.\nSince the project began, we have unlocked a phenomenal amount of Stretch Goals which do of course have an effect on the price of shipping.\nThe latest estimate for a King pledge with all the stretch goals is on average $22 for all American and European addresses.\nThe latest estimate for a King pledge with all stretch goals and all add-ons (including the 3 expansions boxes: Khitai, Stygia and Nordheim) is on average $34 for American addresses and $27 for European addresses.\nFor all other parts of the world, it is a lot harder for us to get a precise estimation as we do not have logistical hubs there. Therefore, please bear in mind that the figures below are deliberately overestimated in an attempt to prevent any last minute surprises, so they are more than likely to change!\n\u2022 South America : $80 \u2022 New Zealand : $90 \u2022 Australia : $80 \u2022 South Africa : $100 \u2022 Japan : $55 \u2022 China : $80 \u2022 Taiwan : $60\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. If we cannot guarantee that all backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, then we can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the Kickstarter one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time however, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.

We are familiar with the delays that can unexpectedly pop up, whether they be due to production, shipping or customs.\nThe estimated delivery date for Conan is October 2015, but please keep in mind that this is an informed guess. Also note that due to logistical restrictions in different regions, some backers may receive their pledge rewards before others. We will be doing our utmost to avoid these situations and, in the unlikely event that we are unable to deliver the game, we will be refunding pledges in full. Due to the fact that Conan is 80% complete as we head into this campaign, and that we have already signed agreements with many of those in charge of production, delivery and distribution, we have no reason to suspect that this eventuality will ever occur.\n\nRefund policy\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, charges included, no questions asked. After which, we will be unable to refund you the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Amazon (as we will not be refunded by them after this 60 day period). Once we have started to process and pack your order however (generally 4 to 6 weeks before the estimated delivery date), refunds will no longer be available. If any part of an order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the cost of this component, charges included.\nAny refunds requested during the original 60 day period can be sent via your credit card or Amazon payments account.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

Ensuring their survival will be no easy task, but each of them is critical to your success, and the more you challenge them the better they\u2019ll become.\nThe Ark 13 is the last ship to leave our besieged planet and you are at the helm. But before you set out, some decisions must be made: Which modules will you choose to take with you and who will manufacture them? What resources will fill your limited cargo holds and which crew members will you take under your wing?\nOnce in flight, your responsibilities as captain will push your limits: Monitor the condition of your crew, civilians and modules, ensure a steady flow of resources and navigate celestial bodies all while evading a pursuing enemy.\nFew composers are more clearly associated with the space genre in gaming than Jack Wall and we were thrilled when he showed interest in the project. His experience delivering a range of scores, from the dramatic space operas of Mass Effect to the Americana of Lost Planet 3, uniquely position him to create an immersive musical backdrop for Into the Stars. \nIncluding Jack's work in the game was one of our biggest motivations for creating this Kickstarter. If successful, he'll release a full OST, but you can help ensure you get a copy by pledging to the Soundtrack tier.\nIf you'd like a more focused listen to the track he created for the trailer, press Play below:\nSome might say that focusing on sound in the vacuum of space isn't a priority, but we and the experts at Hexany disagree. They'll be tailoring a custom audio suite for Into the Stars that matches our dynamic gameplay and varied environments.\nTo handle our Voiceover needs, they've enlisted the help of DB Cooper who has secured some amazing voice talent. More on that later...\nThough they have a wealth of experience in games, TV and film, the passion they showed for this project is what solidified their selection and we can't wait to share their vision with you!\nFor more on the \"Sound of Into the Stars\" check out our latest video:\nFugitive Games is comprised of crafty veterans on the run from traditional development at places like DICE, Capcom and SCEA so they can build games that focus on fun and community first.

This is our opportunity to build something special for you!\n(From left to right)\nBen Jones Development Director @Bagelbeard\nBen is guiding development of the game and making sure things stay on track. He previously worked as a Lead Designer for Battlefield Premium and had Senior / Lead roles on titles like Medal of Honor and MAG. Much of his time is spent dealing with contracts, lawyers and spreadsheets, which he strangely loves.\nAlden Filion Art Director AldenFilionCG.com\nAlden is the tour-de-force responsible for the amazing visuals in the game. Before he joined Fugitive he was the Art Director for Earth Defense Force and Eat Lead, an Associate Lead for Lost Planet and helped shape the visuals for Battlefied 4 Premium. When he\u2019s not making art, Alden spends his time corralling his dog Sasha, who is adorably insane.\nRoy Orr Creative Director @Roy_Orr\nRoy\u2019s deep knowledge of gamplay systems made him the obvious choice to handle creative direction for the game. Much of his perspective comes from the time he spent in Japan surviving earthquakes and working with Grasshopper Manufacture to build Shadows of the Damned. He\u2019s also cut his teeth on titles like The Bourne Conspiracy and Lost Planet, but one day hopes to leave development behind to scour the Earth for White Fudge Oreos.\nMarc Janas Project Architect  \nThough a designer by trade, Marc is leveraging a strong technical background to create the backbone of Into the Stars. Previously he served as the Lead Designer for Battlefield 4: Dragons Teeth and had Senior / Lead roles on the Medal of Honor and SOCOM franchises. Marc is fueled by the power of Monster energy drinks, allowing him to quickly tackle technical challenges and opponents in Madden.\nWe've come up with some fun and compelling rewards that we'll deliver right to your door when the time comes.

Then, name a planet for players to encounter on their journey. We find that being clothed is conducive to creating great ideas, so please try to wear some for the Hangout, Captain.\nBecome Legend: We\u2019ll work closely with you to create a unique encounter for players to discover at random. What shall we call this strange creature? What do they want and why are they so repulsive? Then, become a part of the Crew by having your name and portrait of choice (within reason) added to the manifest. Obviously everyone will pick you, right? You\u2019ll also be listed among the elite as an Admiral in the game credits.\nWe've been involved in the Kickstarter community for several years now, so when it became clear that we required additional funds to complete this project we knew just where to turn. The reality is that we simply can't provide the high level of polish, quality audio and compelling score this game demands with our existing resources.

Release date would be summer 2015 at the soonest, exact details will follow over the next few months.\nPresented in pixel art and set in a future post-apocalyptic setting, Convoy is a squad based tactical roguelike-like in its core. You travel with your combat vehicles and convoy across a wasteland to find parts needed to repair your broken spaceship. During your journey you will encounter strangers in randomized scenarios by picking up radio signals.\nDepending on the choices you make, signals can either lead to tactical combat, text based dialogue or chance based role-play. Whatever choice you make, you need to keep your convoy and its cargo safe from raiders, privateers and other enemies. Keep upgrading your vehicles, as death is permanent in Convoy. \nFeatures\nA new take on tactical combat: Combat plays out in real time as a high-speed car chase where you need to position your units and use abilities to maximise their effectiveness.\nExploration pays: You will encounter many different radio signals, each with a text based event. What doesn\u2019t kill you may reward you with loot.\nFully customizable units: Each unit can be upgraded and outfitted with different weapons and abilities, allowing you to customize them to your needs.\nA randomized planet: Each play-through features different main and side objectives, events, choices, and different consequences to your actions.\nA cold war turning hot: Three factions vie for control over the planet, your actions tip the scales of balance making you an enemy to everyone. As each faction grows in strength, you need to keep up.\nPermadeath at the core: Knowing one wrong move could lead to certain death puts you constantly on edge.\n\nThe Spaceship Mercury has suffered a critical failure to several crucial systems, forcing her to land on the nearest planet; Omek Prime. This is where your journey begins.\nSpaceship Mercury\nOmek Prime is an arid, scarcely inhabited fringe world controlled by three major factions, where the law is seemingly absent. It is a harsh place for anyone, especially off-worlders like yourself.\nYour ship has landed in the town of, Colonia where you hoped to find replacement parts for your ship. Though there are some mechanics and traders around, no one seems to have the parts in supply. They do know of some people who might be able to help you, but they all live out in the wasteland. You have no other choice but to unload your planetary vehicles and head into the desert, in search for the parts.\n\nIn Convoy, you take command of a convoy of combat vehicles and an MCV (Main Convoy Vehicle) with which you have to scour the world to find parts for your ship.\nYour MCV and units\nExplore\nOn your way to a camp...\nYou\u2019ll be given several contacts who\u2019ll be able to help you acquire the parts. These contacts are given to you at the start of the game, with an approximate location. It\u2019s up to you to find them, convince them to help you, and get the parts you came for.\nOn your way to the contacts, you\u2019ll encounter radio signals. These could be from a local town in need of help, other travellers, raiders waiting in ambush, etcetera.\nIt\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019ll deal with these, and how you deal with these. For example, there could be a stranded traveller with a broken vehicle. Will you help him fix it? Or will you shoot the man and take his items for your own? And what would be the consequences of such actions?\nDo you trust a hitchhiker?\nSome actions may lead to combat, others may give you side objectives. Side objectives can be completed for a reward. The risks may, or may not be worth it. Your choice.\nExperience\nAs you complete objectives and survive combat, you will receive loot. Loot can be either Fuel, Bolts or Equipment such as weapons.\nUpgrade your units\nFuel is needed to travel on the map. If you run out of fuel, all you can do is wait and hope someone comes by with whom you can trade.\nEvery unit has stats that can be upgraded with Bolts and customized with various Equipment. To repair, upgrade or customize a unit, you\u2019ll need to find a camp. Camps are scattered around the desert and usually also have a shop where may trade equipment and fuel.\nExplode\nUse your MCV\u2019s ability to gain an advantage in tactical combat and make sure you survive the enemy\u2019s hail of bullets! Destroy your enemies in combat, or die trying!\nSome of the weapons you'll find\nCheck out the video below to see a demonstration of combat:\nPLAY\n\nCombat plays out as a tactical high-speed car chase where you need to order your units to move, shoot and destroy the enemy. Most weapons need line of sight to shoot, so positioning your units is crucial. Units have Health and Armour, some weapons are more effective against Health, other are better versus Armour. Health can only be damaged when Armour is destroyed, and when Health reaches 0, the unit is killed.\nCombat can get quite hectic!\n\nYour MCV has several (upgradeable) abilities that can turn the tide in battle. Abilities currently in the game include a missile launcher that does damage over a large area, a mine thrower that flings mines, an EMP gun that disables an enemy and a repair drone that heals a friendly unit. Other abilities we want to add are a big laser beam that does damage to anything in its path, a drone that damages a target over time, and many more!\nCombat can get quite chaotic, especially as you progress further in the game. Fortunately, you can pause at any time to take a breather and issue new orders to your units.\nOmek Prime is controlled by three major factions. After years of open warfare, they've come to a fragile ceasefire. Though skirmishes occasionally still happen, the factions now mostly prey on the innocent.\nYour involvement however, might stir things up again as it doesn't take much for any one of the factions to break the status quo...\nRaiders\nRaiders drive in souped-up rustbuckets\nRaiders are a ruthless and bloodthirsty bunch. They delight in the suffering of others, often attacking travellers simply for the pleasure of combat.\nPrivateers\nPrivateers mostly use captured civillian equipment\nThe Privateers adhere to the old pirate code of those that sailed the seven seas on planet earth. They are obsessed by wealth and frequently try to bully travellers into handing over their valuables.\nT.O.R.V.A.K.\nTORVAK uses high-tech vehicles\nThe T.O.R.V.A.K. are a mysterious group that favour technology over sheer numbers. They seek technological advancement in everything they do, exterminating everything and everyone that stands in the way of their perceived best course of action.\nChances are, you\u2019ll die in your first run. When you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re dead. No quickload.\nEvery time you start a new run, you'll have a different experience. The objectives, map, events and enemies are all randomized, pulled from a large pool and adjusted to the player. In fact, chances are the same event plays out differently the next time you run into it!\nUnlocks\nSelect your units!\nNot only does the game play out differently each time, you can also adjust your play style. You can unlock new MCVs by defeating each faction\u2019s boss and new units through specific scenarios and achievements. These events may or may not actually appear in any particular run; to get that specific unit you may have to make a certain combination of choices.\nWe have several features on our wish list that we\u2019d really like to implement:\nEnvironmental hazards during combat: We\u2019d like to add more interesting environmental hazards you need to deal with. Things such as bridges and roadblocks forcing you in a tight formation, and cliffs and canyons forcing you to split up your convoy. Other hazards we are thinking about are things like dust storms reducing visibility or particularly bad terrain reducing manoeuvrability.\nRamming/Melee: This is something we experimented with in the past and didn\u2019t really pursue further. We\u2019d like to revisit this as we think any high-speed chase should have cars bumping into each other, with brutal melee weapons smashing up windshields and puncturing tires.\nIncreased interaction with the map: Tying together with the combat hazards; on the map we\u2019d like to show more features such as minefields and dust clouds, allowing you to have more control over where and how you fight. This would allow for different strategies when navigating the map.\nMore weapons, units, events, enemies and other content: More is better, right? We already have around 25 weapons and utilities, 15 units, over 100 events, and 10 enemies. We want these numbers to go up and have some really cool ideas. Fortunately, due to the modular structure of the game, most of these things are relatively easy to add. However, they still take time.\nUnique taunts for each unit: Currently there is one single audio file being played when you select/order any unit. We\u2019d really like to add some diversity as this greatly improves the atmosphere and gives each faction and unit a more unique feel. At the very least there should be a different sound for each action (select, move, target). Better would be a specific voice per faction, and even better would be a small set of unique taunts for every unit. This is a lot of audio production though, especially if we want each unit to have a unique voice.\nWhen we started the project about a year ago, we initially wanted to make a small roguelike-like which showcased our skills as a development team. We first worked part-time on the project, with \u201creal\u201d jobs and thesis work as our main focus. The project grew quickly and the response from people around us was much better than we expected. We decided to push our luck and we figured that this might actually be \u201cit\u201d. We submitted the game to Steam, and after some anxious waiting, we go the news it was accepted!\nNow we want to finish the game and get it released!\nWith your support, we will be able to add the final features and finishing touches to the game, polish the hell out of it, and make it the best it can be. We want to release the game in February 2015 for PC and Mac on Steam, and with your kind pledge, we can -and will- make this happen!\nFunds breakdown\nThe development team\nSander de Visser @p4p3rc1ip Facebook\nSander is the designer and takes care of the business part.

It's great fun exploring dungeons with friends or family, playing an engaging narrative and taking a welcome journey into a magical world of heroes and adventure!\nBut often, something ruins the immersive experience with these games. Its the one aspect which is always overlooked by game publishers. It's like its an afterthought with the big games companies, tacked on the end of a release with some cheap tokens or flimsy card terrain.\nReal Dungeon Scenery has been forgotten for long enough!\nIf you are the kind of gamer who wants an engaging and immersive environment when you play your favorite games. If you want detailed scenery and a wide range of characterful terrain for your heroes to interact with and explore. And if you want to really impress players, with a rich and visually impressive game. Then this Kickstarter, was made for you!\nWe aim to produce detailed scenery and characterful dungeon terrain for the gaming world. Based around an \"inch square\" system, the terrain is compatible with a whole array of boardgames and RPG games such as Dungeons and Dragons\u2122, Heroquest\u2122, Dwarven Forge Terrain\u2122 and essentially anything using 28mm-30mm scale character miniatures.\nCast in quality Resin for maximum detail. No odd materials, no \"restic\" - just RESIN, the tried and tested, gamer's material of choice for decades!\nWith this terrain, we offer you the tools to forge your own narratives. Create amazing furnished dungeon chambers, which will keep players engaged and always guessing what is in store, from one game to the next.\nThe Four Tiers of Core Pledge are \"Dungeon Critter\", \"Dungeon Dweller / Classic Dungeon Dweller\", \"Dungeon Keeper\" and \"Completionist\". Some come with GOLD which can be used to tailor your pledge, to get the exact pieces you want in your dungeon. GOLD can be used to pick from the list of scenery items displayed further below.\nThe Core Pledges are also eligible for FREE Stretch Goal Add-Ons, which will be added to them as they are unlocked.\n\nFor a useful fan-made pledge manager tool by Galious, see this link\n+++Pledge Calculator+++\nStretch Goals come in 5 types.\n4 Tiers of FREE stretch goal, along with \"pure Add-On\" items, which are more expensive to produce, which require GOLD to be used to add them to a pledge.\nThe lower pledge of \"Gold Bag\"  is not eligible for the free stretch goals.\n\nSHIPPING: Details about Shipping will be explained in another section.\nTo outline briefly; UK shipping is FREE. International shipping is charged on a price specific to each country, so that we can get you the fairest price.\nPledges can be tailored to suit your tastes, here is a catalog of all the currently available scenery pieces. Unlocked Stretch Goals will also be added to this catalog, as they become available.\nThe GOLD symbol above each piece shows how much GOLD is needed for each item.\nThe numbers after some names (ie: 3x1) show how many inch squares the piece will partially or wholly occupy.\nScenery with a \"?\" does not have a completed sculpt to display yet. We will replace these with finished sculpts as the Kickstarter progresses.\nSome scenery is displayed with concept art. Most of these will also be updated as the Kickstarter progresses.\n\nFOR LARGER IMAGES, CHECK OUT OUR WEBSITE'S TWISTING CATACOMBS GALLERY.\nIf you want to add any of the specific scenery pieces which are pictured above, to your pledge, they can be added using GOLD.\nGOLD is either part of your Core Pledge, or it is chosen as an Add-On. \nWhy are we not using real currency? Well, if you choose a larger gold add-on, it becomes better value to add the scenery you want.\n(Note ONLY for \"Gold Bag base pledge\": If adding this add-on to the \"Gold Bag\" base pledge, it will increase international shipping an additional +\u00a34)\n(Note ONLY for \"Gold Bag base pledge\": If adding this add-on to the \"Gold Bag\" base pledge, international shipping now follows the rate in the International Shipping Table)\n(Note ONLY for \"Gold Bag base pledge\": If adding this add-on to the \"Gold Bag\" base pledge, international shipping now follows the rate in the International Shipping Table)\n\"What's that paper you have there, pretty-boy?\" growled the gruff wandering trader, as the bard, Leodis, produced payment with a handful of Imperial Sovereign notes.\n\"Imperial Sovereigns, good sir..\" answered Leodis flatly.\n\"Impeweeal sovwins, good sir.\" mocked the old stocky trader, mimicking Leodis's words before he quickly snatched back the Health Potion and returned it to his sack. Leodis stood in confusion.\n\"Your fancy imperial sovereigns and overland money is worthless here in the dungeon, boy! Down here, you pay with GOLD!\" A fanatical grin spread across his scarred face. Then he sniffed twice, smelling.\n\"An' i dont smell any gold on you, boy. So you better go get some, alright? Coz it will cost you GOLD to buy things in the dungeon!\"\nFor this Kickstarter, we are aiming to do simple and regular stretch goals.\nThere are 5 types of Stretch Goal (4x Tiers and \"Add Ons\").\nBackers with a \"Dungeon Critter\" pledge receive FREE Tier 1 Stretch Goals.\nBackers with a \"Dungeon Dweller\" or a \"Classic Dungeon Dweller\" pledge receive FREE Tier 2 and Tier 1 Stretch Goals\nBackers with a \"Dungeon Keeper\" pledge receive FREE Tier 3, Tier 2 and Tier 1 Stretch Goals.\nBackers with a \"Completionist\" pledge receive FREE Tier 4, Tier 3, Tier 2 and Tier 1 Stretch Goals.\nAdd-On Tier 5 Stretch Goals are not free but can be added to a Pledge by using GOLD.\nWhat Stretch Goals have been added Free to my Core Pledge?\nIn addition to the awesome miniatures listed in the Core Pledge images above, all core tiers have free extras added, as the stretch goals are unlocked! You receive everything which is inside the column relating to your pledge.\n Recently Unlocked\nAll pledges come with free UK Shipping.\n \nInternational Shipping is added depending on your location.\nYou can check this table to see how much shipping is for your area. All prices are for a pledge weighing 2kg (4.5lbs) so that is a lot of resin terrain!\nThis Kickstarter is all about miniature creation, this is what we do. We design, prototype, mould and cast - in house. There is no complicated supply chain, there are no logistics delays and unexpected costs. Its just an easy matter of 1, 2 3 and it's ready for you to paint!\nWith this process, for all the scenery pieces offered here, we expect pledge fulfillment to be early March, and February for the Early Pledge Backers. \nOctober: Digital sculpting.\nNovember: Digital sculpts for core and stretch goals completed. All sculpts ready for production. Prototyping.\nDecember: All miniatures prototyped and initial moulds made. Casting begins.\nJanuary: More Casting! Churning out the awesome resin!\nFebruary: Casting for Early backers completed. Casting Continues.\nMarch: Casting continues. Initial batch of regular orders ships.\nApril: Casting is a labor intensive process. But all casting for all backers aim to be completed now.

The risks to this project are very minimal. We do this kind of model design, prototyping, mouldmaking and casting, every day. And have been doing so for 5 years, as a small company. \n\nNow, things are looking like it is time to expand. I have quit my full time day-job to run Zealot. And this is our chance to grow the range and put Zealot on the miniatures map!\n\nFor this project, the digital sculpting, 3d printing of prototypes and casting, all happens in-house. There are no delays or problems caused by outsourcing every stage to another company and trying to slot into their schedule. The only exception, is the production of the plastic dungeon floor and wall tiles (stretch goal), which will be outsourced to an experienced injection moulder.\n\nRisk#1: Resin speed of manufacture. \nResin is a labor intensive material to cast with. Casting 30 units or casting 3000 units, its the same amount of time and work to produce each unit. That's why we have staggered the release dates on some pledges (\"Early Pledges\"), to accommodate for this to some degree. \nIf the project is particularly successful, then this may overstretch our current capacity. In the event of this looking likely, we will expand production with new staff and equipment. \nIn the event of a extremely successful funding period, we can outsource any stage of production to our trusted long term business contacts. \n\nThat is about all the foreseen risks to this project. As mentioned before, this kind of miniature creation is what we have been doing for years. There is nothing out of the ordinary workflow.

Miniature Dungeon Scenery"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Your Board is not a tile system, it is set of tools to help you MAKE YOUR OWN TILE SYSTEM! With Your Board tools you can use polymer bake clays or air dry clays to make solid and inexpensive dungeons and sci-fi corridors that look like you paid ten times what it actually costs. The Your Board system has a couple of elements to it; modular moulds for making your floor tiles and walls, and moulds for making things like doors, objective markers, and traps. In addition it uses Base Texture stamps to easily add character to your tiles, yes this means if you own some of our original Base Textures you already have part of the system!  There is more detail on how each of these work further down in the description, we also are posting videos on our Youtube Channel.\nMany people have been asking us why they should choose Your Board over other gaming tile systems. So we put together brief comparison of what advantages Your Board offers over the three most common methods out there now.\nThere are two main objectives of this Kickstarter:\n1. The first is to get input from you! That was one of the best experiences about our Texture Stamp Kickstarter, was working with our backers to make sure the tools we were producing were what they really needed to create the way they wanted too. You will notice this part most often in the \u201cWe\u2019re listening\u201d section of nearly all of our updates.\n2. Improved production quality! Right now the tools that we are using to show you in the Kickstarter are all prototype and handmade moulds. While the tiles made from the prototypes still look good, we really want to take these to the next step like we did with the texture stamps. This is where we do a lot of 3D printing and other manufacturing things be able to make sure our moulds will lock together perfectly so parts you create will have as clean of a look as possible. Much of this work can be seen in the photos of our digital drafts. This is of course where the funding will go.\nAt the core of the system is our Tile Mould.  This mould essentially has two parts to it a 5\u201dX5\u201d gridded block mould (1\" grid) and a set of square plugs that lock into that grid.  Using the plugs you can turn the 5\u201dX5\u201d grid into almost any tile pattern mould you want.  After setting up your pattern, you can pack the mould with low temp bake clay (any that cures at under 400F or 204C) or air dry clay.  At this point you can take any texture stamp we make or even do your own sculpting to give your tiles some character.  Grooved guides along the side of your block mould give you an easy way to use a stick, tube, or ruler to press in a 1\u201d grid.  Cure your clay per its directions and then pop your new tile or tiles out of the mould, continue to use it over and over again.\nOur new Modular Mold Design will all you to easily produce tiles that will line up with each other and look professionally made.\n The next important part of the Your Board System is something many people are already familiar with, Base Texture Stamps! Our original product and the focus of last year\u2019s Kickstarter. Base texture stamps are the easiest way to add character to your tiles. As in the or video, after you pack and smooth your clay in the tile mould, simply stamp in the texture. You can use the guides along the edges of the tile mould to keep textures strait and line up your stamp edges. \n And of course the stamps are still great for making bases so you can create a unified look between your miniatures and Your Tile System! Please keep in mind that the Base Texture Stamps are made from urethane and not silicone meaning your Base Texture Stamp should not be put in the oven.\nDuring this Kickstarter each Location Kit will automatically come with a specific Base Texture Stamp, we will also produce some new stamps that are not part of a location kit. You can purchase extra Base Texture Stamps  by purchasing the Base Texture Stamp Add-on.  \nStamps that we produced outside of this Kickstarter, will not be available here during the funding period, for more detail on this and how we will be assisting those that want previous released stamps to ship with their Your Board Kit please see Update #2. \nHere is one an example of one of the original Base Texture stamps produced by last year's Kickstarter. You can click on the image to visit our store and see more of our textures.\nHere are the Stamps currently available for this Kickstarter.  The bases are 30mm and the textures come from the plate in the stamps' master moulds, so what you see is what you will have on your base or NOW on your gaming tile!  The lower part of the picture are the stamps from our previous Kickstarter that we have made available through our Stamp Add-on, we felt they go so well with the Tile mould we would add them to the list!\nThe Your Board system also has moulds for doors, objective markers, and other d\u00e9cor, allowing you to make complete dungeons or sci-fi corridors in an afternoon.  To get help you get a jump start we arrange these extra moulds into Location Kits. Each kit starts with one Base Texture Stamp (this is a 3\u201dX5\u201d urethane stamp like the ones already in our store), 1\u201d & 2\" Door moulds, a trap mould and an objective marker Mould. Each of the Locations below show you what the you will be able to create using the moulds (the actual moulds that you will be receiving are not pictured, as that is what this Kickstarter will be funding). Location Kit Guide: 1. The Texture pictured is 2\u201dX2\u201d gridded off in 1\u201d squares, stamped with the Base Texture Stamp included in the Location Kit. 2. 1\u201d Doors are 1\u201d wide and 1.75\u201d tall (total height) 3. Objective markers are on a 24mm circle allowing them to fit nicely on a couple different base styles if you want to mount them. 4. 2\u201d Doors are 2\u201d wide and 1.75\u201d tall (total height) 5. Traps will fit in a .75\u201dX.75\u201d (about 20mm) square \nWhile the location kits below show you what comes out of the mould your kit includes the actual mould itself as seen here, you would receive the purple part and with doors you will receive plastic the guide to line up your moulds.\nImportant! This Location kit will have vines added to it, per backer request.\nOur Wall moulds are also modular to allow you to make 1\u201d, 1.5\", 2\u201d, or 3\u201d long walls walls.  Like the Tile Mould you insert the plug for the size wall you want. You then add your clay, press it with a texture and let it cure.  Additionally the mould is designed with features to allow for you to easily assemble a full board, including 45 degree joints and a upper ridge to put tiles on if you want to create a multiple level dungeon.  Full sized wall moulds are 2\" inches high, Half wall moulds are 1\" high.  \nWall Moulds will help take your dungeon to the next level.\nHere is a digital example of what a wall will look like when it comes out of the mould.\n The relief in the digital is exaggerated a bit larger to make it easily seen, a real wall will have only a slight indentation so as not to offset the way tiles fit between walls and corners.\nDuring this Kickstarter we have planned quite a few stretch goals. When it comes to the end of the Kickstarter keep in mind that we cannot modify the \u201clisted pledge levels\u201d so you may have more coming to you than what is listed there. There are three types of Stretch Goals we will be doing, opening up a new location kit, producing a new Base texture stamp, or adding a new item to the Core Mould Set (Tile mould plugs, walls, stairs, etc.)\nMany times when we reach a stretch goal it will allow a larger number of choices for you.  If you want more there than your pledge level allows you can use the add-on section to purchase extra choices. \n Here are a few things you can add-on to your pledge, simply pick what you want total up the $ value and add that amount to your pledge, during the fulfillment part of the campaign you will get to officially pick what add-ons you would like.  You may pick an add-on more than once.  In order to select an add-on you need to have an initial pledge level of $10 or more.\nThe campaign has gone through a few changes and we wanted to make some graphics so everybody knows what we have added to their pledge levels.  Keep in mind these updates may have more  than what is listed under in the Kickstarter's original version (over at the side where it tells you how many backers we have), Kickstarter does not allow us to change that pledge text once we have even one backer at that level.  Also keep in mind we may add something right around the final minutes of funding that we cannot add to the graphics. Once funding closes we cannot change the front page at all.  When you get your backerkit you will get to make your choices and there may be more there that what you see here.\nHere is where we will post some extra demo videos. You can also see more on our website or Youtube channel as shown below.\nOur Website: www.happyseppuku.com \nOur Store: http://happyseppukumodelworks.bigcartel.com/\nOur first extra video is of us using our 1\" door mould prototype.  You can find this door in the Cave Location kit!\n We have had a few people ask about using the stamps for bases here are the videos we have up on YouTube for that:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe already have one successful (and on time) Kickstarter under our belt . There were a lot of lessons learned from that experience and we are going to bring that to this project to make sure timely delivery happens again. There are of course some things we must put out there that could delay us.\n1. Supply and outside vendor issues. The one that could put us back is a issues with the 3D printer, they could get backed up or something could come to us with a misprint that we need to get printed a second time. Normal turnaround from our printer is around 2 weeks, so if something goes wrong there we know what the impact will be when the problem pops up. \n2. Overwhelming success, we understand why this can be the most common reason for delays. We do almost all production in house, we can do a lot but we do have our limits. With this particular project an overwhelming success would mean us searching out someone to do production on some of parts such as the plugs, in order to meet the demand. We know some of what this entails but as we do not have a timeline on what that kind of setback would mean.\n3. Unexpected! As we mentions in the last Kickstarter there will always be something you cannot for see\u2026\u2026.So again we are not ruling out alien invasion.\nNo matter what we will always keep you updated when problems arise and will work with you to make this project to be successful.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "We're changing gaming AGAIN...and AGAIN...and AGAIN", "update_content": "Hello Team,  \nWe wanted you to know that Happy Seppuku is changing the way you game AGAIN!

It\u2019s time for us to make good on our promises. Star Traders 2 will be, at its core, an RPG and trading game set in a completely open, non-linear universe. We've mingled inspirations from genre-defining series like Firefly and Battlestar Galactica, books like Dune, and games like Mass Effect, Pirates! and Dwarf Fortress, but the heart of the project is inspired and driven by the original Star Traders RPG and our community's vision for ST 2. If you're new to the Star Traders world, we hope you'll join us as a backer and as a Captain. If you're already a Captain - here is the project for which you've been waiting, but we can't do it without you.\nFrom your bridge, command your hand-picked crew and fully customizable ship. Roam through a massive open-universe with complete freedom to choose how and when to approach your goals. Interact with hundreds of detailed characters with unique personalities, strengths and weaknesses.\nExplore a huge game universe with over one thousand years of rich lore developed from our Star Traders games. Experience the galaxy from whatever role you choose for your Captain and ship. You can be a pirate, trader, bounty hunter, mercenary, spy or any blend that suits your style. \nDevelop living relationships with the denizens of the quadrants you visit. Your choices will make friends and enemies among the Factions that hold power in space. \nAssemble and train your crew, developing them from lowly staff to bridge officers. Recruit and promote individual characters from the star systems and colonies you visit.\nExploit the economic and cultural diversity of the quadrants to gain the upper hand in trading, smuggling and political dealings. Discover new trade routes, smuggle rare goods or illicit cargo. \nExplore uncharted worlds, walk the halls of ancient palaces and lead your crew and officers on dangerous missions.\n  Star Traders 2 will let us explore Faction reputation at a personal level - through the members, leaders and enemies of each Faction. Get to know individual courtiers, merchants and soldiers. Build your own realistic network of contacts, allies and enemies.\nOur new Motivation Engine will let you uncover the humanity of your ship\u2019s crew, and you will get to know the officers and even the rank and file sailors. As the ship\u2019s master and commander, you\u2019ll depend on the crew as they\u2019ll depend on you. From our study of inspirational works like Firefly, Traveler and Battlestar Galactica, we clearly saw that the crew is where the drama and story begin -- ship morale in Star Traders 2 will be a function of both what the Captain does, and how he or she does it.\nWe have created 6 games and now we want to take our concepts to the next level. ST 2 will expand on the original in multiple dimensions by exploring both the big picture and little details. We want to make a game that truly focuses on the characters that make up the Star Traders universe and allow you to dig deeper than the broad backdrop of Factions and ships.\n\"When you play one of their fine video games you are involving yourself in an immersive experience and you know that you will begin to really care for the your characters and their storylines during the game as the gameplay takes you along at a brilliant pace...\" - Richard Prett, Game Freezer\n\"Long-time readers will recall my extended infatuation with Star Traders, the Trese Brothers\u2019 lo-fi 2D Elite-like game for iOS and Android.\" - Owen Faraday, PocketTactics\n\"Trese Brothers games are one of the few developers that will always get an instant-buy from me simply because I know that they stand behind their games and want to release the best game that they can.\" - Justin Jelinek, MoarGeek\nStar Traders 2 will be an immense RPG blending elements from our current titles and from classics like Pirates! and Mass Effect. Each major game system will include a purposeful mix of procedural content and custom designed elements. These will ensure that every game will be different -- different worlds, characters and choices await you and your crew. In the greater sandbox universe, the path you strike is entirely up to you. Every hyperwarp gate will uncover sprawling quadrants, new threats, and the lost secrets of the Star Traders and Templar Knights.\nThat is a central theme of Star Traders 2 -- worlds within worlds to discover and explore. The game will offer multi-layered gameplay with depth in each system:\nST 2 will be a turn-based, 2D game with multiple game-play perspectives following either your ship or Captain. The Deep Space View will track your ship as you travel between stars and planets. The Ground View will follow your Captain and crew as you deploy to the surface of planets to attempt missions, explore lost ruins, and visit the notable locations.\nEvery game\u2019s map will be different in this sandbox RPG. The net of hyperwarp gates and the Quadrant connections that they create will be procedurally generated, creating a new universe for every Captain. Individual quadrant maps will be created by backers and filled in from known Star Traders space. \nAs you create your Captain, you\u2019ll choose your personality traits, strengths and weaknesses. Much like a pen and paper RPG, every Captain will be assigned a personal story based on your choices and derived from his or her background, profession and Faction allegiance.\nYour Captain and crew are the heart of the story. Depending on the size of your ship, your crew may be a few veterans or a large body of men and women running different parts of your spacing vessel. Using our new Motivation Engine, each crew member will be a unique individual, procedurally generated with varied traits, goals and prejudices. As each crew member survives harrowing experiences and completes missions, they will gain experience and you\u2019ll learn more about their personality. When a crew member hits a certain threshold, you can choose to promote them to an officer and look to them as a leader of your crew. For these veterans, you'll take an active role spending their XP and allocating gear and weaponry.\nIf the heart of the ship is your crew then the muscle and bones are your Star Trader vessel. Your craft\u2019s hull design will determine its characteristics and limits, and allow you to slot components into its modular structure. You'll design your ship\u2019s upgrades and load out to fit the needs of your profession, type of work and your crew. While your Explorer Captain may install a research laboratory in the upper decks and park an Exo-Crawler in the cargo hold, a Military Captain will dedicate the upper decks to crew barracks and an advanced medical bay while loading up on torpedo bays and extra gunnery points.\nBattle will feature three tactical views, ranging from capital ship combat to hand to hand combat between crews. The Ship Combat View will include battles in deep space and within a planet\u2019s atmosphere. Take the bridge and issue orders to your crew and Officers to maximize your tactical advantage. Use your ship\u2019s unique design, firing arcs and defenses to crush your opponents. Pick from a wide array of weapons to develop your own style - some may favor smart weapons (mines, torpedos) while others rely on the brute strength (mass drivers, guns decks). The Boarding Combat View will cover battles inside ships and hostile orbital installations. Lead the boarding party directly and fight corridor to corridor to capture enemy ships. Equip your warriors with hundreds of weapons, armors and combat skills. Face unexpected dangers on hostile ships including hull damage, radiation and overwhelming aliens. The Ground Combat View will cover exploration and battles on the surface of planets. Lead your away team across varied terrain, through dangerous worlds, toxic environments, and against hostile ground forces. \nPolitics will be built on a base of individual characters and local conflicts. Everyone you meet - from the fence who buys your smuggled goods to the Prince who hands out your promotions - will be generated by the Motivation Engine with their own traits and goals. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to invest in - or destroy - your relationship with these different characters. Your Faction Reputation will be based on your Reputation with its influential members. Conflicts are localized - between Factions in a specific Quadrant - and led by individuals. A Thulun Prince is driving a wave of sanctions against the Javat mining worlds of the Delga Spiral. Your intervention could determine whether a settlement is negotiated or the trouble escalates to neighboring quadrants.\nIsolated for centuries, each Quadrant has evolved a unique manufacturing, agricultural and technological landscape. Hundreds of unique and rare trade goods will be categorized along the classic ST RPG lines for the economic simulation but with substantial improvements. These improvements will focus on driving a more sophisticated trading strategy allowing your Captain to capitalize on long distance trade routes, rare trade goods and realistic supply and demand.\nIn what now seems like ancient history, the Galactic Conflict pitted the Union of the Star Traders against the Planetary Guild in a desperate war for freedom from totalitarian rule. After the final defeat of the Guild Fleets and their Narvidian puppet-masters, the Star Traders fled the war-ravaged galactic core in the great Exodus. Protected by the Templar Knights and lead by the Prophet Shalun, the Star Traders set out to find new homes within the distant Farfallen Rim. In the century of travel and exploration that followed, many of the great hive ships were unable to keep pace, fell behind, and and were lost along the interstellar route. Incapable of reaching the promised destination, the commanders of each hive ship settled whatever worlds they could find and fought for their very survival. All the while the core of the colony hives and Templar battle fleet pressed on to Farfallen Rim.\nNow, after hundreds of years of isolation, the discovery of the hyperwarp gates have brought these empires in exile back into contact. Old tensions and distrust fan the flames of conflict and political rivalries make unification impossible. While the Factions vie for influence and control, the Star Trader Captains seek opportunities on the new shipping routes and in vast reaches of uncharted space.\nDuring the time of colonization and growth after the Exodus and the mysterious departure of the Prophet Shalun, the social order of the Union of Star Traders changed dramatically. \nThese changes include:\nA significant reduction in the numbers and power of the Templar Knights\nIncreasingly fanatical adherence to the Laws of Shalun\nFaction populations become increasingly planet-based and interstellar travel is reduced\nA concentration of control and ruling power within the Syndicates and Houses; increased violence among the Factions\nEach individual Quadrant settled and rebuilt their society with technological, ideological, and socio-political differences\n  Thanks to everyone who has helped share the project! What a success!\nWe believe that our design will create a well-balanced and almost indefinitely replayable experience. As we hit our stretch goals, we will add new features to deepen the game:\n\nAll rewards are KickStarter exclusive (except the game itself) - this is the only place to get the art book, T-shirt, digital rewards, alpha invite, and the opportunity to add your story to the universe.\n\n\n\n $15 - Digital Reward - Luck Boost + Wallpapers\nYou will gain access to an exclusive digital code that allows you to start new Captains with 2 Luck Boost cards.

As an indie studio, we are skilled at stretching limited funds to go far. We've self-funded 5 of our 6 games, using the revenues from our previous titles. For Heroes of Steel, we came to KickStarter to raise funds to help us level up our game engine. Try Heroes of Steel and you\u2019ll see we created an immense world and deeply tactical game on a very small budget.\nWe know that the $50K in funding that we are asking to raise for ST 2 will not cover the entire development cost of the game and fully intend to match the KickStarter funding with our own internal funding. \nThis KickStarter will let us make the next major leap in our game engine, instead of only taking another incremental step forward. The majority of the funds will be spent on our start-up salaries and bringing in subcontractors. We'll also funds on marketing professional video help, a full length soundtrack, SFX libraries, and art asset / model packs.\nThanks and Credits to ...\nStefan Imphenzia for the music\nSpace imagery courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe pre-production and design phase for Star Traders 2 has been underway since early 2014. We have come to KickStarter with a plan we believe is both realistic and achievable based on our wealth of experience with other projects. Our team has a combined 32 years of software development and 8 years of cross-platform game development. \n\nTrese Brothers games has successfully developed and released six games (Star Traders, Cyber Knights, Templar Assault, Age of Pirates, Heroes of Steel, Star Traders 4X Empires) to an increasing list of markets and platforms (starting with Android, to iOS devices, to PC and Mac on Desura and Steam). We are skilled at building games on skeleton budgets, using only self-funding, profits from other games and contracting work. We will work hard to stretch your money, ensuring that it is used in the most efficient way possible to reach the goals of the Star Traders 2 RPG project.\n\nPlease refer to the Budget section to read more about how we plan to match the KickStarter funds. Our matching approach has the advantage that if the project goes over-budget, we have the ability to continue to internally fund the additional development. We will not need to return to KickStarter, find an alternate funding source, nor abandon the project.\n\nFor the implementation, we will use C++ and the Cocos2d-X game engine from our latest two games: Heroes of Steel and Star Traders 4X Empires. This will allow us to use our existing components, processes and immediately deploy to the promised wide range of platforms. With such a solid foundation in place, our focus, energy and funds can be spent on exciting new development and assets for ST 2. \n\nIn early 2013, we ran a successful KickStarter for our fifth game, Heroes of Steel. The game was released in late 2013 (after a nine month production cycle) and we have been steadily completing rewards, stretch goals, and content addition throughout 2014. We have a plan in place to complete the remaining Heroes\u2019 rewards and stretch goals by the end of the year. \n\nWith experience, a proven track record of making strategy and RPG games, and a beautiful shared dream for ST 2, we can make this happen together.

There are many factors that can delay or even doom even the best intentioned of projects.\n\nThe d20Pro Team has always thought the bigger the challenge, the bigger the reward should be when you succeed. The d20Pro virtual tabletop celebrated its 10th birthday this year, a tribute to its longevity.\n\nTens of thousands of gamers around the world now enhance their games with d20Pro. And we have accomplished all this working part-time with the slimmest of budgets. We've done so because we love gaming and want to express that through enabling technology.\n\nd20Pro Unlimited will happen one way or another. It's only a matter of when. The more successful the Kickstarter is, the more features can be delivered in a short amount of time. Otherwise there will be other projects to help pay the bills, and that will slow down d20Pro development.\n\nSo although there are risks developing and successfully releasing software, the d20Pro Team members are devoted gamers with a large existing following.

All backers at Gate Master and higher levels will now receive all the free bonus pieces pictured below! (Backers who pledge $250 or more (not including extra shipping) will receive TWO of each piece pictured below.) See below for more details!\nAll these rewards will be added FREE to every Gate Master or higher pledge! Note: 28mm figure, \u00a9 Reaper, Inc., shown for scale only and is NOT included.\n  Welcome to Griffin Tamer Studio's inaugural Kickstarter Campaign! We will be producing a series of intricately sculpted dungeon entrances and fortress gates and accessories for 25/28mm gaming.\nGriffin Tamer Studio was founded at the start of 2014 by me - sculptor Elye Alexander - to fulfill a personal dream of a home business creating terrain and miniatures of the highest quality for gamers and collectors everywhere. A lifelong gamer and self-taught artist, I've been sculpting and casting miniature terrain for years to enhance the roleplaying adventures I run for friends and family. This campaign represents the formal launch of my new professional line of fantasy terrain. \nI've named it \"Enter the Dungeon\" because it features a series of entrances and gates, both small and massive, to provide  entryways and focal points for your 3D game scenarios. The models will be cast in durable polymer resin and perfectly scaled for compatibility with other 25mm/1\" grid terrain and modular dungeon systems. For those who prefer pre-finished pieces, there will also be a limited number available fully hand painted. Every piece will be personally created by me, from concept to finish, in my home workshop in Vermont, USA.\nHow It Works:\nThe initial offering consists of six finely sculpted fantasy entrances. Depending on level of support, backers will receive one or more of these. \nBecause we reached our first funding goal early on and have been steadily unlocking stretch goals every since,  I am now also able to offer a wide variety of additional pieces as add-ons, options, and free bonus rewards. Please have a look at all the options now available below!\nPledge Manager: Here is a helpful Google.doc pledge manager created by project backer Jchunick, which makes it easier to calculate pledges for all the different reward combinations:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FDo_00fgmviDi-8dGx8KFQaqZzK01xAEDxaEjMoZ5V8/edit?usp=sharing\nTo use the pledge manager, you will need to download a copy for your own use, as the original is non-editable. (If you have questions about the pledge manager, please contact Josh Chunick at:\n http://www.random-roll.com/contact/ \nAvailable Rewards:\n 1. Small Double Doors\nFor scenarios where you want a distinctive and memorable entryway, here is a set of three small but fully functional double doors, each with a unique style:\nSmall Double Doors - Exterior (Hand Painted). Left to right: Ornate Door, Lion Door, Rustic Door\nEach door sits on a 1\" x 4\" base and will fit perfectly into a standard modular dungeon layout based on a 1\" grid.\nSmall Double Doors. Top to bottom: Interior view (hand painted); Grey Resin version, with 28mm figure to show scale. Figure \u00a9 Reaper, Inc. present for scale only and is NOT included.\n  The double doors will come pre-assembled, and are available individually or as a set of three including one of each style. For purposes of backer's pledges, a set of three is equivalent to one of the larger gates.\n2. The Giant's Gate\nFor the times when the hero's path leads to a mighty edifice on a grander scale, there is the Giant's Gate.\nThe Giant's Gate (Hand Painted Version)\n This is a massive stone wall and arch containing two big iron-bound oaken doors, a perfect entrance to a giant's stronghold, a castle or fortified city. \nThe doors are fully operable and will swing wide with a simple push of your hand. The door opening, at over 3\" wide and tall, can accommodate large and even \"huge\" (3\" base) sized miniatures. The base of the piece is 6\" long and 2\" wide.\n  I have endeavored to make every piece as versatile as possible. The Giant's Gate is a modular design; the wall is removable from the base and the doors too are removable. This makes it possible to use the piece as a freestanding arch (with no doors), with or without the base -- to span a road or waterway, for example. \n 3. The Monster Gate\nWhat adventure is complete without a journey to an evil fortress? This piece is a weathered wall of stone, shaped by nature or perhaps dark magic, into the shape of a monstrous face. The craggy maw has been fitted with a fully functional drop-gate of black iron and hammered copper big enough for a mounted rider to pass through.\nThe Monster Gate (Hand Painted)\nInside, the upper part of the stone face has been chiseled away, and there is a large wooden platform where several guards and archers can keep watch. The platform is accessed by a ladder of timbers hammered into the stone; a crack in the rock face allows you to position a miniature as if climbing part way up the ladder. On the opposite side of the door a chain dangles from a hole in the stone-- perhaps to activate the gate's hidden mechanism, or perhaps simply for chaining up prisoners or an evil watchdog.\nThe Monster Gate. Clockwise from top: Interior view (hand painted); Grey Resin version, with 28mm figure to show scale; disassembled to show components (hand painted). Note: figure \u00a9 Reaper, Inc. only to show scale and is not included.\n The Monster Gate, too, is modular, consisting of three pieces: the wall, base, and gate. The wall stands up sturdily on its own, and the 4\" x 6\" base is a useful piece of terrain in its own right; the sockets where the wall fits can double as small pools in the stony floor. The stone face is almost 7\" tall. \n4. The Temple\nA site of dread, or a source of blessing and inspiration? This elaborate temple can be either! The intricate carvings on the pediment are different on each side. One face depicts a demon emerging from an underworld rift, flanked by a serpent and a hellhound...\nThe Temple - Evil Side (Hand Painted)\n ...While on the opposite side, there is an archer goddess and her griffin companion gazing from a windswept peak. By simply reversing the outer piece, the temple can instantly be converted from a den of evil to a noble sanctuary.\nThe Temple. Clockwise from top: Front view of \"Noble\" side of pediment (hand painted); Grey resin version, with 28mm figure to show scale; inner wall and roof structure (hand painted). Note: Figure \u00a9 Reaper, Inc. only to show scale and is not included.\nThe Temple, too, is modular, consisting of two parts, the (reversible) outer pediment and columns, and the inner wall and roof. Both parts stand securely on their own. The inner portion is decorated with labyrinthine designs, and can serve independently as the entrance to a maze, a primitive mansion or an ancient tomb.\nYour Choice\nAny or all of the above rewards can be chosen in any combination by those who back the project at the appropriate level. For example, if you want two copies of The Temple and one set of small double doors, simply pledge at the GATE MASTER - THREE LARGE GATES or DOOR SETS reward level. (Once our campaign is finished, we will send you a survey so you can tell us exactly what combination of gates you want.)\nEarly Bird Special!\nThe early bird gets... the wurm holes! As a special thanks for those who pledge early at the higher levels, I will include two bonus pieces: tunnel entrances created by subterranean creatures! \nWurm Holes (Hand Painted)\nThe first is a 2\" x 2\" stone floor tile with a hole (approx. 1\") gnawed through its center. This works great for scenarios that call for a monster's tunnel leading down through a stony floor. The second piece is a ring, roughly the same size, of earth and stone cast up by a monster's digging or sudden eruption from below. Place it around the hole in the floor tile for a \"freshly excavated\" look, or use it by itself (perhaps with a small piece of black paper beneath it) anywhere you want to create a tunnel entrance in looser soil. \n Want More?\nDo you need four Giant's Gates for the compass points of your walled city? A bunch of small doors for a city full of taverns, armories and wizards' mansions? Backers who pledge at the GATE MASTER and higher levels can freely add additional large gates, or sets of 3 small doors, to their rewards. Simply add $30 for each unpainted gate or door set, or $55 for each hand painted one, to your pledge level. (Canadian backers please add $5 USD/gate for shipping; other international backers please add $10 USD/gate.) For single small doors, add $10/each (unpainted) or $20/each (hand painted). (Canadian backers please add $5 USD shipping for up to 3 small doors, international backers please add $10 USD shipping for up to 3 small doors.) Once this Kickstarter campaign is finished you'll receive a survey in which you can let us know exactly which and how many of each you want. [Note: Kickstarter limits rewards to no more than 10 of any single item.]\nAdditional Rewards:\nThere are three kinds of additional rewards available beyond the base pledges:\n- Add-Ons: These are new sculpts that you will be able to add to your reward by increasing your pledge. For example, the entrance to a dwarven hold, or a set of translucent fire effects.\n- Options: These are alternatives you will be able to choose to customize your rewards.

This is a removable section of barred wall (like a prison cell wall) that fits within the small door arch. The barred barrier stands stably on its own, and can be used independently for other purposes - for example, to close off a 2\" wide corridor, which it will neatly fit within.

What does it hold in?\nThe Barred Barrier & Archway (Hand Painted)\n #19 UNLOCKED! $30,000 - Free Bonus - Weapon Rack! - All Gate Master and higher backers will now receive a free weapon rack.

Backers can now add a pack of 4 barred barrier walls (not including arched openings) by pledging an additional $15/pack (unpainted) or $30/pack (hand painted). Shipping included within the U.S. Canadian backers please add $5 shipping for up to 3 packs; international backers please add $10 shipping for up to 3 packs. These stand-alone pieces work great to block off 2\" corridors or to create prison cells and cages in your dungeon!\n#21 UNLOCKED! $33,000 - Operable Trap Doors: All backers now have the option of adding a pack of two operable trap doors to their rewards by pledging an additional $15/pack (unpainted) or $30/pack (hand painted).

The Ossuary/Dungeon Cell Wall is a removable, freestanding piece that fits within the small door arch. One side features a seated skeleton watching over a wall of interlaced skulls and bones; the other, a stone wall with hanging manacles and a low grate into depths unknown. Combined with the door arch, the piece can be used to create a secret entrance or exit to a catacomb-- or a macabre doorway into a hidden prison cell. Or, perhaps it's the cell wall at the back of a prison, and it's the bones of the former occupants that are concealed beyond. The wall piece also stands stably on its own, and can be used independently for other purposes - for example, to close off a 2\" wide corridor. (This piece will be interchangeable with the Barred Barrier and will use the same arched opening.) \nOssuary / Dungeon Cell Wall. Clockwise from top: Obverse (Ossuary) and Reverse (Dungeon Cell); Wall insert used as pivoting door; Dungeon Cell Wall. (All pieces Grey Resin.) Note: 28 mm figure \u00a9 Reaper, inc. shown for scale only and is not included.\n#24 UNLOCKED! - $39,000 - Free Bonus! Monster Pelt -All backers at Gate Master and higher levels will receive one free Monster Pelt. (Backers who pledge $250 or more (not including extra shipping) will receive TWO monster pelts.) A hunter's trophy, an orc's favorite decoration or an ogre's hearth rug, the slain beast will add a touch of bad-ass elegance to any dungeon chamber. And who knows what might be concealed beneath it?\nThe Monster Pelt\n#25 UNLOCKED! - $41,000 - Add-On Pack - \"Here Be Monsters\" - Backers can now add the \"Here Be Monsters\" pack to their rewards by adding $30 (unpainted) or $60 (hand painted) to their pledge. (Canadian backers please add $5 shipping, all other international backers please add $10 shipping.) Limit 1 Pack per Backer except for Gate Master and higher backers. This set includes a variety of detailed pieces to help give your dungeons and wild terrain that \"lived-in\" look: monster nests both large and small; monster eggs; monster dung; a lair or treasure cache entrance with separate secret door / boulder closure; and a wooden barricade such as goblins might create to block a passage way when preparing an ambush. Also included are the two \"wurm hole\" pieces last seen as early bird bonuses. \n\"Here Be Monsters\" (Grey Resin). Back row, L to R: large monster nest; monster dung; lair/cache w/ secret door. Front row, L to R: small monster nest; monster eggs; wurm castings; wurm hole; log barricade.

Shipping included within the U.S. (Canadian backers please add $5 shipping for up to 3 packs; international backers please add $10 shipping for up to 3 packs.) Further details to follow! \nSewer Grate Trap Doors (Hand Painted). Note: Add-on Pack will also include 1 x Broken Grate and 1 x Iron Trap Door (not pictured).\n#27 UNLOCKED!  $44,000 - Add-On / Option: Hand Painted Bonus Rewards! Due to many requests I have received for an option to have the free bonus pieces hand painted, I am now offering this as an add-on for backers at Elite Gate Captain or higher pledge levels who have selected only painted pieces for the rest of their rewards. (To insure that I do not exceed the time I will have available I cannot offer this option to those who have pledged for unpainted rewards. The only exception is the Fire Walls add-on pack, which is only available unpainted.) Add $40/set for each set you wish to have painted. (Note that this is not an additional set, it is just a paint job for bonus pieces you have already earned.) This price covers all bonus pieces revealed up to and including the monster pelt. \nHand Painted Bonus Pieces (Note: 28mm figure \u00a9 Reaper, Inc. shown for scale and is not included.)\n#28 UNLOCKED! $45,000 - Add-on / Option - Ice Gate: To celebrate the $45,000 (1500% funded!) milestone, I have released the final large gate for this set: the Ice Cave! All backers now have the option of choosing an Ice Cave as one (or more) of their large gates. Backers at Gate Master and higher levels may add additional Ice Caves for $30/each (translucent resin) or $55/each (hand painted). (Canadian backers add $5 shipping, all other international backers add $10.) Cast in translucent blue resin, this piece provides a great entrance into an ice cavern, a glacial tunnel or an elemental realm. Also included is a large multi-stalagmite piece that can fit into the cave entrance, closing it off with the look of an icy maw. The translucent stalagmites can also be used on their own for an icy accent elsewhere. \nThe Ice Cave & Stalagmite Insert (Translucent Resin). Note: This is a first cast / prototype; the final version will be lighter blue in color to more closely approximate the look of real ice.\n#29 UNLOCKED! $47,000 - Fire Walls Add-On Pack: Due to popular request, backers may now add a pack of 4 Fire Walls (the same piece that is in the Fire Effects set) for $18. (Canadian backers please add $5 for up to 3 sets, other international backers please add $10 shipping for up to 3 sets.) Limit one per backer except for Gate Master and higher backers.\n#30 UNLOCKED! $48,500 - Altar / Alcove Wall & Arch: Backers now have the option of choosing an Altar Alcove Wall and Arch instead of one or more of their Small Double Doors. The Altar / Alcove Wall is a removable, freestanding piece that fits within the small door arch. One side will feature a grim altar in a style compatible with that of the Ossuary and the Temple Gate; the other will have an alcove suitable for a statue or other decoration. The wall piece will also stands stably on its own. (This piece will be interchangeable with the Barred Barrier and will use the same arched opening.) Note: This piece is a work in progress; images will be available shortly.\n#31 UNLOCKED! $50,000 - Free Bonus - Fledgling Griffin! As a special thank you to all the fabulous backers who have helped the Griffin take wing, there will be one more free bonus piece: a Griffin Fledgling miniature! I am handling this differently than the other bonus pieces; I will be sending one (and only one) cast in grey resin to every backer from Door Warden on up. (Please note: unfortunately I cannot include this mini in the \"hand painted\" add-on, as he is rather more complex to paint and I simply would not have the time to do him right.) Thank you so much for making this campaign a resounding success! \nGriffin Fledgling\nThanks for Looking!\nThank you for taking the time to look over this Kickstarter campaign. If you like what you see, please consider backing this project, and please help spread the word. Together we will create a whole new line of fantasy terrain and provide years of enjoyment for gamers around the world!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI will be handling this entire project myself, in my home studio. This is generally a good thing: I will be able to personally insure the quality of every piece; there will be no risk of delayed overseas shipments or flawed pieces slipping through at a distant factory. And because I am operating on a smaller scale, the start up cost is also much smaller; no need for hugely expensive metal molds (as are required for large runs of injection molded plastics). This means we can cover production costs with a much lower initial goal, and more quickly start putting some of the profit back into great options and free stretch goals for you, the backers.\n\nMy supplier for resin is an industry leader and I'm 100% confident that a steady supply will be available. Likewise, the extra pressure chambers and compressors I'll be purchasing are readily available, and as I'm already familiar with the simple modifications I'll be making to them, I can quickly and easily integrate them with those I already have to ramp up my production.\n\nThe small business nature of this project does carry two particular risks. The first is the (hopefully small!) chance that something could happen to me-- a serious accident or other tragedy. I can assure you'll I'll be doing my utmost to avoid that! In the unlikely event that I am somehow incapacitated, my family and my fianc\u00e9e, all talented artists, and all enthusiastic supporters of this project, will I hope be able to fulfill my obligations.\n\nThe second risk is that the project might be too successful-- that there will be too many backers wanting too many cool dungeon gates for me to create them all in a timely fashion. But this is entirely avoidable. I have carefully calculated how quickly I can produce my sculptures, and I have set my initial pledge levels far below what is possible. I am holding some in reserve, and I will increase the available numbers of the more popular pledge levels once I see which those are, but in no case will I allow pledges to exceed what I am able to produce. \n\nOther, smaller unforeseen setbacks can, I am sure, be dealt with creatively without causing serious delays.\n\nA few more words about me: while this is my first professional project as a sculptor, I feel that my previous work experience has equipped me well to make this project a success. For well over a decade now, my professional life has been divided between two careers: that of a master carpenter and custom builder, and that of a freelance writer and editor. I am a meticulous craftsman with an eye for detail, and I know how to work to a deadline. I have handled many complex creative projects successfully in the past, from building high-end private homes to editing long manuscripts on tight timelines. Creating outstanding fantasy terrain is just one more exciting challenge.\n\nThis may be a new adventure but the team of heroes is assembled and the end of the quest is in sight.

We will be back!\nWith Event Horizon I wanted to create and capture the richness and depth of an expansive universe like Star Wars or Star Trek. I wanted bring the aspects of board gaming, and strategic miniatures together. I also wanted it to be fun as well as intuitive, to help bridge the gap between wargames and board games by providing a good intro for someone wanting to get into miniatures gaming. That not only involved doing a lot of research on cultures to develop the storyline and history, but also trying to realistically come up with an evolution of how the human race would change 3000 years from now. Then marry that story with a miniatures game that captured those feelings.\nEvent Horizon: Fleet Battles is a skirmish miniatures space combat wargame set in the year 5318. If you would like to support Event Horizon and can't back here on Kickstarter, you can back us on http://www.garage-gaming.com via PayPal. You'll receive the same rewards as Kickstarter backers, including Stretch Goals.\nEvent Horizon is an expansive sci-fi universe set in the future. It has been over 3000 years since Terra and the Sol system completely vanished without a trace, leaving humanity stranded in the Mobius system without a home. Before it disappeared, Terra wasn't much to look at due to years of pollution, caused by the decimation the Psionic Emergence left behind. Most of the privileged had already started to colonize Mars or expand to the Mobius system, but it didn't change the fact that Terra would always be 'home'. \nNo longer bound by one planet, humanity spread out amongst the stars to create multiple empires. Without having a home planet, the history of Terra slowly faded away, and it wasn't until long before the one common bond everyone shared started to vanish. Despite having access to the vast expanse of space and knowing the devastation of war, humanity had not learned its lesson. It just meant more planets to conquer or destroy. it would only be a matter of time before empires would start to clash with one another.\n\nHumanity had been easy to define because everyone was still 'human'. Even the psionics who emerged were human. But as some replaced their organs with cybernetics, or gene-spliced themselves with traits of another life-form, the definition of what it meant to be human began to blur. Under the name of survival, expansion, and even evolution, humanity went through changes depending on which empire they belonged too. Soon there were thousands of new colonies, all with their own ideals and beliefs. Some of the empires could no longer even be recognized as human, at least by visual appearances.\n\nThe galaxy is on the brink of an intergalactic war as you take command of a fleet of ships to defend your empire. Some will be fighting for personal belief and identity, while others just want to fight for sheer dominance of resources and control. What is it that you will fight for?\nWHAT IS EVENT HORIZON: FLEET BATTLES?\nEvent Horizon: Fleet Battles puts you in control of a fleet of starships comprised of high quality miniatures. It is designed to play on a 4'x6' - 6'x6' gaming area. The starships range from small destroyers to huge super-dreadnoughts packed with a vast arsenal of lasers, missiles, railguns, and squadrons of fighters. The standard game box includes everything you need to start a two player game.\n\nWe grew up watching cartoons and anime that depicted large scale spaceship battles. Some of our childhood favorites included Robotech, Star Blazers, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Galaxy Express 999 and Captain Harlock. Even though there are already a few spaceship games out there, none of them seemed to capture that feeling of watching a couple ships maneuver against a fleet. Although we do love playing them, we didn't want to control a small group of starfighters or ships that didn't give us the feeling that we were in space. We wanted the spaceship battles to be a bit more realistic, but without over complicating things. Ships move and generate momentum, and simply turning the direction of the ship doesn't mean the ship changes the direction it is traveling. The momentum will continue to carry a ship in the direction it was going unless new thrust is applied to change that direction. We also wanted ship sensors to play an important part, and not have the game simply be one player reacting to how another player moves.\n\nSince most of at Garage Gaming originally came from a TCG and board game background, it only seemed natural that we would develop a movement system utilizing cards. This let us create a movement system where each player could plan their moves quickly and intuitively. Each ship has their own set of movement cards. Players will need to set up their own movement while trying to predict how their opponent will be moving. Once completed, the cards would be placed on the ship status cards face down. When we move to the movement phase, movement happens all at once, so you don't have to sit and wait for a player to move their ships before you move yours.\n\nYou can simply fight head to head against other players or use our scenario encounters to add more complexity to the game. With scenarios, players would design their fleets then roll on the encounter table. This will help setup the atmosphere and background for which they are fighting. They might be an assassination where the objective is to take out a specific enemy ship or they could be fighting in a nebula that hinders laser weapons. But you won't know the specifics until after you've designed your fleet, so choose wisely.\n\nThere are different ship miniatures that represent the six strongest factions in the galaxy. Each miniature can be purchased individually. Each faction also has a Fleet Starter Pack that can be purchased that contains four of the ship miniatures. The base game contains everything two players would need to start playing.\n\nYou are commanding a group of some of the most advanced starships in the galaxy while serving in the military of one of the powerful six factions in the galaxy. Take control of destroyers, cruisers, battleships, dreadnoughts and fighters. You will be playing against another player in tactical and strategic furious ship-to-ship combat. Win by eliminating all your opponents ships or complete objectives in one of the predetermined missions. \nEvent Horizon: Fleet Battles set includes all the core components necessary for two players to get started as well as several missions offering different victory conditions.\n\nGame Setup\nThe game is playable on a table surface of 4\u2019 x 4\u2019, although we do recommend playing on a 4' x 6' or 6\u2019 x 6\u2019 gaming area. The players will determine the amount of Fleet Points to allocate for the encounter, usually this is 1000-2000 points depending on the length of play you want. A typical 1000-2000 point game will last 1-2 hours. You then choose the faction you will be playing and create your fleet based on the ship choices for that faction.\nYou will be placing hex shaped tokens that represent your ships' signatures, instead of placing the actual ship miniatures, within 4\u201d of the play area border they are entering from. Unless you are playing a scenario that alters the setup, then you would follow the guidelines as outlined by the scenario instead. In order to reveal the real ship, players can move within passive sensor range (which is 36\u201d) to identify the ship. They can also engage active sensors to attempt to identify the ship, but by activating active sensors they reveal their own ship as well.\n \nGame Phases\nThe game is played in a series of game turns, each turn consists of four phases; Planning, Movement, Firing and Resolution Phase. A player can do multiple actions within those phases, the type of actions they can take depend on the phase. All players will get a chance to plan, move and fire for all ships. Once all the players have completed all the phases the next turn will start.\n\nMovement Example\nYou create ship movement orders utilizing the movement deck for each ship. Each movement deck contains 24 cards that outline the various orders that can be issued to a ship. Your ships movement orders can contain one of each card up to the amount equal to the ships main engine rating. The other player will not know how you plan to move your ship or what movement orders you will assign to it until it comes time to actually move the ships.\n\nExample: Player A controls a ship with 6 thrust. Player A can issue orders by selecting 6 cards or less. You would do this for each of the ships under your command, depending on the amount of thrust of each. Using the diagram below as an example, Player A decides to only issue 3 orders: Main Thrust, Turn Port 30\u00b0 (turn left), Main Thrust.\n\nWhen it is time to execute the ship movement during the Movement Phase, each ship before revealing their movement orders will first move the current momentum it has already built up. Currently, it is at a momentum of 2. So it will move 2\" in the direction of their momentum heading.\nWe will then use the movement cards, which you already queued up during the Planning Phase, to continue moving the ship. \nExample: Player A will now flip the movement cards over revealing the movement orders. Starting with Main Thrust which tells us to move that ship another 1\" forward. Then we reveal Turn Port 30\u00b0 which tells us to pivot that ship to the left by 30\u00b0. The last card is Main Thrust 1 which moved us another 1\" forward. You will notice we move forward towards the direction that the ship is facing.  \nTo finish the turn, we need to determine our ending momentum. We would then measure from the start momentum counter to where the new momentum counter goes.\nExample: In this case it is 3\". During the next turn in Phase 2, when it is time to move our ships again, this ship's momentum will move it 3\" towards the direction that the momentum counter counter is facing. That would happen before you reveal and apply the orders for the ship's next moves.\nFree shipping for the US, CA, UK & DE; See Calculating Postage for shipping costs to other locations.\nAs with all Pledge Levels, if you want to add any Add-ons increase your pledge by the appropriate amount.\nOur Thanks.

The base game has been created and gone through a gauntlet of testing. The modeling and writing is finished, they are just going through some final steps to add polish and details. Until we send everything to the printers we will still be testing and refining the rules. \n\nThe two biggest challenges as with most Kickstarters usually revolve around production and shipping. If production is delayed then as a fallout items tend to ship out late. When dealing with oversea contractors production can happen on time but due to customs or shipping to the US, this delays final shipping to customers. \n\nThis is our first Kickstarter campaign so we are new to this but we are not new to Kickstarter. We have also done our homework. We have had brilliant advice from people who have done multiple and successful campaigns. We have tried to anticipate any problems and have done our utmost to ensure that it all runs as smoothly as possible. We have already lined our up manufacturers and they are prepared to move forward once we give them the word. We could of probably done things cheaper if we focused on outsourcing to overseas but we kept most manufacturing locally. This means it is more work for us but we wanted more control and to be more involved in the process. We also wanted to limit delays in both production and shipping. By making almost every part of this game locally we have a greater control over issues and have the ability to make adjustments quicker where needed.\n\nWe want to ensure that we deliver a high quality product to our backers. Until final production we will always be tweaking and fine tuning the product so it may vary slightly from our prototypes in look and quantity. We are pushing the manufacturing process to its limits and there may be some components that need adjustment and certain quantities may need to be re-assessed if there are problems at the manufacturing stage.\n\nWe are as ready as we can be for this and we need your help to get us started. If we get stuck we will work through it to deliver you the best product possible, not a half baked compromise.

Your ship\u2019s physics will react to those choices!\n \n\nFunction Samples\n\u25cf Weapons: There are numerous types of weapons to equip your ship with:\nOffensive: plasma lasers, laser beams, rockets, multi-directional explosives, anti-matter charges, fusion sticky bombs, mines\u2026\nDefensive: decoys, baits, cloaking devices, electromagnetic-charges, time-bender...\n\u25cf Engines: Engines affect your movements and speed and allow you to perform tricky maneuvers, crucial against an overpowered enemy or an asteroid field! \nWith special engines, you can reach the speed of light. \n\u25cf Shields: Shields will cover specific areas of your ship; choose wisely which area to protect to ensure the safety of your ship\u2019s vital functions and crew. \n \u25cf Sensors: Sensors will provide you information about the enemy and other important aspects such as distance, level, type etc. They can be used to make navigation easier and also help you strategize for difficult battles. \n \n\nShip Design\nInternal\n\u25cfMonitors: Pay close attention to your monitors. Most of the information you will need is not represented through the classic interface but through a Diegetic interface. \nThis means that all your required info will be displayed on different monitors and screens of your spaceship.\n\u25cfEngineering room: This room allows the engines and shields to function properly, and thus protects your ship. Adding more engineering rooms will boost their efficiency.\n\u25cfArtificial intelligence room: This room controls the support functions of the ship, and provides feedbacks such as: O\u00b2 level, fire alert, enemy alert, door status\u2026\n\u25cfMedic systems: Used to heal your crew from space related ailments. Further on, you will even be able to upgrade them with some cyber-implants while recovering .\n\u25cfPrison:  Captured a political prisoner? Keep them here and trade them for some much needed supplies or even information.\n\u25cfCargo hold: The place to keep your contraband goods. Cargo can also be used to store scout ships.\n\u25cfCockpit: Also known as the control room. It is the heart of the spaceship, so always keep it safe!\n\u25cfResearch labs: Those little guns you start with aren'tgoing to cut it for long. Come here to upgrade and research new weapons.\n\u25cfDocking ports: Allow you to dock and board the enemies\u2019 ships.\n \nSpaceship vs. Spaceship\nThe combat phases will take two forms: Spaceship VS. Spaceship, and Crew VS. Crew, but keep in mind that whatever happens to your ship will also affect your crew inside.\nPLAY\n\n\u25cfDefine your strategy according to your enemy\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\n\u25cfUse your weapons to destroy the enemy\u2019s vital functions and open a breach.\n\u25cfDestroy their weapons or jam their sensors\u2026\n\u25cfDestroy their engines to incapacitate their movements.\n\u25cfManeuver to avoid taking damages, or to choose the impact area.\n\u25cfCreate hull breaches to slowly drain their oxygen levels.\n\u25cfBoard the enemy ship and launch your looting operation. It\u2019s time to scavenge some goods.\n \n\n\nCrew vs. Crew\nIn the wild space, everyone does their best to survive: some use diplomacy, others prefer less shady methods such as theft, but most of them will find a far greater interest in fighting. Their purpose?\nSteal equipment and enslave crew.\nTo bring your battle to a successful conclusion, you will need a clear understanding of your opponents\u2019 capabilities, and of course know the strengths and weaknesses of your crew like no other. \nEach member of your crew can be assigned to a specific task or position. Like in a classic RTS game.\nThe battle crew's role is to protect the ship from invasions, as well as invade the enemies\u2019 ship in return.\nYou must take their races into consideration: equip your melee fighters with close range weapons and your gunners with long range weapons.\nReal time tactical pause : To facilitate your management and tactical decisions, an active pause will help you to assign your orders.\n\nTactical\nBattles and training increase the level of experience of your crew.\nThe captain is the most valuable element of your crew, protect him at any cost. There is no hope for a crew without a true leader, strength and honor is the path chosen by the greatest captains of the galaxy.\nAssign your crew members to different rooms of your ship: each crew member working on a system increases the power of its functions.\nManage your units with efficiency and relevance:  \n\u25cf Place a core blaster team to control the important hubs.\n\u25cf Lead your close combat unit to their target avoiding the blaster fight areas\n\u25cf Protect the important rooms, cargo, prisoners and captain.\n\u25cf Use your race\u2019s special abilities to overcome the enemy\u2019s weaknesses.\n\u25cf Use the environment to keep your crew out of the line of fire.\n\u25cf Find the captain. Then kill him or force his surrender to win the battle.\nEquipment is an important part of the smugglers' treasure hoard, and nothing is more reliable than the blasters on your ship\u2026 \nDuring your journey you will discover countless weapons, through trading, looting, or simply as a reward. \nBe strategic; equip your crew members in accordance with their race or specialization to improve their capabilities and chances of survival. \n \nBIO-DIVERSITY\nThe galaxy is vast and surprisingly full of life!\nDuring your journey, you will encounter many species...\n\nWill they become trusted allies to trade with?\nWill they be deadly rivals to battle or enslave?\nWill they join your crew as friends, or as slaves?\n\n \nSoundtrack\nIn space, the sound of nothingness can drive you crazy\u2026 and music will be more than an appreciated friend, whether during your lonely travels or enduring the vivid battles. Thus, our intentions are to provide various soundscapes throughout the adventure. \nFaithfull to its \u201cretro-futurism\u201d direction, the game will therefore allow you  to enjoy classical music compositions as well as modern rhythms, and even experimental ones. \nWhile the music of the trailer is signed by Dynatron, our goal for the entire game is to offer an eclectic OST, influenced by a diversity of artists with strong identities, strengthening thereby the dramatic intensity.\n \nReward Samples\n\n \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs in many video games, there is no challenge without risk, nor risk without challenge.\n\nOur goal with Galactic Princess is to offer the deepest experience possible: give the players a great creative freedom and allow them to experiment and discover new ways to play.\nThe relative challenge will be to offer a coherent feeling between experimentation of the sandbox aspect of the game and the narrative situations that player will encounter.\n\nWe are confident about the attractiveness of the gameplay mechanics, but in order to make the game even more interesting, we will need to produce a lot of content: more weapons, more characters, more unexpected situations, more music, more, more, always more!

Travel to strange alien worlds, meet interesting and unique life forms and then if you want... shoot them? In Tiny Trek you will be able to do exactly that. You see, probably like me, you have yet to find a space based game that gives you gameplay that emulates the great Science Fiction TV shows we all love. And thus that is what I set out to do with my latest game project, Tiny Trek.\n     Tiny Trek's mission is to provide you with the exact same experience as those favorite adventures we watched on TV, allowing you to sit in the Captain's chair and make those critical and dramatic decisions. From diplomacy, exploration and resource management to epic space battles and exploring alien worlds.\nAre you ready to sit in the Captain\u2019s Chair?\n     From the creators of Vincere Totus Astrum comes for a universe of exploration and adventure. As the Captain of your own Starship begin your trek of literally endless worlds by first selecting your randomly generated race and ship, then set out for the stars.\n     Encounter alien races and exotic locations as you travel in an endlessly procedurally generated galaxy. No two game are the same. As you explore, randomly generated \u201cEpisodes\u201d will have you fighting hostile ships, helping aliens and exploring the surface of new planets.\n     How long can you survive the deep of space? How far can you travel? Who knows what is waiting for you! Your trek begins now!\nSetting out to the stars!\n     The game starts with players selecting a Home Star from the intro screen galaxy view. From there you zoom into your new system and select a homeworld. The type of the star and the kind of planet you select orbiting it determines some of the base stats of your race. A low gravity cool and wet world tends to produce sentient species that are more docile in nature, where as more hostile environments lead to more aggressive races. These differences help decide how battle-hardened they are or how adept at science they may be etc. From these base stats a player then sets out to determine the look of their race through a set of procedurally generated tools and what kind of society they come from. All of your decisions up to this point help affect what your ship will turn out like. Using procedural generation the game creates unique ship designs which you can edit. Design choices affect a ship's capabilities and stats. Once you're done, it's time to set out amongst the stars.\n     Tiny Trek is designed to be endless... Well, endless if you are a good Starship Captain, that is. Players could select one direction and keep on going, if they choose to do so. The way you lose, of course, is getting killed or running out of resources. As you travel, make sure to orbit some stars and collect fuel. Damaged and need repairs? Visit a planet rich in minerals and mine for them, or trade with a local spacefarer.\n     Exploration in itself is fun, but throughout your star hopping you will encounter randomly activated \"Episode triggers\". The triggers are the starting point for an adventure that is created procedurally from the Mission Matrix. For instance, you may locate a plasma trail during interstellar travel. The bridge crew would then ask you if you would like to investigate. If you choose yes, then the game may take you to a ship in distress in an asteroid field, or one that is under attack or has crashed on a planet. From there, your choices affect the rest of the episode. Attacking the damaged vessel will mark you an enemy of that race whereas tractoring them out makes them a friend.\n     And I think that is the cool thing about Tiny Trek. It is a game that is procedurally generated and thus your actions perpetuate the game world. For instance, that race whose ship you helped repair after they were marooned on Planet X sent word to their homeworld about your heroics. And so, when you are attacked by a hostile race later in the game, they may be flying by and lend a hand (thanks to the randomly generated \"Episodes\"). The current engine design supports over a hundred different episode combinations, and with your help we hope to make that number much larger.\n-Galaxy is big: And when I say big I mean really big like a never ending Galaxy with stars, planets, nebula and other space phenomenon.\n\n-Do you have that ship in a different color? Yes we can do that with our procedural generation algorithms.  Everything from the planets and stars to ships and races is created on the fly. And then to take it step further we provide you tools to edit your Ship and your race.\n\n- Lets fire blue particle cannons full... Engage in battles of one on up to three enemy vessels. Cool thing is with the Mission Matrix, a ship might jump out of battle and you may get the option to chase them, once you catch up you may finish them off or two of his friends might be waiting for you.\n\n--You think they have apples on an alien planet? I don't know if apples will be there, but the idea is that you can explore endless alien worlds and conduct various away missions. Planets will contain unique items that your science officer can scan, and your engineer can collect to bring back to the ship for trade.\n\n-Making Friends will be important: Talk, trade and assisting other spacefarers will benefit you as each race you encounter will store an enemy, neutral or friend status. That will effect how your next encounter with them will be.\n\n-Episodes for everyone! In Tiny Trek we have worked on creating a generator that creates randomized missions or as we call it, episodes. Each episode last around 3-8 minutes on average and include everything from search and rescue, transport, battles and more. Imagine receiving a distress signal, then approaching a ship to discover it's a trap. After defeating them and searching the ship discover that the stranded crew is on a nearby planet. The unique Mission Matrix generates over a 100 different \"episode\" types and puts them together.\n-Stuff is cool... Player will be able to collect and store unique plants, materials and relics you discover on your journey. And trade them for other resources or information.\nWhy do we need Captains like you?\n     Tiny Trek has come a long way in it's one year of being developed.  We need your help to get it finished. Tiny Trek will require a lot of polishing and testing as we enter the final development phase. In order to achieve that we need few things outside of the \"hard work and sweat\" stuff used to build it to this point. The funds raised will be used exclusively to finish out the game and get it to market. The funds would go to the following areas.\nAdditional Programming Staff: To full implement the vision of Tiny Trek I am going to need some additional code warriors to help me complete the game in a timely manner. I could continue to work on it by myself, But this would stretch out the release time. With the additional programming muscle I will be able to assure that Tiny Trek will be released with all the intended features and functions we all want, and what you deserve as the player. Areas in programming that will benefit from more coders involve the random sound engine, piecing together all the various episode functions and porting to all the aforementioned target platforms.\nMusic: Vincent Beers a outstanding chiptuneist has provided us two amazing 8 bit tracks for the game so far, To create a truly submersive experience more music compositions are called for to create the right mood in key areas of Tiny Trek. Portions of the raised funds will go to the creation of these musical pieces. \nOperational Costs: Being Indie is a tough business, involving lots of cheap ramen noodles and store brand sodas. However some of the costs of game development can't be deferred by time and effort. Fees, taxes and other associated business end costs are tough for a indie to produce, I am hoping with your help that these costs wont kill Tiny Trek.\nStretch Goals\n     If we are lucky enough to extend the campaign beyond the funding goal we do have some additional goals in mind that would build a lot more fun into the game.\nACHIEVED! $6,000.00 Raised - Robust Editing Tools: If we can hit this mark we can afford to spend the extra time developing more editor tools for the player, providing more customization to you. More editing tools for your ships and races, more color options, and the ability to edit your home world. At this amount we would also provide procedurally generated weapon systems that you can edit.\nACHIEVED! $8,000.00 Raised - Server based content sharing: If we can raise up to this amount we will be able to hire the database programmer to assist in creating a option where a player could share their games content with another player, and the new player would be able to see that content in their game. Player could share their ship, race or items they encountered in their current play.\n$10,000.00 Raised - Mega Melee modes: If we can reach the $10,000 dollar mark we will be able to expand the Melee combat mode we have planned out. We will be able to include the ability to create team battles where you construct teams out of your save files and download NPCs from the server. Then battle one ship at a time against another team. Another mode would be endless mode, where you ship of choice has to survive against a never ending onslaught of Saved NPCs and generated enemies. The third battle mode would allow you to combat against two enemy vessels and you have a friendly NPC to assist you, two on two. The fourth mode would involve a endless round of battles, where each battle is timed. Each victory adds more time to the clock, the faster you can defeat them the more time added to the clock.\nAddons\nAddition Copies for any platform - $5.00: You can add as many additional copies as you would like for 5.00 each, and can for any platform you select for each copy. This includes PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android and the Ouya!\nTiny Trek Soundtrack - $10.00: Get a digital download copy of all the music for Tiny Trek in MP3 and FLAC with cover art and jacket notes.\nSteam copy of Clickteam Fusion 2.5 - $60.00: Get a copy of the same tool used to make Tiny Trek and start programming your own game with ease! More information on how Clickteam Fusion 2.5 works is here.\nDonate with Paypal\nA few of you have asked if they could donate with Paypal. So I am providing the below paypal option for funding. All the same rewards and Adonis will be honored.

So in order to be perfectly clear about the gameplay in Astrobase Command, here are what a few of the words we use mean to us:\nSandbox  -- You can actually go anywhere and do anything, and as a core premise the game is built around making this as true as possible.\nActions have Consequences -- Your choices fundamentally shape the world, and also how the world informs your future actions in a feedback system which extends into all aspects of the game.\nRPG -- The game encourages attachment and emotional investment in characters by imbuing them with personality, which is expressed during the moment-to-moment gameplay.\nImmersion  -- You feel like you're inside the game-world to such a degree you forget you're playing software. The world is credible and the characters behave not as scripted plot devices or bags of stats, but as individuals that live and exist in that world.\nScience Fiction -- A setting that explores how technology creates novel predicaments for characters, but can also yield the solution to those same predicaments.\nAstrobase Command is about building the space station in your personal fantasy, informed by decades of watching sci-fi shows and movies.\nWe felt building in 3D is the only way this could be achieved.\nAstrobase in \"ant farm\" view\nMuch of the game entails the player fulfilling intrinsic goals.There is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to play the game... there is only survival, and however you want to achieve that is up to you!\nModules are the bread-and-butter of a station. Constructing a module is a bit like crafting, where you combine parts whose stats are added cumulatively to the whole. The characters selected to construct a module also plays a part, so module quality, build-time, and resource efficiency is affected by the skills of the build team.\nDatapad running the Module Builder Cartridge - credit to Dan Cook on the pixel art\nThere are no map sizes or hard limits, so you can really build the space station that's living in your head! We use natural mechanics to define the ruleset, to avoid that \"gamey\" feeling. We want the game to feel as real and logically constructed as any sci-fi universe technical manual.\nProximity Alert!\nRace creation is one of our favorite aspect of space games. We're the kind of guys that never play a pre-made race. So Astrobase Command offers a robust race creation system that allows you to truly craft the civilization that fits your playstyle. \nUse the Bioscope to define your species' characteristics\nRace creation works a bit like tabletop games, and provides the template from which new recruits coming to your station are drawn. It sets the average for your race, which allows you to have an Astrobase filled with characters who are totally unique in the game world. But who also can have variation between individuals (depending on your Variance stat!)\nThe same idea goes for looks. Do you want a race of clones, or a species who has incredibly diverse characteristics? It's up to you.\nThe NPC civilizations you encounter also use this system, ensuring that every time you meet someone, it's a fresh experience.\nMeaningful Differences\nIn Astrobase Command, Racial Traits confer unique game features which are only available to the races which have them.\nBasically, we want you to be able to create the race that really suits your playstyle. Make any species from any science fiction universe, and have it feel unique and authentic.\nDo your characters regenerate wounds in combat? Are they empathic? Can they use salvaged ancient devices? Can they build and deploy stealth generators? Are they logical or scheming?\nTechnology is useful, but it's not more useful than anything else. It can even be a liability if you don't have skilled people to use to and maintain it. So this is really a universe where players who focus their Astrobase on any given area can genuinely compete.\nAt the core of the game are the characters who live and work on your station.\nAs fans of Dungeons and Dragons, we believe that characters are about relationships -- between each other, and with the world itself. Stats and numbers exist to inform and flesh out character development, but they aren't the be-all-and-end-all!\nCharacter Sheet\nCharacters on your Astrobase have jobs, which you specify in the Duty Roster. Each job performs a specific function, such as managing a power reactor, manning a security checkpoint, obtaining missions, or monitoring space with the Astrobase's sensors.\nThere is a leveless progression system in Astrobase Command, and while working a job characters improve naturally by gaining in the associated skills which in turn improves their performance.\nRelationships are Built on Trust\nDeep character development is central to Astrobase Command!\nCharacters have personality traits, and these hook into the AI story engine. So your guys aren't just bags-of-stats with a name! You care about them because they make decisions based on their personality, and  you'll promote and empower units who make decisions that fit your playstyle.\nBrowsing recruit applications, looking for a good engineer\nPersonality Traits give the characters depth by influencing their moment-to-moment AI decisions.\nFor example, if there is a reactor fire between a medic and the wounded crewman he is tasked with saving, that character might deal with the problem in a number of ways. Someone logical might first put out the fire, and then deal with the wounded. An adventurous character might try to make it through the fire and be the hero. A focused character might put on a space suit, and avoid the fire altogether by going outside (leaving someone else to deal with it). If he's creative, he could to seal the burning module and vent the oxygen, and then use the spacesuit to traverse the de-pressurized module.\nEvery goal has many valid solutions, and it's the personality of the character that determines how he chooses to fulfil your orders.\nThe personalities of characters emerge from the situations the player puts them in, as outcomes of the AI story engine. We currently have 280 traits, and a character may posses up to four.\nOur goal is to create characters that have real personalities and you can choose to promote and rely upon the ones that fit your playstyle.\nPromoting Good Leaders\nYou have total control over who you promote, so empower people that you trust.\nThe Org Chart uses top-of-the-line touchscreen technology\nCertain jobs on the Astrobase, such as department heads, have minimum rank requirements. Other jobs such as Duty Chiefs have maximum rank requirements. You need good people at every level in your organization. People you can trust to get the job done.\n\nThe AI Story Engine generates events based on your actions, and ties them into everything that's going on in the game\nThe decisions of you and your crew will have meaningful consequences, and its up to you to interpret whether those consequences are good or bad because the game places no value judgement on how you survive (although other races you encounter might!)\nPlayer Control Through Characters\nWhile you use the Astrobase's sensors and information gathering capabilities to inform your decisions, those capabilities are tied to the crewman (or crew-woman) doing that particular job. \nSome jobs allow you to set feature parameters using the information you have about your universe. So for example, you use the Mission Control Officer to build the missions that sustain your Astrobase.\nDiplomacy and research all work on a similar principle. While manufacturing and shipbuilding take an approach similar to module construction.\nYou're in control, but the characters do the dirty work. \nCombat scales from small squad and wing-based encounters to large regimental engagements and fleet battles. These can happen on and around your Astrobase, on planets and in deep space for resource and supply-line control, and even at the Astrobase of your enemy.\nCrewmen performing a flight check before takeoff\nBecause you can't be everywhere at once, the larger the conflict the more you will have to rely on the skills and personalities of your Commanders to bring you victory.\nTo do this you create combat groups that can be anything from squad and wing-sized to regiment and fleet-sized, and assign the personnel, equipment, and a commander. It's to these groups that you issue orders.\nFor small conflicts, you are really able to really take a hands-on approach and direct every movement. But with large conflicts, there will be too much going on to micromanage every action in real-time, and while you can take direct control of whatever area needs your attention, you'll be conveying the other objectives to the commanders on the ground. The AI will execute those orders using the character personalities.\nSo it's about promoting Commanders you trust to fulfill the objectives in a way that corresponds to your playstyle. \nAstrobase Command is about extending immersion to all aspects of the game -- even the interface and styling. \nTo us, retro means so much more than using low-fidelity graphics, or using a particular art style.\nRetro is about evoking the same of excitement and wonder we experienced playing our favorite games growing up.\nThese games didn't box themselves into a particular genre or followed any convention. They were each unique visions that did something totally new.\nDatapad cartridges on the retractable desktop\nThe game draws heavily on the physical aesthetic from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The interface is real and tangible, and you can touch all the elements and move them around.\nWe wanted a mix of technologies, so you'll be manipulating old-school cartridges for the Datapad, manilla envelopes, ID cards, and all the knobs and dials that exist in a world populated by characters who have to use these same technologies in the game.\nWe're huge modders of the games we play. We feel that even with our favorite games, there's no substitute for being able to customize your game however you want (shout-out to any fellow Fallout 2 modders out there).\nIn Astrobase Command, you'll be able to write your own Datapad programs, rename all the character ranks, redesign the uniforms, change out looks and body types, skin the interface, and even design new personality traits.\nWe'll include such functionality in an editor which ships with the game, but really savvy modders will have full access to the game files. You'll be able to share your mods with the community, or import mods other people make into your game.\nWe believe that DRM-free means that if you own a copy of the game, you can do what you want with it and we'll even support you!\nLet's face it.\nWe need an artist.\nWe have been operating so far with 0 artists on the game, so while we have a lot of great ideas about the aesthetic, they're more complicated than we can pull off on our own.\nGamer Academy Interview (Gamer Academy)\nAstrobase Command Interview (The Indie Mine)\nGaming News: Jellyfish Games Interview: Astrobase Command (The Samurai Rabbit)\nSeeking Spacebucks: Astrobase Command Kickstarter (rockpapershotgun)\nKickstarter Project \u2018Astrobase Command\u2019 Is Unlike Anything You\u2019ve Played Before (inquisitr.com)\nWe Interview the minds behind Astrobase Command (rtsguru.com)\nAstrobase Command Q&A with Adam Blahuta (savingcontent.com)\nGamer Academy Interview (Gamer Academy)\nAstrobase Command Interview (The Indie Mine)\nGaming News: Jellyfish Games Interview: Astrobase Command (The Samurai Rabbit)\nSeeking Spacebucks: Astrobase Command Kickstarter (rockpapershotgun)\nKickstarter Project \u2018Astrobase Command\u2019 Is Unlike Anything You\u2019ve Played Before (inquisitr.com)\nWe Interview the minds behind Astrobase Command (rtsguru.com)\nAstrobase Command Q&A with Adam Blahuta (savingcontent.com)\nGamer Academy Interview (Gamer Academy)\nAstrobase Command Interview (The Indie Mine)\nGaming News: Jellyfish Games Interview: Astrobase Command (The Samurai Rabbit)\nSeeking Spacebucks: Astrobase Command Kickstarter (rockpapershotgun)\nKickstarter Project \u2018Astrobase Command\u2019 Is Unlike Anything You\u2019ve Played Before (inquisitr.com)\nWe Interview the minds behind Astrobase Command (rtsguru.com)\nAstrobase Command Q&A with Adam Blahuta (savingcontent.com)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLet's be honest, making a video game is hard.

The fact is, the more you try to innovate and not follow in another game's footsteps, the more uncertainty you add to the schedule.\n\nAstrobase Command is an ambitious project.

Being huge fans of the sci-fi genre, we wondered why spaceships feel so empty? What\u2019s missing? Looking back to all the TV and Movies that inspired us, like Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica or Firefly, we realised games are missing something integral: a crew. A ship without a crew feels hollow and meaningless, so we\u2019ve taken space travel to the next level. The dangers of space should not only test your metal, but your flesh.\nWe wanted to make a game where you\u2019re not a solid, singular object in a sky-box; you are a captain in an evolving, dynamic ship that hundreds of people call home. They adapt to you, and grow with you as you fight alongside them, and if you suffer losses, you\u2019ll feel the loss that comes with that.\nThat\u2019s where the drama is, that\u2019s where the story happens, and it\u2019s the interacting with people on the deck that makes this a complete experience.\nWe want to create a complete sci-fi RPG experience.\nWe want to explore the war-torn depths of space, engage in political intrigue, lead troops on the deck of a ship, command a fleet from the bridge, and sate our thirsts for glory \u2013 and we want you to join us.\nFor the first time in a game of this type, players will be able to board vessels taking the combat into an RTS environment whilst your friends still fight from their ships in space.\nAs the captain of a ship, you\u2019ll lead your men through battles, boarding operations, and space exploration through a hierarchy of officers, selected and honed by you.\nYou\u2019ll explore your vessel isometrically, discovering the inner workings and day to day life of the officers and crew who serve under you. Invite dignitaries to your chamber, or defend your vessel from attack on foot (in the style of Jagged Alliance, X Com.)\nAs you lead your men to victory, yourself and officers who survive will have access to upgrades and talents, affecting gameplay and offering new tactical opportunities. Make the wrong decision, and expect to lose your officer for good with our rogue-like chain of command.\nConcept for ingame Bridge view\nBattles from space are orchestrated from the classical perspective (Star Trek Online, Klingon Academy, Freelancer, etc.) Whilst in this view, your crew will take their battle stations within the ship, affected by hazards \u2013 even being sucked out of a hull breach. Whatever happens outside of the vessel, affects those within it.\nBoarding operations allow you to isometrically zoom in on your units, or zoom out into Space Battle View at your disclosure. Fight the war on two fronts. Battle in the style of games like Men of War at the same time as fighting battles reminiscent of Klingon Academy.\nTrust your crew? Allow them to fight autonomously, and deal with the ships hands on.\nConcept for ingame boarding\nOur modular design will allow you to build your ships (link to Ship designer) and space station to fit your play style. With thousands of combinations, and the potential for thousands more over the period of the campaign and launch, it\u2019s possible to create something completely unique.\nChange the design for tactical, defensive, and strategic capabilities \u2013 skin, colour, and mix-and-match to your heart\u2019s desire. \nThe Mandate is a sandbox RPG (similarities with Pirates! And Mount and Blade), allowing you to travel the galaxy through a series of jump-gates, opening doors to new systems.\nIf you or your friends are in trouble, instantly jump to their location from outside of the game using Steam.\nEach system of the universe offers a series of procedurally generated content which varies every time, as well as hand-crafted story-driven content for you to take advantage of. What you do in The Mandate is entirely up to you, but as you gain power and unlock more systems, you\u2019ll drive the story forward.\nWith new factions to be found in each sector, and Starbases to be scavenged, looted, and built, watch your empire grow as you conquer and explore the depths of space, where new quests and unexplored territories will reward the most experienced of captains.\nAt its core, that\u2019s The Mandate \u2013 a fantastical space RPG about betrayal, scavenging, exploration, combat, and honor. These elements are eloquently wrapped in an all-original history and lore, waiting to be discovered.\nWith both iterative and entirely unique mechanics and concepts, we\u2019ve been inspired by franchises such as X Com for our upgrading system, Fallout for scavenging and survival, Battlestar Galactica for the sense of home and community, crewmanship, Star Trek Online and Klingon Academy for space battles, and Jagged Alliance or Men of War for RTS style boarding operations. We\u2019re taking the best of what was, and reinstating the old-school \u2013 and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re doing it right.\nWe've written 1500 years of history. It's up to you to write the future. The explorable reaches of space mix hand-crafted and procedurally generated content and is packed with historically relevant easter-eggs offering insight into the Mandate's rich lore.\nEach level of the game, from the political tier of warring empires, through the strategic level of individual star systems and naval battles, down to personal interactions with other characters impacts on how your story develops.\nThe decisions you make in Mandate affect the world around you, and your crew. Every action has a consequence, and as you push your ship to the farthest reaches of the universe, diplomacy, and morality are pushed with it.\nAffect the world with your actions, not with your words. The Mandate will not be challenged with a dialogue wheel.\nIn the far future, mankind has abandoned the exhausted, dying world of Earth and gone on to colonize hundreds more worlds. These colonies were united under the rules of the Imperial Mandate, and linked by faster-than-light travel gates. As civilization continued to expand, corruption within the Mandate and dissent in the outer systems fomented a rebellion against Imperial rule.\nThe untimely death of the last Emperor gave the rebels their opportunity. The military was recalled to his state funeral and the investiture of his successor - a young and inexperienced Empress who took the throne with limited political support. Seizing the moment, the outer systems declared their intention to break away from the Mandate.\nThe Empress dispatched the Grand Fleet to restore order, but saboteurs redirected the travel gates, and the fleet ended up scattered across the galaxy. The Empress was left vulnerable without the protection of her navy.\nDesperate times called for desperate measures. The Empress founded the Corsairs, a new fleet captained by disgraced ex-Mandate officers jailed for breaching the Articles of War. Reinstated under the promise of redemption, these veterans are the last hope of the Mandate. You are a member of the Corsairs. With a small ship, you must move swiftly and make your way to the far reaches of Mandate space. Your mission - to discover the fate of the Grand Fleet and restore order to the outer systems.\nThere was a time when gaming wasn\u2019t about running through a corridor, firing off rounds into hordes of enemies. There are hundreds of mechanically magnificent titles out there on PC, and hundreds of teams equipped to make them. The only reason they\u2019ve declined is that they don\u2019t sell as well as something you\u2019d find on the consoles. We want to change that, and we have the knowledge to do so.\nThe Mandate is an ambitious title, but we are tackling each of the core elements with equal attention. By making each gear in the mechanism function correctly and optimally, our end result will be something mechanically interesting, with a lot of depth.\nWe\u2019ve taken inspiration from some of the finest strategy and RPG titles from past and present; working iteratively with their ideas and concepts. These are ideas that have worked in the past, but unfortunately declined with the changing PC gaming demographic. We know you\u2019re out there, and we\u2019re bringing them back. With tried and tested game mechanics, and some completely original ones, all it takes is the knowledge to bring them together \u2013 hard-earned knowledge that our team members have gained through years of games industry experience.\n\u2022 The ships of The Mandate are modular designs, allowing us - and you - to manually mix and match various parts, or to randomly generate any number of designs for the game world.\n\u2022 One of the themes of The Mandate is that ships are home to many of the world\u2019s inhabitants. Space stations and ships will be our cities. They are naturally much smaller than lunar structures \u2013 however, there will be many of them.\n\u2022 Whilst much of space in The Mandate is hand crafted, there are also procedurally generated areas to keep things fresh and offer replayability and interesting battle options in multiplayer. This allows us to offload some of the work to a complex world building algorithm.\n\u2022 Most importantly, we have experience building massive worlds. Many of our team hail from some of the most successful MMO projects ever created.\n\u2022 We\u2019re careful \u2013 using several middlewares to streamline development and reduce risk, increase efficiency, and most importantly, avoid wasting time. Unity3D is a great tool for this.\nCreating a new RPG world isn\u2019t easy, what have you done differently?\nThe biggest mistake a storyteller can make in gaming is to believe they are writing the future. The future is up to you: the gamers. Because of this, we\u2019ve taken the time to do a lot of research into building a believable past. We believe the story to be so important to The Mandate, that we\u2019ve written 1500 years of history based on Tsarist Russian lore and history. What if the Tsars ruled space?\nThe Mandate is part alternative-history, part fantasy. You\u2019ll be writing the future in The Mandate, it\u2019s simply our job to provide you with the context. Throughout our kickstarter period, you\u2019ll be introduced to our characters, how they\u2019re designed, their names, and their pasts. Even you, the player, will be able to choose your path from families dating back to the Tsarist period. The world of The Mandate did not happen spontaneously \u2013 there are reasons for the way that it is, and throughout this campaign and the games launch day, you\u2019ll enjoy exposition and story updates offering insight into our rich new world.\nWe are an international team: Canada, USA, Sweden, Norway, UK, France, Slovakia.\nWe are a team of veteran developers who decided to go Indie together and come from different game developers each with their own strengths [ex-EA, ex-2K Games, ex-Ubisoft, ex-Funcom]. Previously we have worked on and shipped both singleplayer, multiplayer and MMO AAA productions with team size ranging from 30 to 200\nSome of the titles we have worked on and shipped include: Assassin's Creed 1&2, Mafia 2, Alan Wake, FarCry 2&3, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures,Call of Duty 3, Splinter Cell, Planet of the Apes, Saga of Ryzom, FIFA ONLINE, FarCry Evolution, Rainbow 6 Vegas, The Secret World and more.\nPlease refer to the FAQ for full team statement. Portfolio links:\nGarret (Art Director)\nVegard (Tech Director)\nWe are big fans of sci-fi, be it video games or series like Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Babylon 5 or Firefly. We are CRPG players and some of our favourites are Fallout, Baldur's Gate, The Witcher, Gothic, but we also remember classics like Ultima 7 or Microprose's Darklands. We are strategy players and have fond memories of the original X-Com, Carrier Command, Jagged Alliance and more! We love pen & paper tabletop: D&D, Pathfinder, Deathwatch, Traveller, Shadow Run and more! And also we are board game geeks: Warhammer, Warmachines.\nWe plan on taking all our inspirations, hobbies and diverse development experiences to ensure we deliver a game you will want to play for many hours both alone in dark space and together with your captain friends.\nTier reward information can be found here.\nCLICK HERE for digital add-ons. If you wish to pick a digital add-on simply increase your pledge by the corresponding amount. E.g. if you wish to name a marine ($25) and get the base game with soundtrack ($20) then you would pledge $45 in total and pick the $20 reward tier. After Kickstarter is over, we will transfer your unused credits over to BackerKit where you can spend them on digital add-ons. \nKickstarter is the preferred backing avenue but if you for some reason cannot use Kickstarter, then you can visit our PayPal store.\nReward tiers that grant extra copies [so $150 and above] also include the Cossack Captain tier (alpha, beta, season pass etc) for each extra copy.\nWe have put a lot of thought into thinking about fairness \u2013 especially when it comes to games and their PR and marketing teams. For this reason, to say thank you for your vote of confidence reflected in your pledge amount, we are putting our entire marketing team in the darkest airlock on-ship.\nThey have each been issued a \u201cFairness Directive\u201d, a set of rules they have to follow to make sure there is a coherent and direct flow of information between you and the developers. They have been ordered to be firm, frank, and fair.\nRewards are certainly mentioned in the Fairness Directive, and we will not be selling alpha or beta access at inflated prices. We believe access to the game should be included in the relevant pledge tiers, and we should not profit from your willingness to provide feedback. You are part of the team, and we respect you.\nTherefore, as the pledge tiers scale, you\u2019ll see access to exclusive content that we consider real value for money. Many of these will not be sold separately, and you will not see some of them sold on Steam. They are a thank-you for your continued feedback and support, and there is some exciting stuff such as the Season Pass (access to the first expansion pack and content updates), and access to all early builds of the game (pre-alpha).\nAs you continue to browse the tier pledge rewards, you will even get a chance to completely change the game, and leave a permanent mark on the world of The Mandate. \nRemember, any breach of the Fairness Directive will result in a swift ejection through the airlock, replacing the guilty party with a robotic AI (they are cheaper to feed, anyway).\nAs the Empress placed her trust in the Corsairs securing her a grand victory, your trust is well placed in us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUPDATE\nSome backers have asked to see a clearer cost breakdown. We will not be providing a \u201ccake diagram\u201d as we believe that gives a false sense of security. Instead we have put together a development timeline to illustrate the allocation of manpower for the different stages of development. Keep in mind we are on Indie salaries. The Kickstarter campaign will cover the positions outlined and some devs are prepared to work for free as an additional buffer.\n\nhttp://ships.mandategame.com/images/20131015_KS_dev_budget.png\n\n\u201cWe are taking the pre-production process very seriously indeed. The combat prototype has been in development for almost a year, and only a subset of it is shown in the ship designer. We will get back to this in more detail later in the campaign. \n\n\nPre-production features a skeleton size unit of full-time staff. Other staff are kept informed of creative decisions and when their roles will be needed once production starts. This saves time, money and allows the skeleton team to focus their efforts. Once the production tools are ready, we will ramp up and assign additional full-time staff to their positions. Additionally, we have no big corporate HQ and minimal expenses. Our producer does not have a driving license and as such expenses for company cars will be minimal... (but we might buy him a bike!)\n\nWe are economically efficient, utilizing resources (such as your pledge money) in the best ways possible. We do contingency planning and set aside buffer time to have a reserve. We have funded the prototype so far with side-income and by working late nights.\n\nOur staff understands our budget limitations and the implications for roadmaps and scheduling. We will only hire for position X when it is necessary -not before, and since we have access to a large network of game industry professionals this simplifies the recruitment process. Because we have a clear focus we do not need to give people a task to do merely because they are sitting around. This would be inefficient and wasteful. We will not have Day1 DLCs for the Mandate, and our focus is on delivering the best possible experience at launch to everybody who buys the game. Proper content updates and expansion packs will be planned before launch but developed after based on input from the community, particularly the Kickstarter donors who are our bosses.\n\n\nOn the technological side, Unity3D (the game\u2019s engine) comes with a working world editor, a build system for creating versions of the game, and the ability to deploy to multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and Mac. It has its own eco-system with 3rd party plugins which we purchase for a reasonable price and can use in our project. This saves us time and allows us to do things like push the visual fidelity with one example being TC Particles which allow GPU accelerated DX11 particles. Check out the ship designer and study the impact effect on the shields. It just looks awesome. TC Particles is just one example and we have other bigger plugins or middelware available to us as well like a stable, tried and tested network engine which we have already gained valuable experience with. This greatly reduces the time and effort needed beyond integration, bugfixing and maintenance. \n\nOur team has half a century of game development experience between us, including major MMOs. This is a much smaller project than an MMO, which traditionally demands very capable content production tools. We are taking our combined knowledge and experience to setup and structure efficient workflows and production pipelines. This includes decoupling dependencies between art, code and design to minimize the amount of wait-time and avoid blockers. \n\nMiddleware is the key and we would prefer to license something which has been tried and tested rather than reinventing the wheel. This frees us up to focus on the game and avoid unnecessary distractions. At the moment, we are evaluating several character creation middleware tools which will make the process of setting up characters a breeze for the artists. At the same time players will have access to extensive character customization options. A common theme for both art and game design is to apply a modular and reusable approach. On the art side the procedural textures are an excellent example and if you have tested our ship designer, you will appreciate the versatility it provides even at this early stage. On the design side we are heavily data-driven: our tools must support major changes to content without requiring the involvement of programmers, which would create unwanted dependencies and blockers. \n\nOne final point to make, if you inspect our reward tiers you will see that we do not have any physical rewards. This means we do not divert Kickstarter funds to produce physical goods and instead we can use the funds to fully realize the actual game. To compensate for this we are providing what we believe are fair reward tiers where backers even at lower tiers get to put their mark on the game. Higher tier rewards are bundled with additional copies of the game so backers can split the cost among friends.\n\n\nStill, we understand that some backers would prefer physical copies and merchandise and here is a promise:\n\n\nOnce our funding goals are reached, we will add physical reward tiers and outsource the production and shipping to our backers who will pay for only production and shipping. If people want t-shirts made we will supply the graphics to make your own t-shirts or other merchandise. We will not make a dime off of you ordering that set of China with the Empress Anastasia on it that you always wanted. We are game developers -not Manchester United! \n\n\nTo summarize: we have the necessary know-how, experience and technology, and our overhead is minimal. The Mandate is the love child of some very experienced game developers who all want to see this project succeed. We are doing smart things with smart technology and will pick the right tools for the job to optimize the work-load and streamline our production pipelines and workflows. This allows us to produce content in modular blocks which is more efficient and allows us to reuse, thereby saving time. \n\nSo could everyone and their grandma make The Mandate for $500,000? Probably not. Can we? Hell yes we can.\u201d\n\nRemember: One rule, no quarter. With efficiency, a driven vision, and a careful understanding of what made traditional strategy games and RPGs so great, The Mandate will delve deep into mechanics of old, iterating and improving on them, ultimately delivering a vast and unique RPG experience.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "Latest community Update", "update_content": "Dear backers,\nIn March we went through difficult times, the team size was reduced to only a core team since January, as consequence of the still ongoing negotiations with our publisher about the remaining funding.

For the first time an era of trade and diplomacy reigns. Human corporations, like Star-Ex, have risen to the forefront of human expansion. The universe is a dangerous place, and for those with courage the trade off is simple - they provide the ship, you seek out the profits!\nIn Interstellaria you command a crew of eager explorers. Combat, trade, and diplomacy is handled by giving your crew commands. Survival means watching out for hull leaks, defeating hostile invaders, and destroying enemy vessels. You have to balance pushing your crew to learn new skills, while also keeping them fed and rested. In addition, at any time you can take complete control of the captain and adventure planet side to collect important artifacts, ship resources, and valuable data.\nInterstellaria is a 2d space SIM/RPG/Sandbox game by Coldrice Games LLC created in the same vein as the best space exploration games of the past. Inspired heavily by games like Starflight or Star Control, Interstellaria is all about allowing the player freely explore space. Every star has something interesting to see, and every planet has it\u2019s own unique feel. In addition, each alien race follows its own culture and moral values.\n-SETTING: Take control of a starship in a wild and dangerous universe. Pirates, hostile alien forces, rebel factions, asteroid fields, and strange anomalies threaten the lives of each and every starship. Every pocket of space has its own dangers and rewards, such as unlocking new areas of space, alien races eager to join your crew, or even advanced weaponry not available elsewhere.\n-STORY: The setting and the mechanics allows for you to drive the plot! There are several missions to take part in, a main plot to unravel, or if you so choose ignore the needs of others and simply build your own fortune.\n-EXPLORATION: Every location on the starmap has its own event or challenge. You could face a moral scenario near a dying star, or be tasked to apprehend an alien outlaw. Sometimes you'll be given the opportunity to scavenge a derelict space station, or find yourself shooting your way out of a hostile encounter.\n-CREW LIFE: Your crewman die, so be careful! Permadeth is a constant challenge in Interstellaria. In addition to leveling skills to maximize your ship\u2019s abilities, you must also make sure the crew eat, sleep, and entertain themselves. When managing your crew the wrong choice will wipe out that max level crewman, or worse... wipe out your entire ship!\n-CONSTANT PROGRESS: Interstellaria is all about progress. You can level up your crewmen in the various stations on board. You can purchase bigger and more powerful ships, and you can swap out guns to pick the ones you like best. Each time you play you make your ship your own!\nDefending your vessel is a key part of surviving space. The player must balance power, crew, and life support in order to be the most successful. As you progress so do your crewmen, making them incredibly valuable in a combat situation. A high level crewman can target specific points of an enemy vessel, while a novice can only aim in the enemies general direction. Be warned - once the shields go down the enemy can invade your ship as well!\nENERGY - players must balance the energy of their ship between the engines, life support, systems, and weapons. Energy is limited and usage is dynamic!\nSTATIONS - The crew boost the power of the ship through their stats, as well as the function of the station. Having a special engineering station will boost repair rates and ship speed. Having a max level engineer at that station also boosts ship energy output. Stations can be powered, and they can be damaged!\nSCANNING - Enemies must be scanned down to be fired upon. In addition, having high level scanning stations and high level scanners will boost the loot from wrecked ships. Be careful! Scanning a ship is a very hostile maneuver, and some friendly vessels will fire if they feel threatened.\nLIFE SUPPORT - The oxygen cycles through the ship room by room. A hull leak in any given room can quickly kill a crewmen. In addition, large numbers of leaks will cut into the oxygen cycle and cause other rooms to lose their life support as well.\nINVASION - Be warned, several hostile ships have been known to launch invasion pods. This allows them the ability to board your vessel and kill your crew. The act of forcefully boarding  a ship is illegal!\nA unique side of Interstellaria is the ability to also go planet side. Your captain takes on all risks! Some planets will challenge his mind with unique puzzles and hazardous terrain. Other planets can only be tamed at the point of a gun. The captain can equip armor and unique alien weapons he discovers along the way. In addition to valuable loot, some alien worlds will unlock their vessels for your purchase!\nHAND CRAFTED WORLDS - each world is designed by hand. From sketch, to art, to testing, to completion. The goal is to create unique challenges and memorable encounters. The environments all have their own unique appearance. Coupling the beautiful art with the amazing sounds of Chipzel, planets are really fun to explore.\n\nUNIQUE ENCOUNTERS - Each world has it\u2019s own special enemies and allies. You might travel to a bright red lava planet in Kursha space to discover rock-spiders crawling towards you, or travel to the gaseous world in Human space to chat with human like fungoids.\nSPECIAL ITEMS AND GEAR - The further you travel from human space the more diverse the gear becomes! In addition to finding powerful artifacts to upgrade your ship, there is a plethora of equipment for your crew! Neon lazer tubes, backpack rail guns, chitin chest armor, bio-neural helmet\u2026 you can upgrade your captain to overcome any challenge! In addition, some area\u2019s of larger planets aren\u2019t accessible until you come back with upgraded equipment.\nIn pre-alpha phase, Interstellaria currently features the human components of the game. Some minor alien technology is available, but mostly for debugging/testing purposes. As of now the game sits in closed alpha, but by pledging  you can also be invited to our alpha phase starting January 1st!\nThe current build has been designed to slide all art/code/mechanics seamlessly into the final game. This should shave several months off development time. The hope is for a late 2014 release, but of course Interstellaria will only be released when it feels both satisfying and fun!\nThe best part is by offering alpha/beta access to the game we can also get valuable input by players just like you. Often times games ship with features that were well intentioned, but boring or not well thought out. By having people test features as they are developed we can ensure that we come up with something that is really fun!\nThe game demands large amounts of content just like all the space games of yesteryear. To complete that amount of content within a reasonable timeframe would be difficult. The game would see much of content cut to provide a polished, but smaller, game. The money isn't being raised for anything but to help make Interstellaria the best game it can be! Any money earned would go towards:\n-Musician: The biggest, and in some ways most important, expense. A professional artists helps to bring life to the game. The sounds, music, and ambiance can't be replaced! Chipzel brings her considerable talent to the project and really brings the game to life.\n-Additional artist: It's easy for me to work on this project for free for the rest of my life. I'm passionate about it. In order to create an exciting and diverse universe I will need help, and not everyone can work for free! With the aid of additional artist I can design/implement more worlds, enemies, and equipment\n-Operation costs: Owning a company, paying fees, and supporting contract artists/musicians adds up. A good portion of funds will go towards these costs as well as important software licenses. In addition, time I personally take off to ensure the game is complete means funds are neccessary to support that time.\n- Testers: the final portion of the funds goes towards testers, debuggers, but mostly a professional programmer to keep the game running smooth! I would rather put my money towards improving the game than anything else!\nCOLDRICE - PROGRAMMING/ART\nColdrice (Jon King) is a programmer/pixel art faring from Washington State, USA. A lover of pixel art, his goal is to make pixels that are easy to fall in love with. In addition, he doubles as the lead programmer with skills in Unity, as well as mobile platforms. Coldrice is the main developer for Interstellaria and owner of Coldrice Games LLC. He is committed to bringing the game to players no matter what. He would love to talk to you (yes you!) on twitter: https://twitter.com/ColdRice_Dev\nCHIPZEL - MUSIC\n Chipzel (Niamh Houston) is an incredibly skilled indie chiptune artist from Ireland. Her recent album, Spectra, sets the bar for all other chiptune artists in terms of quality and entertainment value. Using genuine 8bit sound via Gameboy combined with modern tools she produces the perfect sound for a game like Interstellaria - hard beats, vibrant sound, and the electronic pulse of space.\n(All tracks are ideas/a work in progress!)\nTRAILER VERSION 2 - NEW/ORIGINAL CHIPZEL TRACK;\nhttp://youtu.be/7BxZLula1mI\nAMBIANCE/EXPLORATION MUSIC - NEW/ORIGINAL CHIPZEL TRACK\nILLYA KING - CONCEPT ART/DESIGN\nIllya King is an Indie comic book artist faring from Washington State, USA.

You can spot his artwork, as well as several concept art images for Interstellaria, here at his portfolio site.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst Risk - Failure to receive funding. It became really obvious very early on that this game would need a lot of support Without funding, it would be very difficult to complete the project. The game will end up being much smaller due to the limited amount of content I could create alone. In addition, we would lose the awesome soundtrack! I would try and continue to work on the project, but the release date would also slip further away. With bitcrobes, my first \"larger\" project I was able to turn around the game a lot quicker with the support I received. Development under poor equipment was greatly hindered until that point. I know that kickstarter will be the key to success in Interstellaria.\n\nSecond Risk - Development delays. It happens. We've all seen it. My plan is that by offering alpha/beta access at low tiers it'll allow those who put their energy into this game the chance to play it regardless of delays. In addition, all testing feedback only helps to keep development running smoothly!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "NEW UI Patch almost here!

We\u2019ve added over 200 new models to the Bones range, and we\u2019ve discovered that these products are monstrously popular. You wanted more! More monsters! More Demons! More Dragons! More characters! More variety and more amazing new models!\nYou're in luck! We haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. We have many more models that we think deserve to be added to Bones - new sculpts and classic favorites from our metal lines! We\u2019d like to see if you think so, too!\nBones are still really expensive to produce, and we still need your help to expand the line. Your support makes the molds that we need to produce the figures, and in exchange you get the first crack at these figures for a fantastic deal!\nWhat's in it for me?\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot since we fulfilled our first Bones Kickstarter project, so you won\u2019t find as many pledge levels. Turns out that most of you just wanted the core set with the potential to expand over time. What this Kickstarter will do is add 30 more models: character models, new sculpts, and monsters. After we hit our goal, we have plans to make the value of your pledge grow.\nAll we need is your support.\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nWhat?! You're a gamer, right? Are you still living under a rock? Bones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change one.\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed one massive Kickstarter and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of a Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our first Kickstarter. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2012 longshoreman strike that delayed two of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in the model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for a buy in level model. This event did not occur in our previous Kickstarter but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount for the model. Also we reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

Design your company logo and color scheme, and watch your company stock rise and fall against your competitors! \nI put our stretch goals here for easy viewing. A more detailed description can be found here.\nWe are a two-man team of amateurs making the game of our dreams in our spare time. After developing this game for almost a year, we are looking for backers to help us make releasing this a reality. We are also looking for feedback and potential collaborators. We'd love to hear from you!\nBack in the Dwarven Motherland across the great sea, the Dwarven King, Dunold the Wise, has chartered a number of Dwarf Companies to explore and colonize strange new lands beyond the sea. As a Regional Manager in one of these companies, it is your duty to scout out one such island and make a foothold for Dwarven civilization there.\nAs regional manager, your duty is to oversee a colony of worker Dwarves for the motherland.\nThe King of the Dwarves commissioning the company's Royal Charter.\nBack home, the Dwarves are at the beginning of an industrial revolution. With newly invented gunpowder weapons and steam engines, the Dwarves have quickly overcome their ancestral enemies in the motherland, and have spread across the earth in search of profits and expanded market opportunities.\nThe Dwarves are a hardy race, and with access to gold, a warm hearth, and ale, can overcome any challenge -- and this colonization business is going to be a major challenge. The strange lands beyond the sea are uncivilized wilds, and full of unknown dangers. Competing companies see profit in these lands as well, and they don't take kindly to other firms edging in on their territory. Dwarven companies are ruthless competitors, demanding profits for their shareholders at all costs. If that means sacrificing a few measly workers for that extra ton of gold ore, so be it!\nA balloon arriving in the strange lands across the sea.\nThese are trying times for the Dwarves. Will you manage your company well and gain profit and glory? Or will you be driven back to the motherland by the hordes of savage Goblins, Elves and Mole Men, and thrown to the dustbin of history?\nDwarfcorp is played from a free-floating overhead perspective. The game takes place both above and below ground, and so is a truly 3D real-time strategy game. You can go up and down slices of the terrain, all the way from the fiery underdark to the snowy mountain tops.\nYou can go up and down horizontal slices to view different parts of the terrain. You then build underground by constructing tunnels.\nYou command a company of Dwarves by assigning them tasks such as Building, Mining, Gathering, or Attacking. Dwarves are pretty smart. Using symbolic planning-based AI, the Dwarves seek out unique ways to meet their own goals. Tell a dwarf to build a wood wall, and he will determine the best way to do that might be to chop down a tree, or else to grab the wood from a stockpile.\nDwarves take great pride in hoarding resources.\nThe goal is to gather resources and send them back to the Dwarven Motherland for profits, and grow your colony from a tiny enclave to a huge fortress. Generally, the more valuable the ore, the deeper it is in the earth.  \nSend your resources back to motherland for great profit!\nUsing the money from gathering resources, you can promote your Dwarves, or make them happier by paying them more. You can also hire more Dwarves with special skills such as Craftsdwarves, Soldiers, Wizards, and Musketeers to join your colony.\nA small one-level fortress is shown with some of the starting rooms. Each room allows Dwarves to engage in different industries or build weapons and spells.\nWith your profits, you can upgrade your colony by constructing rooms. Training Rooms can give your Dwarves the edge in combat -- The Forge can be used to construct a wide variety of mechanisms and weapons to make your operation more efficient, The Laboratory allows your magical Dwarves to research powerful spells -- and of course Drinking Halls and Bedrooms allow your Dwarves to rest and relax (like they'll be doing any of that!)\nDwarves need ale and song at the end of every hard day!\nYou can choose to pay whatever you want to your Dwarves, but if you pay them too little, or treat them too poorly (say, by not giving them enough ale), they may go on strike! Unhappy Dwarves may choose to stay in bed rather than go to work, and will write you a bad manager's report to the corporate higher-ups. Happy Dwarves will be more efficient, and will even sing while working!\nA horde of Goblins.\nBeware! The surface is full of dangers. Hostile Elves and Goblins aren't too keen on the Dwarves coming and stealing all their stuff. Underground, it isn't much safer, as Mole Men and Demons dwell there.\nMole men are sort of anti-Dwarves. They live miserable lives of savagery digging tunnels beneath the earth. They will hoard resources you need for Dwarven industry. Demons, on the other hand, are rare, devious, and should be avoided at all costs!\nDefend your colony with the most humane deterrents: deadly spike traps!\nLeverage your technical superiority over the local savages! Defend your fortress by constructing traps, hiring mercenaries and building a dazzling array of walls and channels. \nDwarves use their superior technology and crafting skills to their advantage!\nA randomly generated mountain.\nBefore starting play, you may generate an island on which to build your colony.\nMany aspects of the world are simulated.\nThe islands in DwarfCorp are procedurally generated and fully simulated.They are different every time you start playing. Fault lines, air currents, moisture, temperature, rainfall, rivers, lakes and oceans are all simulated through the passage of time -- which gives rise to forests, deserts, snowy tundra, jungles and grasslands. Additionally, civilizations of Goblins, Elves, Humans and Demons are randomly generated and given time to \"fight it out,\" so to speak, on the island. So you, as the Dwarven outsider, will make quite a splash as you arrive.\nDifferent terrain types arise from the simulation.\nAnd speaking of splashing, DwarfCorp features a finite liquid simulation system. Drain entire lakes for Dwarven industry! Power water wheels with the flow of rivers! Direct channels of lava from volcanoes! Just take care that none of your employees drown.\nMining too deep can get your Dwarves into some deep trouble!\nDay and night are simulated in the game, with the sun, moon, stars, and clouds dynamically moving across the sky. During the day, your employees may want to forage for food, but at night they had best stay underground -- where they can find caves, ores, dungeons, and other treasures.\nA full moon rising over the Dwarves.\nVolcanoes!\nIslands!\n\nWe are Completely Fair Games Ltd : a newly formed game company from Pittsburgh, PA. We are just two guys coding and pixeling for fun. In the past, we've made many smaller games with groups of friends from Carnegie Mellon University and elsewhere. We've been associated variously with the Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society, Dr. Fishbowl, and \"Team Danger\". We also participate in game jams from time to time. We both have day jobs in academia.\nMatthew Klingensmith - Programmer. Day job: PhD candidate at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon.\n\n\nWilson Pei - Artist. Day job: Master's student in Electrical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon. \n\nHere are some obscure games we've been involved with in the past:\nGet Pumped! (Winner of the 2013 Pittsburgh Global Game Jam!)\nRedux (Winner of the 2012 Microsoft Imagine Cup!)\nHydraman (2011 Global Game Jam!)\nBeestruction (Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society Gold Winner!)\nA Day in the Life of Danger (Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society Gold Winner)\nMoonwalk (Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society)\n\nWhat are we Delivering?\nIf we get this project funded, we hope to have a playable beta available by this time next year. The beta will have the basic parts of the \"sandbox\" version of the game fully implemented: colony-building, combat, traps, Dwarf classes, world generation, and an economic system. The beta will be Windows only (7 / XP), and will be available for less than $20. Purchasing the beta of the game entitles you to free updates for life. \nFrom there, we hope to have the game grow organically over time through numerous updates and community involvement. Depending on the level of initial funding we are able to acquire, we may opt to add more features or gameplay modes (i.e. stretch goals). \nOne of our main stretch goals is to port the game to other platforms like Linux, Mac and mobile via MonoGame or Unity. Another stretch goal we have in mind is to expand the game with a singleplayer campaign, complete with a storyline, cutscenes, and more. Should we meet our funding goal, more details on the stretch goals will be revealed.\nWhat do we Have So Far?\nRight now, we have what amounts to a small toy with basic implementations of some of the parts of the game. You can see screenshots of this toy on this page. Basic world generation, AI, building, mining, and economy exist, but they are in an extremely incomplete and early state. \nWe have released a simple pre-alpha prototype for you to play with to get a feel for the game. You can find it here.\nWe have a video of the prototype in action:\nFully developing the game from here will take quite a bit more work.\nWhat do we Need the Money for?\nThough we've been developing the game for free over the past year or so, we've been doing so purely as a hobby. Any time we spend on the game is currently time taken away from friends, family, work, and graduate school. We have considered working on this game at least part-time, but without any income, that is hard to justify. We want to make this game the best that we can possibly make it, and as quickly as possible.\nOur estimate of how the money will be distributed.\nAdditionally, development of the game would go much smoother if we could purchase licences to better tools (particularly to content creation tools and professional code profiling and analysis tools), better content (by commissioning professional artists and designers), and better equipment. \nFinally, the cost of actually publishing a game, even with self publishing methods, can be prohibitively expensive. \nWhen we worked out how much of an investment this would be on our part, it broke the bank! That's why we need you! If you want to see this project get off the ground and onto your laptops, become a backer! \nCheck out some of the rewards we're offering for becoming a backer! Our rewards fall into four basic categories, \"Fluff\", \"Digital\", \"Physical\", and \"Creative\". \nFluff rewards give credit to backers in the game. All backers can have their names or nicknames put into the credits. If you're extraordinarily wealthy, and have a few thousand dollars to blow on this venture, you can be named as a \"producer\", have your name appear in a subtitle on the game's main screen, or even be named as the deity of the dwarves! They will sing songs in your honor!\nDigital rewards include the alpha, the beta,  and the sound track, which you can download DRM-free. The alphais the \"feature complete,\" \"playable\" version of the game which has most of the promised game features. The alpha will be out much sooner than the beta, (probably by Christmas 2013) but will be much less fleshed out, and will be quite buggy. The beta is \"feature complete\", \"playable\", and has most of the content of the game already created. Only minor bug-fixes and tweaks remain. The beta will not be released for some time. The sound track of the game is being created in-house. You can hear a sample of one of our tracks on the video. Digital downloads of the sound track will contain 12-18 high quality, uncompressed audio tracks, and/or high quality MP3 versions.\nPhysical rewards are custom items which we will ship directly to your door over the next few months. First, you can get a glossy 7 x 5 inch postcard featuring one of five randomly generated terrains on the front, and a message from the developers on the back. We're also offering an 11 x 17 inch poster featuring artwork from the game, as well as two T-Shirt designs. Finally, we will be offering a physical CD of the game in a jewel case with custom-printed artwork on the case and CD face itself. (art by Emily So: http://emilyso.com/)\nCreative rewards allow you, as a backer, to design elements which will appear in the game. DwarfCorp allows players to customize the logo, motto, and name of their Dwarf Company. We will have several pre-set companies that players can choose from. Non-player companies will be randomly generated from these pre-sets. Taking one of the creative tiers will allow you to create one of these pre-set companies. If it's within taste, we'll include it as a pre-set! The higher creative tiers allow you to name physical features in the randomly generated world (such as oceans, lakes, rivers, mountains or volcanoes), and even design monsters and/or Dwarf classes!\nA table of rewards. Here's how to read it: each column is a donation tier. Every row with an 'x' in it is a reward you can get for that tier. If the 'x' is inside a \"pick one\" box, you may choose only ONE reward from that box.\nT-shirt, 8 color print!\nPremium T-Shirt, full color!\nMake a 32 x 32 corporate logo!\nA glossy postcard!\nThis 17 x 11 inch poster on your wall!\nSome of the Creative Tiers allow you to put a name of a company or its motto into a random pool.\nAs more people back the project, the little Dwarf will climb a ladder from the depths of the earth to the top of the mountain. He's very tired, and would desperately like to get to the top of the mountain to meet his friends! He needs your help!\nAs the Dwarf goes higher, stretch goals  may be revealed. When the Dwarf reaches a stretch goal, we will be obligated to add that (awesome) feature to the game. These will include technical features (like a larger number of available platforms) as well as gameplay features.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDwarfCorp is unfortunately nowhere near finished! We are nothing but two starving grad students working on this game as a hobby. We are NOT professional game developers. We have full time jobs, research, conferences, and all the miscellaneous bits of life to deal with in addition to making this game. And a game of this ambition and magnitude is not easy for just two people to make in their spare time.\n\nWe plan on dealing with these issues in several ways:\n\nFirstly, at the end of this project, we plan on only having a limited playable alpha available, which will be updated (slowly) over time with new features. This is the kind of game which can never be said to be \"fully finished,\" but is a kind of game which organically grows.\n\nSecondly, depending on how much funding we get through the kickstarter and other sources, we will be able to commission artists, programmers and design people to help us build the game. In addition to the general population of independent game developers we could call on to help us, we also have many talented friends and acquaintances who would love to help -- with a little funding.\n\nThirdly, if there is enough interest, we might be able to work part-time or completely quit our jobs over a couple of summers to finish this game. Trust me, I would like nothing more than to spend all day creating the game of my dreams!\n\nFinally, we hope to generate a vibrant community alongside this game and develop easy-to-use modding tools to help with content creation. After the first alpha is released, we will provide an easy way for the community to create and distribute content.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 378, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1078333633/dwarfcorp", "project_name": "DwarfCorp"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 37, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spacetrawlerbigbook2/spacetrawler-book-three", "project_name": "Spacetrawler Book Three"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 7862, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1590639245/stonehearth", "project_name": "Stonehearth"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 2590, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nerdkingdom/tug-1", "project_name": "TUG"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 103391, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rrpgt/robotech-rpg-tacticstm", "project_name": "Robotech\u00ae RPG Tactics\u2122"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 1973, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/554948184/itars-workshop-dungeon-terrain", "project_name": "Itar's Workshop - Dungeon Terrain and Accessories"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 1324, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1757963851/planet-explorers", "project_name": "Planet Explorers"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 51525, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/torment-tides-of-numenera", "project_name": "Torment: Tides of Numenera"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 1089, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/610004753/realm-works-streamlined-rpg-campaign-tools", "project_name": "Realm Works - Streamlined RPG Campaign Tools"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 254, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robotloveskitty/legend-of-dungeon", "project_name": "Legend of Dungeon"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 3368, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshparnell/limit-theory-an-infinite-procedural-space-game", "project_name": "Limit Theory: An Infinite, Procedural Space Game"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 8917, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/22cans/project-godus", "project_name": "Project GODUS"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 62289, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity", "project_name": "Project Eternity"}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 1156, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1447560584/more-oldschool-turn-based-4x-space-strategy-game", "project_name": "M.O.R.E. - old school turn-based 4X space strategy game."}}, {"backer": "Klingbeil", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 15061, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/659943965/planetary-annihilation-a-next-generation-rts", "project_name": "Planetary Annihilation - A Next Generation RTS"}}]
