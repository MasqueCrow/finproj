[{"backer": "Scott Lininger", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "GHOSTS is a full motion video, horror game stepping into the shoes of Night Trap, Phantasmagoria and The 7th Guest. It\u2019s a real-time live action game which means that it has to be played at 10pm in your local time zone. Written and Directed by Jed Shepherd (writer and exec producer of HOST - \u201cThe Scariest Movie of the last Decade\u201d - Dread Central & \u201cThe Genre Phenomenon of 2020\u201d - Forbes) in partnership with Visible Games & Limited Run Games. The game takes inspiration from the works of Manx screenwriter Nigel Kneale and the blurring of fact and fiction in the found footage movies from the last 25 years. However, unlike previous games in this oft-forgotten genre we\u2019re creating a horror experience that aims to truly chill your blood and send full motion video games screaming into the modern day.\nStarring Emma Louise Webb, Haley Bishop, Jemma Moore, Radina Drandova and Caroline Ward, GHOSTS features terrifying creature design by Trevor Henderson (SirenHead).\nHey, I\u2019m Jed and I\u2019m making a video game called GHOSTS.\nLast Halloween, frustrated by the neverending lockdown situation in the UK, like a lot of people I turned to video games for escapism. Looking specifically for horror games to freak me out, I re-discovered the live-action video games (FMV) of the 90s. Titles like Night Trap, Phantasmagoria and Double Switch (featuring the utterly superb Corey Haim), games that dared to try something a bit different and really pushed the capabilities of the game systems of their time.\nIt suddenly dawned on me what I had to do - I had to make a live action video game starring my friends Emma, Haley, Jemma, Radina and Caroline and make it as scary as hell. I want to make you afraid of even looking at your Nintendo Switch but feel absolutely compelled to play the game anyway to help the ladies survive.\nI contacted Visible Games to see if they were into helping me make it and posited the question: What if it was LIVE?\nWhat if it's hard-coded into the narrative of the game that you have to play it at a certain time? What if everyone in your time zone is playing the game at exactly that moment? It would make it an unprecedented terrifying event.  Wouldn\u2019t that be cool?  Luckily Visible Games have the unique skills to pull this concept off and make this unique feature a reality.\nWe took the idea to Limited Run Games and I\u2019ve never heard a faster YES in my life. Their support has been legendary and their reputation of delivering superior games is second to none. They will be releasing the game on all formats early next year.\nBuilding the team to help make this has been so much fun and I went to the absolute best to visualise the \u2018antagonist\u2019, THE LONG LADY. Designed by SIRENHEAD creator Trevor Henderson, I\u2019ve genuinely got the best people on the GHOSTS train!\nYou\u2019re probably thinking \u201cJed, why don\u2019t you just make a movie? Why a live-action video game?\u201d. My answer is: Why Not?\nSo as not to reveal too many spoilers, we have to be a little careful about the information you receive this early on. What we can say is ...\nYou play a TV producer, operating the outside broadcast van for a failing cable channel called FrighTV. Their flagship show is GHOSTS. It\u2019s the only thing people want to watch on the channel anymore. A show that in its heyday captured millions of viewers on a major channel. Viewers were glued to their screens as the presenter with a team of eager ghost hunters explored haunted locations around the country.\nOver the years, GHOSTS ratings began to drop which ultimately resulted in the show being dropped by the network and languishing on various freeview channels until it was purchased by FrighTV and re-branded for re-launch in 2022. The channel is littered with terrible adverts and trailers for movies you\u2019ve never heard of and never want to watch.\nAs the cast explore the location, you not only need to worry about their safety, the noises you hear around the van and the strange neighbours, there\u2019s also the urban legend of THE LONG LADY. Sightings of THE LONG LADY on this very street have chilled the bones of residents for decades. She appears in times of tragedy, looking through the windows of houses on the street. It\u2019s said that if you look directly at her face, you die. Curtain salesmen do gangbusters here.\nEvidence submitted via a recovered mobile phone\nAbove is photograph 2 of 3 taken from the discard mobile phone.\nPhotograph 3 of 3\nYou are the outside broadcast producer, in charge of what is shown to the viewers at home who have remained loyal to the show throughout all the lean years. The show is LIVE so you have to think on your feet and react to every moment to keep things interesting.  In front of you will be all of the camera feeds streaming from cameras installed in the most haunted location in London as well as heart rate monitors for the cast. What gets sent to the LIVE feed is your choice and can affect the future of the show (and perhaps the safety of the cast). You need to keep the show entertaining and you will have various tricks to employ to help you \u2018spice up\u2019 the live show.\nYou also have various documents, videos and audio files, collected throughout the years from this local community that you need to decipher to help understand the grave situation. Perhaps something you discover will stop the horrifying events from unfolding.\nThe full terrifying real-time version of the game is only playable at 10pm in your local time zone. If you load up the game before 10pm you\u2019ll be met with a classic test card. If you can crack the \u2018test\u2019 you will have access to an unlockable pre-watershed version where you can breathe and save your progress, but once you hit 10pm all bets are off! There are consequences for all of your choices though. Playing it safe is not always the best option.\nWhen playing GHOSTS, if you leave your station at any point, the game notices the lack of movement and it will end your session. Desertion of duty means the cast will be killed off. You are responsible for the lives of all involved so make sure you\u2019ve had a bathroom break, got plenty of snacks and most importantly turn off the lights!\n\nHaley Bishop is an American actress, based in London.

It\u2019s important to note that the exclusive Graham Humphreys artwork will only be available with these Kickstarter releases, so don\u2019t miss out!\n GHOSTS for Nintendo Switch by Limited Run Games \nGHOSTS for Playstation by Limited Run Games \n\nIf you want a little bit more oomph to your GHOSTS experience we have also teamed up with the amazing FRIGHT RAGS to offer an exclusive t-shirt too as part of our pledge tiers! \nGHOSTS for Playstation with exclusive Fright Rags Tee \nGHOSTS for Nintendo Switch with exclusive Fright Rags T-Shirt \n\nThe Collectors Edition of the game features a host of items that we can\u2019t wait for you to get your hands on. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of everything you get!\nThe GHOSTS Collectors Edition by Limited Run Games \nThe GHOSTS Collectors Edition by Limited Run Games comes with ...\nPhysical Game for Nintendo Switch or Playstation\nDigital Key for GHOSTS (Switch, Playstation, PC or Xbox)\nExclusive Graham Humphreys GHOSTS Cover\nGHOSTS Logo Sew on Patch\nExclusive Limited Edition GHOSTS T-Shirt from Fright Rags!\nGHOSTS Sticker Sheet\nThe Long Lady Acrylic Standee\nVHS Collectors Edition GHOSTS Clamshell Case (to hold all the contents)\nDocumentary \u2018The Making of GHOSTS\u2019 on Blu-Ray\n1 of 1 Polaroid taken by the Cast and Crew during the filming of GHOSTS\nThat\u2019s right! The cast and crew of GHOSTS will be armed with Polaroid Cameras throughout the shoot and you will receive a one-off polaroid taken by them. It could be anything from their time behind the scenes or an exclusive to you look at how we achieved the special effects. One unfortunate person will get a cursed polaroid of the face of The Long Lady.\nYou asked and we delivered. Limited Edition GHOSTS Jumpsuits are now available as part of the higher tiers ... including personalized ones too! \nNow, this one is something special. Either we will include a photo of you in the game itself or you will work with Jed and Visible Games to have your voice featured in the actual game! Yes, you will be one of the callers during a phone-in segment of the show. This is LIVE remember. Perhaps you\u2019ve seen the The Long Lady before, strange memories from your youth that you\u2019ve blocked out until now. Maybe you\u2019re experiencing supernatural manifestations and want to talk to someone about it.  Maybe you\u2019re just low-life prank caller! You will be immortalised in this one of a kind game.\nIf you want to check what items you will receive in your pledge, we've created this handy matrix for you to check too.\nSince Limited Run Games will not be shipping backers their physical copy until 2022. We have decided that shipping costs for physical items will be charged to backers after the campaign has concluded. \nShipping will be charged after this Kickstarter finishes and this will be based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a \"one size fits all\" mentality to shipping.\nAt present we have been advised that the shipping to the US and Canada should be around $5 whilst shipping to the RoW will be around $20.\nWe are working directly with Limited Run Games and will be using their fulfilment centers and partners to ensure that your order ships quickly and the DDP is included so that you can get your physical rewards without any extra hassles!\nBecause GHOSTS is 99% live action, production needs to begin before we can offer you screenshots or gameplay footage ... and even then we're going to be super careful that we don't want to spoil any of the surprises we have in store for you!\nWe have carefully calculated our budget so that we can afford the best of the best for this production. We have already heavily invested in creatures being fabricated by the Jim Henson Creature Shop and securing the services of our cast, stunt professionals and visual effects team.\nWe estimate that 55% of our Kickstarter funds will be put directly towards the production itself which is shaping up to be a huge affair. 35% of our funds will be used to produce the items that are being handled by the fantastic Limited Run Games.\nThis leaves around 10% which we will use as both a margin of error and for marketing purposes, but we hope you spread the word too!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst and foremost we absolutely love horror and gaming! However, obviously at the moment we're fully aware and taking as many precautions as we can against Covid-19. All members of the team will be taking regular lateral flow tests supplied by the London Medical Laboratory in order to ensure a safe working environment.\n\nWe are also working alongside industry leading stunt coordinators Lucky 13 Action (https://lucky13action.com/) who will ensure that all stunts will be performed in accordance with all regulations.\n\nAfter the shoot takes place then it's down to editing at the same time as finishing up the engine for the system. We will post updates frequently with regards to our progress. We truly believe GHOSTS will be one of these games to overcome the trying times and become a landmark moment in FMV gaming.\n\nThis motivation, above all others, is what drives us.\n\nIn terms of timing: we are targeting Feb 2022 for release. However, it does depend on our funding amount. The higher we go, the more hands we can bring \"on deck\" and get to work quicker. Ultimately, it is far more important to deliver a game that meets the expectations of our fans than to hit a date. We have already built a significant portion of the game, but we do have a lot of work to do.\n\nWe have carefully budgeted this project and believe that our funding goal is realistic to provide you with the experience you deserve.

Lizzy the Lightning Bug and her friends will guide young learners through the real-world engineering process of \u2018debugging\u2019, designing, and building circuits as they work together to untangle the secrets of Sparkdale.\nFollowing our Kickstarter, we plan to develop and release monthly expansion kits that can be purchased individually or through our subscription service. \nEvery kit comes with lesson plans that are carefully crafted to work for children in any learning environment. For educators, we will have free access to additional online guides and lesson plans. At home, new expansion kits ensure new concepts to explore. Your EdBoard will never collect dust on the shelf!\n\n\nWelcome to the town of Sparkdale, where all the learning takes place! As the newest city engineer of Sparkdale, you and your child will work hand-in-hand with Lizzy the Lightning Bug, using real-world engineering to solve the technical puzzles that have been befuddling the lovable EdBugs. Critters all over the city are wiggling with anticipation to meet their newest engineer! Explore Sparkdale through our circuit stories. Go on an adventure with the EdBugs as they introduce your child to all the awesome applications of circuitry.  \nWork through Circuit Stories to help the EdBugs of Sparkdale! As you read through your story, you will encounter and discover the befuddling problems facing the EdBugs. Then, by building circuits on your EdBoard, you will engineer solutions to help the town!\nMeet a new EdBug in every circuit story!\nExpand Sparkdale and meet new friends in our future expansion kits! Keep an eye out for our upcoming subscription service, which is the easiest way to stay up to date on all the most recent Sparkdale adventures!\nThe EdBoard is designed so that you don't need any previous circuitry experience to work with your kid. Any parent can easily use the EdBoard!\nIn our first three kits, your child will learn about...  \nThere's a lot more than circuitry that children need to succeed in STEM. That's why we use our kits to teach about more than just circuitry. EdBoards help prepare children to succeed in a variety of different academic subjects.\nThis is only the beginning of Sparkdale and more importantly your child's journey towards becoming an engineer and inventor. Here are just a few examples of the next three year's worth of Circuit Stories we have planned out.   \nWork with Lizzie the Lightning Bug to learn the first steps in circuitry.

With our Cardboard Builders, you get to do exactly that!\nPut together your cardboard product and build your circuit inside. Every time you assemble a cardboard builder, you learn a little more about prototyping and different ways to wire your projects. If you like building with your hands, this is the perfect place to start your circuitry journey!\nCardboard Builders are add-ons. All of our tiers with \"Creator Kit\" in their name come with cardboard builders. \nAdd the traffic light Cardboard Builder to the Main Street circuit story, the haunted elevator Cardboard Builder to the Haunted Hotel Circuit Story, and the tropical storm cloud Cardboard Builder to the Tropical Island Circuit Story.\nFrom the ages of 5-11, children are learning about the world around them at an incredible pace. Perhaps more importantly, they are discovering who they are. This is the age at which children are developing their sense of confidence based on their accomplishments. Because of this, frustrating and ineffective learning tools can discourage children from feeling like they can succeed and belong. In the case of electrical engineering, a lack of effective child-friendly tools can prevent children from wanting to enter the electrical engineering field altogether. The EdBoard was created with education theory in mind to encourage young learners to fix this issue.\n EdBoard is backed by research; a study from the University of Colorado that was published in ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC) 2020 found that children using EdBoards experience less frustration and are able to build circuits four times faster than children using traditional circuitry tools. The study also found that children who are taught how to create a circuit on an EdBoard are able to create the same circuit on industry-standard tools. This means that by using an EdBoard, children learn real-world skills that they can actually apply to a career in electrical engineering.\n$50,000 - Online Educational Materials/instructional Videos for teaching at home\n$75,000 - Choice of advanced or beginner curriculum\n$100,000 - Choose your EdBoard Base Color in our survey following the Kickstarter\n$200,000 - We include an additional 5 extra EdBoard connector components that allow you to connect your EdBoard to a Micro:bit or any other alligator clip interface.\nAt EdBoard, we believe that learning about STEM is fun, not scary. We understand that traditional STEM education can be intimidating. Education through play makes STEM approachable and boosts children\u2019s confidence, comprehension, and retention. Through this, we aim to inspire young learners and make STEM accessible for any child regardless of their background.\nAt EdBoard, our mission is to create a diverse toolset that inspires future problem solvers. With our Circuit Stories and Cardboard Builders, we hope your children are inspired to confidently build their skillset as they prepare for a lifetime of impactful work in the STEM fields. Our goal is to provide the best STEM tools for teachers, parents, and children.\nOur story began in 2017, in a small classroom at CU Boulder, with a group of students brought together by a common goal, increasing the accessibility of world-class STEM education for all children. From that moment to the present day, our team has been driven to realize the dream of the EdBoard: circuit education designed specifically for kids. Refined through countless iterations over the next three years, the EdBoard was perfected by feedback from our most important users: the children themselves. Our philosophy of putting children first was validated in the spring of 2020 when we competed in the New Venture Challenge, where out of 146 other startups EdBoard went on to become one of six finalists. Now, we are pleased to present the result of these efforts: the EdBoard v.1.0, designed specifically to reach children where they are. Fundamentally, our team believes in children: we believe they are intelligent, curious, and eager to learn about their world. Our goal with this product is to not only make that possible but to make it fun. We hope your child loves their EdBoard, and we can\u2019t wait to see what they create!\nWebsite: https://www.edboardtechnologies.com/\nResearch: https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/edboard-technologies\n You can reach us at: hello@edboardtechnologies.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1 - Production:\nEdBoard already has a mass-producible prototype that is ready for production.

Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually, as though they aren\u2019t in the same place together. \nHaunting beautiful, deeply personal, and highly innovative Alice is Missing puts a strong focus on the emotional engagement between players, immersing them in a tense, dramatic mystery that unfolds organically through the text messages they send to one another. Right at home with games like Life Is Strange, Gone Home, Oxenfree, and Firewatch, it\u2019s designed to feel as much like an event-style experience as it does a role-playing game.\nAlice Is Missing runs over a single session of 2-3 hours, with 3-5 players. In the first 45 minutes, players create their characters, their relationships to Alice, and their ties with each other. The next 90 minutes are spent uncovering secrets and unearthing clues in an attempt to discover where Alice is, and who is behind her disappearance.\nThough text messages seem to be the most common mode of communication in our modern era, they are rarely utilized as a storytelling medium.\nThe integration of texting into the gameplay unlocks a brand new way to play RPGs that is unlike anything you\u2019ve likely experienced before. It\u2019s personal, immersive, and perfect for remote play.\n\nPowered by simple but unique card mechanics that give everyone equal footing in telling the story, the game runs without a GM, or gamemaster, and instead empowers the players to create the story together.\nWhile in-game time is fluid and the text messages could take place over the course of a day or more, the actual gameplay lasts a total of 90 minutes and is accompanied by a beautifully cinematic, licensed music playlist (featuring artists such as Message To Bears, This Patch of Sky, Justin LaPointe, and Be Still The Earth) which acts as both a timer and a soundtrack for the game.\nYou\u2019ll start by choosing characters, drawing a motive for how that character acts, and assigning relationships to one another. Then, using the appropriate prompts on your character card, each player will record a secret voicemail to be played at the end of the game.\nYou\u2019ll then establish some important information about your town of Silent Falls by choosing suspects and locations you think could have played a part in Alice\u2019s disappearance. Lastly, you\u2019ll receive Clue Cards that will be used during the game to generate information about the mystery you\u2019re unraveling.\nOnce the timer starts and the game begins, you\u2019ll flip your Clue Card when the number on the timer hits the number on the Clue Card\u2019s back. This will often result in you drawing a card from the Suspect or Location deck and combining it with the prompt on the Clue Card to create the information your character uncovers.\nThis clue is then worked into the text conversation between the characters organically.\n\nThese clues will continue to be revealed throughout the game, building tension and heightening the stakes until the 10-minute card flips, and the game comes to its climactic end.\n Once the timer goes off at 90 minutes, players will have the opportunity to send one last text message before the secret voicemails play over the closing music track. Once the voicemails are finished and the current song ends, the game comes to a close. \nBy putting its lens on the relationships, tensions, and story arcs between the characters looking for Alice just as much as the search for Alice itself, the game challenges players to explore aspects of emotional intimacy and personal connection in a unique and accessible way.\nAlice Is Missing inherently deals with mature themes and potentially-difficult topics such as gender, sexuality, violence, and grief. We\u2019ve been lucky enough to bring on the incredibly talented Lauren McManamon (Girl Underground, Good Society: A Jane Austen RPG, Codex) as our editor to ensure these topics are approached in a thoughtful and responsible manner. \nWe\u2019ve also included important tools to help navigate these themes at the table (and off the table) to ensure everyone has both an exhilarating and positive experience.\nThough the game has been in development for the last year, in an unintentional way, it mirrors the reality we now face during this era of social distancing; the craving for connection despite the distance that may be between us.\nAlice is Missing provides a unique way to play without the traditional hang-ups that come with trying to structure a Virtual Table Top session. Since the only time you'll need to 'go to the table' is to grab a card. The meat of gameplay exists on your mobile devices.\n We\u2019ve put a great deal of work into ensuring Alice Is Missing will be available as a marketplace item on Roll20 not long after the campaign ends. With the lack of in-person gaming opportunities given the current social distancing orders in place around the world, we hope by making the game available in this format quickly, it will allow players to share a unique roleplaying experience together from the comfort and safety of their own home.\nThe Roll20 version of the game will not replace the use of players\u2019 phones for sending text messages back and forth during the game. It will instead serve as your shared table during online play, allowing everyone to interact with the cards that drive the narrative forward.\n For those of you who would rather not use Roll20, we are offering a PDF with a Print on Demand cards via DTRPG to use with your other messaging systems of choice. It\u2019s important to emphasize, however, that the cards need to be communally accessible individually via a cloud or other software to manage remote play in this way.\nWe plan to release the digital version of Alice is Missing in July 2020. We plan to release the physical version to our backers in November 2020, with the game being made available to stores soon after through a global publishing deal with Renegade Game Studios.

Up to 4 players take their heroes on a branching, narrative adventure, filled with tactical combat and meaningful choices. Thanks to the Chronicle System, the choices you make will impact not just your own story, but the future of the Divinity Original Sin universe.

I love the combinations of characters, abilities and locations. Lots of replay-ability. Over 900 cards!!! Also, the Chronicle System is so cool. The game features great strategy, while keeping the humour and rich world of the video game.\" -- Daryl Andrews, Game Designer\nRead from the story book and decide as a team where to go and how to respond to the world around you. Depending on the characters\u2019 traits and abilities, you might have unique options available to you during the sections. Pet Pal, anyone? \nStory choices direct you to explore locations. You place a unique set of cards around the game board. Every member of the party must choose which area to visit. Both the story and the artwork for the locations may discover clues of what to expect. Each player picks up their location card. Some reward your curiosity by rewarding with new treasure or recipe ingredients. Then again, some locations will have traps or lead into combat. \nCombat plays out over a number of rounds where players and monsters take turns acquiring action points (AP) and use them to move around, use items, and perform skills. Players use the skills they acquire throughout the game to perform unique and powerful attacks, some with additional elemental effects. Most skills require some cooldown time before they can be used again, so choosing which skills to use when is of critical importance.  \nThe iconic elemental interactions of Divinity Original Sin are here! Make a monster wet, so another player can hit it with ice to freeze it solid and keep it from acting. Or maybe your ally hits the enemy with lightning to make it stunned! Creating combinations is a must to ensure victory against the most challenging of enemies. Watch out though, because enemies can create combinations as well.  \nThe choices you make affect how the story unfolds during the campaign toward one of many possible endings. Certain paths, locations (and boss fights!) will only be available if your group makes certain choices. \nHowever, this is a Chronicle System board game, meaning your choices will also impact the direction of future Divinity board games. Each copy of the game has a unique one-use code enabling you to submit the choices you made during your adventure to the developers at Lynnvander Studios.\nWe will collect that information and use it to decide what happens in the next expansion for the game. Perhaps that merchant family has grown to be part of the nobility, and they will remember you saved them. If most players chose that course of action, the expansion will have some very appreciative nobles in it. Then again, if players took the other path, perhaps one of the merchant's descendants survived and seeks vengeance. With the Chronicle System, you not only change the course of your game, but also impact the future of Rivellon as a whole!\nThe submission code is a one-time use, but the game\u2019s campaign is not. Nothing in the game is destructible, and the branching nature of the story means players can play multiple times to explore avenues they didn\u2019t originally see based on their choices. A single playthrough of the campaign might only uncover 25% of the game\u2019s content. \nBelow are a series of highlight videos segmented to show you each of this games unique properties and game mechanics!

The biggest risks are that this is our first board game. We've mitigated this by working with veterans at Lynnvander Studios. We're working diligently to ensure all the pitfalls and roadblocks of manufacturing a physical product of this scale is minimized and clean, however, we only want the best possible product for you and factors such as delay's in molding and tooling, print errors and shipping delays are all something normal in the board game industry. \n\nIf that happens, it'll be because we hit a real roadblock or because some other factor out of our control ended up taking significantly more time and resources than we expected.

Every time a photo is taken, the camera\u2019s battery drains by a little, so players need to think very carefully about their next movement in order to make their way through the multiple levels. \nDuring the levels you will be able to find multiple collectibles, NPCs and maybe some secrets or easter eggs.\nYou can experience some of the gameplay by yourself by playing the demo.\nRandy is an enthusiastic photographer who wants to show everyone that he is ready to become a professional. In order to do that, he gets involved in a journey through Bokehland to find the Golden Camera, a sacred camera, which according to what his grandfather told him, could turn anyone into a true professional photographer.\nThe story of the game is going to be presented through some small cutscenes illustrated by Gaby Yoyo (my girlfriend), who is a very talented artist and is currently helping me doing some promotional art for the game.\nI had the idea to make Randy's camera many years ago, but I never had the opportunity to dedicate the time and effort necessary to finish it. Initially, it was going to be a project for college and it was basically a 2D photography simulator, it was very complex and also very boring for anyone who did not know about photography, so I adapted it to create a videogame that still had the essence of feeling like a photographer and also be fun for everyone.\nCurrently the development of the game is like 35% done, all the core systems are in place (movement, photography mechanics, dialogs, menus, overworld) and the game is already localized in English and Spanish languages.\nThese are some of the things left to do:\nImprove and polish the existing game visuals.\nCreate the graphics and layouts of various of the levels.\nAdd additional mechanics (like the capacity to undo some moves).\nIllustrate cutscenes.\nAPI implementation of the different platforms (achievements, cloud saving).\nMake the Level Editor (if the stretch goal is reached).\nMore music.\nDevelop the iPhone, Mac and Linux port (if the stretch goal is reached).\nA lot of testing.\nThe planned release date for the game is Q2 2020. I'm very confident that I can deliver an awesome and polished game for that date with the required funds. \nImportant note: If the Switch port goal is reached, it will be launched some time after the initial release.\nI always wanted to make a game about photography because I love photography and video games since childhood, but that is not the only reason why I'm making this game.\nI'm from Venezuela, and due to the political and financial situation of the country, I was forced to move to another place: Spain. This has been a hard journey, I left my family,  girlfriend and friends back in order to find some financial stability in another country to be able to help them. I have not managed to get a stable job, so I decided to invest some of my free time during the past 7 months in this project hoping to find some financial support to continue doing this game full time and be able to develop more games in the future.\nI'm putting all my heart and soul into this game because for me is not only a game, is the start of a new future for me, my family and my girlfriend. I love to make games since I was a little boy, so in addition to helping my family, this could also be an opportunity to fulfill my dream of becoming a game developer.\n DIGITAL COPY OF THE GAME\nOnce the game is completed, you'll get a copy of the full game in the platform of your desire.\nBECOME A NPC IN THE GAME\nBe in the game as a NPC. You can also have a custom message of your liking.

We are FULLY FUNDED! \nSphero Mini, Wowwee MiP, Sphero Bolt\nKinazium is a construction set for creating mazes and games for robots!  \nKinazium unleashes the potential of robots by giving kids the tools to design mazes, games and more for playing, racing and competing. At home or in school Kinazium engages kids for hours.   \nInvent and design mazes and games like this:  \nEach Kinazium includes:\n 4 Interconnecting Mats: each 20 x 20 inches, creating a 160 Sq. in. surface \n 44 Mixed Sized Flexible Surfaces: for walls, jumps, teeter-totters, hoops and more\n 80 Pegs: Multi-functional connectors of mats, surfaces, and sensors\n 2 Sensors: Wireless accelerometer sensors complete the game by adding timers, point scoring, or robot interaction\n1 Carry-Along Storage Bag\n\nRobotic School Programs love Kinazium!\nKinazium adds three dimensional challenges for robots that engage physics concepts into  curriculums. It can be used everyday, engaging kids to invent and create and collaborate. Easy to clean up and put away, and less tape on the floor. Infinitely expandable, a four pack can be used individually or combined to become Kinazium in the Gymnasium!  \nKinazium out and about at schools.\nKinazium is mazes, obstacles, racetracks and more   \n Design and Build                          Place Sensors                             Play & Compete!\nHow it works:\nKids design a maze, towers or games like skee-ball, sports games, anything they can imagine. They add in the sensors to complete the game - the sensors can be set to score points, subtract points, be timers or to interact with the robots.  \nThen the racing, or gamesmanship begins!   \nKinazium kits link together making it infinitely expandable. An 'evergreen' toy, it has long engagement playability because every time it comes out of the bag, new games and mazes are invented. We'll create add-on kits to continue to expand the universe of possibilities.\nKids get right on the floor and intuitively start building. Parents and Teachers love that kids are inventing and designing, using their hands and working together to create complex challenges for their robots.\n\nYour Robot is waiting for Kinazium!   \nNo Robot? No Worries! Check out our Robot Packages! \nKinazium is for Kids, Parents and STEM Educators\nCombine left and right-brain learning for an amazing playing experience. Benefits include:\nEducators love Kinazium because it brings new opportunity to their Robotics programs    \nComments coming in from other teachers:\nJean Hendrickson \u2013 I need to keep an eye of this one. It is going to be a classroom game changer.\nJami Sheilds - I want this so bad for my class of coders!\nKim Jackson Backer - These are awesome #teacherwishlist\nDebbie Guerin Kryspin \u2013 Have a classroom full of Sphero Bolts and minis - REALLY need this!\nKinazium is ready for prime-time  \nThe Team Behind Kinazium \nKinazium was invented by Taylor Scott, Hunter Reid, Emily Scott, Susan Crouse and Adam Kemp.  Their expertise in engineering and product development varies from successful startups to technical products for large companies; some products even earned technical Emmys.  \nWant to Hear More? \nClick here to listen to the BoulderTech Podcast Interview with Susan Crouse CEO, or the STEM Everyday podcast by Chris Woods.\n What's Next? \nBuild Kinazium and Augmented Reality Games\nKinazium and Augmented Reality\nSome robots give you the ability to develop your own games. With open source tools for creating Augmented Reality it's not a big a leap to create games with virtual opponents in your physical kinazium game! In this example we took a 3D animated character, attached her to the target and programed her to disappear if the target disappears, which happens when the robot rolls over the target. Knock out characters and Score! You decide the characters, you make the rules, you determine the scoring. You (and your students) are the creator of amazing robot games!\n We've Journeyed from Rapid Prototyping to Fully Tested and Ready to Manufacture \nKinazium has been extensively tested at home, in schools and at events, tuning the product until it is exactly right.  We've selected child safe materials with characteristics that unleash the imagination in kids.  We've designed the pegs to fit the hands of kids and adults.  We've set our supply chains in motion and have received samples for production. Traxart Toys is ready to launch Kinazium!  Join us on this exciting journey.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have tested with 100's of kids and now have gotten the ball rolling for manufacturing, and are working through our timeline.

You can play single player where you can attempt to beat your high score and unlock new mini-games and collectables or you can play multiplayer where you can show your friends how great you are at games (or not). \nSolo\n- You start on a random planet.\n- You complete 9 mini-games where you have to beat the timer/survive long enough to not lose a life.\n- If you have all of your lives by the end of the 9th mini-game, you will then fight a boss.\n- Bosses will be mini-game themed fights. \n- If you fail a mini-game, you must play a new mini-game. You must beat 9 mini-games to get a boss. If you fail the boss, you must repeat it to move onto the next planet. \n- For every boss you beat, you gain health back which carries on to the rest of the game. \nMultiplayer\nThere will be multiple multiplayer game modes available to play all of which will be able to be played with 2 - 6 players.\nPass the Bomb (2-6 players)\n- One controller will be used as the \"bomb\".\n- The game will select players randomly to pass the bomb to. \n- If you have the bomb, you must play the mini game assigned to you.\n- If you fail the mini-game, the bomb will blow up and you will be out of the game. \n- The game will continue until there is 1 player left. \n- The final player must complete a boss, if they fail, the game starts over with all players.\nRandomised (2-4 players)\n- Random players will get given mini-games, at a random order and at a random difficulty.\n- Whoever gets the most points by the end of the 10 mini games each, wins. \nCompetitive (2-4 players)\n- Take turns playing mini-games, all at the same difficulty level.\n- Whoever gets the most points out of the 10 mini-games wins.\n\nWe may add even more game modes for multiplayer! \nNote: Multiplayer is planned to be local multiplayer only however, depending on funding, we may make it online too! \nWill there be anything to unlock/achieve? \nYes! We know how everyone loves the satisfaction of 100%-ing a game. We want to add a ton of Steam achievements which will allow you to do just that!\nAs well as that, we want you to feel like you are progressing in the game and you are getting something from it, so throughout playing the game you will be able to unlock new characters, new planets and much more.\nWhat about future content?\nAfter initial release we hope to be able to continue to develop content for release over the next year. \nWhat can I play it on?\nCurrently, we plan on only releasing on Windows via Steam and Itch.io, however, depending on funding we may port to consoles and Mac.\n **Only available for Windows**\n ** The game is still in very early development, therefore the demo is short and sweet, we plan to release a longer demo in the future. This is just to show how the physics will work as the game progresses ** \nKeep up to date on the games progress via our Discord : https://discord.gg/7SPn5WX\nFollow us on Twitter: www.twitter.com/unboundint\nNote: Our community is a safe space for LGBTQ+ people, if you do not comply with the rules, you will be banned!\nUnbound Interactive have a core team of 3 but for this game, we will also be hiring 2 extra members to the team. All of the team members are students from Staffordshire University. \nDylan Hetherington - Dylan is our project manager and a developer of the company. \nRyan Nisbet - Ryan is our game designer and community manager of the company.\nJane Sheppard -  Jane is our finance manager and our second developer. \nExtra Team Members\nDaniel Bailey - Daniel would be our second artist working on the game if our goal is met.\nLauren Wilkinson - Lauren is our website designer, who we would love to be able pay to update our website. \nWe want Pixel Planet to be visually appealing which is exactly why Ryan has been putting all of his effort in and outside of work to practice pixel art. \nBoth Ryan and Daniel are very talented pixel artists who are incredibly excited to be working on this game. \nDaniel is a Staffordshire University student and a longtime friend of ours. We're very excited to be working with him. \nWe loved allowing our Kickstarter backers to design their own characters in Transhaping, however, we realised it wasn't all that exciting being able to design a shape.\nThis time, we have gone all out to make sure if you design a character, you'll love them and remember them. \nEveryone who backs a tier that allows you to design a character, enemy or ship will get a reference sheet showing exactly what they created, as well as that you have the option to add a backstory to the playable characters and some information about the ship and/or enemy you have designed.\nHere's an example of a ref sheet you would get:\n\nWe also have some set stretch goals which will be released later if we meet our goal, these include hiring artists to make more art to do with the characters, enemies, ships and planets in the game!\n\nThis is a concept Ryan has come up with for a mini-game that isn't included in the demo, you would have to jump between the platforms which seems simple right? however, as the gravity increases, you have less jump height and less movement speed!\n\nWe all love a game of Tetris, this is a concept that Ryan has come up with that involves a twist on that classic game. As the gravity increases, not only will the blocks will fall faster, making it much harder to succeed, you will also lose the ability to rotate blocks. \nThe Kickstarter for Transhaping was very lacklustre when it came to rewards, this was because it was our first game and our first Kickstarter, however, we have grown a lot since then!\nDuring this campaign, we would like to introduce some physical rewards however, we want to makes sure we reach our goal first so we can pay our artists and musicians.\nOnce our goal is reached, we will be adding physical rewards as well as add-ons which will allow you to pay more for extra rewards.\nYou can change your reward after you have chosen your initial tier, therefore, we suggest you choose a digital tier beforehand so we can meet our goal and then release physical tiers for you to change to! \n\n\nWe have decided to do a Kickstarter for Pixel Planet since we would love to hire people to help us make the game the best it can be. We're a group of 3 and this game is going to take a lot of art to make, therefore, we would love to hire Daniel to be part of the team and help us make sprites for the game. \nWe also loved having an original soundtrack for Transhaping and we'd love to be able to hire someone else to do music for Pixel Planet too! \nWe want to make this game great and for that to happen we need your help. \nOther things we need this money for include keeping a roof over our head, keeping our website updated and finally Steam and other development costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk we have when it comes to this project is not being able to meet our Kickstarter goal due to our community being small. We aim to get the word out there about the game, however, if we end up not being able to reach our goal, we may not be able to afford to pay our artist or musician. This means the game may not be as high quality as we would want it to be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Unbound Interactive\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nUnbound Interactive is a games development company based in Stoke-on-Trent.

Your playing in 1st person in a dogfight over the planet chasing drones as they attempt to enter the planets atmosphere.\n#3 is like Defender.

A short while later, a package will arrive with your first casefile.\nEvery case begins with an introduction\u2014a letter, a transcript, a handwritten note\u2014which establishes the murder you must solve. Additionally, the casefile includes several critical reference materials: a map and directory of the setting city; newspaper pages or clippings; photos, police reports and listings of expert contacts. It will also introduce the three characters you'll be sending out to investigate the crime.  \nFire up your brain! Read and study all the materials closely, looking for details and snippets of information which can put you on the path to the solving the crime. Take notes using the enclosed notepad and movement logs. Some clues are obvious. Some are not. \nConsult the map and directory to determine the first three leads to pursue. Send each investigator to a different location using your phone. Keep in mind, your investigators each have strengths and weaknesses. Certain characters may return better or more detailed information when sent to specific locations. While there are no 'wrong' or 'bad' moves, think carefully about who you send where.\nA few days later, replies from each investigator will arrive in the mail. Through their reports, you delve deeper into the case, discovering new clues, details, and people of interest, and opening new investigative threads (or closing old ones). Once you've processed all of the new information, select three more locations and send the team out again.\nRepeat the cycle until you're ready to solve! But remember, the killer is watching, and will do anything to avoid being caught. \nA great question, but difficult to answer. Murders By Mail cases don't have a fixed number of moves required to solve. You play at your own pace, taking as much or as little time between moves as you need. Our playtest groups have indicated that cases wrap up in an average of 8-10 moves, over the course of 3-4 months, but these are only averages. Everyone's game experience is unique. \nUltimately it's all up to your wits, attention to detail and deductive reasoning!\nFor more information, visit murdersbymail.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risks are delays from printing companies and box suppliers, but we've done enough of this kind of stuff to feel confident about our April delivery goal.\n\nWe've been actively playtesting for a year and continue to do so now.

In the last 2 years, we became USA's largest edible insect producer through our Network of Partner Farmer Program. Our Partner Farmers focus on raising quality USA grown crickets and we focus on tasty products. Support for us is support for over 6 independently owned cricket farms.\nDenver Bronco's star Emmanuel Sanders and Kathy enjoying some crickets!\nHi we are Kathy and James Rolin and we want YOU to eat crickets! \nKathy and James Rolin, Founders of Cowboy Cricket Farms\nBut what kind of crickets? Here's our answer!\nIntroducing three new flavors of Jumpers - whole roasted SuperCrickets!\nOur Smokey Jumpers, BBQ flavored whole crickets, have gone all over the world in their old plastic packaging. Our new craft paper bags are better looking and environmentally friendly! They seriously taste like BBQ chips and are made from real ingredients.\nNew Smokey Jumper Bag vs. old packaging\nOriginal and Smokey Jumpers are guaranteed by 20 December anywhere in the US if you pre-order the \"Holiday Specials.\" \nThe original are unflavored whole crickets. From the high quality of our cricket feed, our unflavored whole crickets taste like a sunflower seed. They have a nice crunch which goes wonderfully on salads and tacos.\nOriginal Jumpers\nOkay... okay!  Enough already... where are the new flavors?\nRight here:\nIntroducing .....\nWasabi Jumpers! Think wasabi peas but a whole lot better. For a spicy blend, they are strangely addictive, but they won't make you cry (like that one time I thought wasabi was guacamole). Try adding some to your next sushi roll.\nNinja Wasabi Jumpers\nTropical Mango Jumpers! Consider what would happen if Mango and Chili hung out together on a beach. \nTropical Mango Jumpers\nCinnamon Sugar Jumpers! If your county fair had crickets instead of elephant ears this would be the result.\nCinnamon Jumpers\nBut why SuperCrickets?\nBecause SuperHumans eat SuperCrickets!\nSuperHumans like Mike Ergo:\nSuperHuman Mike Ergo holding Marine Corp flag\nA USMC veteran, father, and kick-ass Ironman Triathlete!  He's Powered by Crickets at every race and is just one of thousands of SuperHumans that have joined us around the globe to bring crickets to the masses.\nSo what's so great about crickets?\nNUTRITION!!!!\nCrickets are a high protein, great tasting snack and can help boost your heart health, immune system, brain function, and cognitive performance. Paleo and Keto friendly, non-GMO, gluten free and made with all-natural, preservative-free ingredients.  \n2 X Iron compared to beef!\nIron deficiency is the leading health concern of the World Health Organization.  Up to 80% of the world's population has an iron deficiency and 30% have anemia.  We can fix this through diet and crickets are a perfect way to do this!  They are rich in bio-available heme iron which is easily absorbed in your body. \n2 X protein compared to beef!\nProtein is more than just muscle.  Your body can create most of what it needs from the food you eat, but not everything!  Crickets have all 9 essential amino acids (the protein that your body can't make itself), meaning that crickets will keep you stronger than plant protein.  Crickets pack quite a punch with 2 X the protein compared to beef too!\n45 X Omega-3 compared to beef!\nOmega-3 fatty acids are a natural anti-inflammatory that have some huge health benefits. They are proven to fight depression and anxiety, decrease ADHD symptoms, and even promote brain health. We know what you're thinking - \"I get Omega 3s from fish.\" Well you also are getting a dose of mercury. No, not the awesome but sadly deceased singer, the heavy metal that can accumulate in your blood stream and can cause issues with your nervous system.\nLet's be honest. Would you rather eat a delicious cricket or an anchovy?\nIn other words... crickets are freaking AWESOME - High in omega-3 and no mercury\n... okay, so what else ?\nWhy eat crickets?\nSustainability!!!\n2,060 X less water compared to beef\nWater is essential to life on Earth!  Unfortunately, our current agricultural practices waste millions of gallons of water every day.  Crickets are considerably more water efficient than cows meaning more safe drinking water for a growing population.\n14 X less feed compared to beef\nA lot of the land and water used for agriculture goes to growing feed for livestock.  If we reduce the use of feed then we reduce both water and land use as well!  Our feed is all made in the USA with super high quality grains and grasses ... you know, what crickets actually eat.  NO CORN and NO SOY in our feed!\n80 X less methane compared to beef\nCows are nasty!  They make tons (literally!) of methane and other greenhouse gas emissions each year.  Live stock produce more greenhouse gasses than all of the cars in the world combined!  But our crickets don't! Little butts make little toots and with how efficient crickets are they don't make much waste at all. \n100 X less land compared to beef\nCrickets don't need much room. Since they are grown indoors and  vertically they take less than 1% of the comparable land mass to grow the same amount of protein.  That's crazy!  This land savings means that we have more room for schools, houses, parks, and most importantly we can stop deforesting our planet!\nSo why Cowboy Cricket Farms?\nWe are a veteran-owned company right in Montana creating jobs for a hardworking people!\nWhy CCF?\nWe are a transparent company!\nPeople should know where their food comes from and how it's grown. Here's how we make our Jumpers, from start to finish. \nStep 1: Farmers\nAll of our crickets come from the amazing farmers in our Network of Partner Farmers, which is the first of its kind in the USA.  Just like co-op farming in dairy or berries, each one of these farms are independently owned.  We've created a whole new industry in Montana and the surrounding states that has in turn created dozens of new jobs.  Support for us is support for over 6 independently owned cricket farms.\nFarmers like Derek:\nOne of our cricket farmers at work\nStep 2: Freeze\nWe harvest the crickets in a humane and sustainable way.  Each cricket is harvested towards the end of its life (crickets only live about 8 weeks).  In nature, crickets would go into stasis (hibernation) as the weather gets cold enough.  In the Spring time the youngest, strongest crickets would wake back up and keep living their cute little cricket lives!  What we do is put the adult crickets into the freezer and after about 5 minutes they are in stasis.  After about an hour they are completely frozen, painlessly, and unable to wake back up.\nStep 3: Dehydrate\nWe don't roast at a high heat like most.  No, no, no!  We cook them low and slow!  This means more time, but also more flavor, and more nutrition since high temperatures denatures protein and kills nutrients.  It takes about 7 hours, but by keeping the temperature below 180 F we make sure that all of the awesome protein and fats that are naturally in our crickets stay there!\nDehydrating crickets!\nStep 4: Flavor\nNow comes the good part!  We hand toss the crickets in organic safflower oil grown in Montana then add the spices.  All natural and all delicious!  \nBowl of soon to be Smokey Jumpers\nStep 5: Roast\nTo sear on the flavor we roast the crickets for just 3 minutes.  Long enough to get the flavoring to stick, but not so long that we destroy any nutrients along the way.\nStep 6: Bag\nThe crickets are almost ready for you!  We measure them out into each bag by hand then seal the bag... ready for you to enjoy!\nStep 7: ENJOY!\nNow it's your turn.  Open up a bag and enjoy with your favorite recipe or as a snack.  Take on a hike, or chow down at home.  Share with friends... or keep them all for yourself!\nIt's your choice!\nPeople eating crickets\nWHO WE ARE:\nWe are no strangers to the challenges of small business owners. 4 years ago, we were in Bankruptcy Court with our 3 children, the youngest being a newborn. We lost everything: 2 houses, 1 business, and our car. Both of us are veterans; Asking for help was one of the hardest things we ever had to do. But, for about a year prior we struggled with feeding our children. When we walked out of Bankruptcy Court we looked at each other and declared we would never own a small business again. Little did we know our experience with food insecurity changed us forever. It was less than 2 years later when Kathy was drawn to edible insects.\nAfter attending Montana State University\u2019s Bug Buffet, Kathy was hooked on bugs as a sustainable food. She went home and told James \"we needed to start a cricket farm for human consumption\". He thought she was absolutely nuts! But Kathy wouldn\u2019t let it go and convinced him to look into it. We spent the next 6 months doing market research and found out the US edible insect market was a growing industry with positive implications for health and the environment. Who would have guessed that bugs could be the number one solution to help stem climate change? When comparing pound per pound (crickets vs cows), crickets use 2,060 times less water, 40 times less feed, and produce 80 times less methane than cows!\nCowboy Cricket Farms turns this amazing food source into consumer products. Chocolate Chirp Cookies, flavored crickets, and Cricket Powder are just some of our product offerings. However, we are expanding and growing. Not only are we expanding our product offerings, including more flavors of our delicious whole roasted crickets, but we are teaching others how to be cricket farmers to increase our supply. During our first year, we quickly learned we couldn\u2019t produce nearly enough to meet our demand. We struggled daily and came up with a solution! We started our Network of Partner Farmer program, the first co-op initiative for cricket farming. So far, we have inspired and given the tools and training for 6 independently-owned cricket farms to start and become a part of our Network. Many of whom have quit a conventional job to do cricket farming full time. We have another 12 partner farmers in the final stages of onboarding and over 200 applicants. From our amazing program, we quickly became the largest producer of the Common House Cricket in North America. We did this by believing in people not robots and by giving our knowledge for free through our YouTube channel.\nThe Whole Jumpers Line-up!\nAWESOME REWARDS AVAILABLE!\nWe've created some amazing rewards for you!\nWant to try out each flavor?

Here's what we see as the biggest threats and how we plan do solve them:\n\nLimited Production Quantity - Food grade crickets are a limited commodity! Luckily, through our Network of Partner Farmers, Cowboy Cricket Farms is the largest edible insect producer in the USA. This means that we can ensure enough production for our expected sales. If there is considerably more demand than expected it could result in a delay in production for later orders.\n\nFood safety - All food operations have an inherent risk. At Cowboy Cricket Farms we are FDA registered as well as licensed by the State of Montana. Additionally, Kathy has a background and several certifications in food safety to include HACCP and ServeSafe. All of our team is trained on proper food handling.\n\nFulfillment - We will work as hard as possible to get things out on time, but sometimes unforeseen issues arise. To reduce the likelihood of late orders we have already done the hard stuff! The recipes are completed, products sourced, and packaging designed. Now we just need your help to to get it all put together.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Chirp into action!", "descp": "Send some love and help to support this campaign.

Hundreds of people take part in our nine-day events, mixing experts trying out new ideas and technology and newcomers experimenting with generative software for the first time. Each event is packed with ideas, energy, friendly people and amazing projects.\nPROCJAM is more than just a jam, though - our mission is to bring generative software communities together, and to make their ideas and technology as accessible and welcoming as possible. We've created free art packs, streamed and archived expert talks, funded tutorials and translated them into multiple languages, and created a zine written by the PROCJAM community. We want to keep growing, supporting our community and welcoming new people into it, and you can help us by funding our Kickstarter for some exciting 2018 projects!\nWhy We Need Funding\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re planning to do with this year\u2019s funding:\nOne of our goals with PROCJAM is to make procedural generation more accessible to everyone. This year we want to try something new, by creating a downloadable example generative project, made in Game Maker, that people can explore, remix and customise. This will give people a great foundation that they can change and personalise and use to start their own adventure with generative software.\nTo make this happen, we\u2019ve teamed up with the incredible Lotte, who is an expert in game development, procedural generation and making beautiful, accessible tools. You can follow Lotte on Twitter here and see some of her amazing work here.\nSeeds is our amazing, community-written zine about generative software, which we began in 2016. Our 2016 and 2017 issues are full of dozens and dozens of articles from PROCJAM people about things they\u2019ve made, things they love and things they\u2019re thinking about - you can read them online here. This year\u2019s funding will pay for editing and design for our new 2018 issue, as well as launching a new website with HTML versions of all the articles for easy linking and sharing!\nGame critic, YouTuber and game jam expert Jupiter Hadley will be returning as editor and designer for our zine, and will help us put out another beautiful issue full of cool articles! You can learn more about Jupiter on her site, or follow her on Twitter here.\nPROCJAM doesn\u2019t rate its entries and it doesn\u2019t have a winner. Instead, we celebrate everyone\u2019s work each year by hiring game jam superstar Jupiter Hadley to come and make a compilation video of every single entry. She\u2019s been doing this since the very first PROCJAM, and we want to bring her back again this year.\nBacker Rewards\nBacking us at any tier means you're helping keep PROCJAM growing and supporting a cool community. We'll include your name in our zine and on our day of talks! PROCJAM has survived and grown these past five years thanks to your generosity and support - thank you so much!\nGenerator Tier - The 2018 Generative Bundle\nIf you back us at our \u201cGenerator\u201d tier you\u2019ll get our 2018 Bundle as a thank you - a collection of unfinished prototypes, sneak peeks at new projects, design notes and weird generator outputs from a host of cool people! This year\u2019s bundle includes surprises from:\nJanelle Shane - researcher & neural network expert \nANGELINA - an AI research project that designs games\nFreehold Games - developers of Caves of Qud\nMatthew Plummer-Fernandez - generative & digital artist\nJames Ryan - AI researcher and practitioner\nLycaon - game developer, artist &  2017 PROCJAM Grant Recipient\nMark Johnson - developer of Ultima Ratio Regum\nAs a bonus, we'll also send you a sneak preview of the Starter Pack as Lotte develops it, so you get a little look at how it's coming along before it launches!\nThank You\nHowever you support us, whether it\u2019s with a donation, helping to spread the word, or entering the jam, thank you so much. We are delighted to be celebrating the fifth year of PROCJAM, and hope to be here for many more!\nStretch Goals\nOur goal represents the minimum we need to keep PROCJAM's traditional activities going, and to make that all-important starter project for newcomers. But we'd like to do a lot more, following on from our success last year.\n\u00a33,500 - Community Tutorials\nThis stretch goal will fund four new tutorials written by our community and hosted on our site. Last year's tutorials went really well, and we want to return again this year and get community members to write some tutorials we can host and share with everyone. We'll be going about it a little differently last year, with some specific topics laid out as well as accepting general open pitches. \n\u00a34,500 - Unity Starter Project\nThis goal will extend our example project with a Unity version as well, helping people get going with a wider set of tools. Lotte will be working on this one too, so the projects will match up nicely!\n\u00a36000 - Tutorials, Translated\nLast year we managed to translate our community tutorials into Spanish and Arabic, and with your help we'd like to try and do that again.

Thanks for reading this campaign. :)  \nWhat is this funding for? \nA line of \"Villain\" themed corsets (that's the short answer). The long answer is that for a long time, I've had a dream to create a themed line of corsets to embrace the 'geek' community and make something truly unique and fun. I chose Villains because there are a lot of people out there who appreciate them, and have decided to do a mix of designs inspired by villains from classic, as well as modern fiction. \n Who am I? \nMy name is Leora, and I am the creative brains and gears behind a very small costume creation company called \"LARP It All\". Over the past few years, I've been working hard to build my business, and it's been pretty successful. \nBut Leora, if you're succeeding, why do you need a Kickstarter for this?\n Well folks, the fact of the matter is that corsets take time to make, and designing and assembling each one is going to be a process that I need to dedicate a lot of my heart and mind to. The Kickstarter will pay for materials and time spent, as well as (hopefully) advertising and branding to help REALLY get the business off the ground and maybe even get some of these put into local stores for purchase, someday! \nSo how many corsets are we talking? \n There are ten designs in total. The start of the campaign will reveal five. Beyond the initial goal of $2,000, we have stretch goals which will grant access to the other five designs and if we go beyond those? Well, let's just say THOSE stretch goals will be super epic. ;) (For photos of all ten designs, including the ones not listed here, check out our Facebook page! www.facebook.com/LARPItAll)\n\nAlright, enough yammering! Tell me about the corsets, already!\nWell, we have ten total designs, but we are ONLY debuting five for the initial launch. If we do really well, we will release the other five (which are REALLY epic) as stretch goals. (*Please see the Stretch Goals question below the photos for more info about what that entails)\nCurrent designs: \n\"Dark Fairy\"\n\"Dark Fairy\":  Black velvet with purple velvet accent front where the busk closure will be. Green flame satin applique atop the black velvet. \n\"Evil Queen\"\n\"Evil Queen\": Indigo/purple satin with a false belt in the middle in red leather. White trim on the top to emulate a collar, and a golden medallion false necklace hanging from the top over the center busk. \n\"Sea Witch\"\n \"Sea Witch\": Black garment leather corset dress wherein the skirt will be made of two shades of purple chiffon that hang down like tentacles. Dark embroidery (black on black) on the body of the corset will add depth and detail. \n\"Claudius\"\n \"Claudius\": Reddish brown leather with black velvet accents at the top starting at a point and growing wider around the back of the corset. Applique 'claw slashes' on the sides toward the front done in hide colored leather. \n\"Impaler\"\n \"Impaler\": Corset top meant to look like a suit jacket over a white frill shirt and a matching bolero coat (sleeveless) in black canvas cotton. There will be small red spots done in embroidery on both false shirt and coat lapel to implicate blood.\n\"Mother Dearest\"\n\"Mother Dearest\": Burgundy velvet tank top style corset with elbow-length bell sleeves. Small designs will be embroidered throughout in a slightly darker shade. Gold and black trim at all edges. \n\"Monster\"\n\"Monster\": One half of the corset will be made of pinstripe black/dark grey wool with a small pocket for a watch. The other half will be assembled of patchwork leather in varying shades of green to emulate the monster that was created. Patchwork will be sewn as if by hand to add to the illusion.\nSo what about stretch goals?\nThere are five corsets shown in concept drawings in the video that AREN'T shown in the photos. They are NOT currently available. The only corsets you can currently get are the ones pictured above, and as awesome as they are, we know you want the others too.\nOnce we hit our initial goal of $2,000, we'll start moving into STRETCH GOALS. Here's a breakdown of what that means.\n$2,500: We release \"Mother Dearest\" (and we will update the picture list accordingly). UNLOCKED!\n$3,000: We release \"Monster\" (and we will update the picture list accordingly). UNLOCKED!\n$3,500: We'll start updating the designs to add more detail and intricacy to the existing designs to make them even MORE amazing and epic. It could be added embroidery, sequins, or even nifty accessories.\n$4,000: We release \"Crimson Dragon\" (and we will update the picture list accordingly).\n$4,500: We release \"Wickedest\" (and we will update the picture list accordingly).\n$5,000: We release \"White\" (and we will update the picture list accordingly).\nThere ARE stretch goals beyond this, but we'll release those if it looks like we're getting close to them.\n\nOnce this Kickstarter is funded (*crosses fingers*), we will be working hard to get your orders done. After that, we'll take photos of the work we create and they will go up on our Etsy store for sale at MUCH higher prices, so if you want to get in on this, NOW IS THE TIME.\nHow do I know what size I should give you when you contact me? Is my size even available?\nDon't worry. We will have all corset sizes available. Once we get funded, we'll contact you directly and send you a handy measuring guide and sizing chart so you know which size you need. Then all you have to do is tell us what size and what corset you want, and we'll do the rest. :)\nLast notes:\nI just want to say thank you. When I talk about my business on Facebook or in other advertising, I always use the royal 'we', but the truth of the matter is that all this work gets done by just one person (although I did just get my first apprentice). If this gets funded, you are helping to fund one persons very starry-eyed dream, and I couldn't be more grateful.\n\nPLEASE please share if you cannot donate. It means the world to me, and every share will help make this a success.

A single mcSquare is 4 different useful products in one: a portable dry-erase tile, a transparent dry-erase board with magnetic connections, a liquid chalk wet-erase board and a guided dry-erase tablet.\nEach Surface Stacks On Top Of Another\n3-Dimensional Dry Erase Board\nThe world's best team dry-erase system.\nIn this high-tech environment, businesses still consistently use dry-erase boards to collaborate, innovate and refine concepts - but these whiteboards don't effectively facilitate creative thinking and individual contribution. While there are \"apps\" that attempt to help companies brainstorm and visualize ideas, there is no substitute for sketching your ideas on a smooth dry-erase board. \nWith mcSquares, everyone\u2019s ideas are heard, valued and shared: even those ideas which are routinely kept private by people who aren't comfortable in group settings.\nThoughtfully designed for incredible innovation.\nmcSquares were developed to democratize meetings by pulling the focus away from the facilitator and empowering everyone in the room to join in the creative collaboration. Our mcSquares are personal, dry erase boards designed to get people in a meeting room to contribute their best ideas.\nSliding mcSquares\nmcSquares have strong, rare-earth magnets so you can put them on your fridge, file cabinet or even a larger, magnetic dry-erase board. The mcSquares system is infinitely scaleable to fit your collaboration needs.\nLet mcSquares completely revolutionize your meetings by maximizing the creative capacity of your team. It\u2019s truly magical to see fresh ideas come to life through the use of our collaboration system.\nCollaborate Better In Any Space\nFor Educators Too!\nmcSquares have deep roots in education. Our \"version one\" product launched in 2014 and is already improving the student experinece in hundreds of schools around the world. In a study conducted by the University of Denver, mcSquares have been shown to improve passing grades by a whopping 340%, while improving overall test scores by 48%. \nmcSquares in the classroom\nNow we are launching the new \"4-in-1\" mcSquare based on all the great education customer feedback. Improvements from version one include:\nmuch easier to remove the transparent top to swap out drawing guides\neasier to attach the boards to our magnetic whiteboards\nmore rugged and durable for the demands of full-time classroom use\nthey \"stack\" - allowing students to layer their ideas on each other\nmore sleek design that feels more familiar to hold (feels like a tablet)\nIf your school can't order on Kickstarter, email us and we can help!\nsales@mcsquares.com \nAdded Bonus \nWe've just added our newest addition to the mcSquare product family - the mcSquare Anti-Gravity Dry-Erase Markers.\nGravity is the biggest enemy of dry erase markers. Store them right side up and they dry out quickly, store them upside down and the ink can pool up and permanently destroy the tip.\nAfter thousands of disappointing tests at the mcSquare lab with existing pens, we decided the best thing to do was to create our own marker to combat the negative impact of gravity to dry-erase ink in those pens.\nThe mcSquare Anti-Gravity Dry-Erase Marker magnetically attaches to magnetic surface horizontally, for longer life and better writability\nThe Polyester Fiber Resin Chisel tip allows you to write beautifully, both thin and bold lines.\nThe embedded bottom magnet attaches to any magnetic dry-erase board - and they also align to snap directly to your mcSquares.\nThe mcSquare Anti-Gravity Dry Erase Pen comes in 6 bold colors: Deep Red, Bright Orange, Pop Purple, mcSquare Teal, Neon Green and Black\nThese are the best markers you\u2019ll own - we guarantee it\nAs a thank you to our backers, we are adding the mcSquares Anti-Gravity Markers to every mcSquares pledge here, or you can buy them on their own at an awesome Kickstarter discount!\n We can\u2019t wait to get these in your hands!\nRewards\nmcSquare Kickstarter Rewards\n Timeline\nmcSquares V2 Timeline\nOur Team\nthe Comsero team (makers of mcSquares)\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur first Kickstarter project for mcSquares version 1 was delivered late due to manufacturing issues and shipping delays coming from China. \n\nThis new product line is now manufactured and assembled here in the beautiful state of Colorado - and we have much more control over timing and product delivery.

We\u2019ve worked with thousands of students, and we\u2019ve found that the earlier youth are introduced to the fundamental concepts and mindsets (in fun and age-appropriate ways), the easier it is for them to develop these skills.\nI\u2019m a mom of two (Maxwell is 3 and Alexander is 1.5). I\u2019ve found stories to be one of the most powerful ways to engage my kids in big ideas-- from potty training to being kind to others, and now to coding-- so I started experimenting with different coding stories with my 3-year-old. He\u2019s hooked and loves being my first test reader.\nWe\u2019ve been introducing these stories into our classrooms, and the children have loved them and thrived with them. Now we want to make the stories available for children everywhere to enjoy and learn the basics of coding.\nKids interact with the book!\n \"We really enjoyed reading these stories together. They were fun and interactive.\" - Parent of 3 kids ages 3, 5, and 8 in Diamond Bar, CA\nInstructor reading the book with a student in a CodeSpeak Class\n    Fun Books with a 21st Century Twist\nHow to Turn Your Grown-Up into a Robot and Other Coding Stories is an old-fashioned picture book with a twist. It\u2019s a physical book that engages the kid reader and encourages them to interact with the book by tapping and choosing from different options, using many of the tactics that make devices so entertaining.\nOne of the biggest challenges for parents who don\u2019t know how to code themselves is figuring out how to help their children learn. CodeSpeak Books are educational for parents, too. The stories increase in complexity through our Step Into Coding system.\nThere are three types of coding stories:\nLevel 1: Build the foundation (Ages 2-5): Learn the major concepts through stories. Sequences, Logic, and Events.\nLevel 2: Learn functionality (Ages 3-6): Computational thinking with visual block code. Repeat Loops, Conditionals, and Functions.\nLevel 3: Ready to code (Ages 5 and up): Transition to real programming code with syntax. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\nChildren learn the big concepts while getting used to how code looks visually, so that when they are older they see code as an old friend rather than the intimidating gobbledegook that adult learners see when looking at code for the first time.\nCodeSpeak Books feature actual code that\u2019s used on the leading online coding platforms, making an easy transition for those parents who eventually want to help their students plug the code into a computer. We've received permission to use the characters and code from Scratch (MIT), Code.org, and Bitsbox.\nThe Stories\nCover\nOur long-term plan is to create a year\u2019s worth of curriculum for parents and teachers, with stories increasing in complexity. This Kickstarter campaign will help us publish the first book, which includes three stories, one at each level.\nLevel 1: How to Turn Your Grownup Into a Robot\n  CodeSpeak Books are like \"See Spot Run\" for Coding!\n  Example pages from How to Turn Your Grownup Into a Robot\nComputer coding is all about telling the computer (or robot) what to do in a way that the computer will understand. Kids learn this concept while having fun getting their grown-up to make silly sounds and motions. We cleverly incorporate the concept of variables through funny emojis that take on different values throughout the story.\nParents willing to be silly required! Kids who love BJ Novak\u2019s The Book with No Pictures will also love this book.\nHappy reader!\n\"OH MY GOODNESS! I can't even begin to tell you how much I am in love with this book. I have not seen my son so excited about a book in a long time. I love how it is so Interactive! We were giggling together within one page. The interactivity with the variables in the first story is genius.\" - Parent in Wichita, KS\nWhat's funner than story time? Story time with ROBOTS!\nLevel 2: Let\u2019s Play with the ScratchJr Kitten\nExample pages from Let\u2019s Play with the ScratchJr Kitten!\n The ScratchJr Kitten is an icon of the children\u2019s coding world. Your child will code an awesome playdate for the ScratchJr Kitten, including painting and giving magic disappearing powers to a friendly dog.\nThe ScratchJr Kitten is a mischievous little one! This Kitten\u2019s got a personality that appeals to kids who love Drew Daywalt\u2019s The Day the Crayons Quit.\nThe characters from this story live on the coding app ScratchJr, where you have the option of showing your child how the code from the story works.\nParent with homeschooled children (ages 6 and 9) all getting into it!\n \"My 6 year old was so excited to program at a level appropriate for him. We had a lot of fun as a family with these stories!\" - Parent in Antelope, CA\nFather-Son bonding over code! Get a conversation going about how to CREATE technology!\nLevel 3: Do You Love Cookies?\nTitle Page of Do You Love Cookies?\n  Example pages from Do You Love Cookies?\nThis story has real code. Parents who don\u2019t have CS backgrounds-- don\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t need to understand all the code to make the story fun.\nEvery turn of the page reveals a new surprise that the code produces. Kids who love Herv\u00e9 Tullet's Press Here will love this book!\nAfter reading the story, parents have the option of typing the simplified JavaScript from their story and seeing their code come to life on www.bitsbox.com.\nMaxwell critiquing an early draft\n  What are these CodeSpeak students so focused on? Coding cookies!\n \"We like how the stories present beginner concepts in easy-to-understand ways.\" - Curriculum Specialist for Computer Science in Lincoln, NE\nStories make code fun, not intimidating!\nCodeSpeak Books in the News\nSelect Coverage:\nLate Night Parents: Audio Interview with founder Jen Chiou\nThe Story Exchange: 5 Crowdfunders to Watch \u2013 Inclusion, Empowerment and Education\nWeekend Jaunts: CodeSpeak Books Introduces Picture Books to Teach Kids to Code\nWho am I?\nMy Family\nI\u2019m Jen, the founder of CodeSpeak Labs, which provides instructors to run computer programming classes in PreK-12 schools.

I\u2019ve also supported the creation of more than a dozen teacher recruiting organizations around the world (Teach For All), built online tools for a social good media company (GOOD Magazine), and consulted for nonprofits (Bridgespan). I graduated from Stanford, where I was highly envious of my peers who came to college already knowing how to code.\nMost importantly, I\u2019m mom to Maxwell and Alexander, who I hope will get to enjoy these books one day soon.\nSpecial thanks to...

Recently, we were gathered together to discuss how best to achieve these goals. We talked, as humans talked: over drinks, and we drank, as humans drink: from cans.  \nIt was this fact that brought us to the topic of a problem that has plagued humanity for centuries.  \nOur cans, like all cans, were disappointingly short.  \nWe first talked about how to solve the problem physically, but we quickly realized that limitations of materials, manufacturing, and economics prevented a practical solution.  \nIt then dawned on us that there was another way to bring this important experience to mankind. Thanks to modern advances in consumer technology, virtual-reality is now available in the homes of people all over the world. No longer are we limited by the mundane rules of physics. Finally, we are free to explore the limits of our imagination.  \nThus, I\u2019m proud to present our revolutionary new virtual reality experience. We call it:  Canlonger.  \nWith Canlonger, along with an Oculus Rift Touch or HTC Vive, not only have we created the most accurate and flexible virtual-can-simulator in the world, but now, using Cribzero\u2019s cutting edge, patent pending CANLONGING technology, you can finally feel the satisfaction of creating, opening, and virtually drinking from a beverage can as long as you desire.  \nDon\u2019t believe me? Don\u2019t need to. We\u2019ve already built a working prototype, but it needs a lot of polish before we can release it to the public. That\u2019s where you come in.  \nFor our base goal, we\u2019re keeping it simple and realistic. You\u2019ll create a can from colorful choice of virtual brands, and then use your controllers and Cribzero\u2019s PATENT PENDING canlonging technology to stretch the can to whatever length you like. Finally, Listen to the satisfying hiss as you crack the can open with the virtual tab, and virtually drink to your actual heart\u2019s content.  \nNow, we know what you\u2019re thinking, this advanced technology will come at a steep cost, right? In fact, we feel so strongly about this software\u2019s ability to improve the human experience, we will be releasing CanLonger to the public COMPLETELY FREE. This is why we need your help to make this dream come true, not just for us, not just for you, but for all of humankind.  \nDoes it end there? Of course not. We have a nearly endless list of ideas on how to improve the virtual drinking experience. We\u2019re willing to go great lengths to keep advancing the software. As such, we have boiled our favorite potential features into stretch goals that will help people feel drinking satisfaction for decades to come.  \nWant to create a can of a specific length? One of our goals is to include a virtual ruler in every copy of CanLonger.  \nWho doesn\u2019t love tailgating? How about an extra long cooler, to give you the virtual feel of plunging your hand into the ice and extracting an ice cold can of Mountain Gumption that\u2019s as long as your truck bed is wide?\nJust imagine the satisfaction of crushing a 4 foot long empty can against your forehead with realistic can-crumpling physics?  \nOf course, all backers will be rewarded with a restful night\u2019s sleep knowing that they helped bring this dark era in human existance to a close, but to show our appreciation for those who choose to support our vision, we\u2019ve also created a number of rewards almost as satisfying as a cracking open a meter long can of Crystal Creek.  \nFor just 10 dollars, we\u2019ll put your name in the ingredient list of every can in canlonger.  \nPerhaps you'd like to show how much you care about humanity's drinking satisfaction by proudly wearing a stylish Canlonger long-sleeved T-shirt?\nEarly t-shirt concept\nIf you want something physical that you can keep to celebrate your virtual triumph, we\u2019ll billet mill you a scale sculpture of a satisfyingly long can out of a SOLID BLOCK OF ALUMINUM. (b-roll of lathe)\nFor those who are truly dedicated to the the cause, you can send us pictures of your drinking room at home, and we\u2019ll work with you to model it out in 3d so you can enjoy a virtual drink in the comfort of your own virtual real-home.  \nNow comes the time to act. Support us in creating a new world free from the disappointment of never having experienced the joy of drinking from very, very long virtual cans.\nStretch goals:\n$3000 - A Ruler\n$4000 - A \"snap-to-inch\" option\n$5000 - Digital length entry in feet/inches\n$5100 - Digital length entry in feet/tenths of inches\n$5200 - Digital length entry in feet/hundredths of inches\n$5500 - Fractional length entry in feet/inches\n$6000 - Digital length entry in metric length units\n$10,000 - A really long cooler filled with ice\n$20,000 - a much higher fidelity indoor scene! \n$30,000 - a high fidelity outdoor scene.

A journey through our entire galaxy, the Milkey Way, would last 120.000 years...with the speed of light! and it contains of 300 billion stars. A journey to our nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, would last around 2.5 million years with that speed. And there we are, at the first tiny dot, next to our own tiny dot in the center of this very sphere. If you add the next 100 000 Galaxies you can see the structure of Laniakea, our home supercluster. Laniakea is around 160 megaparsec in size and of cause surrounded by even larger structures.\nThe diameter of the cloud of galaxies in the sphere is around 250 megaparsec (Mpc). One Parsec is equal to 3.2616 lightyears, which means, that the cloud is 815.400.000 lightyears in diameter. 815 million years of travel, with the speed of light, captured in an 8cm glass sphere. \nWith all these information, this sphere convinced me, that we can\u00b4t be alone in the universe. \nHow is it made?\nI took a katalogue of galaxies and chose every galaxy in a radius of 125 Mpc. I converted the data and found a company, which was able to laser these 675 758 galaxies into a glass sphere. Some galaxies were to close to each other, so they merged together. There are in total 380 000 dots in this 8cm (3.14\") sphere and it weights 0,8Kg (1,76lb). The inner structure reflects light, so it looks really nice, if you put it on an LED, but it is also really good to see without an extra light. The brightness changes with the perspective, so you can spend hours looking into the Sphere. It comes in a black gift box with black velvet inside.\nPLAY\n\nUniverse Sphere in it\u00b4s box.\nExtension:\nThese are some pictures of the Sphere on the polyamid bases on the LED-Base Plate.\n\"LED fitting Base\" on the \"LED Base Plate\"\nI finished the first bases you could buy as an extension. They will be 3D-printed in different colors and materials such as polyamid, steel and some precious metals like pure silver and gold coated brass.\nPLAY\n\nHexagonal Grid Base, Pure Silver\nHexagonas Base, Black Plastic\nRound Base, Black Plastic\nMy Motivation:\nThe idea of the Universe Sphere came to me, after I was watching the video \"the power of ten\" and the more recent video \"a cosmic voyage\".It showes how incredibly huge our observable universe is and I wanted to see the structure of our universe in 3D with my bare eyes. So I decided to create a more concrete view of it, by lasering this tremendous structure in a glass sphere. I was so impressed by what came out of that, that I decided to make it available for all the universe-loving people outside, who try to understand the gigantic dimension of the place we exist in. To make it affordable, I need to order a large amount of Spheres and for that...I need your help!  \nYou can watch the clip \"A Cosmic Voyage\" on youtube and I promise, it is mindblowing.\nDeutsch:\nZu der Struktur im Inneren:\nJeder gelaserte Punkt entspricht nicht nur einem Stern, sondern einer ganzen Galaxie mit milliarden von Sternen. Eine Reise durch unsere eigene Galaxie, der Milchstra\u00dfe, w\u00fcrde 120.000 Jahre dauern, mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit! Sie besteht aus ca. 300 milliarden Sternen. F\u00fcr eine Reise zu unserer Nachbargalaxie, der Andromeda Galaxie, w\u00fcrden 2,5 millionen Jahre ben\u00f6tigt. Und da w\u00e4ren wir nun bei dem n\u00e4chsten kleinen Punkt neben unserem kleinen Punkt angekommen. F\u00fcgt man diesen beiden Galaxien noch weitere 100 000 hinzu, erkennt man den Laniakea Supercluster, der wiederum von weiteren noch gr\u00f6\u00dferen Strukturen umgeben ist.\nDer Durchmesser der Punktewolke entspricht ca. 250 Megaparsec (Mpc). Ein Parsec entspricht 3,2616 Lichtjahren, was bedeutet, dass die Wolke einen Durchmesser von ca.815.400.000 Lichtjahren hat. Diese unvorstellbar gro\u00dfe Struktur, in der es 815 millionen Jahre dauern w\u00fcrde, mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit von einem Ende zum anderen Ende zu fliegen und in der 380.000 Punkte enthalten sind, kann man jetzt in einer 8cm gro\u00dfen Glaskugel in seiner eigenen Hand halten. \nDiese unvorstellbaren Mengen an Galaxien mit jeweils Millionen von Sternen, haben mir gezeigt, dass wir nicht alleine im Universum sein k\u00f6nnen.\nWie wird sie gefertigt:\nIch habe aus einem Galaxienkatalog alle Galaxien in einem Umkreis von 125 Mpc ausgew\u00e4hlt und diese so umgewandelt, dass eine Firma sie in eine Glasskugel lasern konnte. Aus 675 758 Galaxien wurden 380 000 Punkte, da einige f\u00fcr den Laser schlichtweg zu nah aneinander lagen. Die Kugel misst 8cm im Durchmesser,  wiegt ca. 800gramm und wird in einer schwarzen Geschenkbox geliefert. Die Struktur im inneren reflektiert Licht, sodass sie von verschiedenen Perspektiven unterschiedlich hell wirkt. Man k\u00f6nnte sie gut auf einen beleuchteten Sockel stellen aber auch ohne Lichtquelle sieht sie fantastisch aus, sodass man Stundenlang ins Innere der Kugel starren kann.\nErweiterung:\nMomentan arbeite ich an 3D-gedruckten Sockeln f\u00fcr die Kugeln, die ich freischalten m\u00f6chte, sobald das Projekt sein Finanzierungsziel erreicht hat.\nMeine Motivation:\nDie Idee der Universe Sphere kam mir, nachdem ich das Video \"a cosmic voyage\" auf Youtube gesehen habe. Es zeigt, wie unglaublich gro\u00df das beobachtbare Universum ist und in was f\u00fcr einer fantastischen Struktur die Galaxien angeordnet sind. Diese Struktur wollte ich gerne mit blo\u00dfen Augen in 3D sehen k\u00f6nnen. Daraufhin habe ich recherchiert, woher ich die Koordinaten der Galaxien bekommen kann, wie ich diese umwandele und letztenendes habe ich eine Firma gefunden, die mit meinen Daten eine Glasskugel lasern konnte. Das Ergebnis war so erstaunlich, dass ich mich entschieden habe, mein erstes Kickstarter Projekt zu starten. Um den Preis der Kugel von \u00fcber 90\u20ac auf unter 50\u20ac zu bekommen muss ich allerdings eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Menge bestellen.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Up to 9 Spheres", "descp": "In this Reward you can pledge for up to 9 Spheres.

We carried that ambition to Kickstarter when we set such a high target goal. Over 1,500 backers have pledged more than $300,000. That is incredible. It\u2019s truly inspiring to see how many people out there care about the future of space exploration and want to make sure we get that first glimpse at another planet like ours.\nAs we move forward on this journey, please be part of our mission, share your thoughts, and stay involved. We\u2019ll keep an eye on Kickstarter, and may send an update from time-to-time. But if you want more frequent updates, as we hope you do, we encourage you to join our mailing list at projectblue.org.\nAs a remember \u2014we can\u2019t do this without you. So, please, consider a tax-deductible donation to help us launch the telescope that could find another Earth.\nDonate to Project Blue\nOther ways to stay involved: \nSign up for our newsletter on the Project Blue website to receive regular mission updates \nFollow us on Twitter and Facebook and share our content with your friends \nLearn about our partner orgs: Mission Centaur, BoldlyGo Institute, and SETI Institute\nThank you for supporting and being part of Project Blue.\nFinding the first planet like Earth beyond our solar system would transform how we think about our place in the universe.\nTen years ago, we didn\u2019t know if planets like Earth were common in the universe. Then NASA\u2019s Kepler mission launched, and changed everything. Kepler discovered thousands of rocky planets orbiting stars, some of which are at a distance where liquid water could exist on the surface. It\u2019s estimated that there are more Earth-like planets in the universe than people alive today. But we\u2019ve never actually seen one.\nThanks to recent breakthroughs, the technology now exists to capture a direct image of an Earth-like planet outside our solar system. That's what we aim to do.\nProject Blue is a consortium of leading space and research organizations on a mission to build and launch a small space telescope to observe planets around our nearest stellar neighbors: Alpha Centauri A and B (now also known as Rigil Kentaurus). \nOur goal is to capture an image, visible to the human eye, of orbiting planets. Seeing a \"pale blue dot\" could indicate the presence of oceans or an atmosphere \u2014 the potential to support life. It would be our first view of another world like our own. With a modest budget and a planned launch by 2020, this goal is tantalizingly close.\nThis isn\u2019t a traditional space mission. \nWithin astrophysics, NASA has traditionally funded projects with a much broader scope, like Kepler and Hubble, rather than a project like ours that is focused on a single target. So we started this campaign with the belief that together, people all over the world can push the boundaries of discovery in space and achieve one of the greatest milestones of human exploration. \nWe need your help.\nProject Blue brought together the technical experts who can build and launch this telescope: scientists from nonprofit organizations like BoldlyGo Institute, Mission Centaur, the SETI Institute, and the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Now we\u2019re asking for your support to make Project Blue a reality. \nFollow Project Blue on Twitter, like and share on Facebook, and visit us at projectblue.org. \n  \"The first telescope to photograph a 'pale blue dot' of another Earth in a distant solar system may not be funded by NASA, the European Space Agency, or some other government agency.\nIt might come from Kickstarter.\" \n\u2013 Business Insider\n  This mission won't be possible without the design and research you\u2019ll support. \nWe need $1 million to lay the groundwork for the mission through preliminary analysis, design, and simulations. \nWe\u2019ll design the system architecture based on detailed requirements laid out by our Science & Technology Advisory Committee (STAC). This is how the telescope, coronagraph, spacecraft bus, and ground system all work together to acquire, store, transmit, and process the pictures that the Project Blue mission will take. After initial design, we\u2019ll run mission simulations to predict performance, and will make a Mission Performance Simulator available online for backers to run their own simulations. We will also be able to obtain materials for constructing the primary telescope mirror. \nSeeing Blue: What Are We Looking For?\n(L) Voyager's pale blue dot photo of Earth from the edge of the solar system (R) A simulated image of the photo we aim to take.

But to know more about a planet\u2019s Earth-like properties, such as whether it hosts water or oxygen, we need more specific detection methods.\nWith advanced optics technology, we\u2019ll use a technique called \u201cdirect imaging\u201d to dim the light from the stars in Alpha Centauri, enabling us to see any surrounding planets. By working in visible light, we hope to gather key details about their composition. Capturing an image of a planet \u2014 actually seeing it in visible light \u2014 will help us begin to characterize its atmosphere and surface characteristics, especially its potential for oceans. If the planet appears blue \u2014 similar to the \u201cpale blue dot\u201d image of Earth taken by Voyager at the edge of our solar system in 1990 \u2014 it could suggest the presence of liquid oceans and a substantial atmosphere. We\u2019ll be able to see the first indications about its capacity to support life.\nThe Telescope\nPLAY\n\nOur 45-50 cm aperture telescope is small enough to fit on a coffee table, but powerful enough to pick up a planet over a billion times dimmer than its star \u2014 from four light years away! That\u2019s like seeing a tiny firefly buzzing around a lighthouse from ten miles away. Since Alpha Centauri is a binary system, we have to suppress the light of two stars. So we have to get creative. Our specialized starlight suppression system consists of:\n1) An instrument called a coronagraph to block starlight\n2) A deformable mirror, low-order wavefront sensors, and control algorithms to control incoming light; and\n3) Post-processing methods to enhance image contrast.\nWith this system and Multi-Star Wavefront Control and Orbital Differential Imaging techniques, scientists at NASA have proposed and published a method to block the light from Alpha Centauri A and B simultaneously and detect any surrounding planets. Our team will leverage this extensive existing research and experimentation.  \nIn order for the telescope to accomplish such an amazing technical challenge, we have to send it to space, where it can operate outside the distorting effects of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. We\u2019ll launch it on a rocket and place it into an orbit designed to provide stable conditions required for making such precise measurements.\nEarth's closest Sun-like star\nPLAY\n\nAnimation of the telescope in low-Earth orbit observing Alpha Centauri. Credit: Liz Hyde \nQuite simply, Alpha Centauri presents the best opportunity to directly image the first Earth-like planet. We will be capturing images of light visible to the human eye, just like the camera on your phone does. There\u2019s an estimated ~85% probability that the Alpha Centauri system harbors at least one potentially habitable planet that we may be able to see thanks to its:\nProximity: At only 4.37 light years away, Alpha Centauri is our closest neighboring star. A small, lightweight telescope only a half meter in diameter can resolve the habitable zones around these stars. The next closest Sun-like star is 2.5 times further away and would require a telescope 2.5 times larger in size! \nBinary structure: Alpha Centauri contains not just one, but two stars similar to our Sun \u2014 giving us two chances to find planets in either of their habitable zones. \nSun-like characteristics: Alpha Centauri A is a yellow \u201cG2\u201d type star whose temperature and color closely match the Sun\u2019s, increasing the probability that a planet in its habitable zone is analogous to Earth. Alpha Centauri B is a little cooler and redder than our Sun, but scientists still consider stars like it to be good candidate hosts for Earth-like planets.\nAn open science consortium\nProject Blue is a team of world-renowned space and research organizations, including BoldlyGo Institute, Mission Centaur, the SETI Institute, and the University of Massachusetts Lowell, along with an advisory committee of scientists from Yale University, Penn State University, University of Arizona, Arizona State University, University of Victoria \u2014 and you! Our goal is to involve anyone who\u2019s enthusiastic about space science and exploration in one of humanity\u2019s most profound quests.\nThe Project Blue team is led by Dr. Jon Morse, former NASA director of astrophysics and the CEO of BoldlyGo Institute. \nProject Blue's Science & Technology Advisory Committee\n           Consortium members\n  Because the telescope is customized for close viewing of Alpha Centauri, it\u2019ll take just a fraction of the money and time of a larger space mission that would survey dozens or hundreds of stars. We plan to launch the telescope into orbit by late 2019 or early 2020 and will spend up to two years conducting observations for any orbiting exoplanets.\n2016: Form partnerships and initiate fundraising \n2017: Preliminary design, proof of concept prototypes, integration, and initial instrument prototype \n2018: Final mission design, fabrication, assembly, and testing \n2019: Final construction and launch to low-Earth orbit \n2020 - 2022: Science and mission operations.

In fact, until a few years ago, directly imaging a habitable planet around Alpha Centauri was considered to be too difficult, even with a large telescope, because of the need to block the light of two stars. This, despite the fact that Alpha Centauri is so close to us and that it presents two opportunities to host planets around Sun-like stars. Now, we\u2019re taking advantage of recent breakthroughs that finally make it possible. Published research has already described the required technical components both in the lab and in flight, and it gives us immense confidence in the mission\u2019s success. But, as with any space mission, there are technical challenges to making the on orbit instrument perform the same way as in the lab.\n\nSecond, there's a chance that there aren't any potentially habitable planets in the Alpha Centauri system to find in the first place. However, NASA\u2019s Kepler mission has taught us that exoplanets are everywhere \u2014 and small, rocky planets like the Earth appear to be very abundant. Just this summer, a team of astronomers found a planet around Proxima Centauri, the third (but much less Sun-like) star in the Alpha Centauri system. So we know there\u2019s already at least one. You can see why we\u2019re so passionate to explore what planets might lurk around our next-door-neighbor. We can't sit still until we find out.\n\nThe technology used to dim starlight, allowing us to see its planets, is new and continuously advancing. As with any developing technologies, it presents some challenges and risks. Starlight suppression has already been demonstrated successfully in the lab, but its application to binary star systems is a new innovation. Our team has extensive experience with successful high-contrast technology development projects, which enables us to confidently anticipate the specific technical requirements and costs. Since we\u2019re focusing exclusively on one star system, we\u2019ll be able to collect a huge amount of targeted data on Alpha Centauri. Optimizing for this one system allows us to design specific system calibration and noise-reduction algorithms, and thus make finding any orbiting planets easier.\n\nLaunching and commissioning a spacecraft is risky \u2014 sometimes the unexpected happens. The space environment also presents risks, such as maintaining telescope stability under extreme temperature swings and other hazards. But our team has decades of experience designing and building instrumentation for space, and we will work with experienced industry partners to maximize our chances for success. Dealing with risk is hard, but it\u2019s part of why working on space missions is so exciting and rewarding. So while there are challenges ahead, our team\u2019s preparation, expertise, and direct experience make us confident about achieving a truly historic goal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Project Blue\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nProject Blue is a new science initiative to capture the first photograph of a potential Earth-like planet orbiting another Sun-like star.See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "$1 Mission Backer", "descp": "Help get Project Blue off the ground!

Trapped inside by a terrible blizzard, they soon realize they\u2019re being hunted. As they struggle to survive, they must learn to communicate, to trust each other, and decide whether they even should. Throughout the movie, the camera enters the perspectives of our characters as they explore, stripping the audience of that sense, and taking them on a ride as the story unfolds.  \nDIRECTOR'S STATEMENT\nWith Follow The Leader, we're going for something fresh. We love horror movies, but honestly, sometimes we feel like we've seen them all. We as filmmakers are trying to strip back the voyeuristic nature of the horror film and place the audience behind the eyes of the characters, only entering into these first-person views periodically throughout the duration of the film in order to better relate to their struggles. When the perspective shifts, we\u2019re not going for the shaky, found footage style.\nOur generation is obsessed with nostalgia, and that\u2019s why we wanted to set this movie in an abandoned 90s mall. We want the audience to re-experience the 90s as a surreal ghost. Horror is an incredible genre, with a huge fanbase and filmmakers pushing boundaries with creative new ideas all the time, and we\u2019re excited to make this for fans of the genre.\nWHO WE ARE\nConcept Art by MARVEL comic book artist Greg Smallwood\nThe Burghart Brothers - Jacob and Ben.

Two of the biggest problems with new or even popular VR headsets are poor resolution and a shallow library of VR apps. Expanse solves the content problem while providing 5 times the resolution of other VR devices like the Gear VR or Rift for video content and over twice the resolution for 360 content.\nNOTE: Expanse is the same resolution as your smartphone. All resolution claims assume the use of a 1440p smartphone.\nHere are some of the things you can do with Expanse right now:\nWatch your favorite videos or streaming video apps like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, YouTube and ESPN on a screen larger than most movie theaters and up to 1440p resolution (the same videos in a Gear VR or Rift would be about 480p). If you have a phone with an OLED screen this means you can experience the magic of HDR contrast without spending $4k on an OLED TV.\nWatch 4k 360 videos in native resolution. Expanse doesn't suffer from pixellation or the screen-door effect (when using a 1080p and up smartphone) like other VR headsets. This allows you to experience your favorite 360 videos in a way no other headset can offer.\nPlay your favorite apps and games on a theater sized screen. If an app runs in landscape mode and can be controlled with a mouse or controller it can be used with Expanse.\nPlay your favorite console or PC games on a theater sized monitor. With an Expanse display cartridge you can play your favorite console and PC games at native resolution on Expanse. But even without an Expanse cartridge you can stream your PC or console games to your Android or iOS device in HD albeit with a small amount of latency. This is similar to the Cinematic mode in a Playstation VR but cheaper and with 5x the resolution.\nFly your DJI drone in FPV mode giving you a cockpit-like view of the flight with the camera feed filling your field of view in high definition.\nAfter a successful Kickstarter we will open our developer program and work with existing VR apps to begin porting them over to Expanse. This is generally a trivial conversion for Unity developed apps.\nWe have also spoken with Trinus VR and plan to work with them to develop a monoscopic VR mode which would allow you to play your favorite first person PC games in monoscopic VR using Expanse.\nHow do you use it?\nIt's incredibly simple and intuitive. Simply open the Expanse Cinema app, connect an air mouse or bluetooth controller to your phone, and insert it into Expanse. From the Expanse Cinema app you can watch movies, shows, and 360 videos that are stored on your phone or you can launch your favorite video streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu, and more.\nThe air mouse included with Expanse works like a Wii-mote on Android smartphones and has a gyroscopic sensor in it that controls a mouse cursor on your screen. The included controller has a 'remote control' side which has a direction pad, volume control, selection buttons, and Android navigation buttons. The other side of the remote has a keyboard for text input.\nHow is this possible?\n\nExpanse allows you to experience high definition VR right now by utilizing a completely different optical design than other VR devices. Our magic utilizes an all reflective optical design similar to those used by professional aircraft simulators called a collimated display. This design avoids the chromatic aberration (color error caused by the refraction of light through a lens) inherent in the refractive designs used by Cardboard, Gear VR, Rift, and Vive and greatly reduces distortion. \n\nUsing a unique parabolic optic with a dielectric mirror coating, Expanse images the almost the entire phone display to each eye (rather than the two separate smaller images used by other VR devices). Because of this, Expanse is monoscopic or in other words it trades off stereoscopic 3d for resolution resulting in an image that is up to 1440p (or 4 times better than standard HD) over a 90 degree FOV. \nExpanse uses nearly all of your phone's pixels.\nNot stereoscopic?\nMany people make the mistake of presuming that because Expanse is not stereoscopic 3D, it must produce flat, uninteresting imagery. The truth is that few of the people we've demoed Expanse to even realized it wasn't 3D until we mentioned it. Our optical design collimates the light going into your eyes which makes it seem like the imagery is coming from far away. Combined with the lighting and shading that's been used in movies, shows, and gaming for decades it can actually be as compelling an experience as stereoscopic 3D but without the headaches. \nThink about the last time you went to see a 2D movie or played your favorite video game. The graphics look realistic and have great depth cues without the vergence cue that stereoscopic 3D gives you. \nCompatible Phones\nExpanse can be used with the majority of modern smartphones with displays between 4.7\" and 5.7\" with the following disclaimers:\nThe Expanse Cinema App will be compatible with both Android and iOS phones. This app will allow you to watch videos and 360 videos in immersive theater environments.\nOn Android devices Expanse can be used with any non-VR app that can be used in landscape mode and controlled with one finger (the bundled air mouse can be used to simulate finger touches and swipes) or with a Bluetooth controller.\nOn iOS devices Expanse can be used with any non-VR app that can be used in landscape mode and controlled with a Bluetooth controller. (iOS does not currently support mice so the air mouse will not work. Video applications like Netflix, Hulu, ESPN, Youtube, etc. can be controlled in-hand and then inserted into Expanse when the video starts).\nIf the Kickstarter succeeds we can begin approaching existing VR apps to port them over to Expanse. \nFor all devices with screens above 5.1\", clipping (can't see a small portion of the screen) will occur in the bottom corners. We had to make a judgement call against making the headset significantly larger to use a full 5.5 inch screen and found that 90% of the time the corners weren't missed. The clipping is only a potential issue for non-360 apps. Here's a diagram with some popular phone sizes and the clipping.\n$200k?!?! Why do you need so much?\nWe know, $200,000 is a lot of money but I promise you it's not so that we can retire on a beach sipping margaritas. Unlike many other entry level VR devices, our optics are not available as an off the shelf component. They must be custom made and coated with expensive optical coatings. Think about how much the anti-reflective coating costs on your glasses... our optics are much larger. Specifically, the tooling for our optics costs roughly $50k with unit costs per optic hovering around $12-$20 depending on the Kickstarter volume. Our number one goal is to make sure you get your Expanse headset on time and we'd rather fail to meet our Kickstarter goal than risk not being able to fulfill your pledge.\nNames and contact info redacted for privacy\nThe controller\nThe Expanse bundle is recommended for all Android users as it comes with an extremely useful air mouse. This controller uses a gyroscopic sensor to move a mouse cursor around the screen much like a Wii-mote if you've used a Wii. This mouse cursor can imitate single finger touches including tapping and swiping and allows you to use a lot of standard, off-the-shelf Android apps within Expanse (we love playing Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds with it). \nThe controller that comes bundled with Expanse will likely be an off-the-shelf controller that will be rebranded with the Expanse logo. This is the one we use on a daily basis for demoing and development and will probably be the one included with the headset along with a micro USB adapter for the dongle:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/LYNEC-C120-Portable-Wireless-3-Gravity/dp/B00RMX9H7A/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1473876518&sr=8-4&keywords=air+mouse\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Adapter-LDesign-Android-Smartphone-Samsung/dp/B015XA3W0G/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1473876398&sr=8-8&keywords=microusb+to+usb \nUnfortunately iPhone users will not be able to use the controller as iOS does not have native support for mice. This limits the usability of iPhones with Expanse to apps that support bluetooth controllers.\nThe Expanse Cinema App\nWe\u2019ve been developing an Expanse Cinema app which acts as the hub for the Expanse experience and puts your favorite streaming content in a variety of familiar and exotic 360 degree locales so you can watch Star Wars on the moon, Jaws on the beach, or your favorite show in a luxury home theater. We\u2019re currently talking with and have secured one of the top streaming video providers to integrate their streaming services directly into the Expanse Cinema app. \nBut even without custom apps, Expanse is unique in that it can be used with many of the apps already on your phone. Because our optics have much less distortion than other VR devices and view the entire screen, any app that works in landscape mode with a controller or mouse can be used with Expanse. With up to 1440p resolution, Expanse can also be used for text-heavy applications such as surfing the web or reading ebooks.\nFeatures\n  Why Expanse?\nVirtual reality (VR) has arrived in the form of countless low-cost, smartphone-based headsets and prohibitively expensive PC-based devices but two big hurdles stand in the way of mainstream adoption: content and resolution.\nContent\nGear VR and Google cardboard have sold in unprecedented numbers, yet there\u2019s barely enough content for them to last you a week. While VR specific content is sure to come eventually, one form of media is already available that promises countless hours of immersive entertainment on your VR device: video. In fact, according to Palmer Luckey, videos and 360 experiences are the biggest uses of the Samsung Gear VR.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3zt7ul/i_am_palmer_luckey_founder_of_oculus_and_designer\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine why. Sure, watching the movie Interstellar on your 50\u201d flat screen at home is nice but what if you could watch it on a 200\u201d screen on the moon? What if you could ride a 20\u2019 wave through the eyes of a pro surfer or see a game-winning play through the helmet of your team\u2019s quarterback? These experiences all leverage both new and existing video content in an immersive new way promising to change the way we consume media.\nResolution\nUnfortunately current VR devices aren\u2019t really suited to watching the vast majority of video content. Almost all movies, shows, and 360-degree videos are filmed in high-resolution 2D but the VR viewers on the market are all low resolution stereoscopic 3D. While stereoscopic 3D provides a compelling experience for content that can use it, it does so at the cost of up to 80% of your display\u2019s resolution. The result is an image that fills your field of view but suffers from bad pixelation and the so-called screen-door effect, both of which ruin the immersive nature of VR.\nThis is a fundamental problem with the optical design of VR devices at the moment and one that can\u2019t be solved until 4K and 8K mobile displays become available along with the massive batteries and powerful processors to run them smoothly.\nKickstarter Levels\n$5 \u2013 Become a backer and get access to weekly updates and news.

(See FAQ for iPhone compatibility)\nStretch Goals\n$500k \u2013 We have been working with a mobile display provider to create an Expanse cartridge that will plug into your favorite HDMI devices. This 5\" 1080p display features an improved backlight and video rotation to fix the standard portrait orientation all mobile displays have. There is a 1000 unit minimum order so if we get enough support and traction we will make this display available to our Kickstarter backers at cost.\nDesign Features / Specs \nCustom molded optics \u2013 Our custom precision reflective optics are the key to Expanse\u2019s magic and they aren\u2019t cheap. The main front optic is diamond-turned with optimized reflective coatings featuring uniform spectral response and good durability. Our splitter is a low-loss partial reflector that maximizes throughput while minimizing ghost reflections using vacuum deposited coatings. The tooling alone for these optics can be over $50,000. Our engineering team has spent over a year prototyping and testing Expanse\u2019s optics to ensure you have as wide a field of view as is comfortable while preserving imaging quality and minimizing distortion.\nSilicon facial interface \u2013 One of the most important aspects of VR is comfort. One of the quickest ways to ruin the immersive magic of VR is for a headset to fit uncomfortably. Luckily, the unique phone position in Expanse gives it a better center of gravity than most VR devices making it feel slightly lighter. More importantly, we designed a silicon and replaceable foam interface that conforms to your face with a soft microfiber lining. You're going to want a bed made of this stuff.\nUniversal Clip \u2013 It was important to us that Expanse was accessible to as wide an audience as possible. This meant designing a way to hold a wide variety of phones. With an elastomer grip underneath and sweet heat sink design on top, our headset will hold (almost) any smartphone that's 6-15mm thick with a 5\"- 6\" screen. \nLens Cover \u2013 While Expanse is see-through when you want it to be, sometimes we want to ignore the world and binge watch Game of Thrones. Thankfully our lens cover snaps easily on and off with a single hand and blocks out the outside world, fully immersing you in your hedonistic ventures. And since optics account for over half the cost and all of the magic of Expanse, the cap will help keep them safe and clean when not in use. \nLouvered window \u2013 Our louvered window insert allows you to see your hands and feet while wearing Expanse which is awesome for eating popcorn, typing, using a controller, or anything else you do with your hands. Since Expanse is also see-through and untethered, you could theoretically walk around and live a \"normal\" life wearing Expanse all the time (though we don't recommend it). \nTimeline\nAugust 2015 \u2013 Initial prototype tested, prototyped, and demoed\nNovember 2015 \u2013 Upgraded optical elements prototyped\nDecember 2015 \u2013 Prototype testing and iterations\nJanuary 2016 \u2013 Expanse Cinema app started\nFebruary 2016 \u2013 Domestic manufacturers sourced for production\nJune 2016 \u2013 Prepping the Kickstarter campaign\nSeptember 2016 \u2013 Kickstarter Launch!\nOctober 2016 \u2013 Begin tooling optical and chassis molds\nNovember 2016 \u2013 Receive preproduction optics and housing\nDecember 2016 - Manufacturing and packaging\nJanuary 2017 \u2013 Begin shipping Expanse! \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOptics Risks: At least one other Kickstarter VR company has totally failed to make their primary optic; however, we will not have this issue. We have had optical molding experts at Diverse Optics confirm the specifications required to meet our performance needs, and we have multiple domestic vendors that have provided quotes for tooling and fabrication of the optics. These suppliers have experience providing optics for consumer, aerospace, and medical devices, as well as AR devices like Meta. More importantly, we have the capability to reduce costs and turn-around significantly if the demand is high enough through multi-cavity tooling. We've also made conservative estimates on our funding goal to ensure any setbacks don't delay delivery.\n\nGeneral Manufacturing: We have also had domestic injection molding companies confirm the moldability of our chassis. We have chosen to use domestic manufacturers in order to avoid shipping delays and keep an eye on the process. Our design is thankfully simple and we don't expect issues in this department.\n\nTechnical risks: The optical design of Expanse has been used in collimated displays for years and is well understood. Modifying it for use on the head introduces little technical risk. The biggest technical hurdle is making sure Expanse is comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time. To tackle this risk we have contracted a product designer with years of experience developing goggles for sports and military to work on our silicone facial interface.\n\nWe've done a lot of legwork lining up suppliers for Expanse to avoid the typical Kickstarter delays.

See the latest opportunity here.\nYou can find us on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram!\n   MOTI is a new way to stay accountable and motivated for building those habits you know you should be forming, from exercising, to eating healthy, to staying mindful.\nThere are plenty of apps and wearables for habit formation, but we know that humanity isn't just about knowledge and data - it's about emotion. Based on the latest insights from behavioral science and social robotics, MOTI works by being more than just a device: he's a friend who sets up the right types of reminders, celebrations, and accountability seamlessly into your life.\n  One-size-fits-all doesn't work when it comes to our psychology - and our motivational needs change as we progress through different stages of our habit formation.\nMOTI may be simple on the outside, but on the inside he packs the smarts needed to analyze every element of your habit. MOTI learns from your setup inputs, personality profile, individual compliance data, and how you compare to the rest of the MOTI community. The outcome is a program of the right reminders and rewards specific to you.  \nAnd their MOTI's weren't even as smart as yours will be! Still, how can something so simple be so effective?\n  The reason MOTI works is because we've based on over a decade of academic research in behavioral science and social robotics. Here are a few key principles from the brain science of habit formation that MOTI utilizes:\nHabit loop theory - Your brain needs three things to form a habit: a trigger, a routine, and a reward. [read more]\nVariable rewards - The immediate gratification from the reward can't just be the same thing over and over again. What level will you unlock next with your habit progress? MOTI keeps you engaged. [read more]\nPhysical robots motivate more than digital ones on screens - When you interact with technology products that are semi-anthropomorphized and live in the real world, our brains interpret them differently and are held more accountable by them. [read more]\n      Each MOTI works with one habit at a time, so that you can prioritize the one that is most important to your life right now. MOTI works best with habits that happen at least every other day, and that are relevant to a particular location. Here are some examples of habits people have used with MOTI in the past:\nExercising 30 minutes a day (running, walking, etc.) \nDrinking 8 glasses of water a day \nReading before bed \nJournaling or creative writing  \nPracticing morning meditations  \nCompleting physical therapy\nFlossing your teeth \nPracticing an instrument \nAnd more! \n  \nAfter setting up your habit through the support app, place your MOTI in the location best suited for your habit - such as your bedside table, office desk, or entryway (don't worry, we'll you help pick!). Next, MOTI integrates the three elements of a habit loop directly into your lifestyle: \n        You'll know your daily progress simply by looking at MOTI (Green? You're on track! Red? MOTI isn't impressed...). The MOTI supporting app allows you to go even deeper. Set up each habit with best practices, learn your motivational profile, view all your analytics, and \"push\" MOTI remotely through the power of wifi connectivity:\n    MOTI knows that if he gives you the same celebration over and over again you'll get bored, or that sometimes he needs to become more of a drill sergeant than a cheerleader. \nWhen MOTI is connected to the web he is constantly learning and analyzing what types of celebrations and reminders will motivate you the most, or whether you're at risk of falling off or need a break.\n  The first MOTIs are available in three color choices: turquoise, dark grey, and light grey. Pick the one that best matches your home or office!\nWith the app, you can also fully customize your MOTI's settings (light colors, sound pack, volume, etc.). We'll be developing MOTI's \"expansion packs\" with feedback directly from our backers, but here's a sneak peek:\nMOTI Possible Sound Family A:\nMOTI Possible Sound Family B:\nMOTI Possible Sound Family C:\n  In the early days, there was an \"app for that.\" But, now we are in complete notification overload and so easily distracted by emails, texts, social media etc. whenever we pick up our phone (even if we meant to do something else entirely on it!).\nThen came wearables with the promise \"if you can track it you can change it.\" The problem is, that's not actually true - numbers and data alone are not enough for true motivation. Not to mention having to remember to charge and put on a wearable each day (two habits just to get to the one you're actually trying to form)!\nMOTI is deliberately not app or a wearable - he's designed to be an different medium entirely, one that is based in a deeper psychological understanding of what it truly takes to form a new habit.\n    MOTI's founder and inventor, Kayla Matheus, first came up with MOTI to solve a problem in her own life: forming the habit of physical therapy at home. To understand why everyone seems to struggle with good habits, she immediately embarked upon process she had previously taught at universities across the country: human-centered design.\nIn fact, MOTI was invented within the context of a new founders program specifically for designers called 30 Weeks, which spun out of the Google Creative Lab in 2014. At 30 Weeks, Kayla surveyed and interviewed hundreds of people, and it was directly through user testing that the idea for MOTI was born. (The first ever MOTI is actually the koala bear at the bottom right of the above picture!)\nIn Summer and Fall of 2015, MOTI had matured enough through our first MVP and Alpha prototypes that we sold the first batch of MOTI beta units across the country. The results were extremely promising, and we learned many things about what should and should not be included in the MOTI experience.\nA few interesting things we learned:\n85% of users surveyed said MOTI was \"essential\" to their habit progress.\nThe fact that MOTI is a physical thing is vital. Nearly all users talked about that walk-in-the-room moment in their interviews.\nColor choice of lighting is surprisingly important. While green symbolically means good in the United States, it doesn't everywhere - and some people just plain hate the color green!\n\n  At MOTI, we love hardware. So much so that both founders hold engineering first degrees (ME and EE), and in the Winter of 2015, we successfully completed the hardware accelerator, Highway1.\nAt Highway1 we took our product from proof-of-concept prototype to the designed-for-manufacturing (DFM) stage. We also took a trip to Shenzhen, China to see how the most famous products in the world are built. Now, we're are now actively engaging with manufacturers across the globe and preparing the final details of production.\nPLAY\n\nMOTI is co-founded by Kayla Matheus and Laura Day, who first met at a Women in Hardware event in San Francisco, specializing in robotics. Together, they span expertise in design, engineering, and business and are incredibly passionate about bringing products and services to the market that truly help us be our better selves; not technology for technology's sake. (See video above for more)\nKayla and Laura are joined by an incredible team of experts that make MOTI possible:\nWe are also joined by a group of partners that have supported us along the way in all things design, entrepreneurship, and manufacturing! \nParticle: Powering the next generation of IoT devices \nHighway1: The home for hardware entrepreneurs\n30 Weeks: A founders program for designers \nFormlabs: Reinventing 3-D printing \nFictiv: Build better hardware\n          And a big thank you to you for meeting MOTI.

Large-Scale Hardware Manufacturing - Building a physical product beyond just a few prototypes means setting up a production line. The logistics of doing so are notoriously complex.\n\nWe are mitigating this risk by truly understanding the hardware engineering elements of MOTI (our founders are both hardware engineers!), keeping MOTI as simple as possible, and knowing the ins-and-outs of the manufacturing process through mentorship from Highway1 and our other partners.\n\n2. We're creating a product to change behavior - what if it doesn't work? Unlike other IOT or smart devices, MOTI is meant to do more than just make your life more efficient, he is built to interact with you psychologically.\n\nEveryone's motivational factors are different, and that's why MOTI is completely customizable and learns over time what works best for you through deep analytics.

Living in Silicon Valley we were immersed in conversations about \"changing the world\", \"living in the future\", or \"becoming multi-planetary\", and we became fascinated by this dream of future technological immortality at a present time of global crisis. Much like the futures depicted in our favorite Sci-fi movies, the way we envision the future says so much about our present.\nScience fiction always asks the big questions: about what it means to be human, about our place in the universe. Today, when Mars is a more powerful force in our imaginations than ever before, we have set out to make the first \"science nonfiction\" documentary that explores what life on Mars might actually be like, and what going to Mars means for the future of humanity.\nWhen we embarked on telling this story about the HI-SEAS project, we were told there was no way for us to capture life inside the dome, since it is above all research for NASA. We took a risk and flew to Hawaii to film with the crew before they entered the simulation, and we were able to build trust with the project and the crew themselves. They opened their lives to us, and gave us exclusive access to make this feature film.\nWe are thrilled to share with you the project that has consumed our hearts and minds for the past two years. We will continue to work tirelessly to make this film, and only with your generous support can we make it a reality.

I grabbed cards from 8 the Liar and dice that I'm using in a bunch of games. I played it with my game club 30 minutes later. It went really well and I knew right away I had something. Yes it was fairly simple, but I had a hook. If you roll a 9, you are frozen for that round. \nWhen I was testing the game with my testing group in Taipei I made a joke with another designer. I told him I wished his face was on the card so I could slap it.

That does not mean I am 23 years old, I wish. I have printed over 500 print jobs. So when a friend asked me to fill the space on a 70 card print run I jumped on it. It's an investment, but with kickstarter anything is possible. Most designers would probably print 1 or 2 games but I thought of it as an opportunity to make a bunch of games. I have over 50 games in progress, I'm not kidding. So I started thinking how I could maximize the print run. I started looking at all my games to see which games had duplicate cards. M80 was perfect with only 8 cards (x6). I can get 165 copies because I am printing a quantity of 1000, you divide the number of duplicates to get the amount of games.\nMoogoo People - I did the art for this game a couple year ago when I was into art trading cards. At the time I had no idea they were going to be a game. I made a prototype a year ago and played it at a game convention. The game was a simple set collecting game. It had a some strategy because you can steal a color from another player and collect 3 of the same person or 1 of each person. To me it wasn't good enough. It was like a go fish variant. I do like the art and I know there is a game there. So I printed 18 (x3). I shrink wrapped each deck. I could use 2 decks in a game if needed. I decided to print a layout of the cards as the back. While I was photographing the cards I had an idea for a different version of the game. You set up the cards exactly like the card back. That becomes your game board. You have to swap cards and place a card to complete a set. S it is still a set collecting game but very different. I could make a bunch of different variations. So that's where that game stands.\nZodiac Attack - I also did the art for this game a couple years ago when I was into art trading cards. I kept the same outline as the original drawings but changed the background color and texture. I made a little chart of each animal for the back of the card like moogoo people. The reason I did it for this game is that you need to call out animals and sometimes people forget the 12 animals, so it's there on every card.\nThis game is an elimination style game. You deal out all the cards and you have to be the last animal standing. I also have the idea of secret animal cards. I might do little mini cards like I will do for M80. You get 2 or 3 in the ginning of the game and once they are all face up on the table, you are out. I added a mechanic I like. It started as a card that has 4 actions, 1 on each edge. You rotate it each round and do the action facing you. I am still working on it, it needs more testing but it is getting there.\nSakuru - I thought of this one because I wanted some small simple games for when I go to Tokyo. 3 cards, 11 of each = 33 cards in the game. I decided to make 2 versions of the cards. So, 90 games each. (Reggae - red, yellow, green) and (Neutral - white, grey, black). The front and backs of the cards are mirror images. A 2-3 player game, but if you combine the 2, you can play up to 6. I have to admit I designed the cards with out a clear idea what I was going to do with them. But once they were printed I played around with them and got some ideas. The one idea I did have was a coin release game. You make a board using 30 cards. You hold the one card you have left like a ramp and slide a coin down it onto the board. You have to land it on your colored circle. If it has a logo on it you get double. It's fun and the setup is very strategic in the beginning of the game.\nMeepo - I originally designed this game as a nano game ( one card only). That didn't work. So I designed 3 cards with six colored meeples on it. It's the same set up as sakuru, 3x11=33 cards, 90 games. The cards are divided into primary and secondary colors. Each card has a different color across from it. One idea for a game is you need place a card matching one meeple on another card on the table. You are given a color in the beginning. You also have secret color which is marked by the one card in front of you. Example - You are red, if yellow is across from red, that is your secret color. You are trying to get the most in a rowof both your colors. You will have some actual meeples that can be placed to block others from destroying your row.\nZero Deck - this one is funny. It is like a deck system with no games. I have no problem admitting I don't have any ideas yet. The cards were design options for another game I did. I liked the design and just went with it. Another reason is I hardly ever use the color brown in my designs. This one is mostly brown, I am a fan of variety. It took up 9 card spaces. I made it 6 of each number, so 54 cards shrink wrapped and waiting for purpose.\n3 is odd - this game was also a design idea for another game. Sometimes if I have a design job, I might do 8 different designs. One gets chosen, what happen to the rest? So I went back and used some of those designs for new games. I made it a 2 player game. I don't have many 2 player only games. I could make it more players, or teams. I need to test it. There are 8 cards (1,3,5,7 are green, 2,4,6,8 are red). 5 of each number - 200 games.\n Below are some of my sites and projects.\nI am an artist.\nWhen I was 16, after a couple weeks into an art & design class I knew that was what I wanted to do with my life. I never quit fighting for it despite many obstacles. Art has been my life since. Here are some of my accomplishments:\nBFA in graphic design from SUNY Fredonia.\nAttended Yale School of Design in Switzerland.\nworked for WRAL TV (CBS,FOX) News as a graphic artist.\ndesigned for large companies in Sydney, Australia.\ndesigned over 3000 logos and 350 business cards. helped create an\nidentity for many restaurants and businesses.\nCreated over 1800 paintings and drawings.\nSold over 250 paintings.\nhad 20 gallery shows and art exhibitions\nstarted an ran an art magazine in Taiwan\ntraveled to over 30 countries taking over 50,000 photos.\npainted 6 large wall murals in Taiwan and China.\nOne mural was my city's mayor's office building.\n started my own art house (gallery, art school, studio).\nteach art classes to a variety of ages.\nstarted my own board game design company (Hacko Games)\n designed over 40 games since January.\nJust had my first game published last month, more coming.\nWon 8 game design contests on BGG since January.\nstarted my first kickstarter.\nI am a very sweet guy. I feel this is a situation I need to prove myself, so I am not holding back. I am available for any questions you might have. People need to trust me and I hope they do. I have a Taiwanese wife and 2 kids. I have been in Taiwan for over 12 years. I do go back to Syracuse, NY when I can. I wish it was more and I think it will be with my career in game design.

Never worry about leaving your cable behind again. Simply plug Pagar\u00e9 directly into your computer or any other USB port to easily charge your Pebble smartwatch.\nFUTURE PROOF\nAs technology evolves, so will Pagar\u00e9.

It's an extension of your life. That's why Pagare was designed from the ground up to take you further, while still perfectly complementing your style. Special attention was paid to the thickness, comfort, materials and overall look, so you can still proudly show off your Pebble Time, Pebble Time Steel or Pebble Time Round smartwatch.\nTo attach Pagar\u00e9 to your current Pebble Time, Pebble Time Steel or Pebble Time Round smartwatch, simply remove the existing straps using the quick-release pins, place the watch head over the back-plate and reconnect the pins. Pagar\u00e9 can easily be installed in under 10 seconds.\nTHE WORLD'S BEST SMARTWATCH JUST GOT BETTER\nPutting it plainly, Pagar\u00e9 pairs perfectly with Pebble smartwatches. The Pebble smartwatch was already an industry darling with best-in-class battery life, thousands of apps, cross-platform support, water-resistance, and an always-on screen with clear daylight visibility. \nPebble's innovative smartstrap system made it possible to bring Pagar\u00e9's game-changing new features to the Pebble Time family of products, enabling secure payments at millions of retails locations, and opening the door to opportunities in transit, ticketing and access control. In short, Pagar\u00e9 makes your Pebble smartwatch more powerful than ever, for hundreds of dollars less than an entry-level Apple Watch. \nThe Pebble Time family of smartwatches feature:\nAlways-on, daylight readable color screen with a great backlight \nBattery life measured in days, not hours\nPebble Health built-in step and sleep tracking\nPebble timeline calendar interface\nVoice replies \nPebble Time and Time Steel smartwatches are water resistant. \nPebble Time Round smartwatch is splash resistant \nTactile buttons for easy eyes-free clicking \nSilent vibrating alarms \nQuick change bands\nLanguage and international character support \nWorks with iOS 8 on iPhone 4s and above \nWorks with all Android 4.0+ phones including Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG, Google, Motorola, Xiaomi and more\nSIMPLE TO MANAGE, SIMPLE TO USE\nAdd the free Pagar\u00e9 app from the Pebble appstore, scan in your cards and you are ready to start making transactions. Keep an eye out for the contactless symbol at the point of sale, hold your wrist near the terminal to pay, and your transaction is complete!\nHandling multiple cards is a snap. Pagar\u00e9 can easily store every card in your wallet. When you are ready to pay, press the up or down buttons on your watch to cycle to the card you want to pay with. It's instant.\nManage your cards with ease using the companion timeline app. Add new cards, enable or disable existing cards, delete cards, set a card to be the default whenever you pay, view your purchase history, and more!\nYour security is our primary concern. To prevent unauthorized transactions, we have add two really cool technologies. First, a method for detecting if Pagar\u00e9 is on your wrist; second, a personal PIN that prevents anyone but you from making payments with your watch. When you first put your watch on you will be asked to enter your PIN, activating the payment capabilities within. Take your watch off and it's unusable for payments until you put it back on and re-authenticate.\nPERFECT PARTNERS\nOur goal was to make Pagar\u00e9 nearly indistinguishable from a standard Pebble smartwatch strap. That is why we worked directly with Pebble's suppliers to provide the same materials, colors and finish for the Pebble Time, Pebble Time Steel and Pebble Time Round smartwatches.\nPagar\u00e9 for Pebble Time Smartwatches\n(Note: These straps are also compatible with Pebble Time Steel)\n Pagar\u00e9 for Pebble Time smartwatches come in three colors:\nWhite water-resistant silicone with black back plate and USB cap\nBlack water-resistant  silicone with black back plate and USB cap\nRed water-resistant silicone with black backplate and USB cap\nPagar\u00e9 for Pebble Time Steel Smartwatches\n(Note: These straps are also compatible with Pebble Time)\n Pagar\u00e9 for Pebble Time Steel smartwatches come in three colors:\nBlack leather with black backplate and USB cap\nRed leather with black backplate and USB cap\nStone leather with black backplate and USB cap\nPagar\u00e9 for Pebble Time Round Smartwatches (20mm)\nPagar\u00e9 for Pebble Time Round Smartwatches come in two colors:\n20mm Black leather with black backplate and USB cap\n20mm Nubuck leather with black backplate and USB cap\nCORE TECHNOLOGY \nThe secure element is the heart and soul of the Pagar\u00e9 solution. Embedded under the watch head, the SE stores the tokenized card data after being digitized by the respective card network. To detect when Pagar\u00e9 is on your wrist, a flexible PCB runs the length of the strap.\n When the trapper is placed over the notch at the end of the USB connector, it activates the Pagar\u00e9 app and asks for your personal PIN. This assures that you are the owner of the watch and gives you access to the payment capabilities. When the trapper is removed the authentication is lost, disabling the payment environment and protecting your data in the case of loss or theft. The watch becomes incapable of making payments without being on your wrist and authenticated with your PIN. \nA flexible NFC antenna is embedded in the top strap, making it quick and easy to perform contactless transactions at any terminal. Simply hold the top part of the strap near the terminal when you are ready to transact. The watch will buzz and a success message will flash across the screen.\nSECURITY DETAILS\nPagar\u00e9 has a wealth of security features to thwart even the most determined hacker. Starting with end-to-end encryption of all personally identifying information, Pagar\u00e9 leverages the following technologies and adheres to the below certifying agencies:\n\nSECURE ELEMENT A secure element (SE) is a tamper-resistant platform capable of securely hosting applications and their confidential and cryptographic data in accordance with the rules and security requirements set forth by a set of well-identified trusted authorities.\nTOKENIZATION Pagar\u00e9 utilizes tokenization, a process by which the primary account number (PAN) of your credit card is replaced with a surrogate value called a token. Pagar\u00e9 uses the same card network tokenization scheme as Apple, Samsung and Android Pay, removing the need for Pagar\u00e9 to ever store your credit card data.\nPCI DDS LEVEL 1 COMPLIANT The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements designed to ensure that companies that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. Pagar\u00e9 will be PCI Level 1 Compliant at launch. Companies that meet Level 1 must have yearly on-site reviews by an internal auditor, a network scan by an approved scanning vendor, and typically handle over 6 million Visa and Mastercard transactions processed per year.\nEMVCO COMPLIANT EMV -- which stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa -- is a global standard for cards equipped with computer chips and the technology used to authenticate chip-card transactions. In the wake of numerous large-scale data breaches and increasing rates of counterfeit card fraud, U.S. card issuers are migrating to this new technology to protect consumers and reduce the costs of fraud. Pagar\u00e9 adheres to EMV Level 1, which covers physical, electrical and transport level interfaces, and EMV Level 2, which covers payment application selection and credit financial transaction processing.\nCARD NETWORK CERTIFIED Pagar\u00e9 is independently certified with the major card networks. All software must be certified by payment brands to comply with proprietary EMV implementations such as Visa VSDC, and MasterCard MChip.\n PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nOriginal bread board testing\nTerminal tests being run\nFirst stab at miniaturization\nFirst transaction\nFirst full prototypes\nMEET THE TEAM\nFitPay is led by payment industry experts with more than 20 years of payment platform and identity authentication domain expertise. With deep, established relationships with all of the card networks, the FitPay team is well suited for the challenges of Pagar\u00e9.\nIn addition to our core team, we are working closely with our manufacturing partner, ConnecteDevice, as well as the team at Pebble.\nTIMELINE\nDISTINCTIONS\n  Help Us Spread the Word!\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch either through Kickstarter or Facebook.

Should we miss projections, we\u2019ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible.\n\nSupply Chain Risk\n\nWe\u2019re working with a very capable team at ConnecteDevice, who have successfully delivered two previous smartwatches to market. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.\n\nCertification Risk\n\nProduction Pagar\u00e9 units needs to be fully certified by Visa, MasterCard and Discover before being shipped. Though all of the proper business relationships are in place, and we are not concerned about meeting certification requirements, certification windows may be limited, potentially causing shipping delays. We will let you know immediately if we think that certification windows do not properly align with our production shipping schedule. \n\nIssuing Partner Risks\n \nWe are working with our payment network partners to formalize relationships with issuing banks outside the United States. It is our expectation that at launch, we will have a similar global footprint as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay. \n\n***CANADA, CHINA and AUSTRALIA*** While we are working hard to establish full support for Pagar\u00e9 from the issuing banks in your region, we cannot guarantee that your bank will be supported by the time Pagar\u00e9 ships.

We were able to manually burn some development chipsets with the new OS version for firmware development and testing. The chipset is a System in a Package (SIP) that includes a controller and embedded secure element. The release of the OS and verifying our ability to manually burn chipsets are necessary steps before we go into production.

Bear with us Backers; we are going to take a dive into the weeds on this one to describe Security Domains and their significance to Pagar\u00e9.  \nPagar\u00e9\u2019s core payment methodology conceals your personal account information (or PAN) through a process called tokenization. A token is a payment credential that enables retail transactions to occur without sharing your PAN at the point of sale. A security domain is simply the digital silo that safely stores that payment credential, or the tokenized version of your credit card information. Security domains are a mandatory part of the tokenization provisioning process because they ensure that your tokenized payment information is securely stored and enabled to safely complete a purchase.

We send ingredients right to your door and teach you how to turn your grocery delivery into a gourmet meal. All you need to do is say \u201cyes,\u201d and we\u2019ll take it from there.\n Want to experience it for yourself? Try our one week free demo:\nThere are a number meal planning services out there to choose from, but we are the only service that puts the focus on teaching you HOW to cook- not just follow a recipe. After a year of cooking Up Beet Meals you will know every skill you need to be confident in your kitchen.\n       Never again will you think that a \u201cjulienne\u201d is a dance move or that \u201cwhole foods\u201d is simply the name of that supermarket chain that sells Kombucha.\nOh, and speaking of grocery stores, with our service you won\u2019t ever have to go to one. Ever. You can add your personal groceries to the list of ingredients we will send you, and, huzzah! More awesome food for you.\nDo you eat? Do you want to be healthier? Can you boil a pot of water without burning down a building? Yes? Brilliant.

We are working on partnering with more grocery delivery partners as well. \nThe Up Beet Kitchen believes in giving back to the community and making sure everyone is able to eat great food. While Government Food Assistance Programs, like SNAP, provide monetary support, it\u2019s tough to make that dollar stretch. For those who don\u2019t know how to cook, it's easy to fall into the trap of convenience foods.\nSo we have created a Buy 1, Give 1 program. For every Up Beet Eating subscription that is purchased, you will help a family or individual on food assistance also eat healthy.

The steps before cooking \u2013 namely choosing what to have and getting the ingredients \u2013 stopped a lot of people from cooking in the first place.\nWe couldn\u2019t find anyone else out there who would create a meal plan, get the groceries delivered, and effectively support the creation of a healthy meal at a reasonable price \u2013 so we decided to create it ourselves.\nUltimately the best diet is not held together by dictated rules, but by a curiosity and understanding of how the food we eat is either tearing us down or building us up\u2026 ~Chef Nic\nWhere the Money Goes\nTo date, we have been funding the Up Beet Kitchen out of our own savings. We are asking for your help now to complete the beta stage of our development, and launch the Up Beet Eating service. $20,000 is pretty small in the big scale of startups. We are only asking for what we absolutely need. We have been bootstrapping for a while so trust us, we know how to make a little go a long way. \nHealthy meals? What do you mean?\nEvery meal we design and send to you will be packed with nutritious ingredients. Over the course of a week, you will be eating a nutritionally vibrant and balanced diet. Plus, we do the packet reading for you so you won't get caught out by those sneaky nasty ingredients.  \nWhat's the deal with delivery? This is an optional extra to Up Beet Eating.We have the experts on the job; Instacart is a US-wide grocery delivery organization. We have integrated our recipe shopping lists with their service so you can order groceries to your door for as little as $2/delivery. Already have that Soy sauce? Save money and remove it from your online cart.\nNeed eggs for breakfast? Add them before you place your order.\nOut of delivery range? Select the Up Beet Eating without delivery option.\nDo I have to make the meals you send me each week?\nNo. You have the ability to use and cook any of your past recipes.

We now know what to do to make a project you will love! We will make a game twice as fun, better and bigger with a stronger campaign. So stick with us, we will keep you updated!\nIf you visited this campaign after it was finished, you can still help us bring the game back! Just visit our webpage and subscribe to get all the news about the progress of the new campaign brewing! ;)\nClick here to stay in touch!\nGet the best of both worlds! The immersive, fun factor of a mobile game with the social and interactive aspect of a boardgame will make you fall in love with Publish or Perish - a true hybrid game that clashes fun and science!\nThis Augmented Reality deduction board game for 1 to 5 players is the perfect tool for getting your kids into physics!\nPublish or Perish is a cooperative family game where everyone is a winner. Play as a team of scientists and try to beat the game together. Spend time with your family discovering new, secret properties of particles!\nAll set and ready to experiment!\nTo discover the secret property of each particle, the science team will have to show a full spectrum of skills and abilities that a true scientist has: deduction, risk management, insight, cooperation, keeping track of incoming information and communication. Does that sound too hard for your children? Don\u2019t worry, for the game is extremely easy to handle and narrows down to a straightforward deduction game enhanced by the fun and colorful application!\nBarry Doublet from the Dice Tower and his daughter Charlotte review the game! :D\nThis game is not about being a Super Hero or saving the world. The goal is to win the Nobel Prize! Science is important for the future of our children, discovering the secrets of the most basic components of physics may be the key to the understanding the universe :)\nEvery scientist will take turns to use the mobile device which will be transformed into a Particle Collider! How cool is that? By picking two particles from different groups and clashing them against each other, you will discover their secret properties. The result of the experiment can be noted down in the research notebook and compared to the other experiments the team has performed, to deduct the value you are looking for! Next, you can publish your discoveries to score points and reach the ultimate goal of winning the Nobel Prize and therefore Winning the Game!\nWhile playing this game you don\u2019t only practice the scientific method but you also learn about real sub-atomic particles! Electrons, Protons, Neutrons\u2026 All of them generate points in accordance to their rarity! From time to time players will be thrilled to stumble across super rare particles such as the elusive Higgs Boson or the theoretical Graviton! Finding their secret property can push the research lightyears ahead of our time!\nThe app takes on the role of the \u201cKeeper of Secrets\u201d, plays animations and sounds, shows the results of the experiments and publications, randomizes events and provides a great immersive experience. The particles will have different properties assigned to them every game to assure no two games are ever the same!\nAugmented Reality in Action!\nMore Augmented Reality! :D\nAbout the mobile device:\n\"Why do kids need a mobile device to play this game? Don't they spend enough time in front of the screen already? I don't even want mobile devices in my board games...\" All of those are valid points, however kids will disagree with you. They see the world from the totally opposite perspective and that's why this game is the perfect middle ground for joining together different generations.\nIf the fact that kids love this game doesn't convince you can replace the app and change the game at will! The game has been designed to provide you no limitations, only fun! We believe that families should have a great time without the technology too!\nPlease read the FAQ at the end of the page if you have questions about the app!\nGetting kids to learn anything can be hard sometimes. That's why games are fantastic way of sneakily teaching kids anything! Here is what you can expect to learn from the game:\nScientific method: making experiments, noting down the results and repeating the process all over again is the best way of learning this skill!\nPhysics: most of the known sub-atomic particles are in the game. You will learn that Electrons have a negative charge and that a Proton is actually made up of Quarks!\nCooperation over Competition: because we can achieve much more if we work together. Collaboration and teamwork is a great skill to have!\nMath: you heard right! You or your kid will be solving deductive problems similar to simple equations!\nTime Management: in Publish or Perish the clock is always ticking! Planning the moves you have left is the key of mastering the game.\nScience is Fun: it's very important to not be afraid of the \"scary\" subjects in school. If you love science as much as we do, give your kid a reason to fall in love with it as well.\nI am really happy you made it this far reading through the text. I would like to share my story with you. My name is Marcin, and this is how this project came about.\nThe truth is my son had never been interested in physics or maths or other scientific subjects. He was passionate about playing games on my smartphone, despite me and my wife\u2019s best intentions.\nHaving always had a keen interest in physics I decided I would make a game that would interest him. I got in touch with some professionals in the field to make sure that the game would be scientifically accurate. I got together with some friends and started developing. My team came up with a physics based hybrid board game for the whole family called Publish or Perish.\nI designed this game with the idea of the \"Publish or Perish\" in mind where only the best scientists survive. The competitive rules of the game dictated that players should play against each other to see who could publish some research first. I thought this was a great idea until the first testing session with kids came along. The children automatically started cooperating with each other, showing each other what they had found and deduced! We previously designed our cards so that they could be hidden with ease. Imagine my surprise when I found them face up on the table, being shared along with the results of the experiments.\nAfter repeated testing the fact seemed indisputable. The game changed and became the cooperative game you can see. This turned out to be a big life lesson for me of how while trying to educate our children, they may end up educating us.\nRewards Explained:\nThis is the description of the pledges we created to thank you for your amazing support! If you have any questions regarding the rewards or you would like a combination that doesn't exists (like an extra poster or t-shirt) please write us a comment and we will make it happen for you!\nScientific e-book about subatomic particles: every person that lives with a kid has to constantly answer questions that could put even the most renowned scientists like Albert Einstein or Peter Higgs to shame. This book will help you fill up on your trivia about Quantum Physics and hopefully help you answer a question or two.\nPersonalized thank you email: because we love you so much, to show our gratitude we will send you a personalized email as soon as the campaign is over. Expect a small surprise inside ;)\nPost-cards: you will get a set of 4 different postcards to send your science geek friends. They will feature our super cute particle characters! (Preview soon)\nExtra notebook: every game includes 1 research notebook that players use to note down the results of the experiments, you will have an extra one so you don't have to worry about printing more for your little (or not so little) scientists!\nHD Wallpaper: your will be able to customize your computer or phone with a super awesome HD wallpaper that will gather the sub-atomic family together!

Amie & Matt have worked closely together, creating dozens of websites over the years, and he has become part of our chosen family. We knew exactly what we wanted to get a developer like Matt\u2014a cool kid\u2019s book about code, a book that would introduce Matt's baby to the nerdy world of websites, apps, and digital products. We were shocked to find that none existed... so, we wrote our own kid\u2019s code book (well, a PDF) with brightly colored words on a black background.\nMeet Matt and Camper. We want Matt to read our book to Camper before he gets much older, to inspire Camper with the wonderful world of code. I mean, the poor kid has waited his WHOLE life for this book.\nOUR VISION\nWe knew the right illustrations would bring the book to life and into the hands of future developers. At a party, we saw a cute illustration that our friend Sarah\u2018s colleague drew of her that perfectly captured Sarah\u2019s warm and spunky personality. We immediately knew we\u2019d found our partner for the code book, someone who would understand our vision and could build on it with his own silly imagination and fabulous creatures. With illustrator Jason Heglund on board, the The Wonderful World of Creatures & Code (aka WWoCC) was finally born.\nThis is the awesome Jason. This guy should get paid for all the nights and weekends he needs to spend illustrating WWoCC away from his wife and daughter.\nOUR BOOK\nThe Wonderful World of Creatures & Code introduces readers of all ages to foundational code terms and tags used to create websites. The book's world represents our diverse world, with girls, boys, and creatures of all types. WWoCC will be an 8\" by 10,\" full-color hardcover book with premium uncoated linen paper stock\u2014your eyes and hands will thank us.\nThe book is not all fun and games\u2014we worked hard to make sure the illustrations bring each code concept to life. Each drooling creature gets new features added in this lab, just like you add attributes to <a> tags to make them complete.\nA world of code, kids, creatures, and rhymes\nWWoCC colorfully illustrates 26 essential HTML tags and fundamental code elements used in making websites\u2014and has integrated \u201cinsider\u201d references that developers and engineers will appreciate. Short, rhyming pairs make reading time fun and easy, even with a complex topic. The creature-filled world draws kids in and keeps them hooked as they learn things like the difference between ordered and unordered lists.\nWho wouldn't want a pink polka-dotted creature with teef like those teaching HTML concepts like how a <br> tag creates line breaks in a website?!? So darn good.\nFun and accurate \nWritten to teach and inspire, The Wonderful World of Creatures & Code presents code terms and concepts in a simple way, rather than dumbing them down. With each WWoCC storytime, readers of all ages get familiar with arguably the most important language of the 21st century, with laughs and funny-toofed creatures along the way.\nPirates, unicorns, ice cream-eating creatures, and slobbery aliens teach the basics of making web pages\u2014including cascading style sheets. What more could you possibly want?\nA perfect 21st-century bedtime story \nThe Wonderful World of Creatures & Code is a must-have baby shower gift and go-to bedtime story for all kids, not just those of developers like our friend Matt. WWoCC is kid tested and developer approved. Please help us bring WWoCC from the drawing board to your child's hands.\nJust like <!doctype> starts every HTML file, the creature and kid are at the start of their own journey.\nOUR REQUEST \nWe need your help to get this book into the hands of as many children (and adults) as possible. Please fund this project and spread the word with friends and family. And, if you\u2019re wondering, most of the funds raised will be used to pay Jason the Great (illustrator) and to print and ship the book to you.

Here's an example of the type of stuffed creature you'll receive. Note: these examples are not WWoCC creatures, but they other creatures made by Yvonne, our awesome local craftswoman who will be making your kid's new best friend. We will choose a creature from the book to have made for you. Plus, you also get an autographed first-edition hardcover copy of WWoCC.\nBECOME IMMORTAL: Three people have the chance to have their kid drawn into the pages of WWoCC. You will need to send us a picture or two and a brief description of your child, and Jason will work his magic. Each of the three kids will make it into one of the inside pages of the book and will be drawn in the style of the rest of the book.

It takes between thirty and sixty minutes and can be played by two to six people. While the rules are easy enough for children as young as eight to understand and enjoy, older children will keep coming back for the surprisingly strategic gameplay.\nIn the game, each player takes on the role of one of six scientists competing for the coveted Golden Beaker, a trophy given out to the finest chemist in the world. To win this illustrious prize, they must collect element cards in order to complete a variety of molecules from their workbench. Be careful though, players need to take care when collecting elements because any they don\u2019t use will reduce their score at the end of the game.\nSo, why do we need your help? An excellent question! Board games are expensive to produce, especially those designed for children. These games require more vigorous testing to ensure the safety of the components. This means we need to have a run of at least 1,500 games in order to bring the unit price down enough to be affordable. In addition, we\u2019d use some of the funds to create the final art. We love the way our prototypes look, but there\u2019s always room for polish.\n6 Scientist Boards\n112 Element Cards\n36 Molecule Tiles\nInstruction Book\nParent Teacher Guide\nFrom the beginning, our goal has been to deliver STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) based games that are both fun and educational. Surely, there must be a lot of games like that out there already... right? That\u2019s what we thought until we did the research. To our surprise and disappointment, there just isn\u2019t a lot out there, and for most of the games we found, education seemed to be an afterthought, a gimmick used to sell games that were poorly thought out.\nOur games are different!  While fun is at the heart of everything we create, we also make sure that education is a first class citizen in each of these games. To that end, all our games come with both an instruction book and a Parent/Teacher Guide. While the instructions emphasize the simple, easy-to-learn nature of all our games, the Parent/Teacher Guide gives detailed ideas on how the game can be used to teach a variety of educational principles. We also help educators map game concepts to a number of widely used standards: Common Core, National Science Standards, etc\nSee what else we're working on at www.guidedplaygames.com, and check out our facebook page at www.facebook.com/thegoldenbeaker\nThe larger the run of games we can produce, the lower our unit cost. That means that as we hit our stretch goals we\u2019ll be able to include more components in each copy of the game. These additions come in the form of new elements along with their corresponding molecules.\n$100k \u2013 Silicon Expansion\n In addition to the element cards, we\u2019ll include the following molecules: Silicon Carbide (Carborundum), Silicon Dioxide (Silica), and Disilicon HexaHydride (Disilane).\n$150k \u2013 Boron Expansion\nIn addition to the element cards, we\u2019ll include the following molecules: Diborane, Boron Trifluoride, and Boron Trioxide.\n$200k \u2013 Magnesium Expansion\nIn addition to the element cards, we\u2019ll include the following molecules: Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Difluoride, and Magnesium Oxide.\nWe thought it might be helpful to put together a few videos explaining some of the mechanics of the game.

It's packed with activities and fun quizzes. The book teaches concepts including:\nBrainstorming\nTesting your idea\nCreating a product\nNetworking\nProfit & Cost of Goods\nMarketing and more!\nThese are skills she'll use throughout her life.\nWhy is This Important? The Gender Gap.\nThe average revenue of a woman owned business is just 25% of her male counterparts.  Experts say the solution is to get girls interested in entrepreneurialism before high school.

Each kit includes one set of completed hair ties/bracelets and enough material, charms, and instructions for your girlpreneur to make 4 more sets. The meaning of Be Great is revealed in the book.(small parts not for children under 3 years).\nNew Reward!!  You Can Be in The Book!!\nWe just added these new very special rewards.

Fresh craft brew, spilled and gone. Perhaps you are savoring your favorite beer throughout the night and just want to keep it fresh. Or maybe you just don\u2019t want your beer spilling all over where it shouldn't be. Either way, we've got the answer!\nIt\u2019s time to save the beer. \nFollow along on social with the #SAVETHEBEER hashtag\nIntroducing Pop & Stop, one of the world\u2019s first two-in-one bottle opener and sealer, made right here in the USA using 3D printer technology.\nSimple Sealing\nBUT\u2026 most products on the market don\u2019t solve the problem well. This one does.\nPLAY\n\nOpen. Drink. Seal.  It's that simple!\nKey chain sized, it\u2019s perfect for replacing that old bottle opener you have because it comes with the added capability of sealing the beer bottle, trapping that wonderful, wonderful carbonation. \nThe secret to anti-gravity beer\nPop & Stop is ideal for you, and really, anyone who loves beer. \nDesigned by an Aerospace engineer and beer lover, we are raising money to take this product to the next level.  Right now, we are using a 3D printer to make these.  That's cool, but what we really need is a mold to help take this to the next level. \nWe plan on keeping all the manufacturing in the USA, so we need your help. The rise of craft beer is an American phenomenon--let's keep it local.  The mold will help us customize Pop & Stop for you or your company.  When we raise enough money for a plastic mold, we'll take it to the next step with metal--an aerospace-grade item. Think of all the beer you will save for you and others... Support us and share with your friends!\nShare on Facebook!\nSome of the ways Pop & Stop serves you:\n1. Keeps the freshness of your beer for 48 hrs or more\n2. Keeps strangers or friends from adding things to your beer\n3. Helps avoid spillage during bumps, drops and knocks\n4. Opens and seals at your leisure\n5. Identifies your beer with different color options or personalization\n6. Works on all beer types except some twist offs\n7. Works on most glass bottled soda\n8. Each unit opens hundreds of bottles in its lifetime\nWe are patent pending and have a dozen more designs we are hoping to launch in 2015, along with many more functional applications.\nFirst and foremost, our passion started with craft beer and the tremendous waste we saw of a national treasure.

No other installation required.\nKidokey works with all devices connected to its wi-fi network, like tablets, phones, laptops and desktops.\nWe know that you don\u2019t have time to check every site on the Internet so we have done the work for you. Every web site your kids can access has been reviewed by real people from our team, not a computer program. Kidokey comes with 100s of thousands of sites already reviewed by our team and you can also add/remove sites as you wish.\nKidokey is filled with simple yet essential features. For example, you can limit your kids to accessing education sites only when they do their homework!\nPlug & Play\nKidokey is a very simple solution to distraction-free, safe Internet content for kids. The Kidokey box plugs right into your existing router and that's it. You just have to change your existing wi-fi password if your kids know it.\nScheduling & Time Management\nKidokey comes pre-set with sensible website controls and time management defaults that you can easily adjust to fit your family\u2019s needs. A simple daily schedule shows what sites can be accessed and when. \nThere's 3 possible settings for each time period: access to all authorized sites, just the educational ones (we call it \"homework time\") or no Internet access.\nWhite List Filtering\nAt Kidokey, a team of people works behind the scenes to review and categorize every website and app your kids can access. We use a \u2018white list\u2019 approach to building the database. \u2018White list\u2019 means only approved sites are allowed and everything else is blocked. This is the safest filtering solution.\nWe also evaluate the educational value of sites \u2013 so you can rest assured that when it\u2019s time for homework, there won't be any additional distractions. \nParental Controls Easy on Parents \nKidokey is all about simple. The Parent Dashboard is where you control the settings of your Kidokey box. It is a tablet and mobile-friendly website that resides on the cloud, so you can easily override policies in effect from anywhere. For example, approve the use of a web site on your mobile phone from work.\nKid-friendly Search Engine\nFrom their Kidokey home page, your kids can search their own version of the web, see what sites you have recently approved and check out our Staff Picks. \nApp & Game Controls\nThe Kidokey box filters everything on its Wi-Fi network, not just web pages. Using the Parent Dashboard, you can select what apps or games you want to allow access to and when. \nDatabase Updates\nMaintaining such a wide database of kid-friendly sites and apps is a lot of work, but so is taking care of your kids. We strive to keep Kidokey both affordable and accessible. When you purchase the Kidokey box, you also get one year of free database updates (2 years for Kickstarter backers). After that, updates are available on a yearly basis for $25. \nBut we don\u2019t want you to pay for database updates! For each friend that you refer and who also purchases a Kidokey box, you\u2019ll receive another full year of free database updates. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\nCheck out the early-bird special rewards. Be one of the first to support the project and you'll get lifetime database updates!\nAge-based Access\nWe rate and categorize websites and apps by age groups. Some sites are classified as great for teenagers but inappropriate for pre-teens or younger ones. To ensure that your kids are accessing age-appropriate content, the Kidokey search engine takes your kid\u2019s age into account when returning search results.\nContent in Your Language\nKidokey is multi-lingual. You can easily set the list of languages that you want to be available to your kids. \nAll the details on our web site at kidokey.com.\nLatest prototype (3D printed -- ignore the rough aspect)\nThis blue wonder uses the latest wi-fi chips to give your kids the best speed possible. \nVarious stages of the box design\nI'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. I have two sons, now 15 and 13. \nA few years ago, when they got their own computers, I worked hard to engage the operating system's parental control. It was just two computers to maintain, and it was just bearable. But when they got additional devices (iPods, iPads, etc.) things got messy and I started to look for Wi-Fi routers that had some sort of filtering. I found nothing satisfying. The user experience was terrible at best and updating the list of sites was always a tedious process. So, I modified a Wi-Fi router for them.\nLife went on and I quickly realized that I wasn't the only one to encounter these issues. The multiplication of devices was making it harder and harder on parents all around me. My entrepreneurial spirit kicked in (it's not my first company) and I started work full-time on Kidokey with two goals: ease of use (for both parents and kids) and safety.\n- Finalize the box firmware.\n- Source the power adapter and Ethernet cable.\n- Deploy the back-end servers in a scalable way.\n- Launch the production of the box and order the electronic boards in volume.\n- Design and order the packaging.\n- Test, test, test, test.\n\nThe funds gathered in the campaign will be used to pay for production costs, order the first batch of electronics and hire a few key people that are already working with us part-time.\n\n\n As soon as the KS campaign completes, we'll trigger the volume order of the box shell and its electronics. There's about 4 to 6 weeks of lead time. Meanwhile, we'll commission the extra back-end servers and heavily test the whole thing.\n\nThis gives us a planned release in March 2015. \n\nChristmas special !

W\u00dcF is not just for training or tracking, but rather for learning.\nWith a unique combination of hardware, tucked inside a beautifully designed case, W\u00dcF studies and understands your dog\u2019s movements, sounds, activities, locations and interactions, in order to gather a full picture of his lifestyle and habits.\nOnce W\u00dcF understands who your dog is, we start to learn what sort of relationship you and your dog have together. From the walks you go on, to the way you talk to each other and what your favorite playtime activity is.\nThis learning allows us to provide simple and actionable ways to improve on the major challenges (barking, pulling on leash, anxiety, etc.) and find even more ways to bond and play (new games at the park, advanced training, etc.).\nWith one suggestion a day, our goal is simple, to help dog owners around the world have a Good Dog, Every Day.\nInputs\nMicrophone - We can hear when he barks, understand the type of bark and even listen for external causes for the bark.This allows us to recognize patterns in his barking that help us find the root of the bark rather than addressing the symptom.\nGPS - Main purpose is for peace of mind that your pup is never lost, but also handy to show us where they go on a daily basis.Do they have a perimeter that they must inspect every morning and what does this say about them being territorial?\nAccelerometer - Measuring their activity to see when they are most (in)active, how much they sleep during the day and how far the walker really walked them to learn how many calories they burn so we know how much to feed them.\nBluetooth - BLE (Low Energy) connects to \u201csmart\u201d devices inside and outside the house to exchange information about location, proximity, speed and more. Can be used to snap a picture from your DropCam, to turn on the DOG TV, or even to detect if he\u2019s going in a room he doesn\u2019t belong in.\nOutputs\nSpeaker - Say \u201chi\u201d when you are missing them at work, work on obedience through voice commands or enable the invisible leash for off-leash control (more on that below). There are so many possibilities for training, safety and games when you can talk to your dog from anywhere.\nVibration - More humane than a shock while still useful for getting his attention.\nBluetooth - Constant connection with smartphone to share information about distance apart, \u201cBest Friend Time\u201d and other contextual data.\nGSM - Utilizing the 2g/3g networks, we keep your family connected around the world, even when separated by oceans and time zones.\nBy pre-ordering through our Kickstarter campaign, you will receive your W\u00dcF before anyone else in the world, you can get a limited edition color, you can become a beta tester (ask us!), you can get a full year of premium for free, you have a voice in our final development and you also help a startup bring a powerful idea to life. \nWe take care of our friends. Contribute today and let us show you how. :-)\nWe believe that the training industry is ripe for a rethink. Everyday, we witness owners who have the best intentions but a lack of guidance in getting the \u201cdog of their dreams\u201d. With trends like \u201cflipping the classroom\u201d, MOOCs or Gamified language learning, the traditional ways that we learn are being challenged and updated.\nWUF is doing the same thing for dog training. With fun, daily exercise, supported by data, WUF is bringing a whole new concept to becoming the pack leader to fit our active, mobile lives.\n\"No more lost dogs\" is just the beginning! GPS is vital, but is only just scratching the surface of what's possible with W\u00dcF.\nThrough customer development, speaking with hundreds of owners, trainers and vets, we looked at the entire relationship to discover what would be most useful in a \"wearable\" device. This led to our unique and patent-pending combination of hardware, including microphone and speaker, to inspire a whole new slew of capabilities and benefits. \nBecause, having a dog is a lifestyle and every way we can learn how to bring more balance to it, means healthier and better behaved pups living with happier families, friends and neighbors.  \nSome of the things we\u2019ve mentioned above have been tried before. The GPS and activity tracking are obvious, with several startup companies creating products that do just that, while training products have been around for years that include shock, vibration and anti-bark methodologies.\nNot a single one of these products is taking the approach that WUF has invented, turning a product that is always with your dog into a learning device that recognizes, analyzes and advises in real time. \nFinally an e-collar that looks cool. Our device is sleek, modern and attractive. Further, it comes in multiple colors and has an interchangeable system so you can accessorize and personalize your pup\u2019s look. Just imagine, vibrant orange for a trip to the park, cool grey when walking around town and camo for the weekend in the woods.\nClose up of our latest prototype\nRenderings of W\u00dcF's Two Main Colors\nLatest Renderings with SAMPLE Collars\nRendering of W\u00dcF internals\nW\u00dcF's smartphone app follows the \"Freemium\" app model. There is a core version that will ALWAYS BE FREE alongside multiple ways to upgrade the experience with a-la-carte Premium Features. \nLearn more about our Free and Premium features in the FAQs below.\nIndustrial Design\nBy splitting the product into two pieces, the Brains and the Case, our collar allows dog owners around the world to find the perfect style to express their (dog's) personality. \nWe are launching with a couple core cases, with the future of \"W\u00dcF Wear\" holding unlimited options to personalize your pup's look. \nExternally, our approach combines an appealing, minimalist design with a soft, yet durable, outer case, creating a contoured feel for comfort and a eye-catching look for self-expression. \nInternally, we\u2019ve designed the electronics to maximize space, providing for optimal battery capacity and antenna reception. Fitting inside a waterproof shell, the brains can pop into and out of any case you want.\nSafe\nAs the technologies are the same as in human smartphones, they have been extensively tested and approved for humans to use, let alone dogs. So, if you ever want to put one on your kid or significant other, they would be totally safe too!\nDisclaimer - W\u00dcF is not responsible for any relationship issues that result from the above suggested idea. ;-p\nBiteproof\nSo when your two 120 pound dobermans are roughhousing in the backyard, no matter who wins, W\u00dcF comes out on top.\nThe outer case is made of similar materials to the most durable dog toys while the \u201cbrains\u201d are tucked away in a hard, molded plastic shell.\nWaterproof\nGo ahead, swim, roll in the mud, take a shower, do what dogs do! Our smart collar device will stay fully functional, safe and dry up to at least 1 meter of water.\nShockproof\nConsidering the playful nature of dogs, W\u00dcF collar device must be shockproof. All the delicate electronics are enclosed in a rigid enclosure protected by a flexible outer cover for plenty of ample cushioning. \n Main Hardware Features\nAccelerometer\nOur 6 axis motion processing unit captures the entire range of doggie movements. We can detect and learn all about your dog's favorite ways to move:\nMovement: Up, down, left, right, forward, backward.\nPositioning: lean right/left, bend forward/backward, turn side/side. \nGPS\nOur 48 channel GPS includes advanced power saving modes and assisted tracking; we can track your pup\u2019s movements in dense city environments and deep wooded areas.\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE)\nBluetooth 4.1, the industry's latest standard. Our algorithms automatically default to BLE when in range so as to maximize its extreme power saving advantages.\nCellular + IoT network\nCURRENT: Quad band 2G and 3G enabled. Cellular networks enable W\u00dcF to connect to your smartphone when away from your pup. \nFUTURE: IoT networks like Helium or SigFox are currently being evaluated for potential use in first generation product.\nProcessor\nARM cortex microprocessor with dedicated digital signal processing unit. The heart of the device has its own embedded operating system, swiftly managing all of the functionality and features.\nIntelligent Power Management\nPower management IC with over-voltage, under-voltage and short circuit protection connected to Lithium Polymer battery.\nCurrent setup achieves 5 day battery life on second generation prototype. Goal is to make it so you never have to take the collar off to charge, with new wireless charging technologies hopefully making that possible. \nMain Software Features\n\nGPS Tracking + Geo Fencing\nPeace of mind to always know where your dog is. Let's work together to a future with no more lost dog signs! \nSet the \u201cfence\u201d around your yard and if your dog leaves the area, you\u2019ll be be notified to start tracking immediately.\nActivity Monitoring\nCharts and graphs are cool for a bit, but eventually get old. We calculate it all for you and give you the one metric that really matters for your dog's health: How much do I feed my dog today?\nBeyond that, we\u2019ll provide ongoing suggestions to live a healthy, active lifestyle based on age, breed, season and location to get you off the couch and keep you moving!\nTwo-Way Audio\nA \u201csmart microphone\u201d listens in and sends you alerts if your dog is barking a lot, crying, whining, growling or whimpering unexpectedly.\nA powerful speaker allows you to talk to your dog from anywhere in world, whether to check in when away at work, or to train with manual or automatic commands such as \u201csit\u201d, \u201cstay\u201d, \u201cdown\u201d and more. \nInvisible Leash\nThe off-leash control you\u2019ve always wanted! Let your pup wander: just set the perimeter around you and W\u00dcF will keep him as close or far as you desire.\nBased on two-way audio, vibration and our included training program (think \u201cadvanced clicker training\u201d) whenever your dog approaches the perimeter, it\u2019ll receive a series of commands to: a) stop, b) listen and c) come on back to you to get a treat or affection!\nTraining\nBite sized training programs to build you up into the family\u2019s top dog trainer, 10 minutes at a time.\nGames\nFew ideas: \n1) Augmented reality RPG with you and your dog as the main characters.  \n2) Geo-Caching with your dog in on the hunt. \n3) The Quiet Game :-) \nHave an idea for a cool game? Connect with us and lets build it together. \nGamification\nAt the end of the day, living with a dog should be FUN! Our platform adds Gamification elements to encourage, support and reward you for doing the tough stuff, while throwing in some competition for you and your fellow dog \u201cparent\u201d friends.\nThe Hardware Evolution\nFrom development boards strewn across a desk to a tight, 2x quarter sized PCB with dozens of components nested into a compact design.\nThe Software Evolution\nJust like the hardware, our software has gone through several iterations. From an MVP app (below) that proves the concept, to a fully immersive UX that highlights only the most important things for you, each day.\nPLAY\n\nColor\nGray is sleek while Orange has pop. Which one is best for your pup? \nSize\nHow big is your pup? Our devices will come in a standard size range for small, medium, large/extra large dogs, based on the following collar widths:\nLarge strap opening: 1 inch (2.54 cm), \nMedium strap opening: \u00be of an inch (1.9 cm), and \nSmall strap opening: \u215d of an inch (1.6 cm).\nWe\u2019ve gotten to this point as bootstrapping entrepreneurs, on what we like to say, \u201cone tank of gas\u201d. Now we are ready to FUEL UP and take things to the next level. \nWe've garnered great support and excitement in our local networks and are now coming to Kickstarter to attain an initial market validation that we need to prove that this product is a winner and has the potential to improve the lives for millions of dog owners around the world. \nWe need your help to prove this demand and enable W\u00dcF to become a true market reality.

If you have any suggestions for other stretch rewards, I am very open to suggestions! I had considered an audio version of the book, but after investigating, at this time it looks like the production costs associated with that idea make it out of reach at this point.\nThanks!\nDean\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was reading a biography of William Shakespeare when all the threads and my loose thoughts coalesced into a storyline, a tale that seemed worth telling -  the story of an ex-soldier turned play-actor, caught up the dangerous uncertainty of the English Reformation...and the vagaries of an eleven-year old Will Shakespeare. \nMost fiction embedded in the Elizabethan era tends to be bodice-ripping tales of Court intrigue, set amidst the silken splendor of palaces.  Mine tends to hang about in ale-soaked taverns, muddy streets and fetid back-alleys where cold-steel by lantern light offers redemption or grim death by turns\u2026\nThe Jesuit Letter is the result: 112,000-odd words of historical fiction, hung together in 25 chapters of murder, mayhem and copious amounts of sword-play.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary:\nThe Jesuit Letter reader copy cover\nThe innyards of London are closed due to plague, and the Earl of Worcester\u2019s Men are on the road, touring through the market-towns of the midlands. Ex-soldier turned play-actor Christopher Tyburn finds himself entangled in a murderous and deadly conspiracy when he intercepts a coded letter from a hidden Jesuit priest in Warwickshire. \nTyburn thought he had left bloodshed and violence behind him when he abandoned the war against the Spanish in Flanders.  Now, stalked by an unknown enemy, he must race to unmask the true nature of the conspiracy and hunt down the Jesuit to clear his name, or die a traitor\u2019s death.\nYou can read an excerpt from The Jesuit Letter below or read the first three chapters on my website. As an added bonus, the opening chapter of Thieves Castle, the work-in-progress sequel, is also up...\nPLAY\n\nExcerpt:\nIt was all about waiting. \nFlanders had been damp and cold and dull and dangerous.  The motley collection of soldiers in the Lowlands that made up the small English expedition under Morgan and Gilbert had been a m\u00e9lange of ex-Sea Beggars, Prussian mercenaries, English soldiers-of-fortune and rake-hell adventurers, leavened with a healthy mix of brutal Scottish Highlanders and amoral Dutchmen.  They were hard, cruel and unscrupulous men, men who prized loot, fighting, drink and women.  They were routinely drunk, undisciplined, licentious and lice-ridden.  They fought among themselves almost as much as they fought the Spaniards but fight they did.  They had honed their belligerent skills in the dank and stony streets of Edinburgh and Haarlem, in the hard arenas of clan warfare and on the chill decks of the Dutch brigand fleet. \nIn their ranks, Tyburn had been well-schooled.\nThe man stepped forward, looking to close fast and pull the interloper off balance, to reach out with his massive calloused hands and break this bastard player.\nWaiting was over.\nTyburn sidestepped and slammed his open hand into the lunging man\u2019s throat.  The man gagged and choked, both hands inadvertently pulling away from their intended target.  Tyburn\u2019s booted foot raked down the man\u2019s instep and he lurched forward, his advance turning into a painful stumble, Tyburn arced a hard closed left fist into the man\u2019s right ear and another into his stomach.  As his opponent bent over, Tyburn levered his arm and slammed him headfirst into the cornerpost with a sickening crack.\nThe man fell like a brick.\nCuttle glared up at the player and rose, head swimming.  One hand dropped to his belt, grasping the bone hilt of his dagger.\nTyburn regarded Cuttle with a chary stare and flipped back his yellow cloak, tapping the hilt of his rapier.  \u201cThat\u2019s a path you don\u2019t want to tread, friend.\u201d he said in a mild tone, shaking his head.\nWhat's been done?\nThe book is 100% complete, but as I learned, writing is only part of the road to publication.\nThe next step lies before me: going from words on paper to a fully published novel.\nPublication is a journey and, although self-publishing today is click-of-a-button-simple, putting out a good book \u2013 one that has few typos, a nice layout and structure, well-edited & graced with brilliantly compelling cover art \u2013 can be expensive.\nI have invested significant time and effort in research, writing and re-writing, aimed at creating a compelling and exciting story set in the Elizabethan world, while trying to keep it as historically accurate as possible. \nWhat's needed to bring this tale to publication? \nTo bring a good product to market - in this case the first novel in a planned series - you need to provide a quality reading experience and value for readers.  That means superlative writing, a great story and a terrific reading experience.  This requires professional editing, proofing, layout design (interior & exterior), multiple e-book formats, and a great cover.\nSuccessful publication also requires marketing, in order to be visible and promoted to the widest possible reading audience.  That's easy if you are in the hands of a major publisher, but much harder if you are on your own.\nEditing, design and marketing\nThese are the three items that bring me to Kickstarter.  I need capital support to help me bring the book to the publication stage.  This involves sourcing & hiring:\n1).  A great copy editor\n2). A layout designer to help manage the interior design layout so a reader's experience is flawless and smooth no matter if it be a Kindle, Kobo, Nook or a print copy.\n3). A cover designer who can capture the energy & excitement of the story and help get readers to pick it off the shelf.\nWhat do you get?\nAside from my undying gratitude, some great rewards and a well-spun story, your investment in the publication of The Jesuit Letter isn't just the start of this tale, it is the start of a SERIES.  Tyburn's tale is planned to encompass a significant part of the Elizabethan reign, from the 1570's through to at least 1588 and the advent of the Armada.\nOnce the first book is off the ground, the others will follow.  The second book, Thieves Castle, is currently 1/3 complete and is slated to be done by the end of 2014, followed by book three, Sorcerer's Street, and at least two more that are in the early planning stages.  \nInvesting in a Kickstarter is about more than just swag, its about the opportunity to help support, create, develop and build an endeavor. \nNobody likes to wait!  If project supporters are interested in receiving the unedited advance per-release digital copy of The Jesuit Letter immediately (i.e. no waiting til September!) I would be more than pleased to provide it as an Advance Edition to the various reward levels.\nEven if you decide that The Jesuit Letter isn't for you, poke about and throw your support behind some of the other projects on Kickstarter.  Ideas and dreams always can use a little bit of help or a nudge in the right direction.\nI hope you decide to be a part of it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe upfront risks are frankly minimal. The book is 100% complete (barring editor-recommended re-writes and corrections), so it is mainly editing & design time and sourcing suppliers for these activities. \n\nThere are minimal risks associated with completion of this project.\n\nKey Challenges:\n\n1). Sourcing a good editor\n2). Sourcing a good layout & interior book designer\n3). Cover design\n4). Marketing plan (FYI - I happen to work in marketing during my day job, so that may give me a key advantage instead...)\n5). Finding time between walking the dog, taking the kid to hockey and everything else that life throws at you..\n\nMy expectation is that the edit & the cover design can happen in parallel. The final interior layout design would be the final piece prior to publication. My plan is that, barring any unexpected difficulties with sourcing the editor, the final version of book should be ready for publication by the end of the summer of 2014 with an official release date in Fall, 2014.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Exclusive Sneak Preview: Thieves' Castle", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\n\nAs a part of my IndieGoGo campaign to raise publishing funds, here's a short exclusive preview of the first three chapters of the new book Thieves' Castle.

Cheer up a sick friend by building a game to play with them. Thank someone more personally with a one-of-a-kind interactive card. Build a game as a school project, which shows off your knowledge of the topic in a fun way.\nVixle is Social - From creating code, art, and sound, to playing games or hanging out, everything you can do in Vixle can be done side-by-side with a friend, whether they are on a computer next to you, or across the globe. Families can build and play together, working at different skill levels, but without leaving anyone behind.\nVixle is Easy To Learn - Everyone is a novice at something, and so we've made each activity in Vixle easy to learn. From adults with no programming experience to middle schoolers, everyone should be comfortable learning to use Vixle. Even younger kids will be fine, with a little guidance.\nVixle is Powerful - In order to build together, Vixle needs to support all skill levels, so the tools grow with you. More powerful code editing and APIs are available. Richer and more detailed models and animations can be created. Assets you create in other tools can be brought into Vixle, and vice versa.\nVixle is Code - What separates interactive media like games from video, images, and text? Code. It's the lifeblood of your game, and it's front-and-center in Vixle. Get started with block code (similar to Scratch or Blockly), and then move on when you're ready. Eventually you'll look at all the devices in your life, and realize the power you have over them.\nStart with Block Code\nProgress to Lua\nVixle Maker is the software you receive at the BETA pledge level and above. It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and allows you to build worlds and play with other Vixle users on your network. Our servers help connect you and your friends, so play over the Internet is often possible without Hosting.\nVixle Explorer is free for everyone, and enables anyone to play the games you've built with Vixle Maker. It runs in a web browser and on mobile devices, to make it easy to share your creations with friends and family who don't have Vixle. Only your hosted worlds can be played by Vixle Explorer.\nStarting in May 2015, you'll get 1 year of free Hosting for one of your worlds. Hosted worlds run on our computers to ensure uniform access and performance, and can be played with Vixle Explorer. You'll have the option to renew Hosting for your personal account at an estimated $1 per month. Even if you don't renew, Vixle Maker is yours to use forever.\nVixle Maker will be released with 3 Asset Packs in the fantasy, sci-fi, and modern genres. Accounts with an active Hosting subscription will receive an additional Asset Pack every 6 months, as well as the ability to share their own models with other Vixle users in a community gallery. Some of our stretch goals accelerate the release of more Asset Packs.\nAlthough it's not software, we want to call out the short story offered to backers at FICTION level, \"Journey to Galaxy's Edge.\" Brian was first inspired to learn programming by the Micro Adventure series in the 80s. The exciting stories transformed you into a hero who uses coding skills to overcome obstacles.\nIn the same way, Journey includes scenes which prompt the reader to play a game or solve a programming challenge, using Vixle. The challenges encourage experimentation to foster an intuitive understanding of how the code works. The reader can then copy the scenes to their own worlds in order to further play with and expand them.\nWe have a few demos for you to check out, which show the progress we've made. They run directly in your browser, with the help of the popular Unity web player.  Most Windows and Mac browsers are supported, and HTML5 support is planned for later in the year.\nAuger - A fully working game running on the current version of Vixle Explorer.\nModeler - A standalone voxel editor, enabling you to build 3D models similar to how you will in Vixle Maker. The models you create can then be saved as images or shared with your friends. In the future, you'll also be able to order 3D prints of your model, directly from within Vixle. Using the Modeler requires logging in with a Google+ or Facebook account, so that we can save your work.\nJourney to Galaxy's Edge - A preview of the story available with the FICTION tier, along with a concept video of the first challenge.\nAll of our pledge levels up to ALPHA include all of the rewards at the previous levels. Here we give the full list at each level, along with a little more explanation.\n$5 - HIGH FIVE - Digital desktop wallpaper and icons suitable for social media avatars, ideal for showing your support for Vixle.\n$20 - BETA - The digital images, plus a copy of Vixle Maker when it goes beta, estimated at the end of this year. The software will be released on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your personal account will include two usernames, which allows two people to use Vixle at the same time on different computers. Starting in May 2015, you'll also get one year of hosting.\n$25 - FICTION - The digital images, Vixle Maker with 2 usernames and 1 year of hosting, and a digital copy of the short story \"Journey to Galaxy's Edge,\" which includes 6 introductory programming challenges as part of the plot. Any additional stories that are unlocked by stretch goals will be yours as well.\n$40 - FAMILY - The digital images and story, and Vixle Maker with a total of 5 usernames and 1 year of hosting. Vixle is ideal for families and friends to play together, and this level adds 3 more users at just $5 each.\n$50 - MEDIA - The digital images and story, Vixle Maker with 5 usernames and 1 year of hosting, the digital soundtrack of Vixle music, and the digital \"Making of Vixle\" art book. In addition, backers that later purchase a physical art book from our web store will have their edition personally signed and endorsed.\nExamples of Vixle music created by Mike Jones:\n$75 - SHIRT - The digital images, story, art book and soundtrack, Vixle Maker with 5 usernames and 1 year of hosting, and a specially designed t-shirt exclusively for backers at this level (and above), personally signed by both Kit and Brian. This level includes shipping anywhere in the U.S. for free. International shipping will be the cheapest we can find, with the difference billed separately at fulfillment time in July.\nLimit T-Shirt Concept: Vixle Launch!\n$100 - ALPHA - The digital images, story, art book and soundtrack, Vixle Maker with 5 usernames and 1 year of hosting, the signed t-shirt, and access to Vixle starting with the Alpha release, estimated in September, and your name will appear in the credits.  In addition, you'll have the option to join our tester program, which gives you the ability to view and update our bug lists, and we'll communicate with you frequently to solve problems and get your feedback, so that you can help shape Vixle.\nAll of the following tiers are limited in quantity, and include everything in ALPHA.\n$150 - CLUB - limited to 25 - You'll be able to sponsor a school or social club of your choice for one year, with a group account that includes 30 usernames. Unlike personal accounts, group accounts become inactive if not renewed. For larger clubs, you can pledge an additional $50 for each additional 10 members.\n$500 - MAKER - limited to 10 - Kit and Brian will work with you to create a custom character or object, along with interesting animations and code to go with it. Your creation will be included in the Vixle catalog, so that all Vixle Maker users will be able to add it to their own worlds. If desired, your name will be displayed prominently in the title or description of your model.  We'll also have a 3D version of your model printed and sent to you, perfect for displaying.\n$1000 - SCHOOL - limited to 5 - You'll be able to sponsor a middle or secondary school of your choice for the 2015/16 school year, with a group account that includes 250 usernames. Unlike personal accounts, group accounts become inactive if not renewed. You can add support for an additional 25 students for every additional $100 pledged.\n$2500 - JAM - limited to 6 - Game jams are one of the great traditions of game development. Over the course of a weekend, the Vixle team will work side-by-side with you, day and night, to turn your game idea into a reality. You're the boss, you get to make the decisions. If you're local, you can choose to join us at the Pittsburgh office (location TBD), or we'll stay connected to you via Google Hangouts and Vixle (of course)! It'll be a blast, and we'll create a 3D print for you and us to commemorate the occasion.\nThe possibility for Vixle stretch goals is endless. The more support we get, the richer the platform becomes.  Here are a few to look forward to:\n$60,000 - Vixle lives!\n$70,000 - Add the ability to import and voxelize programs created with MIT's Scratch programming environment. Released in January.\n$80,000 - Add a 4th Asset Pack in a genre chosen by the Vixle backers. Released with Beta.\n$90,000 - Add a visual editor for customizing NPC behavior, such as path following, dialogue, trading, and state machines which heuristically govern mood. Released in February.\n$100,000 - Finish the \"Journey to Galaxy's Edge\" trilogy with two more stories and related challenges. Released in February and April.\nThere's plenty more to announce, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.\nWhat's in an Asset Pack?\nAn Asset Pack consists of at least 8 animated characters, 20 terrain textures, 40 objects, associated code, sounds, and one musical theme. Each character comes with at least one unique animation, in addition to standard animations like walking. All of the assets in a pack are thematically related, coming from a specific genre, such as Fantasy or Virtual Reality.  Vixle backers at BETA and above will receive at least 5 Asset Packs, between the original three, and the two they'll get during the first year of hosting, plus any unlocked by stretch goals.\nWhat's the difference between a world and a game?\nA world is the physical space you create, for users to visit and explore. Within your world, you can build games to play. Games can be ongoing activities that users engage in while visiting, such as capture the flag, paintball, or nurturing pets. They can also be structured experiences with an explicit start and end, like a board game, or a platformer with levels.\nBrian likes to create worlds as virtual amusement parks, where the games take the role of rides. This format encourages visitors to come see what's new, and at the same time play their old favorites. In the end, you decide what your world is like.\nSome users may choose to create multiple worlds, either to keep them thematically separate, or because they have different groups of people they like to experience them with. Vixle Maker allows you to create as many worlds as you like, but hosting is billed on a per world basis.\nWhat's the difference between an account and a username?\nAn account is used for billing, and is managed by whomever is \"in charge\", such as a parent or teacher. Each account has several usernames permanently associated with it, one for each person who uses Vixle.\nHosting is billed on a per-account basis, and allows the users of that account to host a number of their worlds online. Hosting allows a personal account to host one world online for $1 per month. The first year of hosting is free, and users can change which world they are hosting at any time.\nAs an example, a family of five that uses Vixle together would need a single account with 5 usernames. For $1 per month, they could host one world online and work on it together. If each member wanted their own hosted world, the cost would be $5 per month, although we expect to offer volume discounts in such cases.\nDo all usernames associated with an account have to be part of the same household?\nNo, your extra username is a great way to invite a friend to use Vixle with you.\nWhat's the difference between a personal and group account?\nAll of the backer tiers offer personal accounts, except for the CLUB and SCHOOL tiers, which offer both an personal account to the backer, and a group account for the organization of their choice.\nPersonal accounts remain active even if you choose not to renew hosting, so you'll always be able to use Vixle Maker to build and play games.  Hosting for personal accounts is $1 per world per month.\nGroup accounts are subscription-based, and become inactive if not renewed.  The cost of Hosting for group accounts is included, and allows every member to host one world.\nWhat happens if I don't renew hosting?  Do I lose access to Vixle or my games?\nNo, your hard work belongs to you. With a personal account, you will always be able to use Vixle Maker to continue building and playing your games, even networked on your LAN. Only free Vixle Explorer users won't be able to play your game. Vixle includes import and export options to common formats, so you can also take your work to professional game development programs, and vice versa.\nWill children under 13 be able to use Vixle online?\nYes, with caveats. The account holder will need to verify their parent relationship to the child. Once verified, we will provide a variety of parental controls to customize who your children can interact with online, and how. All controls will default to the most conservative settings, for added safety.\nWhere are all the physical rewards?\nThey're in another castle. We did significant research into the costs of a variety of cool physical rewards, but sadly the numbers didn't work out. As a small software company, there are no bargains on physical goods that we can pass along to you.  If we had added physical goods and shipping to our most popular backer levels, our funding target would have increased by 40%.\nWe still love swag, so we plan to sell non-limited Vixle t-shirts, folders, prints, art books, and soundtracks via our web store, opening in July. Otherwise, there's the SHIRT tier, which will get you a limited edition t-shirt. And don't forget that backers of the MEDIA tier that later order a physical copy of the art book can have their edition signed and endorsed!\nWhere does my money go?\nBy keeping our costs tight, we can put 83% of your pledges directly toward the development of Vixle. The distribution changes based on stretch goals we unlock, but if we raise $60k, it looks like this:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs software projects go, Vixle has a relatively high complexity due to the number of features and platforms being supported, especially given that Brian is currently the only engineer. However, Brian has 18 years of experience building and launching complex Internet software, and is one of the engineers Google trusted to work solo in a remote office.\n\nComplex software projects also tend to become delayed. In this case, we've waited to launch our Kickstarter until all of the potential show-stoppers were addressed. We built the game Auger to demonstrate that the Vixle core is nearly ready. LAN support and better project management will round out the core. From there, each additional feature (e.g. voxel editor, character animator, block code interface) is independent and incremental, meaning that if delays do occur, they will be on the order of days or weeks, rather than months. In addition, an early and active alpha test community will ensure that our progress is communicated clearly.\n\nOne of the selling points of Vixle, is our claim that it will be powerful enough for experts, but still accessible to middle-school children on their own. Brian would go insane with boredom if the former weren't the case. He is also a regular sponsor of the local middle school game design club, and will continue to tailor Vixle based on first-hand observations this fall, while students learn to use it for the first time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Reality Foil, LLC\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nBrian McBarron was a Staff Software Engineer at Google for 8 years before founding Reality Foil, an independent game studio in Pittsburgh...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Setbacks and Departures", "update_content": "Despite a final weekend boost that has brought us to 22% of our goal, I don't think anyone is going to call me a pessimist for saying that Vixle isn't going to be funded in the next 12 hours.

I have yet to stumble across a really intuitive interface to handle the rigging, skinning, and keyframing needed to animate modern 3D models. Internally, we've been using to animate Vixle models.

My book is about little Ruby.\nRuby and her friends\nWhy this matters?\nCode is the 21st century literacy and the need for people to speak the ABC of Programming is imminent. Our world is increasingly run by software and we need more diversity in the people who are building it.\nMore importantly, writing software is about expression, creativity - and practical application. Our kids should learn to bend, join, break and combine code in a way it wasn't designed to. Just as they would with crayons and paper or wood and tools. I believe there's plenty to learn in programming logic and culture before showing children a single screen.\nHere's what I want to do\n Hello Ruby is a children's book that comes with an activity book. The two books teach the very foundations of technology through stories and activities that serve as a simple template for all future learning. The book and workbook are aimed for four to seven year olds. \nWhy a storybook?\n We all have treasured childhood stories that have affected the way we see reality. Instead of only focusing on how applications are built or code is constructed, I want to tell about the architects, principles and personalities behind software. And I believe the best way to tell this story is through a book that will be read with children and parents at night, and live in the bookshelf for years to come.\nHello Ruby will be a classic journey of discovery that teaches the readers about different people working together, how problems can be solved in small sequences and how remixing and sharing helps everyone.\nIllustrations are as important as the story. My book will be full of detail and whimsy, with cutaways and magical moments, a world where everything is not apparent at once.\nHardcover book, 8 x 8 inches and 32 pages \nTraditional story of friendship, being different .. and technology. \nWhy an activity book?\nThe activity book teaches kids early programming skills. It\u2019s designed to be enjoyed by a kid alone, but can also be worked through with an adult. And best of all - the workbook is designed to be doodled, wrecked and drawn all over. \nThe foundational knowledge structures, like sequences, variables, patterns, loops, lists, conditionals, operators and events. Taught through exercises of dot-to-dot, pairs, odd-one-out, all from Ruby's world. \nA sprinkle of software culture, by teaching them to abstract and modularise, work iteratively and incrementally as well as encouraging them to reuse and remix work. \nCreativity and DIY attitude. Tons of doodles, logic puzzles and even a foldable miniature laptop that allows the kid to peek inside a computer. \nThe Budget\nThe book will be hardcover, 8x8 inches and 32 pages. The activity book is  16 pages and paperback. To make the minimum order of 1000 copies, I need you.\nYou'll get a lovely old-fashioned storybook that introduces Ruby and the other characters. In addition there will be a workbook with puzzles, exercises and additional materials for the parent to teach web literature for the little ones. \nI'm writing and illustrating all of this myself. Most of the funds will be production costs: printing the books and workbooks and hiring an editor. And you'll get to be a part of the journey of a first time author. \nBreakdown of budget\nEditor for spelling and storyline\nPurchase of fonts\nBook and workbook layout design\nObtaining ISBN numbers, registration fees and costs associated with getting listed in online bookstores\nProduction of the books \nShipping \nWho am I?\nPrior to writing this book, I co-founded Rails Girls, a global non-profit teaching programming to tens of thousands of women in over 160 cities. I also worked at Codecademy as one of the first employees. I first got excited about programming when I was 13 years old and madly in love with Al Gore. However, it took me almost ten years to learn more than the basics, so beginners are close to my heart. \nI'm a Ruby Hero 2013 and the Digital Champion of Finland. \nSee my talk at Heroku Waza 2013 on Ruby and a talk on girls & programming in Railsberry 2012. \nTell me more about Ruby!\n Gladly. I've actually already drawn a few of her adventures here.\nRuby is one of the best little girls I know.  \nShe has family all around the world. Her father is from Japan, but she has aunts and uncles and siblings and cousins everywhere.  Ruby loves her family, wants to be helpful and make people around her happy. \nSometimes Ruby is a little bossy. She says things like \u201cGet me the milk from the lowest shelf of the fridge\u201d and \u201cCombine two spoonfuls of cocoa with the milk\u201d. \nRuby learns quickly. If you show her how to make her bed, she\u2019ll have no trouble doing it a hundred times over. \nAnd she\u2019s independent: Ruby doesn\u2019t like other people telling her how to clean her room, only what should be done, while she prefers to figure out the process herself. \nAll the adults say Ruby is a sensible, nice kid. But sometimes she can be mischievous. If you\u2019re not very precise in ordering your chocolate, the kitchen might end up be flooding with hot cocoa. \nRuby\u2019s favorite things in the world are her precious gems. The colorful, glittering gemstones are presents from all over the world. When Ruby closes her eyes the gems become magic and help her do things she never could have done alone. \nRuby's friends are pretty mischievous too. Androids are messy. Snowleopard doesn't want to play with other kids. Penguins are booksmart but sometimes hard to understand. \nOh, and the coolest thing about Ruby? She and her friends have their own secret language. Can you guess what happens when Ruby says: \n  puts \u201chip hip hooray \u201c*5\nIn Ruby\u2019s world there are words that mean things and words that do things. And magic happens every day.\nPast updates\nFri Jan 24, 2014\nOh wow. What a day.\nYou are amazing. During the first 24 hours of the campaign we surpassed $100k. I'm so excited to be able to work on Ruby's world with all of this overwhelming support.\nEvery additional dollar will go towards building the magical world of Ruby. A larger budget means I can commit to making everything so much more better. Let\u2019s do this! Thank you so much for your support.\nHugs,\n- Linda", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019ve spent the last weeks learning everything I can about authoring, publishing and printing. The timelines for printing and shipping something this big are very different from the project I started with. It\u2019s all very exciting, but also all very new. Luckily I have great people helping me. \n\nI know it sucks to wait for more than 6 months for a book, but for normal industry printed books the cycle is even longer. Here's my plan: \n\n1. Making the book \nThis is the first time I\u2019m doing a children's book. I\u2019ve talked with several Kickstarter authors about the process as well as other children's book authors. I've almost written the story and sketched the pages into a storyboard format. Before starting with the final artwork, I'd like to hire a native english speaking editor to go through the story with me. With all of the support I can also work together with an art director. I hope you\u2019ll love every single page of both books as I've loved making them. \n\n2. Printing the book\n When the book leaves my desk, there\u2019s still a lot of things that need to happen. My biggest concern is the shipping, but also printing takes time. \n\nBoth the storybook and the workbook are industry standard, so production problems shouldn't be an issue. Now that the Kickstarter is ending, I'll know the number of books I can afford and where I should be printing them. \n\n3) Shipping the book\nShipping is expensive and always a bit of an unknown. This is why I\u2019m planning on shipping the books with Amazon and using their third party fulfilment services. If there are delays in shipping I\u2019ll keep everyone posted and try to share the e-book (as that\u2019s the one part I really can influence) as soon as possible with all the backers (excluding the 5 dollar pledge category). \n\nI\u2019m very committed to making this all happen and feel very privileged by all the support. I will keep you posted, all the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Love Letters for Computers \ud83d\udc8c", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "How do computers talk to each other?

This offer expires on 31st December!\nMy name is Martin Johnson and for 8 years I have been providing cinematic sound design, orchestral music, audio editing, mixing and mastering for some of Britain's best loved audio dramas, most of which have been broadcast on BBC Radio. These include many officially licensed audio adventures of Doctor Who (Big Finish Productions), the new horror anthology series Hammer Chillers (Hammer Films) and comedy horror series The Scarifyers (Bafflegab Productions). \nOsiris is a 6 episode original cinematic science-fiction audio drama series intended to be listened to in 5.1 surround sound (also available in standard stereo) and each episode will have a 1-hour running time. This Kickstarter project will fund the release of the first two epsiodes: Pilot and Osirian Enemy.\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the term \u2018audio drama\u2019, it is a term that is used to describe a radio play produced for CD release, digital download and web streaming. Unlike narrated audiobooks, audio drama is designed to sound like a film or television drama but using only audio to engage the listener\u2019s own imagination and provide the images. This is how audio drama excels where film cannot. Your imagination is far more powerful than any CGI effect and because it is purely sound your senses are heightened and it is much easier to be drawn into the acoustic environment. It is my strong opinion that an audio drama production does have to be well made otherwise something like an overused library sound effect could jolt you right out of the story and you will become instantly aware of the editing.\nHere is a trailer for my cinematic sound design, music and mixing work on the officially BBC licenced Doctor Who box set UNIT - Dominion. It will give you a small taster of how Osiris will sound in stereo...\nDeep in the heart of Sherwood Forest stands a great ancient oak tree, The Major Oak. Myths and legends surround the tree and many theories have been cast about its unusual size but none are close to the truth.\nIn a hidden cave beneath the Major Oak lies a semi-organic spaceship buried for thousands of years until October 2014 when a freak tremor causes graphic designer Jason Fox to fall into the cave while walking in the woodland with his flatmate William Tyler. Upon rescue they are joined by their old university friend Christopher Mason and the three of them are thrown into an epic adventure within our own solar system that they will never forget.\nThe two episodes of series one being made are as follows:\nEpisode One: Pilot (April 2014) by Martin Johnson\nJason Fox discovers a spaceship hidden for thousands of years beneath Sherwood Forest. Fox and his friends are thrown into a dangerous adventure and chased by authorities around the world.\nEpisode Two: Osirian Enemy (April/June 2014) by Dan Lacey\nOsiris is fired upon by Isis, an identical ship piloted by an alien female who wants Fox dead.\nIf these first two episodes are successful, and with current plans they should be very well received, Osiris will run for at least 2 series of 6 episodes each!\nI\u2019ve been developing Osiris for a number of years. Listening to it will be like listening to a Hollywood blockbuster film on audio with incredible atmospheric sound design and a huge orchestral soundtrack. It will also be one of the first of its kind to be mixed and available in 5.1 surround sound on a Limited Edition DVD as well as a standard stereo CD. It will also be available as a digital download in either format.\nLimited Edition DVD  - The Limited Edition DVD Osiris: Volume 1 contains a feature-length version of the first two episodes in 5.1 surround sound, single episodes in stereo MP3 format (DVD-ROM), exclusive behind-the-scenes material, complete orchestral music score in 5.1 surround sound, PDF Scripts (DVD-ROM) and a thank you video.

I began by creating a pictorial catalog of my self-doubts, my confusions and longings and victimhood. Seeking a fuller, more truthful description, I included my moments of spontaneity, contentment, and joy. The images effectively formed two piles; one that expressed feelings of well-being, and one illustrating our alienation from it. The book took further shape; it became a tale for those who long for well-being - a well-being that is only dimly remembered and scarcely believed in. \nUsing images to tell the story the narrative guides the reader to discover that well-being is grounded in self-acceptance, and that more often than not we lose it on the road to adulthood. Yet, it may be recovered.  \npage 39\nThrough illustrations and a minimalist text, we learn that thoughts acquired in childhood are what estrange us from ourselves. They are thoughts that we're not smart enough, talented enough, good enough, or thin enough. They're patterns of thinking which tell us who we are and how our world works. They put us in a corner. \npage 43\nThese patterns lead us to look at the world as through the distorted windows of a bus we don't know we're on. Through its smudged windows, we look upon a world where joy depends on circumstances, on what happens outside of us. \npage 73\nWe organize our circumstances so that they reinforce stories we picked up along the way and carry within us. \npage 131\nThey are stories about who we think we should be.\npage 145\nOr think we are.\npage 147\nThere's a simple path through the thicket of these habitual thoughts. It's one that promises renewed clarity and gratitude for being alive.\npage 207\n \nThanks to the Kickstarter community for generously supporting my project. To my son, Emmanuel, for creating the video and formatting; to Bira, my nephew, for lending his voice and sound; to Margaret Osburn, for editorial assistance; to Saul Steinberg, for showing me how imagery approaches written language.\n\nWhat you get\n      Gift cards\nWith a donation of $18 you will receive 6 gift cards\n      Book\nWith any donation of $65 or more you will receive a beautiful hardcover copy of The Well of Being", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have written and illustrated a book which requires a quality production.

All of us are lovers of music in a very broad sense, and although it's true that Requiem has more projects than he has time for, neither of us hesitated to start a band. Requiem's second band (his first being Pandora Celtica), but really, who's counting?\nEchoes of Orpheus began as a dream. An idea that stirred all of us. So, back in September of 2012, we sat down and we made a list of songs we liked. From there, we established a sound (somewhere between Alternative Rock and Country), and then Kyra started writing songs with a fever. A month later, we had plans for an album and a Kickstarter. Shortly after that, we brought in a very talented violinist/keyboardist called Amity Rose.\nSo what are we trying to do here?\nWe are trying to make our very first album, Last Sin, a reality. We want very badly to be able to bring our music out of our practice rooms and to speakers worldwide. It is our dream to hear our voices on the radio, and to share our passion with all of you. A passion for music, emotion and expression. We cannot do that without the first step... a first album. A CD that we can use to show people \"Hey, this is who we are,\". \nAnd yes, we'd love your help!\nThe truth is that Kickstarter, while awesome, only works if the project meets it's goal. That said, we need your help to make that happen! We've offered some pretty swanky rewards to make it more worthwhile for you to back us, and we hope you will agree. Our goal is to make enough to fund the creation of the album. We have stretch goals ready, but you don't get those surprises until we hit the initial goal. :)\nBut seriously... this is really important to us. Our success rides, quite literally, on your shoulders. Sadly, excitement only carries music so far, so we are here hoping you will join in our exuberance  Everyone on Kickstarter has a dream they want to make real. Please help us with ours.\n\"But what if I can't afford to donate?\"\nIt's okay, you can still help! Simply share this project with anyone and everyone you know! Most especially anyone who loves discovering new music.\nAnd here's a special treat for all you lovely people...\nWe've written up the track list for the album and laid them in order. We've got a few covers on here, but the rest are originals (and one traditional piece). We've marked the covers with a *. We hope you're as excited as we are. :)\n1.) Last Sin\n2.)

These characters struggle with each other and the world to uphold their Beliefs. These Beliefs are declarative, subjective controversial statements, such as \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely\" or \"The needs of the many outweight the needs of the few.\"\nThe more you challenge your Beliefs, the more Influence you gain and the more Conflicts you can win during play. By changing yourself, you can change the world. It is a game about self-reflection and personal growth, where you can explore real life issues and maybe even learn a little bit more about yourself.\nBuild a World...\nThe Spark Roleplaying Game is about imagining, building, and exploring fictional worlds. It gives you all of the tools and guidance you need to create an evocative and engaging Setting. It shows you how to work together, how to find inspiration, and how to structure this fictional world.\nThe game is purpose-built to foster creating dynamic, custom Settings. You can work together to create a world that interests all of you, one that gives you a context for rich stories. The GM plays the setting, directing the major factions and portraying the potent NPCs within.\n... or play in one of ours!\nThe book contains three playable Settings that you can use and customize.\nInitial Goal ($4000) - FUNDED!\nThe initial goal of $4000 should be enough to get a small print run of the book. If we only reach this level of funding, then I will personally fund all of the art, editing, and layout costs to get this game produced.\nThe current version of the book has a word count of about 33K, not accounting for the contributions of Kickstarter backers.The book will be printed as a softcover 9\"x6\" trade paperback, approximately 200 pages long.The book will be printed on EcoLogo certified and Forest Stewardship Council certified paper, to make it as environmentally responsible as possible.\nEach copy of the physical book includes electronic copies of the book in PDF, Epub and Mobi formats.\nIf we meet our initial goal, the game will be released under a Creative Commons, non-commercial license (CC BY-NC 3.0) for ten years. Ten years after publication, I will release it into the public domain.\nIf you back this Kickstarter, you will be able to download the current draft version of the text in (this backer post).\nStretch Goal 1: The Pen is Mightier than the Sword ($6000) - FUNDED!\nCreating a clear, well organized, and entertaining RPG text is a major challenge, and one that I overcame with the help of my four excellent editors. I managed to save up and pay for their services out of my own pocket, and they were collectively very generous with their rates due to my limited budget.\nIf we reach $6,000 stretch goal, not only will I be able to pay off the editing costs, but I will also be able to give David, Queenie, Gus and Mark a little extra compensation for all their hard work.\nIn appreciation to you fine backers, I would also put together Quickstart Bundles for each of the three settings. These bundles would give you everything you would need to sit down and start playing immediately. They would include a pregenerated GM sheet, Faction Sheet, Belief Sheet and Character Sheets, along with the rest of the relevant setting information to get started.\nStretch Goal 2: Art is Priceless ($8000) - FUNDED!\nJust as my mighty editors have revised the text, my tireless artists have brought the game to life. I paid for their professional services out of my own pocket, and it was worth every penny. I am likewise also very grateful that they only charged me a fraction of what they really deserved.\nIf we reach this stretch goal, not only will I be able to pay off the artistic costs, but I will also be able to give Gabriel, David, Gregory, and James a little extra compensation for all their hard work.\nI will (likely) also be able to commission a new and improved version of the cover art. You see this beautiful piece that Gabriel produced back in 2010? Apparently, his skills have improved and he can do even better. I would like to pay him to do just that.\nAs an extra bonus, I will also release the Digital Campfire MP3, as featured on the Kickstarter video, to all backers.\nStretch Goal 3: Education is a Right ($10 000) - FUNDED!\nAn alternative title for this stretch goal was \u201cInformation wants to be Free\u201d.\nIf we can reach a total of 10K of pledges, we will send free copies of the Spark RPG to libraries or schools. Anyone who pledges at the LEGEND tier or higher will get a chance to identify a particular school or public library to whom I will donate a copy of the Spark RPG. I will also write up a short teachers guide to help educators use Spark in a classroom environment.\nAdditionally, I will change the game\u2019s license from Creative Commons Non-Commercial, Non-Derivative, to a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Attribution license (CC BY 3.0). What his means is that everyone will have an open license to change Spark and to sell any derivative works commercially if they would like.\nDavid A. Hill Jr. of Machine Age Productions is cross-promoting with us, offering backers of the Spark kickstarter a setting if his own Kickstarter hits 20K and we hit 10K of pledges. Apotheosis Drive X is his high-action and high drama Mecha game setting that explores what it means to be human, and the points where humanity and technology intersect. The factions of ADX believe that sufficient technological warfare will end war forever. They believe that nationalism, expanded to the superlative, will end human struggle. They place their faith in weapons, of which you are the pilots.\nLast but certainly not least, I will devote some additional time and expense to expand the \u201cA Spark in Fate Core\u201d article and release it to the world as a free PDF. This stretch goal will give me the funding necessary to expand on the content, get it professionally edited, and possibly commission a little art to jazz it up.\nStretch Goal 4: System Matters ($12 000)\nThis one is for all the game designers, hackers and GM\u2019s in the audience. There\u2019s a lot of different systems and procedures in the Spark RPG, and I want to explain them all to you.\nIf we reach this goal, I will write up a detailed hackers guide for the Spark RPG. I will explain how each of the rules work, and why I chose them. I will explain exactly which games inspired which portion of the game. I will provide some alternate rules that didn\u2019t fit in the corebook, and point out some areas that could be easily adapted. This Hacker\u2019s Guide will in PDF format (CC BY 3.0), for all backers pledging $10 or more.\nRemember that we announced that the previous stretch goal changed the games license to allow for commercial publication and derivative works, so this will give you everything you need.\n\nStretch Goal 5: Everyone is the Hero of their own Story ($16 000)\nThis is the big goal and the one I most want to hit. If we reach this level, we will produce a professional fiction anthology of short stories about challenging your Beliefs. Every story in the collection will explore a different setting, including one set in each of the three settings in the core book.\nPutting this together will be a lot of work, so I asked Matt Forbeck to take the role of editor for the anthology. Matt has an incredible amount of experience in the RPG industry, having worked for pretty much every gaming company in the industry. His fiction credits are equally impressive, having successfully completed his ambitious 12 for 12 project to write a dozen books over the course of 2012. Matt has the skills to see this project to completion.\nWho will be contributing to this anthology? Our current roster includes in no particular order:\nJ. Daniel Sawyer (Author of The Antithesis Progression)\nMur Lafferty (Parsec Award winning Host of the \u201cI Should be Writing\u201d Podcast)\nAlasdair Stuart (Host of the \u201cPseudopod\u201d and co-host of the \u201cEscape Pod\u201d podcasts )\nGreg Stolze (Game designer of the \u201cUnknown Armies RPG\u201d and prolific author)\nMike Resnick (5 Time Hugo Award Winner)\nEveryone who backs this project at the $10 level or greater will receive a copy of the book in PDF, Mobi and Epub formats.\nThank you very much for your time, attention, and help. Let\u2019s make some noise and hit these goals!\nTimelines\nI'm excited to publish this game and I want it in as many hands as possible. I want to get the game finished and printed this spring, so backers can run some games during the 2013 convention season. As backers, I consider you my vanguard, and I will need your help to spread the word.\nThe game is almost complete. I intend to send out the copies to the Kickstarter backers in the early summer of 2013. If I have sent out all of the kickstarter backer copies of the game, then I hope to formally release the game to non-backers at GenCon 2013.\nI won\u2019t sell a single copy of the game myself before I have shipped out all of your copies. It\u2019s in my best interest to get the book in your hands as quickly as possible, without sacrificing quality.\nWho am I?\nMy name is Jason Pitre, a game designer and professional ecologist from the wilds of Canada. Some of my past credits include work for Evil Hat Productions (Don't Hack this Game) and Pelgrane Press (Hillfolk RPG). I am also the host of the RPG Design PanelCast, where I distribute excellent seminar recordings to help people improve in game design and publication.\nI have been working on the Spark RPG for about four years at this point and I'm proud to have it finally finished. It's been fully playtested (mechanics and text alike), professionally edited (multiple times) and filled with amazing art from my contributors listed below. The game itself is complete, and available for you to download under this backer post. \nWho's Helping?\nMany people have come together to help create this book so far. Their contributions have helped make the game what it is today.\nMy Developmental Editor is David A. Hill Jr., of Machine Age Productions, who has tightened the text and helped me keep the game as inclusive as possible.\nMy Copy Editor is Queenie Thayer, an experienced horror writer and editor who has helped me omit needless words.\nMy Assistant Editors are Gus Belanger, and Mark Richardson.  Mark has also done the graphic design for all of the sheets (Character, GM, Setting, Faction, and Belief).\nGabriel Verdon is my lead artist for this project. He has produced the stunning cover art for the game, and the vast majority of the interior illustrations.\nDavid Sondered created some of the first excellent illustrations for the game.\nThe stunning chapter icon illustrations, helping you navigate through the game, are courtesy of Gregory Puzon Jr..\nThe evocative soundtrack for the kickstarter video was produced by James Durham, creator of the award-winning future-noir audiobook. FETIDUS: The Damned Heir. Check him out!\nSpecial thanks to my tolerant and supportive better half, for keeping me (mostly) sane and helping me with the project.\nYou will need some dice and tokens to be able to play a game of Spark, so I have partnered with Jacey over at Sink or Swim Stitching to produce some stunning dicebags for backers. All of these reversible bags are artisanal and hand-crafted and made in Canada.\nShe has been working hard to produce three different kinds of dice bags, available at different backer tiers in addition to the book.\nThe Halfling Burrow is the smallest of the three dice bags, with a soft and gorgeous purple velvet fabric. It holds about 50 dice, perfect to hold all of your influence tokens. It\u2019s a traditional dice bag with high quality material, embroidered with \u201cSpark RPG\u201d.\nHalfling Burrow Dicebag\nThe Human Keep is the next next level up and can hold 150 dice. The interior is the same purple velvet as the Halfling, while the exterior is a tough waterproof nylon. It has a carabineer that does double duty; ensuring that the bag stays closed at all times and allowing you to attach it to a belt or backpack. This is the perfect way to carry your dice bag at game conventions. This bag comes embroidered with \u201cSpark RPG\u201d, your name, and/or another short piece of text.\nHuman Keep Dicebag\nThe Dragon's Hoard is top of the line. It\u2019s a larger version of the Human Keep, holding up to 250 dice. The velvet lining has 6 pockets that help you organize your dice making for easy access while you're playing. Each pocket is embroidered with the size of die (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20) and has an elastic edging to ensure your dice stay safe and sound.\nThe amazing thing is that you can reverse the bag, while keeping all the dice in the pockets. The pockets are available on the outside, leaving space in the middle to hold other things like your Influence tokens. This bag also comes embroidered in golden thread with with \u201cSpark RPG\u201d, your name, and/or another short piece of text. \nDragon Hoard Dicebag\nThe Preorder Initiative \nWant to support a friendly local gaming store? So do we, which is why we have a pre-order system set up. The following retailers have already joined in the Kickstarter campaign and are happy to take pre-orders. If you order from them while the campaign is going on, you can get all the exclusive benefits as if you had backed at the $30 HERO level.\nModern Myths (Northampton, Massachusetts, USA)\nModern Myths (Mamaroneck, New York, USA)\nSph\u00e4renmeisters Spiele (Herzogenrath, Germany)\nThe GameShelf (Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada)\nThe Adventure Game Store & Dragon's Lair (Davie, Florida, USA)\nLeisure Games (Finchley, London, UK)\nTrollune (Lyons, France)\n\nWant a local retailer on the list?

There a variety of different risk and challenges that I am attempting to overcome.\n\nThere might be delays in art and layout, should a surprise accident or sudden illness strike. Most of the art is already in hand and I have created the layout template, but this is always a potential risk. \n\nSome of the stretch goals involve the contributions of other professional writers and artists. These stretch goals will be worked on after the physical book has been printed and shipped, so there may be some delays in getting some of the extra content.\n\nIt's possible that we will have unexpected success and a massive demand for dicebags, which might cause some challenges for the supplier. Should that come to pass, I will ship out the existing dicebags, along with all of the books, and ship the remaining bags seperately. \n\nThe biggest risk is likely to come from printers. While I have chosen a reputable commercial printer for this project, there might very well be unexpected delays or errors on their part that would delay the production of the book. There might be some supply shortages, or some other manufacturing error. I do have a back-up printer in the case of major problems. In the rare case that you receive a defective book, I will be happy to replace it at no cost.\n\nShipping is one of the other risks. We will replace lost packages.

Out of clay. \nToday that army has come alive, destroyed half your village, and stolen the princess for a sacrifice to bring back the dead emperor. Now is your chance to save the day, get loads of treasure, and rescue a hot chick, -because you just found the entrance to the tomb.\nTiny playable demo: http://vvhale.com/tc\nTerra Cotta is an action adventure platformer. It has its roots in Metroid, and Zelda, and Castlevania. It's emphasis is on exploring a huge world, instead of making irritating jumps,(looking at you Castlevania) or irritating bosses.\nThe characters are at a resolution that would be comfortable on a Gameboy, but the world is sized for modern screens and devices (iPad sized). What that means is that you get to see more of the world as you explore, and it also means it feels HUGE. So while the game feels really big, it's easier to keep your bearings than on the games we played as kids -where every room looked identical.\nDetails\n* Collect coins, and gems to get money to buy items.\n* Explode enemies with your slingshot, and lots of other weapons once you find them.\n* Mini quests(not the irritating kind) that gives you lots to explore.\n* Bosses(hopefully just the right amount of tough.)\n* Lots of enemies, extra types of treasures, and puzzles.\n* The catch is that you can't just go shooting like crazy, -some of the vessels are sacred, and they hurt you when they break. Plan out those ricochets!\n* It is fun to break things... \n(Pop the video out so you can see it actualish size)\nWhat's the money for?\nI've been making this game in my spare time, and I truly am having fun. It's reached a point though where I realize I have hundreds of hours till the finish line. It's tough to make the time commitment if it's just for the fun of it. I'd really like to justifiably devote the time and resources to make this game as great as I know it can be. I already know certain resources will require outside help, and they cost money.\nQ: How is the game built?\nThe game is actually built in HTML5 and Javascript using the Impact Engine. It can be wrapped for distribution on most platforms.\nQ: What Happens if you exceed your goal?\nRight now I'd just be happy if I hit the goal. If the project somehow exceed it's goal, first I would do that Scrooge McDuck swim through all the cash. Then I'd start figuring out how to add even more bosses, levels, bonuses, and weapons to the game. More money = more game. Oh, I'm also really interested in providing controller support.

I was taking my first creative writing class and was very ambitious.  I asked my professor if I could write one large story instead of ten short ones.  He cautioned that this could get very challenging, and I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  Forty thousand words and just under a semester later, I had something to turn into him; but it wasn\u2019t a novel.  I asked for his honest opinion and he said he enjoyed it.  He asked me if I looked into publishing, and I said I had thought about it.  He suggested that I look into getting some short stories published, so I set forth writing. \nAs I crafted my short stories I kept in contact with many different History and English professors who would lend me assistance in my research.  I wanted my fiction to be believable, so I began to take a historical approach.  What if my characters could interact with history; maybe they helped to shape it. \nMy story opens in a church, and I found one in the city of Cluj that was perfect.  I began to research the area and contact local city officials for their take on local history regarding St. Michael\u2019s Church.  I started to craft other historical influences into my story as well.  For example, some of my characters are present for the excavation of Arnold Paole, who has a very rich vampire history. \nMeanwhile my short story fiction was not taking off like I had hoped.  I held on to a glimmer of hope, my rejections were getting\u2026longer.  Editors were just saying \u201cno,\u201d they were saying, \u201cplease try us again.  Here are some ideas for improvement.\u201d\nI contacted an editor at Renaissance Magazine, and though they publish fiction, I decided to try my hand and write a small documentary on Motte and Bailey castles in England.  Just about a year later I received a reply, they would be happy to publish my article\u2026once I trimmed it down from one thousand to six hundred words.  A few months later, I realized my dream; I was a published author!\nWhich brings us to today, my motivation sparked by a personal and life changing event.  It is time to take things to the next step.  To finish what I started so many years ago.  I have a story, it needs to be told, and people are going to want to hear it.

Of the over 300 releases I\u2019ve tracked this past year this one makes an excellent case for being among the BEST OF 2012.   Typically, when I audition an album I\u2019m looking for that ONE song that \u201cmakes\u201d the record \u2013 it starts with the performance and moves on from there.  Three such songs and an album \u201chas legs,\u201d meaning it will probably stay in rotation for several months of the year, easily long enough to be a year end TOP 40 contender.  When an album has MORE than three singles it\u2019s a bonified hit, the kind that will usually receive both critical praise and sustained radio airplay\u2026. and more often than not propel an artist/band to broader popularity and more featured show slots.   This is a beautiful year end surprise.  It easily establishes Jeff Brinkman and Mark Kranjcec as one of the best songwriting and co-producer teams I\u2019ve ever heard regionally, and Jeff himself as one of the best of Colorado\u2019s great male singer/songwriters of the past half century\u2026. easily in the same class as Todd Park Mohr (Big Head Todd & the Monsters), Sean Kelly (the Samples), Isaac Slade (the Fray), or Ryan Tedder (OneRepublic)...\"\nChris Kresge, Colorado Sound\n\"The latest album from the Jeff Brinkman Band is out, and it's beautiful. It's also one of those records that packs an emotional punch, so we caught up with Brinkman to talk about making the recording with his songwriting partner, Mark Kranjcec...\"\nAshley Dean, Colorado Daily\nThe album is finished, it's beginning to get great reviews, and we're very proud of it.  Now, we need your help introducing it to the world.  The funds raised will go toward producing a video, marketing, social media, radio support and tour support.\nThe rewards... \nTHE ALBUM - Become a part of our album: We're creating a very small number of limited edition CDs (just enough to fulfill Kickstarter rewards), with custom artwork designed by Jeff, containing bonus tracks and with a personal message to you as track #1.  EACH CD WILL BE ONE OF A KIND!  Every time you spin the CD, you'll hear your name and a thank you message from Jeff for being there for us when we needed support the most.  You will also be recognized on our website and Facebook page.\nTHE VIDEO - Become a part of the video: One sponsor will have their house concert included in the official video for our single \"Island\".  The video will be posted and promoted anywhere and everywhere possible.  Other sponsors will have live footage from their house concerts featured on our website, social networks and youtube channel.

Deadly cold temperatures, mega Martian dust storms, cramped living conditions, a constant lack of water, not to mention the vacuum of space, all threaten your day-to-day survival. To make it you need steady nerves and a strong work ethic.\nFor 12-year-old Samuel Jett Smith, living on Mars isn't a dream, it's a reality. His reality. And the ruthless Red Planet is the only home he's ever known. Jett lives on Colony X, a settlement his mom and dad helped build after a devestating global disaster on Earth. He was the first human born on the colony; now Jett and the Colony Xers are all that's left of humanity.\nSince there aren't many 12-year-olds on Mars, Jett's best friend is a robotic sidekick named Al. Jett and Al work as scouts and drive heavy-duty rovers along the Martian terrain in search of resources. This means spending long hours in a pressurized space suit. It's dangerous work, but you have to grow up fast on this ultimate frontier.\nThe adventure really begins when Jett and his dad travel to the South Pole of Mars on a scientific expedition. Jett begins hearing strange voices that lead him to discover the TERRIFYINGLY STRANGE remains of an ancient alien race, buried deep within the Martian ice. \nPROJECT TEAM\nANDY ORR, Writer. The story is my brainchild. I grew up reading The Hardy Boys and Tom Swift Jr., and as an avid sci-fi geek, I've been incubating a Mars-based adventure series of my own for young readers, all from a belief that kids need quality science fiction to fuel their imaginations. Real-life current events surrounding the Red Planet inspired me to complete a book manuscript of Jett Smith and The Alien Grave, but I need more talent to bring the story to life.\nJAROD LENZ ERWIN, Artist.

With your backing, Sara and I will pilot a draft of Jett Smith and The Alien Grave in her classroom. The pilot will include a variety of reading and writing activities around the story and its characters. Students in Sara's classroom will also get to interact with the author (me) through webcam and email. Their comments and reactions will yield valuable feedback and possible revision points. Real 4th graders will have a hand in completing the book; in this way, they will become a part of the book-making process! This unique pilot project will also inform the design and writing of the Jett Smith eCompanion Guide.\nJarod's rendering of Jett. Your backing means artwork like THIS for the book!\nLET'S TALK REWARDS\nI love ebooks and digital platforms, but hate having to pay $12.99 for the latest Kindle release. That's why everyone who makes an entry-level pledge of $5 or more gets a professionally illustrated, professionally edited, professionally formatted digital copy of Jett Smith and The Alien Grave. But the rewards don't stop there.\nIf you'd like to back the book project at a higher level, I have some fun, meaningful add-ons to offer in exchange. Like a thank you eLetter that gives a sneak peak of Jett Smith adventures to come; an eCompanion Guide; a chance for your name to go in the book's acknowledgements page; and even a 9\" by 6\" trade paperback version of the book SIGNED by me, the author.\nExciting, right? You can browse the Reward Scheme for a breakdown of what backing at various levels will get you. Become a part of the story. Because kids need quality science fiction to fuel their imaginations. \nBUT IS THIS BOOK JUST FOR KIDS?\nNope. I wrote the book with a target audience in mind (readers age 8-14). But I think space enthusiasts, Red Planet buffs, and people who generally like life-on-the-frontier narratives, father-son themes, and coming-of-age heroes will enjoy the book, too.\nI'll be posting writing samples as we go, along with artwork from Jarod as it becomes available, so stay tuned. You can also read more about me and the book on the official Jett Smith Blog.\nWHY MARS?\nThe pioneering efforts of Elon Musk and the folks at Mars One, along with the landing of the robotic rover Curiosity in August of 2012, means the topic of visiting - and one day colonizing - Mars is becoming a realistic and exciting topic of national conversation. The Red Planet's not only ruthless but relevant too, and definitely worth talking and writing about. This brings me to one of the key motivations behind Jett Smith and The Alien Grave.\nI wrote the book out of a belief that kids need quality science fiction to fuel their imaginations (the WHY behind this project). Because it feels like we've lost our love affair with the future. We haven't been to the Moon in over 40 years. The NASA budget continues to wither. And we haven't yet landed a man or woman on Mars. What happened? We used to dream about Warp Drive; instead we got Twitter.\nMaybe a new wave of science fiction for kids can kickstart a generation of dreamers and innovators. With this aim in mind, I've written Jett Smith and The Alien Grave not only to tell a story, but also to tell a story that can be adapted for use in elementary and middle grade classrooms. (Hint hint, for teachers who are looking for stories that bridge reading and creative writing with science, technology, engineering, and math).\nWHY YOU SHOULD BACK\nKid-friendly writing enriches vocabulary\nStoryline explores BIG ideas around technology and science\nBecome a part of a unique DIY publishing experiment\nBackers get a copy of the finished book\nSeries potential = more Jett Smith book adventures to come\nThey say the first human to set foot on Mars is alive today and probably around the age of 12.

She watches the tides in sunstruck dreams of an empty shore, patiently waiting for her life to end.\nAlone in a skyless and desolate labyrinth-city , there isn't much else to do.\nBut then...\nSo, here's the general idea:\nChallenging gameplay. Hectic combinations of environmental hazards, platforming, and lethal enemies reward players who assess, strategize, and stay attentive. \nMindful level design. The player's experience is managed by a carefully-paced series of dangers and savepoints.\nA somber and expansive open-world connecting many areas in a network of pathways and shortcuts. Hidden areas and optional content encourage exploration.\nHand drawn cut-scenes help illustrate the vast and desolate setting of the game.\nA \"module-based\" character progression system. Players obtain and arrange upgrade pieces on a grid in configurations of their preference, with certain patterns granting additional abilities or bonuses.\nPlayers who die in-game die in real life.\nCentral concepts:\nSun Rooms (Savepoints) - \"Blindspots for hostile machines, sun rooms are found throughout the city--their presence unexplained. True sunlight is not found within the city, but as long as one has faith, it is sufficient.\"\nField of View - The camera swivels towards the player's direction of view. Combined with a default binocular item which moves the camera, the player is encouraged to manage and anticipate distant danger as well as dangers near, but out of frame.\nPulser - Primary weapon. Fire off signal pulses which trigger switches or create explosive bursts for close-up attacks. Upgradable to damaging projectiles, navigable projectiles, and more.\n(Continued):\nDriver - A multipurpose dash skill. Jump out of the way of ranged and melee attacks, leap over bottomless pits to engage in platforming, or charge towards an enemy during an opening. Upgradeable to feature extended duration, momentum canceling, or ruthless bashing.\nShields - Shields are indispensable tools which enable the player to strafe creatively and survive even amidst a harrowing bulletstorm. The direct-charge shield nullifies frontal damage and fizzles away when overstressed. The alternating-charge shield, obtained in later stages of the game, changes polarity depending on the player's up-down/left-right orientation.\nNightmare - Unwholesome event.\nDaybreak\nBlackout\nRotary\nSunlight\nSpent Greens\nQ> What's this all about?\nI blended classic Zelda and dark science fiction and drank the ensuing mixture. It was Radio the Universe.\nPlayers will feel aesthetic and gameplay influences from titles like Yume Nikki, Symphony of the Night, Hotline Miami, and Dark Souls, with a tinge of 2D JRPGs thrown into the mix.\nRtU is a challenging and atmospheric sci-fi game with SNES-style visuals and a sinister, offbeat narrative.\nQ> What's the funding for again?\n7-10 percent immediately goes to Kickstarter and Amazon for whatever their nefarious purpose. A slice goes towards hiring vocals for some of the game's music and sound. Another slice goes towards hiring dedicated game testers. Most of it is to enable 24/7 work on the game for the duration of the planned development timeline--after taxes, of course.\nThe game will take -16,777,216 years to complete.\nQ> What happens if you meet your goal?\nWith the funding, the basic game will be completed for PC.\nThe current development plan allocates ~1.5 months per general area. I'll be sticking to monthly deadlines and keeping a solid 40-hour-a-week schedule. I'll do my best to keep everyone updated.\nIt will be a dense game, designed to be a satisfactory challenge for as diverse a skill level spectrum as possible. If you're exceedingly bad at video games, then consult your video games doctor. You can also wait for a nearby star to perish and automatically win the game. It's in the code.\nQ> What happens if you exceed your goal?\nAdditional funding will primarily be used to expand game content and add additional areas. It may also buy me enough time and/or hired help in order to move the project to a different engine or a custom engine (possibly in Java, performance willing) which supports platforms other than Windows.\nQ> What happens if you don't meet your goal?\nI'll cry softly over my design notes, my heart rendered unmendable thereafter.\nQ> Anything else?\nWith Radio the Universe, I want to create something beautiful, melancholy, and evocative. A game that, of course, is fun to play, but also imparts a special, maybe surreal, experience to the player. I want to make a game with personality. A game that can feel a bit \"off\".\nI'm hopeful that there are enough people out there who want to see \"off\" happen.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThen there's this to consider.\n\nEverything that can be planned now has been planned.

His co-edited volume, From Biped to Strider: the Emergence of Modern Human Walking, Running, and Resource Transport, examines the pattern of emergence of the innovations unique to modern human gait. His interest in sasquatch footprints began when he crossed paths with an enigmatic set of tracks in the mountains of southeastern Washington. He conducts collaborative laboratory and field research throughout the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West, as well as China and Russia, and has spoken about his findings in numerous interviews, television appearances, public and professional presentations.

A company who posses years of priceless experience and knowledge relative to this niche and profitable market.  We find ourselves on the cusp of this expanding RC Airship and Blimp technology, and certainly have acquired an infinite sense and appreciation for this business and the very future of the global market place.  Best described, we're a novel corporation that's ''on trend'' and ''on target'' with our endeavors and we've relied on this sharp vision to this day.\n\nWe've creatively invented many new technologies over the years, all of which have been designed to harmonize not only to you as a consumer, but as importantly, with the many wishes of the Aviation Authorities.  The industry ''as it stands'' requires many areas of expertise, and we hope that with our experience and exceptional product combined with honed operational procedures, that you too might agree \" that you as a client will prosper from our abilities and our integrity\". \n\nUltimately, whether your desire is to provide an RC Airship or Blimp service of your own, or possibly to commission an outdoor Blimp/Airship for an upcoming Marketing Campaign, there are many considerations that are at the core of anything that is Radio Controlled.  For example, serviceability, ease of operation and an ability to operate in moderate weather. \n\nTo make an informed decision, we can only hope that our in-depth links can help you create a \"base line'' for what is actually required to be successful in this exciting Remote Controlled Airship and Blimp Industry.  \nHigh-Definition Thermal Imaging Camera\n\nThe Aurora will be deployed in selected areas of appropriate habitat where reports suggest sasquatch may range. The specifically built gyro-stabilized camera mount will house state of the art equipment that can view and film in infrared, thermal imaging and High Definition. The camera is the highest resolution (1024 x 768 pixel) uncooled, long wave 7-14 um and 17 micron pixel pitch system in the world today, except for classified U.S. military equipment. Peak emittance from the human body is around 10 um and so this camera will provide the best possible resolution. ICI IR Flash software used with the camera allows image enhancement to 12 Mega Pixels which is better than any uncooled thermal imaging camera in existence today. In other words you will be able to literally print a 12 Mega Pixel image with a Thermal/Infrared Camera by using the proprietary ICI IR Flash Software. This is unheard of in the entire infrared camera manufacturing industry. The FOV (Field Of View) lens used will be a 44 mm x 176 mm optic, f 1.2. To our knowledge no company has used a telephoto lens of this size with an uncooled 1024 x 768 camera for such a project other than possibly the U.S. Defense. Putting an optic on this particular camera will be a first for ICI as it is the newest uncooled IR camera on the market today and not even offered to the public at this time.\nInfrared Cameras Inc.\nIan Redmond, OBE\nIan Redmond is a tropical field biologist and conservationist, renowned for his work with great apes and elephants. For more than 30 years he has been associated with Mountain Gorillas, through research, filming, tourism and conservation work. He served as Ambassador for the UN Year of the Gorilla 2009 and for the UNEP Convention on Migratory Species since 2010.\nAs with his mentor, the late Dr Dian Fossey, the main focus of his work shifted in 1978 from research to conservation work, after poachers killed Digit \u2013 a young silverback in one of the Karisoke study groups \u2013 to sell his skull and hands. Finding the headless, handless body of a gorilla he regarded as a friend was a turning point in his life. Ten years later in Kenya, the experience was repeated when some of the cave-elephants he was studying were killed by ivory poachers.\nAs a result, he became a conservation consultant and advisor for organizations such as the Born Free Foundation, the Gorilla Organization, Orangutan Foundation and the International Fund for Animal Welfare. To encourage such groups to work together, he established and chairs the Ape Alliance (80 organizations linked via www.4apes.com), the African Ele-Fund and the UK Rhino Group (www.rhinogroup.org.uk). He is now Chief Consultant and Envoy for GRASP - the UNEP/ UNESCO Great Apes Survival Partnership he helped launch in 2001.\nBorn in Malaysia, Ian\u2019s passion for animals developed during his boyhood in Beverley, a market town in Yorkshire, and after University, took him in 1976 to Africa. There he joined Dian Fossey, studying and protecting the mountain gorillas of Rwanda and Zaire. This work also led him into documentary film-making. Ian is the man who introduced Sir David Attenborough to the gorillas in 1978, for the famous BBC \u2018Life on Earth\u2019 sequences, and who taught Sigourney Weaver to grunt like a gorilla in 1987, for her award-winning role in the film \u2018Gorillas in the Mist\u2019 (in which he is characterized as \u2018The Worm Boy\u2019). He has advised in the making of, and/or appeared in more than 50 documentary films for the BBC, National Geographic Society, Discovery Channel, TF1, etc. His books have been translated into many languages and he is in demand as an entertaining and thought-provoking public speaker.\nPutting conservation principles into practice, he has led anti-poacher patrols, guided film crews and/or special interest tours into close encounters with gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, elephants and erupting volcanoes, and worked to support local conservationists during the horrors of Rwanda\u2019s and D.R. Congo\u2019s civil wars. Under-cover investigations led him to play the role of a potential ape-buyer in order to infiltrate a poaching ring in Congo-Brazzaville and more recently a potential Coltan dealer in DRC. His work on behalf of animals was recognised in 1996 with the presentation of the PAWS Humane Achievement Award, at a ceremony in Hollywood, California. Ian was appointed OBE in the Queen\u2019s Birthday Honours in 2006 and awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Oxford Brookes University in 2011.\nAs well as great apes, Ian Redmond\u2019s research interests include: underground elephants - he carried out the first study and photography of elephants in the caves of Mt Elgon in Kenya and helped Sir David Attenborough to film them for the acclaimed BBC series \u2018Life of Mammals\u2019; parasites - he studied gorilla parasites, and in Papua New Guinea, discovered several new species of nematode worms; reptiles and amphibians - he discovered two new species of frog, also in New Guinea; and re-introducing orphaned apes, elephants and polar bears to the wild.\nAsked to summarise his work, he says, \u201cI am a naturalist by birth, a biologist by training, and a conservationist by necessity. But conservation for me isn\u2019t just about saving species. On a larger scale, the planet needs us to save functioning eco-systems; on a smaller scale, we must also recognise that species are made up of individual animals. For me, it became personal when I had the privilege of getting to know individual wild animals in the wild... I can truthfully say that some of my best friends are gorillas, and I care passionately about them and the future of all life on Earth.\"\nJim Halfpenny, Ph.D.\nJim Halfpenny has authored many books, including several on wolves and tracking. His fields of expertise include carnivore ecology (especially bears, wolves, mountain lions, etc.), tracking mammals and dinosaurs, and cold environmental ecology. As a licensed guide in Wyoming, hunting played a central role in developing Jim\u2019s abilities to find all sorts of creatures. Sharing his adventures and knowledge with others has been his life-long goal. When Dr. Halfpenny retired from the university, he founded the Track Education Center and Museum in Gardiner, Montana, dedicated to sharing natural history and ecology. Through his organization, A Naturalist\u2019s World, Jim annually travels the world teaching classes on carnivores, tracking, cold, and ecology.

For 30 years of his 45-year-long career he was an international a professional wildlife biologist with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) with the United Nations, living and working in Uganda, Tanzania, Iran, and Trinidad and Tobago. His work consisted of wildlife surveys, the preparation of wildlife conservation and wildlife management plans, and the training of wildlife technicians.\nMore recently, he participated in wildlife research and consulting projects in several Canadian provinces, especially in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. His interest in the sasquatch began in 1963 and eventually led to a family move to Vancouver Island, BC in 1975. It also led, eventually, to two books on the subject: North America\u2019s Great Ape: The Sasquatch (A wildlife biologist looks at the continent\u2019s most misunderstood large mammal) (1998), and The Discovery of the Sasquatch (Reconciling Culture, History, and Science in the Discovery Process) (2010). His wildlife research is now almost entirely focused on sasquatch anatomy, behavior, and ecology, and on the discovery process as it applies to this sasquatch.\nJohn Mionczynski\nJohn Mionczynski is a wildlife consultant with field experience going back 40 years.  His biological studies have spanned a broad spectrum from microscopic marine life to large ungulate mammals of the high mountains.  He has conducted studies on bighorn sheep in Wyoming and all over the intermountain west for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, the U.S. Forest Service, and the University of Wyoming.  During these studies he was acknowledged for developing goat packing as a technique for transporting scientific equipment into remote and rugged high mountain ranges and glaciers. In this regard he has performed as a scientific packer for the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Forest Service, the University of Wyoming, as well as his own scientific research.  He has also written an authoritative book on the subject.\nHe spent three years trapping, radio collaring, and documenting food habits and behavior of grizzly bears in the Yellowstone Ecosystem of Montana and Wyoming for the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team and U.S. Forest Service.  Other field studies have included work with mountain goats, pikas, habitat analysis, fire ecology, a biological survey of the Omo River Valley of Ethiopia, and ethnobotanical studies of tribes in North America and Africa.\nWhile working for the U.S. Forest Service in 1972, he had an encounter with a strange unidentified animal in a forest camp which spurred a nearly 40 year quest to collect field information and sighting reports on the legendary 'Old Man' as it is known in parts of the Rockies...better known as Sasquatch.\nBill Munns\nIn a career spanning 45 years, Bill Munns has excelled in several unique professional arts, including the \u201ccreature business\u201d (fabricating ultra-realistic physical models of living, extinct and fictitious creatures for Movies, TV, Theme Parks and Museum Exhibits) and Computer Graphics Imagery (CGI). He has devoted 5 years of diligent effort to the analysis of the famous Patterson-Gimlin film, which is the most unique and detailed photographic record of the cryptic entity known as \u201cBigfoot\u201d or Sasquatch.\nIn that effort, he has pioneered new methods of image analysis to make a factual determination as to the biological authenticity of the Patterson-Gimlin Hominid.

As the principle manager and overseer of the entire project, as he has over 25 years experience in operating his own businesses.  He has been a gold dredger for the last 15 years, and had his Hominoid sighting in 1997.  Managing businesses with attention to detail, and getting the job done with the necessary resources, has given him the ability to create success without going over-budget.  His focus is more on creative problem solving;  thus, he solicits ideas from all involved in whatever business he\u2019s involved with.  Team effort is a huge focal point in working with any group of people that he manages.  He appreciates having input from his colleagues, as this helps him to make firm decisions which move the organization in a direction that works well for all involved.  He believes that good input from colleagues creates good output, and thus, well-spent, economically used investment dollars.  He has found this approach to be a tried and true business practice.\nJason Valenti\nJason Valenti, co-founder, was inspired to get involved in Hominoid research after his own personal sighting in Apalachicola National Forest in 1996.

We want to create a game with a thrilling story and a great atmosphere through art, sound and music.\nThe pilot chapter will be available for backers two months before it goes public for other registered users. New chapters will need funding as well, using a mix of incomes, but backers will not have to pay again unless they want to donate. As a premium member you will have early access to all new chapters.\nThis is a free game with a free2play style community that will not affect the game itself. If you don't want to use the extended features you can just play the game when it becomes available to you.\nWe offer backers the opportunity to get involved in the project starting from \u00a31 to get access to project files, and up to \u00a31000 to become a playable main character in the story. Enjoy!\nThere are some moments in horror novels that evoke powerful feelings and achieve a high level of immersion. Enrique, the lead artist of our team, thought about creating an image to capture one of these moments. But it is the imagination the one creating most of the little details that really build that scary feeling, and it happens that images are just too visual for that.\nListen to the Main Theme while reading:\nAfter toying with this idea for a while the project came to life and got us excited to create this game. With the use of art and music we will create the right atmosphere for your mind to live the story.\nWe get the inspiration mostly from authors like Edgar Allan Poe and H.P.Lovecraft, so when sketching the setting and the concept, ideas just started to flow naturally.\nThe story starts in the late 19th century in the south of England. Good times for science, psychology and art. The main character (which is waiting to get his name from a backer), receives a letter from his old friend Anthony asking for help. A strange request since it has been long time since they were colleagues at the University. But when he arrives to his house in the Sussex county he finds that something horrible might be happening.\nAfter we get the funds for the pilot chapter the real challenge begins. To continue telling the story and making this a long term project we will depend on the community we have.\nWe like mysteries, secrets and conspiracies, so you can expect to find clues and references for things to come... maybe something that looks accidental is not.\nWe want to release the game chapters in the style of a webcomic, this is why we have chosen the game to be web based.\nIn our vision of The Last Door, being episodic is not just about delivering content in pieces. Playing a chapter may take about 15-40 minutes but there might be weeks between them. Between releases there will be other minor releases with extra content.\nThe web provides more flexibility to create an expanded experience using subgames, hidden content, and dynamic community events. It also provides a real possibility to create a game widely accessible from any connected device.\nWe plan to set up a season structure and a system for funding future chapters with a mix of crowdfunding, donations, merchandising, ads or whatever we get to discuss with the community itself.\nOnce the project is running we will have to keep it growing by earning players confidence chapter after chapter. Players will be the ultimate judges deciding whether new chapters are released or not.\nIs this a classic adventure game? Absolutely\nIn The Last Door you will find all the features you can expect from an old school adventure: exploring, an inventory, using and combining objects, dialogues and lots of puzzles.\nBut because of the very special nature of this project these features will appear as the game progresses. Game mechanics will be added following the player progression and to support the narrative.\nWe will be releasing a very short \"Prologue\" during this campaign. A playable teaser to show the game atmosphere.\nAs well as designing the mechanics and puzzles we need to design how different players experience the game and progress from being visitors to become players, community members and finally fans. Because of this we want to allow everyone to enjoy The Last Door in the way it fit them best.\nCommunity releases\nNew chapters are always first released for premium members, when new chapters are released previous ones become available to free registered users.\nWe want each new release to be a community event, gathering players to \"unbox\" the new chapter together. This is the kind of expanded experience we are aiming for, offering a deeper experience for those who want to get more involved while allowing more casual players to play without interferences.\nEach chapter will have a set of extended features linked to the community, such as a forum, a section of chapter-based secrets, quizzes or ingame comments. Players can just play the game and start using these features whenever they feel ready.\nThe community release of the pilot chapter will be exclusive to backers. Being a premium member (or special community member as stated in the rewards) will keep providing this and other privileges in the future.\nYou can see some ideas for the community and extended features in an interactive web mockup located in the confidential project files.\n                               YOUR HELP\nWe have already been working on a playable Prologue which will be released after the first week of the campaign. We also keep creating concept art, script and music for the future of the series. But we need funds to produce a pilot chapter and a initial set of the web extended features.\nEvery person backing this project is a person trusting in our idea, and that means a lot! This project is very dependent on having a community for long term survival, so if we don't get enough support it will be difficult to create a community out of nothing. We want to prove wrong those who say that \"a project like this is never gonna work\".\nYou can also spread the word to horror fans, pixel lovers and adventure maniacs. Find us at The Last Door on Facebook and at @horroradventure on twitter.\nWe'd love to have you with us, and if you believe in The Last Door, we have this rewards waiting for you:\nIf you think this looks interesting enough, show your support with just \u00a31 and you will get instant access to a lot of material (through a secret link in the first \"only for backers\" update). Some projects will just \"thank you\" for this money, but rather than this we prefer to share with you these confidential project files.

This tapestry will become an actual game object, so we ask to keep it secret until it appears in the game.\nPlus all previous rewards and also we instantly become big fans of you!\nIf you have any ideas of a reward you want to see here, please let us know in the comments.\n                       What's the money for?\nWe need at least 3,852 pounds to be able to develop the complete PILOT CHAPTER and a initial set of community features to kick off this project.\n\nThis amount of money will help us to pay for:\nOne month of a game programmer.\nOne month of the main artist and writer.\nWeb programming, community management and production.\nMusic and Sfx composing and editing.\nProfessional English writing.\nAll the money pledged through this campaign will go directly into the project. There's so much more that could be done if extra funding is available, some things we have in mind are:\nWorking on the pilot chapter for a little longer, making it bigger, richer and more accessible.\nMore community features ready when pilot chapter launches.\nTranslating dialogues into different languages.\nRich \u201cmaking-of\u201d development blogpost and videos.\nWe will extend into this if it seems likely the original funding goal will be surpassed.\nThe Game Kitchen is a small game development studio, based in Seville, Spain. Our company is made of an incredibly talented group of people, just six of the most crazy game freaks out there. We created The Game Kitchen to be able to craft our wildest projects and ideas, for a living.\nNot your typical business, though: we\u2019re independently owned, and horizontally managed. Also worth mentioning is that we don\u2019t require a physical office space to work: we\u2019re totally \u2018cloud\u2019  based. We still go to a lots of places together, but that\u2019s normally just to have some beers!\nIn the three years we\u2019ve been operating, we have done plenty of game consultancy work, mostly creating games on demand for other companies. Now, we\u2019re taking risks and investing in our own ideas turning into a proper independent game studio. These are some of the projects that we\u2019ve worked on so far:\nWe are proud and experienced agile developers. To create games we use a monthly-based, iterative process called \u2018scrum\u2019. Scrum can suit the episodic nature of this project very well if done properly. We aim to deliver an impressive amount of content in every new chapter, and keep improving the experience.\nKicking it forward\nOnce the project is finished and published we won't forget that other projects need help too, so with the help of our community I will be pledging 5% of the profits made from The Last Door to projects out there that are also relying on everyones help.

During the first chapter we plan to have ready at least the chapter specific forum.\n\n- To keep a clean and consistent gameplay that is interesting enough but progresses at the right pace while keeping player interest and expectations.\nDon't make it too big in the beginning! This is meant to be a humble start to create a sustainable long term project.\nWe will need to be very clear with the backers about this and try to engage in a dialogue.

When I first conceived the idea I did not know how my students were going to react.  I thought there would be a lot of groaning and complaining, especially since it would require them to write several pages of composition per day!  Surprisingly, they were wildly excited.  The students have already started writing and they have until March 1, 2013 to finish their manuscripts.  \nTo further fuel their enthusiasm, I told them that we are going to publish each of their novels; they could barely contain their excitement.  \nWe need help to make this happen.  We found a publisher that is willing to work with us, called KidPub Press.  They work almost exclusively with children to publish their literature.  According to the KidPub.com website, the publishing packet includes:\n      Professional layout and editing\n      Cover design\n      Printing and delivery of book copies\n      Press releases in our area\n      The books are sold on Amazon.com and KidPub.com\n      Quarterly royalty payments (15% to 20% of sale price)\nThis is an incredible deal and it is exactly what we are looking for!  The cost, however, of this publishing package is $300 per student.  There are seven students in the 6th grade class, so that brings the total publishing cost to $2,100.  There are also fees from Kickstarter and Amazon and the printing of additional book copies that bump the amount needed to $2,500.\nAs their teacher, I am willing to kick in $300 to help my students publish their novels.  Will you help us by kicking in some money too?\nAlso, here is our story as presented in our press release:\nScottsdale, AZ \u2013 The sixth grade students of Ville de Marie Academy are undertaking a monumental task for children their age: they are each writing their very own 15,000 word novel, known as a novella.  Surprisingly, the project did not draw the groans and complaints that typically accompany the announcement of a lengthy composition assignment.  \u201cThere was an air of excitement that permeated the classroom when the children were presented with the challenge,\u201d recalls Thomas McMullin, the sixth grade teacher.  \u201cThis class has a lot of creative energy that is ripe for this type of project,\u201d McMullin explains, \u201cshortly after I gave the assignment, a parent reported that their child stayed up all night working on their novel.\u201d\nTo further motivate the students, Mr. McMullin is planning to commission KidPub Press to publish each student novel.  KidPub Press specializes in working with children and teenagers to publish literary works.  The company\u2019s publishing package includes: professional editing and formatting; paperback printing with a glossy, full-color cover design; and recognition as a Book In Print, which allows the books to be offered at libraries and bookstores worldwide.  Additionally, the students have the opportunity to become professional authors as their novels will be for sale on Amazon and KidPub.com.  \nThe project will take the class the entire academic year to complete.  Class time is set aside each day for the children to work on their novels.  Mr. McMullin and several other parents are acting as the primary editors and advisers for the project.  \u201cI try to collaborate with each of my students daily to help them develop their plot lines and to improve their storytelling and composition skills,\u201d explains McMullin.  The small class sizes of Ville de Marie Academy make the daily one-on-one interaction possible.  The sixth grade class has only seven students, which allows Mr. McMullin to confer with each of them without taking time away from other subjects.\nPublishing the novels will be the crowning achievement of the students\u2019 hard work.  The sixth grade class launched a fundraising campaign on kickstarter.com (titled: 6th Grade Project \u2013 Publish a Novel), which is a funding platform for projects, to acquire the money necessary to publish with KidPub.  The children are enthusiastic about the prospect of joining the ranks of professional authors.  In the words of sixth grade student Kateri Rosedale, \u201cI want to get my book published because I want to be an author, and getting a book published while I am in sixth grade will be a big accomplishment.\u201d\nVille de Marie Academy is a private K-12 school, located in Scottsdale, AZ.  The school was founded in 1991 and it offers students a Catholic, classical liberal arts education.

The novel is a satirical take on the zombie apocalypse, told in the setting of that great American wasteland turned desert oasis: Las Vegas. It's crude, it's funny, it's sometimes heartfelt, and we guarantee it's unlike any zombie story you've ever read.\nOur artistic skills are limited to cartoon-style comics (see it here), so for a book of this caliber we've located a REAL painter who can accurately portray the gruesome badassness of an angry zombie feasting on human flesh like it's Christmas dinner. Unfortunately we're both working writers (aka literal starving artists) so we could really use some help paying her commission. We also need some funds to help us pimp this new story out like the fine, classy, piece of literary ass that it is.\nNow, I know what you might be thinking. Anyone can write a book, so why doesn't this one suck? Well, this book was originally picked up by one of the largest publishing houses in the world (whose name we can't mention because of legal reasons), but at the last moment they dropped our book because they said it's too \"unique\", which makes it too difficult to sell. We think they're dead wrong.\nAlso, this isn't our first rodeo. Our first novel, \"The Missing Link,\" has sold pretty well and has great reviews (that weren't written by peer-pressured friends and family, either!). Read our reviews here. \nSo please, help us get this book the badass cover it deserves, and more than anything, help us prove to the publishing industry that unique books CAN sell.\nThanks for your help!\nHere's the story synopsis:\nMany things are lost in Las Vegas. Innocence. Paychecks. Little Scotty\u2019s chances of ever going to college. Worst of all is the loss of humanity. Once a man\u2019s been bitten by lady luck, the hunger becomes infectious, and before he knows it he\u2019ll chew the arm off the guy sitting next to him just to win a hand of poker. Especially if he\u2019s a zombie.\nLas Vegas has been overrun by flesh-eating, undead monsters that are now flooding the Strip and obliterating everything in their wake\u2014cars, tourists, and even casinos. First on their path of destruction: the Olympus, Las Vegas\u2019s premiere hotel and casino, which is currently housing a human buffet-line that\u2019s been trapped inside by a poorly thought-out, self-locking alarm.\nAmid the chaos of hungry zombies are a handful of survivors not yet food for the slow (but persistent) tourists-turned-undead: a guitar-wielding Elvis impersonator and his son, a feminist stripper, and an alcoholic janitor whose drunken hijinks might just be the only thing keeping him alive. Cornered inside an overflowing casino, the only place for this rag tag crew to go is out, but is there any place safe? Can they evade the soulless Bobby Darin impersonator who\u2019s become unofficial king of the undead? Have the zombies taken over every last casino in Vegas? Do the dead play slots?\n And here's a sample Chapter:\n              Let\u2019s Call in Dead to Work\n              Chuck Woodward had never been known as a model employee. He rarely showed up on time and was often drunk, as he was today\u2014late and drunk. And yet this perpetual carelessness may have saved his life, something he didn\u2019t consider as he staggered into the back entrance of the Olympus Hotel and Casino, reeking of an off-brand vodka so cheap that drinking paint thinner might have been a safer alternative.\n            He first noticed something was wrong when he went to punch in at the time clock and found it had been ripped off the wall and stomped into the ground. He then noticed a trail of blood leading into the break room. His third and final clue that something was wrong was the sight of his coworker, Ray, bleeding onto the tile floor as three feral-looking, gray skinned men devoured his flesh the way Chuck had been expecting to see Ray devouring a cruller. That was when Chuck began to scream, in a wavery, high-pitched wail unbefitting of an overweight janitor.\n             A man with a forehead peeled away from his skull in blood-crusted flaps sat hunkered protectively over the body of \u201cBig Ray\u201d Williams, lips smacking and chewing loudly as he snacked on the sinewy arms that had made Ray such a great security guard. The other two men standing over him, who looked like they had just walked out of a ten-car pileup, were playing tug-of-war with Ray\u2019s bite-addled legs. They eventually split him in half, but the zombie with the bigger chunk didn\u2019t make a wish. Instead, he began to eat. None of them paid the screaming, quivering lump of fat that almost tripped himself stumbling away from them any mind.\n            Backing into a corner, Chuck fumbled his walkie talkie from the pocket of his hoodie and squeaked, \u201cTyphon, are you there?\u201d as he scratched at his beard with enough force to rip skin. \u201cOh my God, pick up, please!\u201d\n            \u201cChuck,\u201d the radio belched, in a thick Greek accent, \u201cI am here, Chuck. What do you want?\u201d\n            \u201cWe, uh, we have an emergency,\u201d Chuck muttered, choking on his words as he ground his back into the break room counter. In the back of his mind, which was still clouded in pools of cheap alcohol, he had to ask himself if what he was looking at was real. \u201cR-Ray is dead. I guess. H-He\u2019s being eaten, by, like, cannibals. I think.\u201d More tears slipped down into his beard.\n            \u201cChuck, is not emergency,\u201d Typhon fired back. \u201cIs just tiny, tiny problem. Everything is under control.\u201d\n            \u201cEverything doesn\u2019t seem under control,\u201d Chuck remarked, as three zombies feasted out of Big Ray\u2019s open skull like a gathering of homeless hunched over a can of refried beans. \u201cRay is dead! I need help!\u201d\n             \u201cChuck, there has been a small attack on my casino,\u201d Typhon\u2019s voice chirped, in between staticky pops, \u201cSome lives are lost, but everything is being contained. I just need you for doing your job once security fixes very small problem. So go to your store room and be safe so you do not get hurt. When noise stops, you come out and clean, okay? We\u2019re going need a lot of clean.\u201d At that, he said the magic words: \u201cWill pay a lot of overtime.\u201d\n             \u201cOh\u2014kay,\u201d Chuck confirmed, and felt his head swoop in a failed attempt at escaping his bloated body. \u201cUm, Typhon, is this real?\u201d\n              The radio popped loudly. \u201cJesus, Chuck, you are drunk again? Nothing is real except clean. That is all you need to be real.\u201d\n              Chuck ran his hands through his messy mop of hair as the undead that held Ray\u2019s open head sucked longingly on their brain-matter covered fingers, much the way a stoner savors the last remnants of his Cheetos.\n              \u201cAre you real?\u201d he asked dumbly.\n              Their eyes lifted up to him now that their flesh-covered bowl was empty, and under the pretense that this might be real, that his legs were shaking too hard against his baggy, mustard stained pants for this to be a dream, Chuck turned toward the hallway at a brisk pace. His mission: to find his store room and hide, as ordered by the Olympus\u2019s owner, which sounded like a reasonable idea given the three cannibals lumbering after him as he hurried out into the game room.\n              Slot machines were overturned. Playing cards and game chips were strewn all across the carpet, trampled and covered in footprints. A middle aged woman, whose screams were waging war with the fire alarm, tried to scoop up her bucket of spilled quarters even as a trio of undead fell upon her.\n              She was not the only one being attacked. A security guard unloaded a few rounds on an undead girl staggering after a fleeing family, until the noise of gunfire attracted the attention of three more that collapsed in on him and sunk their collective teeth into his face, neck, and shoulder. Behind the bar, a teenager threw bottles at a cluster of battered zombies army-crawling toward his highly pock-marked, and yet highly appetizing skin. Maybe to them his acne was as appealing as the lustrous, greasy shine of freshly fried French fries, because their expression was one of sheer ecstasy when they ate.\n              On the other side of the room some Cirque Du Triumph performers, who one might have expected to flee the casino with carefree skips and nimble backflips, were staggering and stumbling over each other to escape. One tripped over a bullet-riddled body, planted the corner of his head into a slot machine, and scrambled away in torn gymnast tights. Grabby, blood covered hands weren\u2019t far behind.\n              Left standing in the center of it all was Chuck Woodward, the thirty-two year old, drunken janitor, who stepped toward the escalator with his eyes goggling the casino floor like a newborn staring out from a crib. He was about to walk onto the gold-covered, electrical walkway, boasted by casino staff as the tallest in the world, when he saw a two-worded sign swinging dangerously above, followed by a loud snap that sent it plummeting down to the casino floor. It was the casino\u2019s logo, and it flickered loudly before shorting out at Chuck\u2019s feet.\n              The Olympus: tallest casino on the strip, classiest gambling establishment in Las Vegas, and currently swarming with blood-thirsty zombies.\n *****\nCheers!\nBrandon and Bryan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Books Sent!

Stine's \u201cGoosebumps.\u201d I love the idea of fresh monthly content to read and enjoy.\nThat's why, with the help of ebook publishing and readers like you, I want to create a new monthly serial that both kids and adults can look forward to.\n\nCamp Myth is a summer camp built to teach young mythological creatures about the cultures and dangers of their amazing world. Minotaurs, Dryads, Merfolk, Centaurs \u2013 you name it! For six weeks, these children live and work together in order to earn merit badges and prove their worth to the mythic community.\n\nBut for Felix, a mischievous Fae with a knack for getting into trouble, camp means nothing more than a chance to break free from his overprotective parents and enjoy a few weeks without responsibilities. That is, until a series of accidents turn camp life upside-down, and some of the other campers start disappearing from the grounds.\n\nTogether with his cabin-mates, Argee \u2013 the world's only nerdy Cyclops \u2013 and Moxie \u2013 an orphaned Kitsune unable to control her shape-shifting powers, Felix will meet learn about mythological creatures, what it really means to grow up, and how friendship can transcend race and culture.\n\nEvery month, there will be a new volume of Camp Myth, clocking in at about 20,000 words. Each book will be named after a new merit badge, and will focus on Felix, Argee, and Moxie attempting to earn that badge, while at the same time learning more about the overall mystery of Camp Myth.\n\nVolume One will be titled, \u201cPhoenix Watching,\u201d and will follow the characters as they first arrive at Camp Myth, and try to earn what looks to be the easiest badge. But it doesn't take long for the gang to discover that Camp Myth is anything but a free ride.\nUpcoming Volumes in this series will include:\n\nVolume #2: Kraken Fishing \u2013 A relaxing day at Leviathan Lake turns into a race to catch a baby Kraken... until the Mama Kraken decides to get payback!\n\nVolume #3: Cyclopean Archery \u2013 Determined to impress his older siblings, Argee convinces Felix and Moxie to earn Camp Myth's Archery merit badge... Cyclops style!\n\nVolume #4: Golem Building \u2013 Forget about cars made from blocks of wood! In this volume, the trio compete in Camp Myth's annual Golem Derby.\n\nAs of now, I have four of these books drafted, with an outline for at least half a dozen more. But none of this will be possible without your support. Art, editing, publishing, distribution, Camp Myth-themed goods \u2013 it all adds up. But hopefully I can raise enough to give this series the attention it deserves, and have the first book released this July. \n\nWith Camp Myth, you'll see the results of your donation in a matter of weeks, not months or even years like some other campaigns.\n(Illustrations by Jay Camay)\n\nCREDENTIALS\nWhat makes me qualified to write this series? Well, I've been writing for years, and \u2013 including pieces accepted for unreleased projects - I've been featured in nearly two dozen different publications, both online and in print, from anthologies, to magazines, to websites, to podcasts. I even have fiction published in Newfoundland's current 8th grade textbook. I'm passionate about the industry, I know the target market, and I have experience and success with writing for several different age groups. \n\nCAMP MILESTONES (AKA: Stretch Goals)\nSummer camps are also about community. In that spirit, Camp Myth #1 features several \u201cCamp Milestones\u201d - rewards that will be given to all backers should a certain level of funding past the goal amount be reached. There are six in all, and the specifics of the next reward will be revealed when the previous goal has been hit. Donate, spread the word, and unlock new rewards for everyone!\n\nUNLOCKED: $5,000 \u2013 \u201cPhoenix Watching\u201d merit badge for all backers $25 and higher.\n\nUNLOCKED: $6000 - \"The Art of Camp Myth #1\" PDF for all backers. \n\nCamp Milestone #3: $7,000 - All copies of Camp Myth #1 become hardcover.\n\nCamp Milestone #4: $9,000 - Ebook copy of Camp Myth #2: Kraken Fishing for all backers. \n\nCamp Milestone #5: Locked\n\nCamp Milestone #6: Locked\n\nREFER A FRIEND & THE MYTHIC CAMPER AWARD\n Summer camps are about friendship, and connecting with other people in order to accomplish a common goal. That's why Camp Myth #1 will use an innovative \u201cRefer a Friend\u201d system.\n\nIf you convince another person to match or exceed your donation, you'll be moved up one reward tier at no additional cost to you. Just have that person send me a quick message confirming that you were the one who let them know about Camp Myth, and you'll get more rewards just for spreading the love.\n\nBut that's not all. Whichever backer manages to raise the highest amount of referred donations will given Book One's \"Mythic Camper\" Award. Not only will they be credited in the final product, but they will also receive the $500 Tier Rewards absolutely free!\n\nThat's right! You don't need to have the fattest wallet to earn the coolest swag. There's going to be a winner - guarenteed - so why not you?\n\nNot everyone has a zillion dollars to support these types of campaigns, and I totally understand that. But word of mouth can be priceless, so I want to reward those of you willing to spend some time promoting the project.\n(Cover art by Anne Ballaran)\n\"Like\" Camp Myth on Facebook: www.facebook.com/campmyth\nSpecial Thanks to:\nJay Camay: www.jron-camay.com\nAnne Ballaran: http://anneballaran.daportfolio.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Camp Myth: Book Two - Now Available!", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming, but I\u2019m thrilled to announce the second book in the award-nominated Camp Myth series is now available!

They are full of intrigue, strategy and healthy competition. Settlers of Catan is definitely on top of this list as you work to create a chain of cities and settlements worth more points then your opponents. It does have a few logistical downfalls though that can detract from game play.\nFor instance, have you even been playing and then mid game needed to relocate to another surface? With the standard board it would take some tricky manuevering to be able to do that without causing an earthquake on the board.\nHow about getting the perfect board all set up only to have the tiles start to slip under one another and the border break apart.\nWe wanted to create a product that not only solved those common issues but many more such as effective storage and being able to personalize your game in a well designed and functional package\nOur Store and Play accessory board is packed with features and opportunities to customize your Catan game. The full set is $130 with a flat finish and $150 with an engraved finish. The Set includes the following:\n1 Wooden Playing Surface: This surface is designed to hold all the pieces tightly together for the standard Catan game. With its border and perfectly measured hexagon shape you will avoid slipping pieces and allow for easy moving during game play. This surface comes  in a flat finish or engraved with a design border and one name or word engraved in the center.\n1 Wooden Storage Pedestal: This low profile pedestal has slots for 6 drawers and lifts the playing surface to stand 2 inches tall, a perfect playing height. It has solid construction to withstand years of game play and is shaped in the traditional Catan Hexagon\n1 Set of Wooden Storage Drawers: There are 6 removable drawers that slide into the storage pedestal. These drawers conveniently stores all the pieces needed for game play. There are: 3 medium open drawers (one for the pips, one for the resource cards and one for the reference cards), 2 medium drawers divided drawers for the 4 sets of player pieces and 1 long drawer for border and tile pieces.\nOptional Engraved Border (with Name Upgrade)\nAdditional Accessory\n4 Sets of Color Acrylic Player Pieces: Each of these sets includes: 5 settlements, 4 cities and 15 roads. The four colors for the sets will be red, green, blue and white. These acrylic pieces are slightly translucent creating a unique twist on the classic pieces. They are definitely fun to fiddle with as you wait for your turn.\nWe need KickStarter to help get the funding we need to produce more then our few prototypes.

Lucky for Dan, Zito's also makes a pretty good cup of Joe, a necessity in the edge of explored space. Dan is a loner constantly bickering with the few around him, his personal AI--komputar and his mechanic, Joules.\n\nDan is stuck in the melancholy of corporate space with nowhere to go but down.

But on one particular mission, Dan finds his way into the middle of an adventure unlike anything he has ever experienced before.\n\nWith crazy rogue asteroids, alien death ships, his demanding boss, and komputar, who seemingly only knows how to play jazz in the worst of situations, Dan learns that his fight for life and those around him is far greater than the corporate governance looming above.\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nKickstarter will allow us to distribute the comic book digitally, which requires a copyright and ISBN purchase.

All tiers now include an audiobook version of Camp Myth!\nStill on the fence about becoming a backer? Here's what you'll now get for only $25:\n-Short story pack\n-Camp Myth eBook\n-Camp Myth audio book\n-Camp Myth Softcover\n-Design a Level 2 Camper (name, race, description, line of dialogue)\n-Deisgn an official Camp Myth merit badge\n-Eliminate a lower-tiered camper from the story \nThere has never been a better time to sign up! :)   \nWhat is Camp Myth?\n\"Camp Myth, your name we say with pride.\n Our haven from the world outside.\n And when this mountain we descend,\n All mythic creed return as friend.\"\n\n- Official Camp Motto\nHave you ever wanted to ride a Pegasus? Fish for a Kraken? How about tame a pet Phoenix, or play chess with a Sphinx?\nEach year, mythic children of all ages and races are invited to attend Camp Myth, a special summer camp built to teach them about the cultures and dangers of the Unseen World.\n \nBut for Felix, a young Fae with a knack for getting into trouble, it means little more than a chance to break free from his overprotective parents and enjoy a few weeks without responsibilities. That is, until a series of mysterious events turn camp life upside-down, and he accidentally stumbles upon a sinister plot to enslave all myth-kind. \nTogether with his cabin-mates, Argee - the planet's dorkiest Cyclops, and Kit - an orphaned Kitsune unable to control her shape-shifting powers, Felix will meet strange new friends, earn amazing merit badges, and maybe, just maybe...\nSurvive until the closing ceremony!\n(Cover art by: Anne Ballaran)\n\nCreate a Camper! Design the Camp! \nCamp Myth is the first YA novel that allows readers to take part in the action and directly affect the setting and events of the final product. Becoming a backer means you will not only be supporting a unique work of fiction, but - depending on the donation tier - you'll be able to have more of a creative voice in the world where everyone will interact.\nDontations of any amount are greatly appreciated, and rewards start at only one dollar. But at the ten dollar level and beyond, you will be able to enroll in the camp, and you can select the mythical race (from eight) and name of a camper in the novel. The more you donate, the more defined and important your character will become, with higher tiers allowing backers to become camp counselors \u2013 or even main characters!\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Camp Myth is a pretty dangerous place, and not every camper returns home in one piece. After all, the mythic community is no place for creatures that aren\u2019t capable of facing a little danger. That\u2019s why, beginning at the $25 dollar level and higher, every backer will be responsible for randomly removing a lower-tiered backer\u2019s character from the camp.\nThat\u2019s right. While your character won\u2019t do the deed directly, you\u2019ll be personally responsible for someone else\u2019s character being taken out of the story. Will they be eaten after taunting a wild dragon, or sent home early after being caught with contraband phoenix feathers? Who knows? But since you are only a potential target to people who have contributed to higher donation tiers, the higher you go, the better chance you\u2019ll have of making it to the graduation ceremony.\n(\"Camper-Crashing sketch by Jay Camay - These sketches will serve as chapter headers, and will feature backer-created characters.)\nBut there\u2019s even more! In addition to creating a character, several tiers are able to contribute directly to Camp Myth lore. You can design merit badges that the cast will attempt to earn during their stay, and choose whether the main characters succeed or fail, with consequences that will impact the rest of the story. Returning to the phoenix example, a backer could say they want the camp to have a badge for spotting a phoenix in the wild. If they choose for the characters to succeed, perhaps they will find one of its fire-starting feathers to use later. Or maybe they fail, startling the phoenix, and in return it angrily torches the nearby baseball diamond (and half of the players!) Hey, I told you it was dangerous.\nIn addition to e-books, short story packs, signed copies of the book, custom characters, authorship of events, and the fun of eliminating other campers, you can also get custom art from the spectacular Anne Ballaran (http://anneballaran.daportfolio.com) of your camper earning your personally-designed merit badge (or your counselor assisting in a merit badge attempt gone wrong). \nAll funds raised for Camp Myth will be used to create, publish, and distribute the novel. I'm not going to retire on a private island or anything. By the time I pay my artists, publishing, distribution, and advertising costs, I'm hoping to enjoy a nice sandwich with the remaining profits :)   \nCamp Rules\nWhile there is a core story line that will guide the narrative, all of the moving parts are able to be modified while the original concept remains in place. There are some restrictions, though, obviously. The success of Camp Myth will only be possible if people are willing to channel their creativity in a positive way. I\u2019m going to be moderating to ensure that no one is paying money just to troll. To that end, here are the rules:\n1) Character names can be human or made-up, but cannot be offensive, completely ridiculous, based on celebrities, or any other copyrighted material. Sure, a Minotaur called Dave could work (for, you see, several mythic races have incorporated human names into their cultures) and so could 'Rhhal Scarhorn.' But you can\u2019t just donate to the project and demand to name a camper \u201cStinky McDerp,\u201d or \"Harry Potter.\" The same rules apply to custom dialogue, and locations. \n2) A variation of these rules also apply to merit badges. While you can create a badge for most any type of activity involving a mythic creature, there cannot be any badges that overtly encourage violence or non-fantasy criminal behaviour. \"Steal a trinket from Medusa's forest hut?\" - Sure. \"Fillet a Mermaid?\" - No.\n(\"Camper-Crashing\" sketch by Jay Camay)\n\n3) After becoming a backer, you may submit your character and/or merit badge ideas at any time to either this Kickstarter account, or campmyth@gmail.com. The deadline for contributions will be two weeks after the kickstarter campaign has ended. All unsubmitted backers will be contacted for their ideas prior to that date, and failure to respond will result in your submissions not being included. However, you will still receive all other rewards, and will be responsible for eliminating a lower-tiered camper. \n4) The author (me) can be contacted at any time with thoughts or questions about your submissions. For Level 3 characters and higher, I will be in contact though email (or Skype) regarding how you'd prefer your character be portrayed in certain scenes. Level 4 and 5 characters will likely involve several exchanges, so hopefully you're willing to do a fair amount of collaborating.\n5) The author (me) reserves the right to make the final decision to include any and all content submissions. Believe me, I hope I'm not forced to ultimately override anything, and I'm totally willing to work with you in order to refine a particular idea. But if you're unflinching in your belief that your character should explore the geo-political ramafications of Camp Myth being discovered by NASA satellites, I might have to step in. Remember, keep it fun, fantastical, and friendly.\n6) By backing and submitting ideas to this project, you agree that you are allowing those ideas and characters to be used by the author of Camp Myth as he deems fit, and you are not entitled to any further compensation - monetary or otherwise - aside from your specified donation rewards. I hate to get legal all of a sudden, but you know how it is.            \nI truly believe this project can become a wonderful, entertaining experience that allows for creative people to come together and build an incredible world. This is an opportunity to take part in a landmark in collaborative storytelling, but, like most things in life, it can only reach its full potential if people are willing to take it seriously.    \nIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work, but I know that I\u2019m up for it if you all are :)          \nCreature Races of Camp Myth\nBackers can choose from the following eight mythic races when designing their camper/counselor. (Art provided by the fantastic Jay Camay: www.jron-camay.com.) \nCyclops\nAggressive, arrogant, and valuing strength above all else, Cyclopes are feared throughout the mythic community. However, despite their violent tendencies, most are natural artisans. Unfortunately, this usually results in the creation of stronger, deadlier weapons.\nFae\nServing as heralds of the elements, the Fae draw strength from Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind in order to maintain the world's natural balance. Fae adults are known to be highly pragmatic thinkers, and despise anything that might be considered \"fun.\"\nKitsune\nAble to shape-shift between fox and human forms, the Kitsune are magical as they are cunning. There is no greater honour for a Kitsune than to develop additional tails, as they symbolize strength and maturity.\nDryad\nExisting as physical embodiments of nature, and possessing the ability to commune with animals, Dryads can live for hundreds of years by bonding their spirits with the trees themselves. These bonds are so powerful that when one dies, so does the other.\nCentaur\nIncredibly fast and fiercely competitive, these half-human, half-horse creatures are unique in their belief that all matters - from political to personal - can be settled with a game of skill. Females of the species prefer to be called by their proper name: Kentaurides.\nMer\nEither as man or maid, Mer are the undisputed masters of the sea and all its creatures. Despite popular belief, most Mer can survive on land for several hours, provided they return to their watery domains to recover from the exposure.\nRedcap\nAlso known as goblins, kobolds, or brownies, the Redcap is a deceitful trickster of the highest order. Although small in size, Redcaps are known for their love of dangerous pranks, and seldom think of the consequences of their actions. \nMinotaur\nNatural leaders, Minotaurs are as wise as they are ferocious in battle. However, due to several centuries-long feuds between rival clans, there are rumored to be less than a few hundred Minotaurs left in existence.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Chris Lewis Carter\n3 created \u00b7 15 backed\nFrom high-school textbooks to award-winning magazines and podcasts, Chris Lewis Carter has been featured in nearly two dozen publications ...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Reminder of new Camp Myth Campaign", "update_content": "Hey there,\nJust wanted to remind everyone that Camp Myth is back online and off to a great start (we're currently featured as a \"popular this week\" project!)

Our Shirts and stickers were so popular, we've going to continue to offer them (and other personal goodies) as rewards for your support.\nThe Hermes Spacecraft\nWe are developing the Hermes Spacecraft: a reusable suborbital spacecraft that will take passengers and payloads into space.  We want to provide the ultimate joyride, a thrilling ride to space where passengers can experience zero gravity, see the curvature of the Earth below and the star-filled black sky above.  Our mantra is \u201cSpace for All\u201d, and we want to provide affordable spaceflight for all future astronauts waiting to go!\nWe have a full scale prototype of the Hermes structure already created.  We've also made great progress on several other subsystems.  We need your help to create a full size prototype of our rocket motors.\nOur Goal: A Full Size Hybrid Rocket Test Motor\nThe Hermes Spacecraft will be using a hybrid rocket system for it's main propulsion. It\u2019s easier to handle, build, acquire, and most importantly, safer to fly on and better for the environment.  Inside the Hermes, we'll be using several rocket motors to propel us to space.  To date, we've done several tests with 2\u201d diameter motors, and we've designed and tested a 3\" motor.\nThe next step in the process of developing the Hermes Spacecraft and meeting our objectives is to scale up our small-scale hybrid rocket motors to a larger scale, 10\u201d diameter motor capable of putting out about 5,000 lbs of thrust.  This rocket will allow us to better test and characterize the propulsion system in preparation for manned, suborbital spaceflight.  We need your help to make this happen!\nWhat's our Budget?\nOur $20,000 budget is broken down into the following:\n$10,000 - Sensors.  To prove our engine is safe and reliable, we need to be able to measure and analyze every piece of it, and that means A LOT of sensors.  We'll have over 40 sensors on our full scale core, including pressure transducers, load cells, strain and temperature gauges.  Not only will these sensors document how the engine test goes, but they will alert us if any problems occur, allowing us to shut down our test before all of our hard work goes up in smoke.\n\n$3,000 - Data Acquisition Hardware.  We'll use this hardware to monitor and record all of the data coming from our rocket engine. Using this hardware and our sensors, we'll be creating an entirely autonomous Rocket Monitoring and Control System.  When we go out to do our first big test firing, all we'll have to do is press the button.\n\n$2,000 - Materials.

Hey, everybody needs their piece of the pie.  Thank you Kickstarter and Amazon!\nThe Tiers\nHow Much For the Entire Spacecraft?\nWe wanted to set a Kickstarter goal that was an honest assessment of our next big milestone.  That's how we came up with our request for $20,000.  One of our mantras is \"Build a Little, Test a Lot\".  Of course, we have a lot more subsystems to build!\nWe have a set plan, with several milestones along the way, covering the build and integration of all of our major components.  However, even with our long term planning and constant drive to keep costs at a minimum, this is still rocket science and it ain't cheap.  It would take us about $4 million to have one Hermes Spacecraft ready for paying customers, and $8 million to realize our three year plan.\nWe want the Kickstarter community to show their support for a home-grown space project, and we're prepared to do great things with any extra funding we receive.  We would use any extra funds graciously and with purpose to help fulfill our vision\nThe Hermes Team\nThe Hermes Core team is made up of aerospace entrepreneurs.  We are a small team of experienced, \u2018hands-on\u2019, multi-disciplined engineers, working on this project in our spare time, on nights and weekends.  We are backed by an extensive talent pool that we call the \"Hermes Pit Crew\":  people who have directly helped us with our work on the Hermes.\n*Story Musgrave is not an active member of our team nor directly endorses us, but he did think the Hermes was pretty cool!\nSo to sum up our story...\nThe Hermes Spacecraft is the brainchild of founder, Morris Jarvis.  Morris has been dreaming of going to space since he was a boy, and started the initial design for the Hermes in 1978.  The Hermes combines today\u2019s latest commercially available advances in the aerospace industry with the lessons learned from 60 years of manned spaceflight, and we're looking to offer safe, affordable access to space.  The current prototype has been a work in progress for the past decade, but we've been ramping up our efforts in the past year.\nPlease get to know us by checking out any of our links below.  We hope we've proven to you that people are still as passionate about space as ever.  If you've always wanted to be an astronaut, if you find yourself looking up at the night sky in wonder, if you love high tech and big engines: join us. Help us get the word out about the new space race and what we are trying to do.  If you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to ask and we will try to answer to the best of our ability.

[Wednesday, August 31st] PART II IS NOW LIVE! Click HERE to watch it. *The video above is part one in a Kickstarter exclusive \"Fundraising\" Trilogy. Note that this is not the pilot - it was simply made for fundraising purposes in the style of our episodes. \n             A pilot for a comedic anthology series in the style of 'Tales From the Crypt' and 'The Twilight Zone' - aimed for web or television distribution. Focuses on genre elements beyond mere horror, the aim is to make you laugh first, and thrill your pants off second. \n             Without giving anything too exciting away, the pilot for the first season of \"The Cautionary Tales of Jack & Justin\" involves a seemingly 'haunted' wireless printer that consumes the lives of our peeping tom's. Printing not only data from their apartment but also that of a beautiful girl across the street from them, Jack & Justin are presented with your everyday moral dilemma: simply return a defective printer that violates the privacy of your neighbors or...use the printer to your advantage to learn more about this sexy babe and try to manipulate false encounters to get her to fall in love with you. Clearly the latter. \n             Needless to say, nothing is ever simple (or logical) in the moronic world of Jack & Justin, and they quickly find themselves over their heads in deep poop. What is the mysterious printout the boys receives late in the night? Is it a cry for help or a ghastly confession of murder? How long can Justin survive at her Bikram Yoga studio before she notices him? Will they recycle all the ink cartridges they use up or merely throw them in the trash? And who the hell is the crippled figure that lurks in her apartment when everyone is asleep?\n             Our main interest lies in landing a 15-minute spot on Cartoon Network's late night sub-channel 'Adult Swim.' With a demographic that ranges from age 21-85 male and female, and sociopaths of all ages, we feel like 'Adult Swim' is the perfect home for us. Lately, we've been noticing a shift in their programing from cartoons exclusively, to now having a solid mix of both cartoons and live action. Shows like Tim and Eric and Children's Hospital create an audience to match our content. Neither of those shows incorporate a heavy 'movie flair' to them, so with the right resources and equipment, we can help our show stand out among them. \n             For starters, we plan to shoot with a very high end digital camera called the Red One. The camera is not only more affordable to shoot on than film (allowing more money to be allocated into set design, costumes, props, and post production) but also creates a very realistic filmic look. There is no doubt that if we are able to acquire this camera that we can create a more believable, dark, and thrilling world that would contrast wonderfully with the comical mishaps and stupidity of our main characters.\n             Submitting to festivals once the film is created will help our work receive attention from producers, agents, and the general public. The more people that see our film, the more hits we get on our older videos online, and the more the demand for new episodes increases, helping our chances of pitching to a studio and creating a full season of 'Jack & Justin.' Submissions to festivals is an expensive process but one that cannot be overlooked!\n             The soundtrack to the pilot will be created from scratch by Jack Bishop and Justin Nijm. You can hear Jack's style by checking his one man band 'Mr. Bear' also available on iTunes! Everything will be recorded with real instruments to help create that unique cinematic symphonic sound.\n             We don't subscribe to the Chicago Tribune but we do have an unlimited subscription to Netflix, Blockbuster Video, and over $200 in late fees to Specialty & Adult Video Palace. We went to school for movies and although that doesn't make us experts, we can definitely hold our own in a game of \"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\" \n             The point is, we have a good idea about what the influences for the show are going to be. Not to be confused with satire or parody, 'Jack & Justin' simply borrows classical cinematic themes and techniques and then dumbs them down for your entertainment. Take a look at this class gem from Brian De Palma and now re-imagine it starring Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne. \nNot to reference Jim Carrey twice but you seriously need to revisit this underrated masterpiece from Ben Stiller. He dared to blend comedy and psychopathic horror long before Jack & Justin found themselves face to face with a demonic Janitor who stole all their stuff. \n             And who can forget the classic Martin Scorsese remake of the classic 'Cape Fear' with '90s heart throb Nick Nolte. \n             But the best example of all for how we would like our show to be perceived is 'Tales From the Crypt.' Please do yourself a favor and revisit the first episode called 'The Man Who Was Death' with William Sadler. Woo wee, it's a shocker. \n (last updated 8/18/11)\n             Bob Zegler - Creative Producer. Bob works as producer for a company he helped create in 2005 with friend Brad Bischoff. They have won number awards for their work, including the highly coveted Chicago Award for their film 'WET' at the 45th CIFF. See Bob's most recent film here:\n             Casey Tompkins - Director of Photography. We've worked with him numerous times, and he shot this Kickstarter video for us! An amazing talent from Columbia College as well, currently applying for grad school at AFI for Cinematography! Check out his reel below.\n             Mollie Alexander - Production Designer. Mollie has a talent for making the surreal and fantastic come to life. Having production designed and art directed numerous high budget films at Columbia College, Mollie has developed a style that is not only unique but highly sought after. See her most recent production design work here:              \n             Jack Bishop and Justin Nijm - Writing, Directing, and Editing. Also playing the roles of Jack and Justin respectively. If you aren't familiar with the web series check out the newest episodes at JackandJustin.com under 'Jack & Justin in Chicago,' or click the 'Selects' button to see their weekly skits, and 'Jack & Justin in LA' to see their early blog videos that started it all. \n             Art Department - This will be our biggest expense, seeing as how we won't be shooting in a live apartment, but instead building one from scratch in a studio space (the new Columbia College Media Production Center sound stage). The set will be reused to create a second apartment - saving a little bit of money - but the rest of the art budget will go into props, wardrobes, effects, and makeup.\n             Actors and Crew - A good actor these days 'aint cheap, and we need the very best to compensate for our idiotic personas. Crew also won't work for free, plus we need to pay for transportation costs and feed them. Kind of like a Mogwai from 'Gremlins.' You can't feed them too late or give them water or they'll mutate. Coffee is ok though, we think. \n             Equipment - We want to rent the very best cameras, lenses, lights, dollys, and all the other stuff that works magic behind the scenes. Have you seen 'The Social Network?' That was shot with the same camera we plan to use. Trent Reznor not included with rental. \n             Post Production - Proper color correction and visual effects, as well as the costs for music rights and sound mixing. \n             Remember, any little bit helps - plus, Kickstarter WILL NOT charge your card until we reach our goal of $8,000.

Do you like me? Well, then, have I got a proposition for you\u2026\nI\u2019m back in the studio recording a series of three, three-song EPs\u2014hereforth known as The Triples\u2014and I\u2019m asking fans, friends, family, and anyone else who\u2019d like to contribute for some help. I\u2019ve got a number of songs burning a hole in my pocket (yes, that\u2019s where I keep my songs) and I want to get them out into the world. We (the band and I) have already started the recording process, and I'm bursting with joy (literally; send help) at how good these songs already sound. I will release each EP via a special download card. At the end of this series of Triples, I will re-release these songs as a full-length album, complete with artwork, CD, and additional tracks. Some common questions:\n\u201cWhy Do You Need Money?\u201d As most of you know, I funded my first album, Dying Day, all by my lonesome. It was worth every penny. But at the end of the day, those pennies added up to more than $11,000. Unless I start streetwalking (and let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s never really off the table), I\u2019m not going to come across that kind of cash anytime soon. I don\u2019t want to cut corners and make these recordings any less wonderful than the first, so I\u2019m asking for help in raising about half of what these EPs will cost: $5,500.\n\u201cHow Does It Work?\u201d At Kickstarter, the idea is that the project initiator (that\u2019s me) sets a time limit and a dollar goal. If I don\u2019t reach that dollar goal (in this case, $5,500) within the allotted amount of time, Kickstarter will come to my house, kick in my television, punch my face, and use my bathroom without washing its hands afterwords! Lies! That\u2019s not how it works at all. In truth, if I don\u2019t reach my goal, all donations are refunded back to the donors. Why? Because Kickstarter doesn\u2019t want donors giving money to projects that don\u2019t have enough funding. A project that's under-funded is a project that doesn\u2019t happen. And if that project doesn\u2019t happen, you don\u2019t really want someone to whom you just donated money walking around with a bunch of cash in her pocket while looking up bus fares to Tijuana. (Note: If I do reach my goal and I still have some time on the clock, I can continue to accept donations.)\n\u201cWhat\u2019s In It For Me?\u201d Not only will you help an independent artist (and her awesome band) pursue a dream, you get stuff. Stuff!!! Take a look-see at the Rewards. From music downloads to album credits and even private concerts, you\u2019ve got a lot of options. Every dollar counts. Every dollar is appreciated. No donation is too small. (No donation is too big, either\u2026you know what I'm saying?) Most of all, you help an independent artist create great music. \n\u201cWho are you? I mean, are you any good?\u201d Well, music is subjective, but subjectively speaking, I\u2019m awesome. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Here\u2019s some press for my first album, Dying Day:\n\u201cDying Day is a stellar first release and the launch of a sure-to-be long and healthy career.\u201d\u2014Mare Wakefield, Performing Songwriter\n\u201cBarrett is refreshing, a bright light among others of her genre.\u201d\u2014Julia R. DeStefano, The Noise \n\u201cJust when you think you\u2019ve got [Dying Day] nailed down, off it goes again on another unexpected tangent. That\u2019s what makes this debut album so compelling. She\u2019s a bit folky, a bit ethereal, a bit strange (especially on \u201cTrain\u201d)\u2014but all good.\u201d\u2014The U.K.\u2019s Rock \u2018n Reel\nBetter yet, take your own word for it. Listen to tracks at facebook.com/abbiebarrettfans\n\u201cI've listened and I like your music. I\u2019m sorry I ever doubted you. How can I make this right?\u201d Throw down a couple bucks and please spread the word! Let others know about this project. Share my widget. Tell your ma, tell your pa, tell your friends, tell your butcher, your baker, and your candlestick maker. (I assume you have one of those\u2026)\n\u201cI\u2019ve done everything you asked.

No doubt if you\u2019re reading this page, you\u2019ve already been to shows, listened to my first album, received countless emails from me, and in general, put up with all my crazy.

Thanks so much for checking out my project. The idea is very simple. As a designer, I love creating logos. So, I thought it would be fun, and challenging, to do a project with the straightforward concept of creating a whole bunch of different logos for a whole bunch of different people, based on each person's name. That's it. Each backer will have a unique, custom and professionally designed logo created for them that represents their own name. Then, all of the logos will be displayed at namelogodirectory.com. Why a directory? Because each logo will then link to a specific URL that the backer gets to choose... It could be their own Facebook page, Twitter, website, etc. (nothing obscene or inappropriate though). Depending on the number of backers, this project could be pretty huge. But in then end, I think it would be such a cool design piece to see hundreds of individual name logos displayed on the site together. Check out the examples images below, but imagine a lot of different logos in the site example.\nAbout The Logos\nAs a design nerd, I'm pretty picky about consistency. So, to give the final site a consistent look, I'm planning for each logo to be displayed in black and white. Also, in the event that this project actually takes off and receives a lot of backers, I want to let everyone know in advance that the number of hours spent on each individual logo may be limited to an hour or two. Just imagine if for some crazy reason there were 500 people who backed this project, it could then potentially take 4 months, working 40 hours per week to finish all of the logos ... Which would be awesome!! ... But pretty challenging at the same time. However, I think that's where the really interesting part of this project might come into play... Designing consistently good logos in a limited amount of time probably won't be easy, but I'm excited to push my inspiration and creativity to new limits. No matter how difficult though, please know that in the end I refuse to put out anything that looks bad with my name attached to it.\nAbout The Funding\nOverall, you can think of it this way; Backers get a unique, custom designed logo, while I get a really sweet design project. Upon successful funding, I'll reach out to each backer and ask that they submit a brief sentence or two about themselves from which I may draw inspiration for their logo design.\nThe reason I'd like to raise at least $500 is so that there could potentially be at least 20 backers at the lowest funding level ... Otherwise, I'm afraid that namelogodirectory.com might feel a little empty in the end, and it's potential impact would be lost.\nThank You\nIf you want to learn more about me and my design skills, please visit brandoneck.com.

The film is called \u201cWarm Earth, Which I\u2019ve Been Told\u201d and is built around music by Six Organs of Admittance, who have generously given me their full support and music rights for this film. The entire film will be shot on a digital camera with a 180\u00ba circular fisheye lens (brand new Canon lens technology), allowing the entire horizon and sky to be visible in frame. \nThe fisheye will contain the images in a circle, representing the shape of the earth, a repeating theme throughout the film. Likewise the distortion of a fisheye lens will add an interesting abstractness to the images making an entirely unique and compelling work of art. \nPREVIOUS TIMELAPSE: With the success of my timelapse art film, Mossgrove/Bed of Moss, this new film will continue to expand the creative parameters of timelapse storytelling through dramatic photography, deliberate pacing, style and mood.  \nSTORY: It begins at noon looking straight up at the sun and sky. Trees stretch from the outside of the circle toward the center where they part, displaying the entire sky. Voices chant \u201cwhere will I rest\u201d as the sun continues to set and clouds flow by. At the 4:50 mark, the sun sets behind the horizon. Then the music shifts to a tranquil/cosmic section. Here the camera will display the entire rotating night sky and Milky Way galaxy, silhouetted by lunging trees. At 12:50 in the film, the music begins to shift again into an ominous chant as the sun starts to rise. The camera follows the sun up above at noon under the trees at the same place where the film began (representing the looping/spherical pattern of life).\nFUNDING: To help pay for and recoup the costs for making the film. Those include rental costs of the camera, lens, battery and data storage for shooting 24 hours straight in a remote location. For $2,000 I will able to produce, film, edit, and complete this unique HD film that will be shown throughout the world.\nPUBLIC SCREENINGS:\nFESTIVALS: I have had my films shown in over 30 international film festivals and plan to use those connections to screen this film in many festivals around the world.\nPLANETARIUMS: I am already in discussion with screening this in many planetariums and welcome the opportunity to inspire and educate audiences with this unique glimpse of a day passing.\nONLINE: I will offer a full HD version of the film available free online with vimeo.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "DVD's and Cryosphere", "update_content": "I am hand making the DVD rewards and will be shipping them out at the end of the week.

Specifically, the story follows the lives of Grace Canton Kelley, her sister Athena, and their two best friends as they respond to the turmoil caused by an alcoholic, abusive stepfather and the poverty and dangers that surround their town.  The story is told from the perspective of Grace, the meek, bookish second-born, who grows up in the shadow of her magical, beautiful, yet dangerous elder sister.  Grace's timidity and lack of self-confidence are only surpassed by her passion to protect those she loves and the burden of responsibility she feels to hold her family together. \nThe book visits the unspoken, unyielding bond of loyalty between siblings, yet highlights the stark contrast between Grace and Athena, shown perhaps most vividly by the way they ultimately deal with the abuse of their mother.  Most of all, the book offers a poignant look at the problem of evil and its lasting reverberations within the intertwined fates of a family.  As the Spark Flies Upward is a compelling story filled with love, laughter, pain, grief, vengeance, forgiveness, and hope.  You should read it.\nThe funds raised on Kickstarter will be used for cover design, publication and preliminary promotion of this book, all of which are entering final stages.  The headshots and book cover photos are in the capable hands of Lauren Stonestreet and the book cover is currently in Heidi Rolf's design studio (keep a weather eye on my website for a sneak peek in the coming weeks).  The video you see above was filmed by Stephen Stonestreet, and he and Lauren are tag-teaming my online presence, which is off to a great start.  There are a few more details to handle with our publishing company (Round Door Publishing) and setting up the title with our distributor (Lightning Source/Ingram) that will also necessitate some bucks. The book will be offered in paperback and eBook formats, so there will be absolutely no excuse for any living humans not to read it.  \nThe key in this whole process is that I've been surrounded with young, hip professionals that know what they are doing. That has made all the difference. Now, please help me pay them what they deserve!\nThe book launch is planned for late June 2011, and we plan to do it right...and with your help, we can.

The concept is to make one continuous timelapse shot following the night and day sky over the span of an entire day, 24 hours. The film is called \u201cWarm Earth, Which I\u2019ve Been Told\u201d and is built around music by Six Organs of Admittance, who have generously given me their full support and music rights for this film. The entire film will be shot on a digital camera with a 180\u00ba circular fisheye lens (brand new Canon lens technology), allowing the entire horizon and sky to be visible in frame. \nThe fisheye will contain the images in a circle, representing the shape of the earth, a repeating theme throughout the film. Likewise the distortion of a fisheye lens will add an interesting abstractness to the images making an entirely unique and compelling work of art. \nSTORY: It begins at noon looking straight up at the sun and sky. Trees stretch from the outside of the circle toward the center where they part, displaying the entire sky. Voices chant \u201cwhere will I rest\u201d as the sun continues to set and clouds flow by. At the 4:50 mark, the sun sets behind the horizon. Then the music shifts to a tranquil/cosmic section. Here the camera will display the entire rotating night sky and Milky Way galaxy, silhouetted by lunging trees. At 12:50 in the film, the music begins to shift again into an ominous chant as the sun starts to rise. The camera follows the sun up above at noon under the trees at the same place where the film began (representing the looping/spherical pattern of life).\nFUNDING: To help pay for and recoup the costs for making the film and the equipment required. Those costs include the camera, lens, battery and data storage for shooting 24 hours straight in a remote location. For $5,000 I will able to produce, film, edit, and complete this unique HD film that will be shown throughout the world.\nPUBLIC SCREENINGS:\nFESTIVALS: I have had my films shown in over 30 international film festivals and plan to use those connections to screen this film in many festivals around the world.\nPLANETARIUMS: I am already in discussion with screening this in many planetariums and welcome the opportunity to inspire and educate audiences with this unique glimpse of a day passing.\nONLINE: I will offer a full HD version of the film available free online with vimeo.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Kurtis Hough\n3 created \u00b7 6 backed\nView more of my films here: http://www.vimeo.com/23600010 http://www.vimeo.com/2618991 https://vimeo.com/51479272 Twitter...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project ends": "MAY 19, 2011"}, {"Project launches": "APRIL 19, 2011"}]}], "comment_no": 4, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1560227758/24-hour-timelapse-warm-earth-which-ive-been-told", "project_name": "24 Hour Timelapse - Warm Earth, Which I've Been Told"}}]
