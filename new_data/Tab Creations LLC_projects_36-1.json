[{"backer": "Tab Creations LLC", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "A post-apocalyptic game of melancholy. Is it all a facade or is there truth beneath the new order of existence?\nPLAY\n\n The New World \nThe decay started around 2020 and in less than thirty years we lost centuries of growth.  In thirty years time, the world changed as we knew it. Birth rates sank, deaths spiral out of control. Imagine for a moment that everything you take for granted is gone;  your video games, your supermarkets, your electricity, and all but five percent of every person you\u2019ve ever known. One could expect here that the wellbeing of the population is at a profound new low. Add to that the grim reality that their survival relies solely on the use of the animated bodies of their dead loved ones and you begin to realize the bleak and irreparably grim existence the survivors must bear. \nSurvivors formed communities, barricading themselves behind the walls of makeshift fortresses. Outside the land is reclaimed by nature. Mankind fell to an apocalypse of harmless and quiet ruin. Not with a bang, but with a whimper.\nIn the end, the dead that come back to haunt us were of our own creation.\n\nThe Great Hecatomb \nThe height of death in 2057 is known in Florence as the year of The Great Hecatomb. Bodies laying still on the streets, innumerable corpses littered in droves. The remaining survivors, despite the abundance of resources, were on the verge of starvation. There were no hands to cultivate the fields, to raise the cattle, to do anything.\nFortunately for the people of Florence, a collective of brilliant minds had formed. It was these scientists and innovators, who would later become  known as The Builders, who broke the most egregious of taboos to end the famine by exploiting the most abundant resource. By combining the latest frontier of biology with cutting-edge  patents in precision mechanics and thermohydraulics, the Builders synthesized a procedure capable of reanimating corpses and making them into autonomous working machines. The era of constructs and the Florentine Scientific Empire had begun.\n\nFlorence and the Constructs\nThe arrival of the constructs had a traumatic impact on the psyche of a population that was already teetering on the edge. But the people of Florence had little choice. Without this gift they would perish. Over time the constructs became less human, unnecessary physical features removed to further separate them from humans. Leaving them with the appearance of little more than motorized leather mannequins. Now the Florentines had stopped burying their dead entirely, opting instead to give the corpses to the Citadel as a public resource. In return, the fields were supplied with farming constructs, the streets with autonomous garbage collectors, the construction sites with heavy-lifting mechanical assistants, and eventually even the homes of Florence were equipped with their very own domestic servants. Today, the constructs are the base on which the entire Florentine society rests; they are everywhere, everywhere.\nIn the twenty year aftermath of The Great Hecatomb, Florence expanded and stabilized as a technocracy. Through the use of these constructs, society has found a new way of living. Human bodies are no longer sacred as they once were. They are simply machines to be used for public good after your death, it\u2019s pieces replaceable, for they do not belong to you in any sacred way. Mutilation and maiming are considered little more than temporary setbacks. Human life, however, has never been more precious. Humanity, a flickering light in the darkness, is fading \u2014 and to take a life is inconceivable to even the most hardened criminals. Despite the hopelessness and bleakness, even the most broken individuals understand their responsibility to protect what little remains of humanity. \nDespite the disappearance of electronics and due to the rapid advancements in biomedical technology, virtually any illness or injury can be treated if the patient seeks attention quickly enough. Organs can be grown, and limbs can be transplanted safely. An eighty-year-old within the walls today looks and acts as a fifty-year old would at the turn of the century.\n\nThe Codex Scientificus\nThe people, having found salvation through technology, asked for guidance from their saviors and the scientists delivered yet again.  The Council of the Citadel of Sciences of Florence issued the Codex Scientificus, the principles on which the law of Florence and of all the communities under its influence are still based. Born in a period of immense scarcity, the Codex Scientificus saw it necessary to optimize everything to save humanity. The Codex is divided into three parts: Laws, Calculation Models, and Normative Equations.\nThe Laws, while few, are binding and unchangeable. Most famous among them is the 2-2064, which ratifies the \"direct and immediate ownership  of all non-slaughtered bodies, human or otherwise for use at reconversion into worker constructs for public or private utility with deliberate impediment to their transport punishable at the  discretion of the Analytical Commission of the Citadel of Sciences of Florence\".\nThe calculation Models, studied by the Architects and Builders, are nothing more than a series of modules and questionnaires designed to find an individual\u2019s aptitudes in order to place them within society.\nThe Normative Equations, as practiced by the Militia, contain the means of practical interpretations of the Law, as well as a guidebook on the theoretical limit of constraints to be placed on the population before creating resistance.\n\nThe Militia\nBorn during the collapse from the Municipal Police Corps of Florence and outliving both the military and police. The Militia represents law and order within the walls of Florence and the neighboring communities it controls. The militia which is composed of law enforcement, investigators, and legal servants are tasked with enforcing the law, settling disputes through use of the Normative Equations, and solving the occasional crime.\n\nThe Army\nBy the early 2070s Florence found relative stability. With the famine now behind it and deaths in a slow but encouraging decline, the attention of the community turned to the tumultuous world beyond the walls. Florentines felt it was time to bring order beyond the walls to ensure the safety of neighboring farms and to restore contact with the rest of the world. For this purpose the Florentine Army was born. Among the Florentine army\u2019s elite stands the magnum opus of the Creators; the Technopowered Division. The brainchild of Nicola F\u00e8nn\u00f9, the Technopowered Division is a testament to his visionary genius. \n\nThe Scrap\nBefore the advent of hybrid constructs in the mid 2050\u2019s, the population of Florence had little use for the long-defunct technology of their forebears. As they began the effort to move the broken technology of the old world into a small island just northwest of town, a colossal pile of vehicles, appliances, infrastructure, robotic components, and electronics amassed.\nToday it is the paradise of the Technosophists, where they can procure virtually all the components needed for their absurd contraptions, from the coil of a fridge to a quantum annealer \u2014 no questions asked. The Technosophists are solitary and often nomadic outsiders but, if they had a capital to speak of, it would certainly be the Great Dump. If you find yourself wandering through its canyons of wreckage and corpses of ancient technology, know that somewhere, somehow, you are being watched.\nOutside the Walls\nNot much is known about the world beyond the walls of Florence. Truth is subjective and trust across both sides of the wall is hard to come by. The world outside, as just outside the tall walls that envelop the city, Forlorn suburbs from the old world lie in a state of decay. beyond them massive farm fields as far as the eye can see \u2014 all tended by boiler-bound constructs. Beyond the farms are no roads or rails, but a land reclaimed by wilderness. Out there, you are alone.\nIn the dead of night, bands of raiders storm the farms on the outskirts of town. The survivors face a cruel fate of torture and slow dismemberment as the cannibal marauders subject the farmers to a slow and painful death. Wolves, bears, and other predators also haunt the reclaimed wilds, hungrily awaiting their prey. \nCrazed, malfunctioning constructs ambush travelers and shred  them alive, tanning the remains for replacement parts or perhaps to enact some sort of revenge on the human race.\nIs this world, as I see it, as the people of Florence see it, the truth? Of course not. We see only a sliver of the ruin, and if you were to witness even half of what is out there you would never want to sleep again.\nIn a broken world where the dead are machines that do the heavy lifting for us, we are just a cog in the social engine, alive at first and forever once dead. The greatest good is to protect human life, at any cost. Nothing is worth more: not the body's sanctity, nor mental sanity.\n\nIn Necrobiotic, you can taste the whole spectrum of emotions, from the deepest horror and the bitterest melancholy to the most moving compassion and the lightest laughter, in a continuous celebration of life and a rediscovery of its fragile uniqueness. The original illustrations will drag you into the alleys of a wounded Florence, among human corpses with tanned leather hides, eternal monuments, and coarse foggy streets.\n\nThe original game system is based on deck-building mechanics with a standard deck of playing cards, though Tarot cards can also be used.  Players will always know what they can do alone or together, and the game's mechanics will easily push the player\u2019s roleplay toward the character\u2019s features, highlighting everyone's specialties.\n\nNecrobiotic is a dark celebration of life where survival is paramount.  It features unique and emotional art along with a new card system that will draw your players into our grim future.\nWIP Special Edition\nWho are you?\nArchitect: You have an educational background in advanced medicine, but you\u2019ve also learned about the science of the constructs. You have mastered the process of tanning corpses and programming the dead.\n\nMilitia: You are responsible for keeping civil order within the laws of Florence.  You may be law enforcement, an investigator, a jurist, or even a prosecutor.  You have a level of authority within the walls of Florence, and have an understanding of the law.\n\nTechnosophist: You are part of the Free Technosophical Society. You have learned the rudiments of the Technology of the Ancients, learning to recognize lost technologies such as electronic phones and computers or even hydrocarbon engines.  You are able to reactivate, use, and even modify these devices.\n\nTechnophant: You have trained as a recruit from the Technopowered Division of the Florence Army. You are equipped with Technopowered Armor, the most devastating weapon known, and are responsible for keeping Florence safe from outward threats.\n\nEngineer: You belong to the Society of Master Builders.  You have advanced knowledge of precision mechanics, thermohydraulics and steam automated mechanics.  You are an inventor, improviser, and a master of modern technology.\nNecrobiotic uses a standard deck of playing cards per player.  You create the player character you form from a deck of cards based on your character\u2019s proficiency in Flesh (Hearts), Steel (diamonds), Steam (clubs), and Gear (spades).\n\nAt the start of play you take a breath, drawing a hand of 6 cards in your hand and, during a scene or conflict, you are playing 1 to 2 cards depending on if you are trained in the associated skill or not.\n\nSuccess is a suit that matches the action is taken or a combination of cards that adds up to 8. Successes will be used to move the narrative forward or counter consequences.\n\nChoosing which cards to play from the hand,  allows the players can decide which actions succeed and how, but every action has consequences!\n\nConsequences are the only tool in the hand of the DM (called Machinist) and they give momentum to the narration, leaving the players in suspense.\n\nPlayers will be able to modify their decks, adding higher cards, removing lesser cards, and buying more face cards that give special abilities.

The crowdfunder format reduces economical risks for the producers, meaning that the more people who supports a project, the better the result is for everyone. Helmgast and Modiphius are experienced game developers and have run multiple successful crowdfunded campaigns in the past.\n\nDespite all the knowledge and experience we have in the field and doing our best to not be too optimistic, sometimes we underestimate the workload for a particular segment of the production, meaning we will need more time than originally estimated. We promise we will be open and frequent in our dialogue with you where this happens. We do however want to outline that we will always put quality over speed in our production.\n\nAlbeit we have come far with the production to date and have vast previous experience in the field, there are some further risks and challenges involved that one should be aware of, listed below.\n\n- Production: The products are dependent on work from a few dedicated artists, writers, and producers. If they are out for whatever reason, it may be hard and take quite some time to find a replacement.\n- Delivery: The product is delivered to you using a third party distribution service. Distribution services are not without errors. Delays and damage to some of the shipments in a Kickstarter campaign are inevitable. We will do our best to assist you where this occurs. All products are insured for transportation and storage.\n- Subcontractors: We are dependent on subcontractors for different items. We use high quality and well-known subcontractors.

And if you want to keep getting the little green pills that keep your body from rejecting your shiny new implants, you'll do EXACTLY as the Company says...\nYou are an Agent of the Company. Equipped with multiple cybernetic augmentations, you carry out the dirty work that keeps the shareholders happy and the corporate executives in their cushy penthouse apartments. When conventional negotiations, political pressure, and legal threats fail, the Company sends you in to \"overcome impediments\" by any means necessary. From acquiring valuable intellectual property to triggering a competitor's succession plans prematurely, you've been (re)built to handle any assignment that comes your way.\nIf you succeed, you get another dose of the medication that keeps you alive. If you fail, the Company will terminate your contract and rip the augmentations out of your body before dumping the leftover meat. That's IF you fail and survive, of course...\nAugmented is a rules-lite cyberpunk roleplaying game for 2-7 players,  one of whom plays the role of the \"Supervisor\" to direct the narrative, frame situations, and control NPCs. \nThe game uses a simple action resolution adapted from the game Revenant. Each Agent has at least two cybernetic augmentations that provide them with superhuman abilities. The game has no stats or skills. Actions are resolved by rolling 2d6 against a variable target number. One die is assigned to the player, the other to the Supervisor. If the test succeeds, the player narrates the outcome. If it fails, the Supervisor describes what happens next.\nBut either the player or the Supervisor can still impact the narrative regardless of the outcome if their die result is higher. This can quickly lead to situations in which an Agent successfully performs a task, but still suffers an unexpected problem. On the other hand, it also means that even when an Agent fails, they can still work closer to their ultimate goal.\nWith no stats or complex mechanics to track, Augmented can be played with little to no preparation. Although the game is well-suited for one shots and episodic missions, Supervisors can use the optional downtime rules to create an extended campaign.\nAugmented was first released as a digital PDF earlier in 2021. Funds raised from this Kickstarter campaign will go toward printing physical copies of the game and shipping them to backers. Additional PDF fulfillments will be handled through itch.io.\nOriginal AUGMENTED PDF Releases\n\nThe core Augmented rulebook consists of 36 full color pages, but the print edition of will also incorporate the content from the Augmented Campaign Setting Guide, which will add another 30 pages to the zine-sized book.

It is endless. It is a layered, grand sea that spreads indefinitely in all directions. In the center of that infinite ocean is an archipelago which is known as the Crescent. Like the sea surrounding it, the Crescent is also unending, but only to the north and south, and never in a straight line. Instead, if the Crescent archipelago could be viewed from above, it would likely look like the sliver of an endless moon being cast onto the water through the dots of islands reminiscent of pointillism, encompassed by a completely empty sea.\nTo the inexperienced sailor, open waters spell death. A magic cast down from the three sibling moons clings to the waves of the ocean and changes them. Massive sea walls, called Shifts, have twisted, capsized, and sunk many merchant ships and pirates alike. Cyclones and tropical storms prove a similar threat through torn sails and broken masts. Yet, not all is danger and foreboding. Sailors have learned to surf smaller Shifts across the sea at great speeds, and astronomers have learned the alignments of the stars before a terrible storm. \nThe sea brings life too, through the boundless creatures that live below it. Merchants make fortunes by peddling wares from island to island, and pirates steal riches from them on their return journeys. Adventurers travel all across the Crescent, taking odd jobs wherever they go and spreading their names far and wide.\nIt is said that no two islands of the Crescent are alike. A unique magic resides on each island, causing such severe effects that even neighboring islands can feel like different worlds. Most have their own climate that has no relation to each other, allowing desert islands to exist next to arctic ones. One island's magic could change the very flow of time, so that a minute on the island feels like a day, while another island's magic could create a volcano that is constantly erupting.\nBecause every island is so distinct, the Mortals of each often develop cultures around them. People living on an island under the effects of a constant thunderstorm could take to the underground and worship gods of rock and stone that protect them from the evils of lightning. People living on an island floating in the sky may not concern themselves with the politics of the region below them, and become aloof. There are even those that take to the sea and live in cities made of coral and shells, if the water around an island is breathable, whether due to an island's magic or their own abilities. \nLuckily, many of these islands have already been charted and detailed by organizations across the Crescent. Notes for these islands can be found in provided guides (Player's Handbook) as you chart a path across the archipelago, and general rules for the structure of these islands (charts) are given to navigators (GMs).\nYou can see some example islands here:  Example Islands \nIt is an adventurer's dangerous task to traverse this melting pot of wild magic and outstanding culture as they sail from island to island, avoiding dangers of both the sea and the surface. To survive is to learn, and to thrive is to adapt to every stop along the way. Their reality will be called into question, and their determination tested. At some point, even death may take a new meaning as the Crescent extends always before them.\n\n Crescent does not use classes or character archetypes. When players begin making a character, they are given Attribute Points that can be distributed among Crescent's 14 Attributes. These Attributes work to represent the sort of physique and mentality the character has, and show their growth in power and personality. \nDepending on their Attributes, characters become eligible to learn useful abilities called Techniques. \nTechniques are usually split into two categories: Combat Techniques and Utility Techniques. Combat Techniques grant characters new options in combat or enhance other existing options. Utility Techniques grant characters new options outside of combat or guarantee success in specific circumstances. The choice is up to the players on what balance they want to strike between the two, allowing for characters to excel entirely in one area over the other, or choose to be well-rounded but less specialized instead.\nBecause there are so many possible Attribute combinations in Crescent, there are an abundance of Techniques to try out\u2014nearly 400 at every level. It's unlikely that any two character's builds will look the same. \nSome Combat Technique Examples:\nSome Utility Technique Examples:\nIt takes a particular sort of person to take to the seas of the Crescent. These adventurers are fueled by ambition or dedicated to a longstanding goal. Many pick up odd skills and bodies of information as their journey continues, and develop habits that help them prepare for any situation they might find themselves in. They are skillful and resourceful, but also still flawed as all Mortals are. Some leave their islands for recognition, to hear their names spoken in the mouths of strangers all across the archipelago. Others leave to become stronger and seek out challenges simply to prove themselves. The roleplay systems of Crescent mediate all of these particularities and place them into tangible and interactable terms.\n Dedications: Dedications serve as driving personal goals for characters throughout their story. As players travel from island to island, they\u2019ll come across stories tailored to progress their Dedication or challenge their desire to see it through. Interacting with these stories can grant them additional experience or other mechanical benefits.\n Areas of Knowledge: Every character has Areas of Knowledge which represent subjects they\u2019ve studied or interacted with enough to build a deep knowledge base of. Areas of Knowledge will grant characters otherwise hidden information along their adventure, and boost their chances of success when they can apply their experience.\n Preparations: Adventurers are often associated with the things that they always do to ready themselves, called Preparations. Whether it's something as harmless as always carrying their lyre for an impromptu song or as nervous as checking every room they walk into for spies, Preparations work as a character\u2019s rule for their interaction with the world.\n Habits: People act differently when stuck in a lie, and those differences are represented by their Habits. Habits define the unconscious activity a character performs when in a situation, from sighing continuously when bored to clenching their fists when nervous. Noticing a character\u2019s Habit can reveal the truth about their inner thoughts.\n Reputation: Very few who travel all across the Crescent manage to do so without garnering a Reputation. Characters can create Good Reputations by defeating evil and helping out the needy, or develop Bad Reputations by harming innocents or challenging popular groups. Once a character has built up enough of a Reputation, it begins to spread far and wide across the sea, and may affect their interactions with new islands.\nEach of these systems, and many more, help to make the world of the Crescent feel more alive, and the player characters feel more well-placed within it.\nCrescent's combat allows players to blend offensive and defensive tactics, and rewards thoughtful choices and teamwork. Characters gain Action Points at the start of their turns which they can use in a variety of ways, from striking their enemies to aiding their allies. Any Action Points that aren't used on a character's turn can be used for defenses and reactions during the rest of the round. Characters often have the option of burning through their Action Points on their turn to try gaining the upper hand, or saving Action Points to defend against a potential counterattack.\nTechniques provide new and interesting ways to approach combat. Usually unwise tactics such as taking on two enemies at once can be made beneficial, while certain niches of play such as demoralizing or exhausting enemies can be empowered with the right techniques. Characters can also use techniques to reflect their physique and personality through the association of their attributes.\nA swift character may utilize their speed to charge into combat for a powerful strike before nimbly escaping. A knowledgeable character may gauge an enemy\u2019s weaknesses and attempt to exploit them. \nA character's choice of weapons is also an important one. There are over 40 weapons to choose from, and each one is designed to be competitive with the others, providing its own set of strengths and weaknesses, as well as a unique ability that sets it apart from its peers.\nCharacters can also utilize supernatural abilities to aid them in combat:\n The Touch allows characters to manifest their imagination as reality, until proven to be nothing more than a fantasy of the mind.\n Blessed Beasts are creatures manifested from the user's own soul, and can protect them or attack their foes.\n Wretched Weapons are murder tools summoned through contracts and deals struck with otherworldly entities. Those who wield them can cause great mayhem and destruction.\nFirstly, we're delivering the completed ruleset and setting of Crescent.

Blood, Sweat & Steel is a Sword & Sorcery/Dark Fantasy tabletop RPG that is built on the Fudge game engine, with some Fate influences as well. This game takes place in what can best be described as a human-centered, barbaric world, largely unexplored, and filled with dark sorcery, strange beasts, and undiscovered ancient secrets. The world is largely uncivilized, and resembles the worlds of Conan the Barbarian, Kull the Conqueror, Dar from The Beastmaster, and Deathstalker, from the movie \"Deathstalker\".\nMy primary goal is to create a sword & sorcery/dark fantasy RPG that is easy to learn, easy to run, and has the quickest resolution possible in order to keep the game moving at an exciting pace. I want to make a game that introduces non-gamers and new gamers to the sword & sorcery and dark fantasy genres.\nThe most unique features of the game include:\n Unified Dice Mechanic - every roll in the game uses the same Fudge/Fate dice roll\n Skill-Based Characters - no classes or professions. PC's generally consist of Attributes, Skills, Qualities, and Talents.\n Simultaneous Actions Resolution - no initiative rolls. Everything happens simultaneously, with the winners of each Exchange taking their action against the losers of each Exchange.\n No Weapon/Armor Stats Or Damage Rolls - Resolution determined from a single opposed roll\n Non-Linear Wound System - no hitpoints or wound track, uses a threshold system\n Freeform Sorcery System - no spell or ritual lists, Characters create whatever spells and rituals they can think of\n Goal-Based Character Development - Characters earn experience points by accomplishing specific Major and Supporting Goals.\n Abstract Economic System - no more accounting and bookkeeping to account for every copper piece.\n Situational Modifiers - Modifiers are designed to be used where they make sense, allowing GM's and groups to have more flexibility in resolving conflicts.\n Robust Combat Tactics - From zone-based movement, to combat stances, to combat maneuvers (like tripping, disarming, tackling, etc.), Players can employ advanced tactics and strategies to tip the scales to their favor.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe layout and editing for this game are complete, so there should be a short gap from Kickstarter completion to publication.

A mysterious creature has moved into the cemetery and murders anyone who dares enter its new hunting grounds. Eyewitness reports say the monster looks like some sort of golem crafted from tombstones and mossy grave markers. A party of confident adventurers have been hired to rid the town of this dangerous pest, a task that should be wrapped up by the afternoon, with a heavy pouch of gold awaiting its completion. Yet, could this be merely a harbinger of greater evils that infest the land? What darksome power might be lurking that threatens the whole of the Northern Kingdoms?\nIn the blackness of night, the laughter of the dead makes cowards of us all.\nThe Adventure\nDawn of the Necromancer is a 5th edition DnD campaign that pits your PCs against a necromancer of unimaginable power. Here\u2019s what you can expect to find\u2026\n Epic Scope: Players begin at 1st level and advance all the way to 20th before the final showdown.\n Adaptable: Easily drops into your own campaign setting, or use the included high fantasy setting of Argomere, a medieval European-style world that worships the gods of the Greek pantheon.\n Sprawling: A sandbox-style adventure with the players traveling between a cosmopolitan city, memorable towns, an ancient necropolis, and other dark destinations.\n Imaginative: Includes something for everyone\u2026amazing new magic items, nightmarish monsters, challenging puzzles, detailed locations, unique NPCs, and most importantly, encounters unlike any you have ever seen!\n Flexible: Each of the 40 major encounters and countless additional adventure hooks can be easily lifted out and used as one-shots or to supplement your current campaign.\n Customizable: All the encounters include advice on how to adjust the difficulty based on the level and abilities of the PCs. A sandbox isn\u2019t fun if everything is under- or overpowered.\n Format: Available in both digital form and a 250-page hardcover book.\nSample Excerpts\nHere are some snippets from the adventure to give you a feel for the content:\nIn Ashgate capital punishment is carried out by the Royal Torpeo, a medusa who petrifies the convicted and then oversees their body being smashed to pieces by those who were wronged as they wield the ceremonial Hammer of Justice.\nThe PCs hear about an annual celebration in the Rookeries called \u201cThe Running of the Gorgons\u201d. Each gorgon has a wreath of solid gold secured to their head that runners can keep if they can snatch it off. The use of magic is prohibited, but difficult to enforce with crafty PCs. Harming the gorgons is prohibited, and festival organizers do not provide resurrection services for the participants, a fact made evident by the \u201cHall of Runners\u201d that displays all the petrified former participants.\n Cobb\u2019s Boots (Wondrous Item, uncommon) While wearing these boots you can flee from danger in a speedy manner known derisively as \u201cCobb\u2019s Traverse.\u201d When moving away from an attacking opponent your speed is doubled (regardless of armor or encumbrance) and you can jump twice the normal distance if it is not further than your movement would allow. When attempting a saving throw against a fear effect you suffer a -2 penalty.\nConstable Marret quote: \u201cI\u2019m glad the council took my advice and brought in some professional help to deal with the situation in the cemetery. I\u2019d take care of it meself if they gave me some deputies and whatnot. And if it weren\u2019t for this bum leg. Or the dropsy. But no matter\u2026as they say, in Darwich justice always prevails!\u201d (The constable is literally the only person who says this.)\n Half-Swording Feat: This feat requires the wielder of a longsword or greatsword to have both hands free. By grasping the blade of the weapon with their free hand the wielder gains the following benefits: 1.) Change the damage type to piercing or bludgeoning. 2.) Gain a +2 bonus on all Shove attacks. 3.) If their opponent is wearing medium or heavy armor, spend a bonus action to exploit weak spots and gain a +2 to hit.\n Favored by the Gods optional rule: Praying at a temple, church, or shrine gives the petitioner Advantage on their next attack or ability check connected to that deity (Ares or Athena for combat, Hercules for a Strength check, and so forth.). Alternatively, the GM might allow the PC to choose when to use this Advantage die.\n\u201cThe Jewel of the North\u201d, Dorias is a powerful kingdom dominated by its magnificent namesake capital city. This ancient, ruin-filled city was also once the capital of the Therosian Empire. The waterfront of the city was prized by the old nobility who began to build out into the Gulf of Adsko, eventually expanding the footprint of the city by over 50% and creating an elaborate system of canals and bridges. Dorians are famed sailors and control many of the waterways in the north. Their merchants range far and wide, making the capital a major trade center. At one time Dorias was home to the mighty Therosian fleets of skyships, but the entire navy was in the air when Hecate\u2019s Storm at the end of the War of Brothers dropped them out of the sky and dashed them all to pieces. Even today, artificers attempt to recapture the lost secrets of the skyships in hopes of creating unimaginable trade possibilities.\nThe Playtest\nThe crazier the encounter, the more important a comprehensive playtest becomes. Dawn of the Necromancer was in playtest over a year to make sure we got the balance just right. Here\u2019s what the playtesters had to say about the adventure:\n\"This campaign is so fun and rewarding because every journey has a pay-off and every action has consequences. Nothing we do is forgotten; everything we do ripples throughout the campaign world. The story is compelling, the lore is very well developed, and the characters are all extremely unique. It's a blast!\" -Josh F.\n\u201cDawn of the Necromancer is as unique as it is fun! I've never experienced an adventure like this. And it's so refreshing to not have the main villain come out of a box like the typical \u2018bad guys\u2019.\u201d -Scott R.\n\u201cVery creative content across the board... world, maps, creatures, antagonists, protagonists, traps, and magic items. Tons of fun.\u201d -Justin F.\n\"As a long-time D&D player (since I was but a lad), I am impressed by the insightful story and fun twists on encounters, each having an aspect that makes them memorable and challenging.\" -Mike N.\n\u201cThe Necromancer is a sexy redhead that will let not rest until she has captured the hearts of the heroes, literally. Loved it!\u201d -Doug S.\n\u201cThis is hands down the best campaign I ever played. Love the encounters, love the mysteries, love the world. The hanging chasm fight was an all-time favorite. Can\u2019t wait to read the book and see all the stuff we screwed up.\u201d -Trevor G.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nDawn of the Necromancer is already written, and several groups spent the last year playtesting all the way through. So, why release through Kickstarter?\nIt\u2019s simple, an adventure this ambitious requires an enormous number of illustrations, maps, and graphics. We could release the book today as-is, but we want it to look as good as it plays. That means adding a lot more artwork!\nThe book is being laid out right now and we will begin commissioning additional artwork as soon as we reach our initial funding goal. We plan to send out the digital copies of the book as soon as it is done (likely mid-summer 2021) and have the hardcover versions available by the end of summer 2021.\nThe hardcover version of the book will be produced by the industry-leading DriveThruRPG Print-On-Demand service, the same service used by Dungeon Master's Guild. The book is expected to clock in at almost 250 pages once complete and will be available in standard hardcover (with \"standard\" color), premium hardcover (with \"premium\" color), or a limited-edition Collector's Edition (also with \"premium color\").\nNow it\u2019s Your Turn to Face the Necromancer\nGo ahead and pledge. We know you\u2019re going to love it. But you don\u2019t have to take our word for it. We\u2019ve included a sample encounter for you to download and play right now to get a feel for what to expect.\nWe\u2019ve also got some stretch goals planned, so please share this project with your friends so we can ensure the absolute best adventure possible.\nBuckle up and let\u2019s roll for initiative!\nVirtual Battle Maps Unlocked!\nAll of our stretch goals have now been unlocked. After reaching our social media sharing stretch goal we added DIGITAL BATTLE MAPS of every major encounter to every pledge level.\nNew Monster Pictures Unlocked!\nWe already had some creature illustrations, but upon hitting our $20,000 stretch goal we added pictures of all new monsters in the adventure. Flavor text can conjure a compelling scene but like they say, a single picture is worth a thousand-word stat block.\nNew Subclasses Unlocked!\nThe most frequent request we have received since launching this project is to include new campaign-specific subclasses. Upon hitting $26,000 we subsequently added three new subclasses to the book.\nThere is a ranger archetype that hunts the most dangerous of prey\u2026that which is already dead. These sworn enemies of the undead are known as Death Hunters. Whether prowling old graveyards alone or patrolling ancient necropoli in small teams, the death hunters have the abilities and training to make short work of any undead they encounter, from lowly skeletons to mighty vampire lords.\nEvery druid understands the natural cycle of life and death that governs the breadth of existence. The all-consuming undead are an existential threat to this balance and it is the druids of the Circle of Life who seek to restore order to the world around them. Druids of this circle can compel nature itself to rise up against the undying scourge.\nLast, but certainly not least, we meet the Necroficer subclass for wizards. A cross between a necromancer and artificer, necroficers don\u2019t create better undead, they slowly transform themselves into powerful undead\u2026one body part at a time. This isn\u2019t simply combining Dr. Frankenstein with his monster, these spellcasters use necromantic body horror to gain supernatural powers. Learn exactly how dangerous that makes them, inside the pages of Dawn of the Necromancer.\nPicture the NPCs\nDawn of the Necromancer features dozens of major NPCs, and thanks to reaching our $35,000 stretch goal, we're going to have portraits of ALL of them. Let's meet one right now: Indara Blackfin, a resident of Highport who figured out a way to be where the people are, with the help of a custom magic item.\nMagic Item Pictures\nReaching $45,000 allowed us to unlock artwork of all the new  magic items in the campaign. From powerful artifacts to relatively  mundane objects, many of the magic items exact some sort of  price from their owners.\nOne example of a magical item found in Dawn of the Necromancer is the Hat of Whimsy. A jester\u2019s hat that borrows inspiration from the Wand of Wonder,  activating the hat randomly confers temporary, yet powerful  enchantments upon its wearer ranging from transformation into a demigod,  toddler, flying monkey, or even stranger effects. Does the potential  reward outweigh the risks?\nAnother magic item that might be encountered is the Golem Hammer. Just what in Zeus\u2019 name does a Golem Hammer do exactly? It might not be what you expect!\nVTT Tokens & Player Handouts\nNow that we hit $51,000 we will create Virtual Tabletop tokens for all of the new monsters and major NPCs in the campaign. These images will be added to the same zipped folder as the virtual battle maps.\nIn addition, all backers will also receive digital copies of all of the player handouts and assets they need to GM the campaign: isolated pictures of the NPCs, monsters, magic items, locations, maps, et al. No more holding up the book and trying to hide stat blocks while showing what a monster looks like. We want to provide you with every imaginable piece of information and digital art to make your adventure prep as simple as possible.\nShare the Adventure\nRemember, there\u2019s one sure way to unlock this stretch goal and a bunch of other cool ones we have planned\u2026share the project! The fate of Argomere is in your hands.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- The book is already written, so there are few risks to you receiving exactly what you pledge for.\n\n- Keep in mind that all the artwork used in this Kickstarter campaign and the current version of the book (even the cover art) is preliminary and may change/improve depending on the final funding and stretch goals. \n\n- Once the book is finalized we will send backers a link to the digital version (hosted by DriveThruRPG) immediately. We will simultaneously submit the hardcover versions to the printer, but it will likely take a month for the printer to run the book through their pre-media checks and print proof copies. Once everything checks out we will order the physical hardcover books. After the order is placed it is estimated to take approximately three weeks before it arrives on your doorstep (for domestic orders).\n\n- Without knowing the final page count, or what changes will occur with postage rates, we are using the best estimates of shipping/handling costs supplied by the printer.

Featuring diverse alien societies, advanced technology, epic space battles, and a future worth fighting for.\nTangent Space is set within a nascent utopia where the various alien nations of the galaxy try to come together despite their differences. The year 3025 is a great time to live! The core worlds are peaceful and nobody is poor or homeless. The frontier is dangerous and unknown, begging for exploration and adventure. Grand and powerful factions compete for influence on the ever shifting galactic stage. Mysterious precursors have left treasures and warnings for those they deem worthy successors. The universe of Tangent Space is as limitless as our own galaxy!\nTangent Space was designed to be easy to pick up and play, but also provide increasing complexity as you delve deeper into the possibilities. The rules were crafted with science fiction TV shows and movies in mind. Everything takes places within a scene, which is as long a time period as makes dramatic sense. It could be a single combat encounter, or several days traveling through space. The game moves at the speed of plot.\nTangent Space is played using a custom dice-scaling system. Dice get bigger when things are easier, and dice get smaller when things are difficult. Your chances of success shift as circumstances change from one turn to the next. Moments play out as exchanges of actions and reactions rolling against one another. Teamwork is actively encouraged within the mechanics as allies set each other up for success.\nTen playable species are available. Each comes with four different cultural backgrounds that describe their civilization and offer unique advantages. Species and culture are separate, offering a wide variety of interesting combinations to choose from when making your character.\nThere are no classes and no character levels. Instead, it's the 40 skills that gain levels as characters progress in the four skill categories: Martial, Technical, Social, and Psionic. Archetypes are provided as suggestions to help new players get started.\nEquipment is modular, with a flexible crafting and invention system that lets you customize your kit even further. This modular design extends to vehicles and spacecraft,  which use a modified version of the character rules.\nDownload the demo version from itch.io here:\nTangent Space RPG - Demo Version\nTangent Space has been a passion project of mine for my entire adult life. It's grown and developed in ways that actually surprised me, but it's in a place now where I truly believe it's \"Good.\" The mechanics are complete and, aside from balancing tweaks from testing, won't be changing much going forward. What I don't have is all the professional trappings to make the game come to life: Art, editing, and publishing. All these things are very expensive and make the difference between a game that stands out and one that gets swept aside. I'm hoping that through this Kickstarter, you'll be able to hold a finished copy of Tangent Space in your hands and have memorable adventures in this universe.\nThe game book will be completed in two versions: digital and print.\nThe digital version will be an interactive PDF with bookmarks and hyperlinks for quick navigation. A horizontal layout is planned for easier viewing and it will also be formatted to play nice with screen readers.\nThe print version will be available through DriveThruRPG print-on-demand services, formatted to standard 8.5 x 11 page size. Backers will receive a voucher for \"at cost\" printing. This means they will need to pay the printing and shipping costs separately from their pledge. Reward level pricing for the physical tier has been reduced accordingly.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe overall quality of the finished product will depend on how well funded it is. The funding goal is the estimated bare minimum to commission enough art to fill the 400+ pages of the finished book. A picture speaks a thousand words and layout can only do so much to glam up a wall of text. The better this campaign does, the more I can afford to put into the project, such as more detailed artwork for vehicles and alien lifeforms.\n\nThe physical books will be fulfilled using DriveThruRPG print-on-demand services. If this campaign does well enough to attract an actual publisher, I'll consider working with them instead.
