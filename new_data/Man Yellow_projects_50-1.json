You are now a fully fledged adventurer ready to make your name known in all the lands. However, this time, you will go it alone. Farrador is a relatively peaceful region; however, menacing monsters reside in the shadows of even the brightest lights. You are being called to explore abandoned mines, save villages from devastating foes, and claim your name as the next true adventurer. All this and more will be possible as you go Into the Unknown!\nInto the Unknown is a true solo adventure for characters level 1-5 for 5e, B/X, or Swords & Wizardry!\nArtwork by Francesca Frisinelli\nTrue solo modules are just that... solo. These books are designed to be played by a single player using the 5th Edition, B/X, or Swords & Wizardry systems. If you have ever read a Pick-a-Path, Choose Your Own Adventure, or Endless Quest book, you will feel right at home with Into the Unknown. These adventure campaigns are designed in that way where you choose your own fate as you decide where to go and what to do while adventuring through Farrador. You play your character and the monsters or encounters in which he or she explores. Gone are the days of wishing for a group to play with! Now your own fate is in your hands.\nThis book may also be run with one GM and one player. The text will be nearly flawless to play this way; however, the only real difference is the layout of the book does not follow traditional RPG books Pacesetter or other companies use when creating campaigns/modules. It does read like a Choose Your Own Adventure. For example, if you decide to go into the cave mouth, turn to page 23. If you choose to scout around the entrance first, turn to page 24. So on and so forth.\nA quick note from, me, the designer and project manager, Ben Barsh:\nI could not be more excited to bring this book to life. I have worked on many projects in my small career as designer; however, none have hit the nostalgia cord like this one. I began playing 1st Edition in my late middle school years (2011-ish). Other than small games with my father and at conventions, I was not exposed to a true campaign due to lack of a group. This problem was resolved through solo adventures. \nI immediately played through the first three solo modules my father wrote through Pacesetter. I believe I finished adventuring in 2 days (school got in the way). I sprinted downstairs after my final encounter and begged him for more adventure my 3rd level Ranger, Grimlon, could go on. He dusted off his old TSR solo adventures and off I was on my next great adventure.\nHere I am in 2020 having the honor of bringing this module to life. This campaign is truly special to me. I want to thank all of you for visiting this page and potentially backing. You are quite literally making a childhood dream come true.\nArtwork by Raven Evermoor\nThis book will include:\n64+ pages of adventure\nFull color interior (art and maps)\nNew Magic Items\nNew Monsters\nAnd more pending stretch goals!\nThe adventures you go on will take place in Farrador. This is a region of Dagmore (Ben Barsh's world being developed). This campaign is a sandbox solo story. You make your own decisions as you go, and they will lead you down different paths to the conclusion. As you can see by the map below, there are many areas to explore in Dagmore. Pending your decisions, you may even explore all areas!\nCartography by Raven Evermoor\nAdventuring solo is not an ordinary practice for many. It presents a different array of challenges that normal RPGs do not fall victim to. In an effort to quell the fire of uncertainty, Pacesetter has developed our SoloSystem\u2122 that is included in the beginning of every solo module we create. This outlines tips on how to adventure, rules to modify or keep in mind, and recommendations on how to go about mapping, resting, hirelings, experience, death, etc. We also introduce the idea of Adventure Points to help your character overcome great threats!\nYour character will start with a new \u201cstat\u201d called Adventure Points (AP). Your PC will have a number of APs equal to their character level: A second level character will start the game with an AP 2. Each time you gain a level, you add an amount of APs equal to your new level. For example, a second level character starts with AP 2. The adventurer advances to third level and gains 3 APs. If your character had not used any APs, they would now have a total of AP 5. APs are not regenerated by rest. When used, they are gone until you gain more by level advancement.\nAPs are used as a mulligan. If your character failed a specific die roll, they can spend one AP to change the die roll to match the desired/required result. This can be done for saving throws, attack rolls, skill checks, find a secret door, etc. Also, an AP can be used to grant a reroll at any time, such as damage rolls, hit point generation, etc. Furthermore, you can use an AP to alter a described result.\nThese tips and recommendations will be fitted for each game system. For example, experience does not function the same in 5e, B/X, and S&W, so we will have a section specifically designed for teaching you how to reward yourself experience.\n$15 Digital Defender - Single PDF - You will receive a PDF copy of Into the Unknown in 5e, B/X, or S&W.

This is absolutely FREE to all backers at a physical pledge or higher. This can be used while playing so you do not have to flip back and forth between pages or simply put in a frame for you to proudly display for guests!\n$3,000 - Pacesetter Character Sheets - (Unlocked!)\nThis stretch goal is absolutely FREE to all backers who back at least the PDF level. Once we have raised $3,000, we will add our character sheets to the appendix of the book or send them as a separate PDF. The 5th edition sheet was designed by Wonkee (our amazing interior artist and cartographer). They are an amazing addition to any campaign fueled by Pacesetter! The B/X and S&W sheets were designed by our fearless leader Bill Barsh!\nThere will be a separate character sheet for 5th edition, B/X, and S&W.\n$4,000 - More Art! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $4,000, we will add in 2 more interior pieces by the amazingly talented Raven Evermoor! These art pieces will continue to help bring the visual life to the book!\n$5,000 - Character Creation Section - (Unlocked!)\nThis stretch goal is absolutely FREE to all backers who back at least the PDF level. Once we have raised $5,000, we will add character creation charts for your use. These charts will be tailored precisely to the campaign that follows. There will even be recommendations on how to build characters for solo adventure! Your generated character will be ready for the adventure! The following charts will be available for your use: class, race, background, personality traits, flaws, and quirks.\nThere will be a separate character creation section for 5th edition, B/X, and S&W!\n* Note: The listed charts are subject to change before final layout. If you would like to recommend a chart, leave us a comment :) *\n$6,000 - More Art! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $6,000, we will add in 2 more interior pieces by the amazingly talented Raven Evermoor! These art pieces will continue to help bring the visual life to the book!\n$8,000 - New Subclass! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $8,000, we will publish the Elemental Ranger in the book as a new option for you to play! This is a new subclass of ranger that calls upon four of the natural elements of the world: fire, earth, water, and air. You may now use these forces to amplify attacks, defense, or tactical maneuvering.\nThis subclass will function more or less the same in each edition this book is being released for. Obviously the mechanics will be different; however, we will stay true to the original abilities and perks for becoming an Elemental Ranger.\nThe Elemental Ranger is woven into the unique lore of Farrador Keep, a college of sorts for those wishing to become adventurers. This subclass does not specifically given any sort of advantage over other during solo play, but it does give a unique twist that allows you to personalize your ranger more than ever.\nThis subclass will be available for playtest and review before the books are printed as long as there is interest! If there is interest in this, leave us a comment! If there is enough intriguing minds, we will release these early for you to try out!\n$10,000 - More Story! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $10,000, I will write in another story arc for the campaign! As we know, your decisions in pick-a-path/solo adventure style books can take you anywhere. This stretch goal will add in more options of adventure. Think of it like a different branch has been unlocked! This will feature the same color maps and art used in the rest of the book. The adventure will remain levels 1-5, which makes it more re-playable.\n$12,000 - Another New Subclass! (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $12,000, we will publish the Path of the Ruinseeker Barbarian! This new subclass allows barbarians to harness the wild and untapped magic that lies within!\nFor 5th edition, this is quite simple. You will be able to choose Path of the Ruinseeker as your primal path at third level. This subclass will allow you to access the sorcerer spell list, cast spells while raging, and relentlessly cast allowing yourself to exchange physical exhausting for more spell damage (the latter two being unlocked at higher levels).\nFor B/X and Swords & Wizardry, we will be introducing the barbarian class as an option of play. Along with that, you will be able to choose to be the Path of the Ruinseeker. This will function similar in each edition allowing your barbarian to be opened to their primal magical nature. \nThe Path of the Ruinseeker Barbarian is woven into the unique lore of Farrador Keep, a college of sorts for those wishing to become adventurers. This subclass does not specifically given any sort of advantage over other during solo play, but it does give a unique twist that allows you to personalize your barbarian more than ever.\nThis subclass will be available for playtest and review before the books are printed as long as there is interest! If there is interest in this, leave us a comment! If there is enough intriguing minds, we will release these early for you to try out!\nArt by Francesca Frisinelli\n$14,000 - Alternate Ending - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $14,000, I will write in an alternate ending for this story! Since the ending will be relatively similar in each playthrough, I would like to add in another for those who are going to play the module more than once. This will also help keep the sandbox nature of the adventure rather than have the ending be on the railroad tracks (an inevitable feature of many RPG books). This ending will be woven into the fabric of the adventure as to keep the sense of the unknown alive!\n$22,000 - New Dwarf Playable Subrace - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $22,000, we will publish the Bijou Dwarf!\nThis new race of dwarves are close cousins those that reside within mountains. Once a sturdy, formidable people have now turned to the more elegant side of life. They found a wealth of gems and other minerals in their mines, and now they prefer to focus on the finer side of life.\nThe Bijou (bee-zho) are native Dun Bhuldar within Farrador. This makes them an amazing and seamless subrace to bring your adventure to life! They are naturally charismatic and openly welcome the presence of magic within their settlements. They are constantly looking to grow their wealth; however, they still do take care of others as they are constant donors to the less fortunate living within Lakeshire or other villages living in squalor. However, there are few that believe they should join higher societies of humans and elves in other lands.\nArt by Raven Evermoor\n$24,000 - New Finfolk Playable Race - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $24,000, we will publish the Finfolk!\nThe finfolk are a race of humanoid fish-like people that are natives to Starland Bay area in southern Farrador. Their communities are very welcoming and wise people that take in anyone that is in need. Originally, they were coastal settlers; however, some hungered for what the rest of the world had to offer, so they set out to explore what other settlements had to offer. Since then, they have been good neighbors and allies to those residing within Farrador. \nThe finfolk are natural hunters and/or healers. Since their settlements started out in recluse from conventional society, they have had to rely on themselves for survival. They are dexterous and wise, which many account to be the pinnacle of their survival. Being naturally amphibious creatures, they excel in water type scenarios as well.\nArt by Raven Evermoor\n$26,000 - Farrador: A History - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $26,000, the Farrador: A History add-on book will be available!\nThis book will encompass all the known history of Farrador and how this land came to be. It will include extra information on each settlement as well as the history of how it has come to the modern point in time where you are adventuring.\nIt will also include the new classes, subclasses, races, subraces, magic items, and spells that you can encounter during your adventures. This way if you would like to take these new goodies to a different campaign, you can do so without carrying around your copy of Into the Unknown. \nThis book will be a $10 physical add-on and a $5 PDF add-on through Backerkit post-campaign. It is estimated to be a 28 page, full color digest book.\nCover by Dmitry Yakhovsky\nAll digital rewards will be send via email after the Backerkit and production is completed. We will also be sending the PDF through Backerkit and DriveThruRPG! We will notify you by updating the Kickstarter when the emails have been sent.\nWhen the Backerkit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you, will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during Backerkit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged. U.S. shipping cost will be around $5 via media mail. International shipping is charged at cost. If you would like a quote, message us here!\nRetailers: Your shipping is included in your pledge level. You will only need to fill out the Backerkit survey to confirm your e-mail and shipping address. Again, this pledge level is for U.S. retailers only.\nPacesetter Games & Simulations has been producing old school adventures and supplements since 2008. We have produced more than 50 products in print form including several boxed sets. In general we produce content for the world's most famous fantasy RPG system (first and fifth editions as well the BX edition) but also for game systems including Swords & Wizardry, the DCC RPG, and soon Call of Cthulhu. In addition, Pacesetter produces a large line of miniature figures for all of these game systems. We attend several game conventions every year and operate one of the longest-running old school RPG tournaments in the country. Pacesetter has brought back the solo module as well as cross-platform adventures (The Red Queen series).\nBill Barsh has worked in the gaming world since 1978 and produced material for Task Force Games and Hero Games. Bill was a member of the Metro Detroit Gamers beginning in 1977 and assisted with running some the country's largest game conventions throughout the late 70s and early 80s including Origins (when it was held in Detroit). Bill also published the Deck of Many Things magazine throughout that era.\nBen Barsh started working at Pacesetter in 2015 and produced his first KS project, Rise of the Nefarious (a 5e mini-campaign) in 2018. Ben's title at Pacesetter is Operations Manager - that means he is the driving force behind how we get things done. His first major project, Rise of the Nefarious, was resounding success and ran flawlessly. He is also credited for Reaping at River's End and the Book of Beginnings, Pacesetter's most recent 5th edition products.\nFacebook\nWebsite\nTwitter\nInstagram", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any crowdfunding program, there is the risk of being late on delivery. This project is subject to various risks such as supplier failure, production company disruptions, and damages to books during the shipment process. Any and all prevention techniques will be implemented such as constant communication and updates, a strict and organized schedule, and working hard to be ahead of an unforeseeable curve to limit any issues that make come to be. In addition, to mitigate logistical delays we are using a US-based printer.\n\nWe also are aware of the negative impacts COVID-19 has brought to U.S. based businesses. We will continue to monitor the situation and work in accordance with local, state, and national safety procedures. We will work diligently to get ahead of our timeline so if the project is delayed due to COVID-19, we will have some buffer time. \n\nWith all that said, the rough design of this project is complete. We will have the manuscript edited and thoroughly playtested. Stretch goal artwork is either completed or in production. As the Kickstarter moves along, we will be posting sample pictures of the books and their content.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "Our Gratitude", "descp": "No reward but our gratitude for supporting the project.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital Defender - Single PDF", "descp": "You will receive a PDF copy of Into the Unknown in 5e, B/X, or S&W.

You and your crew can pilot breathtaking starships, face down alien horrors, battle evil space wizards, and explore the furthest reaches of the galaxy.\n Get the FREE demo for the Dark Matter Starter Kit and start playing today!\nNew pledge tiers will be unlocked as you meet stretch goals!\nDark Matter is for any player or GM who wants a little more sci-fi at their table. Though it's a full 298-page campaign setting, Dark Matter is designed with flexibility as a top priority: the rules and options in Dark Matter can seamlessly be applied to any 5E campaign from definitely-not-Star-Wars settings to all-inclusive fantasy games.\nConspiracy in the Stars! is a brand-new adventure for Dark Matter! Dive into the seedy underbelly of Port Nomad and unravel its mysteries in this 56-page neo-noir thriller. Designed for characters of 3rd to 5th level.\nThe starter kit contains everything you need to get started playing Dark Matter right away! It contains a full adventure, Conspiracy in the Stars!, pregenerated characters, a GM Screen, Basic Dark Matter rules, dice, battle maps, and more! With this box, you can dip your toes into the sprawling universe of Dark Matter, even if you\u2019ve never played DnD before. Makes a great gift for newbies and RPG veterans alike!\nYou can get the following items by increasing your pledge by the listed amount. At the end of the campaign, you will receive a survey (via the pledge manager BackerKit) asking you to choose which add-ons you want for the extra funds you added.\n(You can also choose add-ons after the campaign, but pledging for add-ons during the campaign helps to unlock more stretch goals.)\nShipping for add-ons will be calculated on the BackerKit pledge manager.  \nHematite Dice from Level Up Dice\nWe\u2019ve partnered with Level Up Dice to make custom, handmade  Kickstarter-exclusive dice made from quality hematite, featuring a unique font and color, available nowhere else!\nDice Vault from Wyrmwood\nWe've also brought Wyrmwood on board for the perfect dice companion: an elegant, luxurious case, custom-engraved with the Dark Matter logo and made from fine wenge wood. These cases are handmade, magnetic Kickstarter-exclusives, and are positively gorgeous. \nCaptain's Log from Rook and Raven\nCompleting the trifecta of perfect RPG companions, we have the Captain's Log from Rook and Raven. We're working with the best notebook company out there to make a custom Dark Matter campaign diary, featuring unique character sheets and pages to immortalize your sci fi campaign.   \nUNLOCKED | This compact bundle comes with essential maps for any starfaring crew: ship interiors for three vessels, as well as a beautiful, asteroid-strewn starmap for space combat, on a fold-out double-sided map. Plus, it comes with 30 1-inch scale ship tokens, so you can play out elaborate space battles with minimal setup, and without an expensive fleet of miniatures. When unlocked, it will be available as a digital + physical add-on for $25.\nUNLOCKED | In this new lighthearted campaign for Dark Matter, you play second-rate mercenaries working for a third-rate mercenary company, Grax\u2019s Guys for Cheap. As part of your contract, you take whatever nonsense oddball jobs come across your desk, and your boss, none other than Grax himself, has more than enough to keep you busy. Each chapter of this campaign functions as a slapstick one-shot, as you are recruited to some new, ridiculous job for yet another unstable client.\nThis campaign comes from the very same writers that brought you Conspiracy in the Stars! When unlocked, it will be available in print-ready PDF as an add-on for $15.\nUNLOCKED | Want even more tokens of the alien beasts and magical constructs from Dark Matter? No problem! This bundle comes with another 40 tokens of alien beasts and baddies, as well as a double-sided, four-page fold-out map that places your characters on the strange alien worlds of the Galactic Frontier.\nUNLOCKED | If you\u2019re accustomed to using high-quality spell cards for every wizard and cleric you play, these cards are a must-have. You can enjoy easy reference for spells, familiars, and ship combat roles, while your GM can keep hazard cards near at hand, in case you fly too close to a star.\nUNLOCKED | In this new campaign, you play a team of mecha pilots for the Lakshay defense force. Fresh out of training, you\u2019re given your first assignment: hunt down one of your own. A legendary Lakshay pilot has turned cloak, going AWOL with his custom prototype frame, a cutting-edge mech of unsurpassed power. It\u2019s your job to hunt him down, and discover what infernal plot is brewing at the center of the Warzone.\nThe most elite Lakshay pilots, called Oni, are recognized only after one hundred confirmed kills. As you battle through the Warzone, you scratch tally marks on your frame, counting up your One Hundred kills, until you achieve the rank of Oni, or die trying.\nThis campaign has an all-star cast of writers on board, and will feature an entire set of rules to make your next 5e game a mecha thrill ride. When unlocked, it will be available in PDF as an add-on for $20.  \nUNLOCKED | This deck of 50 high-quality tarot cards contains beautiful illustrations on one side, and full monster statistics on the other. With this deck at hand, you never need to crack open the Dark Matter book for monsters, NPCs, or mega creatures. When unlocked, will be available as an add-on for $15.\nUNLOCKED | We know that not everyone can meet their regular tabletop group face-to-face at the moment, so if we meet this stretch goal, we\u2019re going to bring Conspiracy in the Stars! (as well as all the other Dark Matter rules that come with it) to a virtual tabletop near you. When unlocked, it will be available as an add-on for $25, which includes high-resolution maps, tokens, and other VTT essentials.

Adventurers who delve within may discover a profusion of odd mosses and fungi, an ancient tomb complex, the lairs of weird, subterranean monsters, and the hide-out of an exiled illusionist. The Incandescent Grottoes is a companion adventure to Gavin's previous scenario, The Hole in the Oak. The two adventures can be played independently of each other or can be connected to form a larger dungeon.\nAbout Gavin: Gavin is the creator of Old-School Essentials, creator of the Dolmenwood campaign setting, and author of critically acclaimed, weird fairy tale-esque adventures (Winter's Daughter, The Hole in the Oak).\n Holy Mountain Shaker, by Luka Rejec [Unlocked \u2014 $70,000]\nBackers will have the option of selecting this adventure as an add-on in the pledge manager at a special, reduced price of $10 (MSRP $15).\nAbout the adventure: The earth shakes. Trees sway like grass before the hungry wind. Again. Chimneys fall like childrens' toys in the streets of Doll Town. Again. The capstone of the tomb of the first folk tumbles and breaks. The divine carp beneath the sacred mountain is angry. The town needs heroes. Brave souls to enter the deep places, the abandoned temples, the lightless waters at the roots of the mountains. Holy fools to appease the wonder fish. Is service to the community not draw enough? The townsfolk wag eyebrows and mutter and complain. Then admit. There are old treasures there, too. Glittery scales of gold and adamant, yes. But also doors to the other worlds, where demons of disease may be banished, whence lost friends may be retrieved from death's dusty grasp.\nAbout Luka: Luka is an artist and writer, probably best known for the ENnie-winning Ultraviolet Grasslands, though he would prefer to be better known for the apocryphal adventures of Pointyhelmet and Poncho.\n Isle of the Plangent Mage, by Donn Stroud [Unlocked \u2014 $80,000]\nBackers will have the option of selecting this adventure as an add-on in the pledge manager at a special, reduced price of $10 (MSRP $15).\nAbout the adventure: Isle of the Plangent Mage takes players to multiple locations above and below the ocean. Areas worth exploring include a hidden cove, an old rickety lighthouse, a small fishing village, a weird island, and a mysterious lair that plunges the to depths of the underwater world. Ultrasonic magics, strange aural puzzles, monstrosities from the deep, suspicious villagers, and beached whales all stand between discovering the truth behind the dealings and the demise of the Plangent Mage.\nAbout Donn: Donn began his public gaming persona when he concocted and launched (with co-host Adam Muszkiewicz) Drink Spin Run: The RPG Talkshow Podcast. After talking to RPG writers, designers, and other creatives, he decided to move from podcasting to writing and publishing his own material. \nFree PDF: Spell Trackers [Unlocked \u2014 $110,000]\nWe\u2019ll produce a PDF with four spell trackers \u2014 one for each type of spells (cleric, druid, illusionist, magic-user) \u2014 allowing players to easily keep track of the spells their character has memorized.

Gavin has driven the Old-School Essentials project since its inception, and is the mastermind behind the writing, layout, and art direction. Gavin's adventure Winter's Daughter was nominated for two ENnie awards in 2019.\n Donn Stroud: Co-host of the infamous Drink, Spin, Run podcast. Donn's adventure Dead Planet won an ENnie in 2019 and his adventure A Pound of Flesh won another ENnie in 2020.\n Luka Rejec: Luka's magnum opus psychedelic metal campaign setting, The Ultraviolet Grasslands, won two ENnie awards in 2020.\n Diogo Nogueira: Renowned creator of the platinum selling old-school RPGs Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells and Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells (along with many, many other games!).\n Frederick M\u00fcnch: The coding maestro behind the Old-School Essentials SRD and generator website!\n Peter Mullen: Revered for his fantastically imaginative work on the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG and many other old-school games, Peter's paintings grace the front of the Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome and Referee's Tome! \n Andrew Walter: Beloved creator of the wondrous covers of the Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy game, two new pieces by Andrew are featured on the collector's edition Player's Tome and Referee's Tome.\n Stefan Poag: Esteemed creator of weird and wonderful fantasy art, including many pieces for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Metamorphosis Alpha, and many others.

We're renowned for our communicative and open development process, so you can be sure of receiving a steady stream of updates as the project progresses.\n\nThe risks involved in this project are low. The text of the Advanced Fantasy books is 100% finished. The layout is done. The cover art is done. About 50% of the interior illustrations are in place. All that remains, development-wise, is for the artists to get working on the final illustrations, to be slotted into the layout.\n\nWe've previously worked (on very large projects!) with the printer who'll be manufacturing the books, so their professionalism and commitment to high quality are known factors. They do excellent work, fast and don't bat an eyelid when we tell them we need to print 30,000 books.\n\nAs for the stretch goals, we've been careful to not get carried away adding loads of extra content which could risk decimating the project timelines. The physical upgrades to the books don't entail any additional development time (they just cost extra!). The adventure scenarios obviously require additional print production but this work has already been factored into the planned shipping dates, so the risk is minimal. The authors, illustrators, editors, and layout folks involved are all professionals whom we've worked with before and can rely on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental

In order for those items to show as fulfilled the tracking numbers had to be manually uploaded into Backerkit.  This was done once all of the items had been shipped and most of them already received by backers. Those notifications had not been pushed through at that time from Backerkit to the backers because all of the shipments had already been recieved.
