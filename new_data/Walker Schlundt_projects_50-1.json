Note that the Ant-Man and Wasp Stretch Goals can only be found in the standard retail Core Box.\nWe will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel United: X-Men Core Box (however many copies you get) and it is estimated to deliver around September 2021, about the same time as the Core Box goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the box of Stretch Goals and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around May 2022. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledg.it Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated May 2022 delivery date.\nPlease take note that once the system launches they'll also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline. After the deadline to confirm the Expedited shipment pledges, all pledges (and extra pledges) containing the First Wave Core Box will be locked and will no longer be editable. However, everything related to the Second Wave will be editable up until the Second Wave deadline. This means that backers that confirm a 2-Wave Expedited Shipping order will still be able to add/remove pledges/add-ons related to the Second Wave after the First Wave deadline.\nNote: 2-Wave Expedited Shipping will not be available to backers in the UK.\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our Pledg.it pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Mutant pledge, for a 1 or 2-wave shipment. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                          \u00a9 2021 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 48th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2022, for single wave pledges, and for Expedited Shipment pledges, September 2021 and May 2022 for wave 1 and 2 respectively, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

It is NOT an option for the '# or more Pins!' tier choices, and is only available as an add-on or by itself.\nHard enamel pins are decorative art pins that can be worn or otherwise displayed. They have raised metal lines forming the 'line art' and the recessed sections between the lines are filled with colorful hard enamel.  Then the whole thing is polished smooth!\nAn example of a pin I previously designed, the Kitty Reaper\nAbove you can see the front, side and back of the Kitty Reaper, a pin I designed and had produced last year!  The back of the pins have pointed posts with rubber clutches to hold the pins in place when worn. \nPins I have designed worn on a jacket, a lanyard and a small backpack\nPeople wear pins on jackets, bags, lanyards and other articles of clothing.  Some people prefer to display their collections in shadow boxes or on cork boards.\nI also like to put them on my dice bags!\nSeries 1\nIn January 2020 after my wife and I had our third child I was taking the night shifts with the new little one so that my wife could try to get some rest.  Most nights I had a sleeping newborn cradled in one arm and a sketchbook within reach of the other. Magic was happening between 2 AM and 5 AM and I ended up designing little black cats dressed as all 13 5e classes, plus a DM. \nI ran a Kickstarter to turn them into hard enamel pins and it grew well beyond my wildest dreams!  Over 1,100 people backed that project.  I ended up with 25 pin designs and nearly 15.000 individual pins produced in total!\nThe Series 1 designs in the green box will be available as add-ons in BackerKit when you are filling out your backer survey after the campaign is finished.\nSeries 2\nThis year I created all new designs for each of the classes and the Game Master!  I also switched the genders from what I did last year, so if a class was male last year, it is female this year. (You can choose to see whatever gender you like in the designs, as cats tend to look like cats regardless, but in my mind the pointy hands and feet are the girls, and the rounded hands and feet are the boys.)\nI may also have a few additional design surprises in store depending on how well this campaign does. \ud83d\ude09\nBut perhaps you had something more specific in mind? \nFor those with more specific taste, at the Custom Kitty reward tier I will work with you to design a Custom Kitty and have it produced as hard enamel pins.  Once they have been produced you will receive twenty-five (25) pins of your choice from this Series 2 campaign.  Get 25 of your Custom Kitty or swap some out for other pins from this project, it is all up to you!\nI, Joshua Pinkas, will retain all rights to the resulting design and will be able to sell and distribute additional pins or any other derivative work in perpetuity.  \nCustom Kitties doesn't have to play by the 'rules'.  While it could be inspired by a DnD player class it doesn't have to be.  Maybe a brightly colored witchdoctor is more up your alley, or perhaps a two headed ogre kitty!  If it generally can fit under the banner of the Fantasy genre it is fair game!\nThe resulting design will be similar in size and style to the other designs in this campaign and will also become selectable as a reward for other backers of this campaign.\nNo nudity, lewdness, gore, or obviously offense concepts will be allowed.  I reserve the right to refund your pledge in full and cease work on the custom kitty if for some reason we are unable to come to an agreement on the final design.\nIf you pledge at this tier and want pins in addition to the 25 described above please add an additional $8 US per pin you would like.\nI designed these awesome pins, but it is expensive to have them all produced as pins. Think of Kickstarter as a place for you to pre-order these pins to help me fund production.  It also helps me understand which designs are more popular than others.\nYou pledge money to this campaign, then when the campaign is over Kickstarter collects the money from you and gives it to me.  I will then send you a survey through a tool called BackerKit to find out which designs you want, and where I should ship them.  I then use the money to pay my production partner to make the pins.  Then when I receive the completed pins form my production partner I inspect them for quality, package them up and ship them out to you!\nIt will take several months for all of that to happen (especially for larger projects like I hope this one will be), but at the end of it we have brought something awesome into the world that didn't exist before, and I cannot do it without your support!\nThank you for helping me in my creative journey!\nBecause of the logistics involved with running a project such as this we have built in what we believe is a reasonable cushion time to handle any unforeseen complications.  If all goes well and we don't need the cushion time we will be shipping the pins out as early as we are able.  Having said that we greatly appreciate your understanding and support as we work to deliver you the highest quality we can.   \n My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC.

Many of my previous designs are available for sale through my online shop, frostdragondesigns.com.\nAll of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers.\nI love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives.\nEvery pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time.

Over the decades, the tone, content and form of the stories told have evolved; shaped by the times in which they were created. As we carve out our corner of the setting, we strive to pay homage to the past, while being responsible in the present. To that end, we worked closely with a Native American history and cultural consultant who lives and works in his Native community. Under his guidance, we designed Native American survivor characters who stand against the undead hordes, and we ultimately chose not to portray Native Americans as zombies in the game. These characters will be revealed as the campaign progresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Dead West pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline.

These cards provide keywords to spark your imagination and example phrases for their use. Written by novelists and organized by dungeon-masters, the cards are designed for quick on-the-fly use and inherently add randomization. The list of monster parts uniquely depicted include, but are not limited to, the following:\n Horns\n   Teeth\n   Claws\n   Protrusions\n   Bodily Forms (Hides, Ears, Eyes, etc.)\n   Tails\n   Wings\n   Tentacles \nBetween great heroes and great monsters lies the pinnacle of drama \u2014 Combat. The unrelenting tension that comes with knowing blood will be spilled, and life may be lost. Monster Description Cards will guide you while you detail these moments, providing keywords and examples for horns that PIERCE, claws that SLASH, tails that BLUDGEON, and more. Hundreds of new ways to describe monster strikes in these familiar categories: \nSlashing\nPiercing\nBlunt\n\nWhat happens when a monster is cornered, heavily injured, or both? What if the creature is smart enough to be deceitful, spiteful, or vindictive in its last moments? How can you subtly share that your monster is on its last legs, but there is still a worrisome hint of malice in their eyes? These questions are all answered by the LAST STAND section of the cards. Where examples help illustrate the response of creatures facing overwhelming odds and perhaps displaying heroism, sacrifice, or wickedness of their own.\n\n\n \u201cWRITERS OF ALL LEVELS LOVE THE IMPACTFUL NARRATIVE EXPERIENCES DESCRIPTION CARDS ADD TO THEIR WORKS\u201d \nThere are common composition principles that ask writers to \"show and not tell .\" That is, allow the reader to experience the story through actions, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's summarization and cliches. The Monster Description Cards reinforces this principle by providing keywords to spark the imagination and elegant examples chock-full of distinctive story-building concepts.\n\"Cliche Busting Cards\"\nThere are three cliche busting writer's tools within the Monster Description Cards.\n\n 1. Above all else, the \"core descriptions\" provide brilliant creature concepts. They share unique ways to introduce or explain distinct physical features to an audience. These \"core descriptions\" allow writers to stay far away from monsters, terms, phrases, or even ideas that are now unoriginal and thoroughly overused.\n   2. The second tool in the deck is the Combat Sections. These areas focus on drawing an audience into the sheer violence of monstrous combat, exploring unsettling concepts like great height and length, great strength, even preternatural abilities. They touch on the tension that lingers with the threat of a hero's death. These cards collect these concepts and inherently randomize them for writers to literally draw inspiration.\n   3. The LAST STAND is a fresh and new idea for our card tools. Whether you write horror, sci-fi, or fantasy fiction, your creatures and oddities will need to be compelling and memorable, particularly in their last moments. The LAST STAND helps by offering depictions of your monstrosities on the verge of defeat while adding a bit of doubt in the reader's mind with one last defiant moment.\n  AS A STORYTELLER, HAVING A MEMORABLE ANTAGONIST IS A KEY INGREDIENT TO SUCCESS. SO JOIN US! WE BELIEVE YOU WILL LOVE THESE CARDS.\nFor GameMasters (In-game Play)\nThe cards will melt right into your game, and your players will think you are brilliant. They will provide idea after idea on improving monster encounters. But more importantly, they will also drive you to new, full-blown campaign ideas. The type of campaign that players will reminisce about for years to come. The Monster Description Cards archive these feats by offering up concepts over statistical modeled stat-blocks. The cards narrate one-of-a-kind characteristics that you can easily add to existing monsters, creatures, or oddities. \n\nIntroduce extraordinary creatures to your players, giving them clear signs of why they might be unique, even among their kin. \n\nImprove combat by focusing on the right adjectives associated with the body part landing the blow, such as claws, tails, or fangs. Not only are there specific narrations for specific body parts, but they are also broken down by blunt strikes, slashing strikes, and piercing strikes. With these multiple combinations, you can keep your combat fresh game after game. \n\nLastly, there are always moments in the game where a GM would like to subtly provide hope to their players by indicating the monster is nearing defeat. These epic final moments are depicted in the LAST STAND sections of the Monster Description Cards.\nWriting advice on worldbuilding typically leads towards lists of 'rules' and 'tips' which are either too general to be useful or downright wrong. The Monster Description Cards instead provide concepts and implementations of ideas capable of driving your imagination to discoveries about the world you want to create. Alongside the Magic Description Cards, the Monster Description Cards can immerse you in creative ideas and concepts that are anything but clich\u00e9.\n\nIF YOU'RE A GM, THIS IS AN EASY BUY, BUY, BUY DECISION.\n\nFamiliars and Animal Companions: Your Familiars and Animal Companions are cool as hell. Let me make them sound cool as hell. Select a few cards that match the combat style of your familiar or animal companion and hand them to the Gamemaster to describe their attacks with style. Critical hits made by your Familiars or Animal Companion should be magnificent, and these cards provide that strike description that can be so satisfying. You can even have a LAST STAND card ready for your Familiars or Animal Companion just if things come down to that. Moreover, the cards' descriptions can be the basis of the unique features that make your Familiar or Animal Companion distinctively yours. So let\u2019s build something special with these cards.\n\nShapeshifting: In tabletop RPGs, there are thousands of classes/powers/feats/spells that can shapeshift or grow body parts into lethal weapons. Thousands more transform hands to claws, teeth to fangs, arms to tentacles or growing tails, bony protrusions, even wings. Each of these wonderful transformations can benefit from the Monster Description Cards. The Cards will instantly make these transforms unique and unforgettable with clever depictions, separating your character's ability from the crowd of other characters with similar capabilities or sometimes the exact same class ability, power, feats, or spells.\n\nUsing the cards to depict transform spells: Using the Monster description cards to verbally illustrate the results of magical effects that modify a character's body is more than just a way to be unique; it's how you build a legacy. Stylize your character's abilities with these cards, so they are recognized by others, respected, or even feared.\n\nMonster Journal Entries: Commemorate the monsters you've encountered by inserting Monster Description Cards in your monster journal. Flip through cards of unique descriptions to depict the memorable battles along your character's journey. Each card is your personal trophy, a memento of your battle-scars from the most challenging encounters. You can even use these cards to log essential information about certain monsters in your campaign, making every entry a result of your character's meticulous observations during battle. Sing the song better than any bard could with these encounter-defining descriptions. \nBuild a strong visual library with the entire series of description cards from Conflict Games. The entire Description Cards line can be used as a database for ideas, concepts, events, environments, and fight scenes. Not only do these cards bring new ideas to concept art, but the combat styles and descriptions therein can help portray your creation in a way that works and sells a room on the idea.\n\nDuring the Concept art process, Game Design, and Film writing, an artist and designer often craft creative assets like anomalies, monsters, characters, and fight scenes that heavily influence the final work. Our Descriptions Cards have been used during this process for great success. If the goal is to provide realistically visualize ideas for VFX teams, animators, and modelers, then the Magic, Combat, and now Monster Description Cards can be an innovative way to help and become key part of your process.\nUnlike our previous description cards, these cards are double-sided and chock-full of goodness.\nBackers will receive: \n200+ Descriptions and introductions of various monster components\n  300+ Combat descriptions sorted by monster appendage\n  100+ \u201cLast Stand\u201d descriptions, for portraying monsters that are heavily damaged vengeful, desperate, or relentless\n  Printed on heavy card stock (350 gms)\n  Large Format Card (tarot sized cards)\n \nSize: 2.75'' x 4.75'' (70mm x 120mm)\n  Over 100 total cards, including stretch goals\nEach card is organized under the following general categories:\n Horns & Frills\u2014Horns are hard permanent outgrowths, often curved and pointed and typically found in pairs. Frills are upward-curving bony plates typically extending behind the skull.\n\n Fangs & Maws \u2014The Fangs category is considered the mouths, jaws, teeth, and maws of large, small, or odd creatures.\n   Claws & Pincers\u2014The claws category consists of pincers, paws, talons, and hooks. That is, any style of sharp, usually slender, and curved nail at the end of hands and feet.\n   Protrusions & Osteoderms\u2014This category consists of bony deposits that form knots above scales. Protrusions regularly produce sharp structures that can be used offensively, or widen scales and plates that add to the defenses of a monster.\n Bodily Forms\u2014Creature hides, eyes, noses, ears, or other physical oddities that might distinguish a creature from its nightmarish kin are the focus of this group.\n   Tails\u2014The hindmost part of a monster, such as the flexible extension of the backbone in a vertebrate. Tails can be used to whip, constrict, or trip an opponent.\n   Wings\u2014This category focuses on wings of all shapes and sizes, functional or non-functional: Elliptical wings, high-speed wings, long soaring wings, and more. For the cards combat backside, wings will batter with winds, slice with sharp edges, and stab with spiked ends for a unique description style.\n   Tentacles\u2014The tentacles cards help depict any elongated, boneless, flexible organs, limbs, antenna, or barbels of famed monsters.\nPotentially more to come with stretch goals, so please back and share this project.\n\nOne the backside of the cards are Combat Description for the associating Monster part. The cards are divided into three suits, which correspond to the three common attack types of Blunt, Slashing, and Piercing.\n \n\nWe understand that there are a multitude of genres, points-of-views, worlds, rulesets, and games that writers and tabletop gamers choose. That\u2019s why our writing philosophy dictates the following rules which will ensure our content is system-agnosit, narrative Neutral and friendly to writers at all levels of expertise:\n We don\u2019t describe the person perceiving the monster.\n   We don\u2019t give names to monsters.\n   We don\u2019t mention blood specifically, but generalizations like \u201cfluid\u201d are occasionally used .\n   We don\u2019t describe the surface the monster is on.\n   Nothing cheesy, corny, or racy will be accepted.\n   Both Heroes and Antagonists should be cool, so let\u2019s make them sound cool!\n  System Neutral: The card descriptions are not tied to any tabletop ruleset or Genre, meaning they can be used to describe monsters in any of your favorite tabletop-rpgs. If you run multiple games in multiple systems, these cards are great to use in any and all of your games.\nThe cards will help you answer question like these:\nIn a sea of zombies, what if you need one to stand out?\n  In a world of dragons what makes this dragon different? Special? Memorable?\nAnime is all about unique characters and ability, so why not use the cards to create singularity among a crowded field?\nREWARD SUMMARY\nPLEDGE LEVELS\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add an add-on to your Kickstarter pledge, follow these steps:\n1. Press the Manage Your Pledge Button. (If you have not pledged yet it will say Back this Project.) \n2. Increase your pledge in the Pledge Amount box by the total of the add-ons you want to add.\n3. Do not change the tier you are currently pledged at, unless you also want to change it while you are on this screen. You will then need to add the total of your add-ons onto the amount of the new tier you chose. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so that you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned, and customizations when applicable.\n\nVoice Overs in the App: As mentioned in this Backer Update, The app contains over 200 Voice overs performed by Classically Trained Voice Actors.  You can hear a few examples below.\nNote: Only the Monster Description Cards included \u2191\u2191\n\nAll Cards Included + Voice Overs\nVoice Over Examples:\n\n\n\nMany of the above add-ons are from Previous Kickstarters.

If we do hit these goals, each and every backer benefits! Here are a few, not all, of the initial stretch goals.\nUnlocked!\nA protective coating will be placed over each and every card to help guard them against spills, rough handling, and those who regularly have gooey fingers (you know who you are). Your investment will be much better protected with this card coating! We will also increase the density of the paper used in the cards from 250 to 350 gsm. What does that mean? An improvement to the density will increase the appearance of the printing and make the card stock even more substantial and harder to damage. That's right, this reward is both protective and appealing!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\n\nEmail Mark with any ideas\n\n\nWe've been especially fortunate to find some great partners with whom to collaborate. In December, we will finalize any product design changes as dedicated by stretch goals and backer feedback. Going into January, we will focus our writing and editing teams on completing the product content. The cards will be produced in China by mid-February. By the end of February, decks and accessories will go on freight to U.S. soil. We will prepare the orders, and the very first batch of deck boxes will be ready to ship to the priority shipping backers by the end of March. By the end of April, we will start to fulfill other orders with physical rewards to our domestic backers, then international backers. \nWe will share updates to the estimated schedule via the Kickstarter update page.

BackerKit is the world's most trusted post-crowdfunding platform and we are proud to have them aboard. \nShipping in the USA will be included. International shipping will be between $15 and $25 dollars based on the number of items in your order.

Fortunately, this is our 5th Kickstarter under the Conflict Games LLC brand and we have consulted on over 20 others. The Monster Description Card Deck is a fairly straightforward product. However, the foreseen risks involved include shipping logistics and the unexpected cancellation of contracted artists, writers, editors or product manufacturers. In the case of contract cancellation, the contractor will need to be replaced. Which in turn, could delay the project's completion but shouldn\u2019t prevent its completion. \n\nIn regard to shipping, logistics could become burdensome. We are unable to control the fact that domestic and out-of-the-US shipping costs seem to be spiraling out of control. However with our target funding goal, we don't foresee this preventing the project from succeeding; although, it may impact delivery dates. \n\nThe one guarantee we can make is that we will be transparent with issues and communicate them to our backers as quickly as we can. We strongly believe our target funding goal is sufficient to complete our vision for the product. \n\nIf you're as excited about this card deck as we are, then help us exceed that goal - we have much more we wish to do for this card series. This is just the first step in an exciting journey so please JOIN US!\n\nPlease Note: The final design of the Monster Description Cards deck and stretch goals may vary as many of the graphics above are digitally produced. Examples of this include, rounded card corners vs squared corners and raised lettering vs flat ink on the final packaging.\n\n\nRequired Attribution Text\nThanks to:\nsolid platonic solids by Dank By Design from the Noun Project\nDeath by rayhan maulana rikzan from the Noun Project\nrating by Flatart from the Noun Project\ndigital by Eucalyp from the Noun Project\nstretch by KEN MURRAY from the Noun Project\nShipping by Gregor Cresnar from the Noun Project\nbooks by Yeong Rong Kim from the Noun Project\nD20 by Lonnie Tapscott from the Noun Project\nCards by Henry Ryder from the Noun Project\ntwo by Laura Reeny from the Noun Project\nfall by Rendra Tri Kusuma from the Noun Project\nUnicorn by Lazar Nikolic from the Noun Project\nStory by Lars Meiertoberens from the Noun Project\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you kind Sir or Madam!", "descp": "You will receive project updates & Mark M.

However, some of the best descriptions are longer than others. This may be a problem for physical cards, but not for the digital products. Therefore, we will be doing another round of selection to ensure only the cream of the crop gets printed. At the same time, we did not want to shortchange you guys on the creative efforts because of trivial physical limitations. Therefore, we have also decided that all 880 descriptions will be published on the Digital products (i.e., API, app, and writer's grid).

However, I have been extraordinarily particular about the descriptions that make the final cut. In my mind, they must be good \u2014all of them.  For that reason, our writing room has created a ton of descriptions, and to guarantee high-quality creativity, we also have many rejections, edits, and rewrites. Each of these steps has gone slower than I anticipated.  I may add writers to the project, but I believe the best solution to the delay is to simply keep writing.

I'm a designer, calligrapher, and illustrator following my dreams of creating a line of joyous products for my shop. This is not my first enamel pin design but it is my first Kickstarter, and I'm so excited to share these designs with you!\nDon't worry \u2013 you won't be charged for your pledge unless the campaign meets its initial goal! \n\n\u2728 THE DESIGNS \u2728\nVintage postage and brightly colored designs are a couple of my favorite things! After the success of my Anemone Postage Stamp enamel pin, I had an idea to create a series of hard enamel pins that feature the sun and moon, incorporating them into a classic postage stamp design. \nThere are five total pin designs planned in this collection! The initial goal will unlock the first design, and each additional design will be unlocked if stretch goals are achieved. Limited edition and collector prints are available for certain pledge levels.\n\nALL PIN DESIGNS ARE NOW UNLOCKED! \n\n\n\u2728 BONUS GOODIES \u2728\nThree options for bonus goodies are available for this project!\n Limited edition 5\" x 7\" print: a full-color print of the original set of 4 pin designs! Printed digitally printed on acid-free, archival paper with an eggshell textured finish.\n Signed + Numbered Foil Prints: choose from a collector's edition 5\" x 7\" print of the original set of 4 pin designs in full color with gold foil accents, or gold foil on acid-free black paper. See below for a photo of these gorgeous prints!\nThese are available at certain pledge levels or as add-ons!\nLeft: Full color print with gold foil accents. Right: Gold foil print on black paper.\n\n\u2728 ADD-ONS \u2728\nAdd-ons are now available for the campaign! Now you can add extra pins to your pledge without changing your pledge amount (or losing your early bird status)!\n\nANEMONE POSTAGE STAMP PINS\nI'm also offering my Anemone Postage Stamps (photo below) as an add-on for those who are interested! These will be offered at the $10 campaign price, which is $1 off my Etsy shop listing. Woohoo, discounts!\nThis pin is my original postage stamp design (the one that started it all) and will match the other pins in size and shape. It's a great way to round off the collection, especially if you're pledging for all 5 pins!\nPOSTAGE STAMP STICKERS\nNow that all stretch goals have been unlocked, STICKERS to coordinate with the pin designs are available as an add-on (photo below)! These will be offered at a discounted price before they're listed in my Etsy shop at their regular price. Designs are already being produced and I'll have them in-hand at the beginning of December!\n\n\u2728 TIMELINE \u2728\nNovember 1st-December 1st: Kickstarter is live and pledging is open! Once the Kickstarter ends, a survey will go out to ask which pin designs you'd like as rewards.\nDecember-January: Pin production begins! Average production time is between 30-45 days, but depends on the final quantity.\nFebruary: Rewards will be shipped! All packages will be shipped via USPS First Class or Priority Mail, which include tracking information.\nNOTE: These dates are estimates and may change, but I'll keep backers updated if any delays occur!\n\n\u2728 SHIPPING \u2728\nDomestic (US) backers: All packages will be shipped via USPS First Class or Priority Mail, which include tracking information.\nInternational backers: Good news, international shipping is now open! \nPackages will be shipped via USPS with tracking.\nYou are responsible for paying customs fees, import taxes, service fees, and any duties that your country charges.\nTracking may not update once the package leaves the US, but don't panic! Tracking should update when the package arrives in your country.\nDue to COVID-19, shipping delays may occur. If your country is not accepting mail from the US during this time, please pledge responsibly \u2013 I can't be held liable for any delays in rewards due to international shipping, customs, etc.\n\n\u2728 OTHER DETAILS \u2728\nWant to follow me? You can find me on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest \u2013 though I'm definitely most active on Instagram! \nPins will be made in North America with all other packaging/shipping materials proudly supporting small businesses in the USA.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEnamel pins are created in a factory and are made by hand, so there is always a possibility that large orders can be delayed, some colors may look different, and errors may occur. Current and final colors may look different in person than they do on your screen due to screen/monitor calibrations. Some details may be altered during the design process as well \u2013 that's to ensure we get the best enamel fill possible!\n\nOnly collector-quality pins will be shipped as rewards. Any seconds/B-grade/C-grade pins will be available for sale in my Etsy shop.\n\nShipping via USPS is the most affordable option for shipping pins but has its limitations, including delays, failure to scan the package at each post office destination, and other delays due to COVID-19. Patience is key! :)\n\nAnd of course, if there are any delays at all during production/manufacturing, backers will be updated!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "1 Pin", "descp": "Choose one (1) pin from the unlocked pin designs!

It's now the time to see what lies hidden and reveal the ship's final days.\"\n The basic idea behind Trip 1907 (second edition), is to provide an enhanced game play by limiting the webpage usage, and focus on the hardcopy. In this version the webpage is only for submitting the chapters answers and receiving puzzle hints.\nThe main differences between Trip 1907 Interactive Escape the Book Game and Trip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails are on the game experience. The new version does not need logging into the website. The passcodes are there to save your progress as well as the sanity system is now embedded inside the book.

Other than this we have collaborated with dozens of Kickstarters during these last two years. Providing models all round to community members in some of the most popular campaign offered in Digital on Kickstarter. \n\nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. All Stretch Goals have also been completed, but need to be tested and will be available shortly after that. \n\nDIGITAL MEDIA: We strive to produce models that will print with as little support and parts as possible. Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled. \n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com \n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce. \n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round. \n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible. \n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print. All the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk. \n\nAll the files have been checked using Netfab, this means that PrusaSlicer should have no problems slicing these files. Many of the files are also tested using PrusaSlicer. \n\nAll accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models, also known as Daily Bonus or Free Models are given freely, under no obligation, as is and as a gift and don't form part of the campaign or responsibilities associated with this. \n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user. \n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how. \n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they may not be an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary. \n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nDigital distribution, no impact to the environment", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Super Backer and Add-on", "descp": "Help us by contributing and following this project.

Due to the popularity of the Dungeon Mats and Walls, it was important for us to find a way to bundle them in at a hefty discount, so we did just that!\nDiscounted rates: All add-ons are at least 20-25% off the retail rates!

Each theme will consist of 15 bases ideal for fantasy miniatures and printed at home on your own 3d printer.\nMy name is Casper and I am the designer behind BasicAid. I am a wargamer and miniature hobbyist through 25 years. For many years basing was the thing I liked the least about the hobby. The miniature was done, why would I bother with something extra like the base? Fast forward several years, and I have learned how important a great base is for a great miniature. The base really sets the scene and mood for the mini you used countless hours on.\nWell, why not have great bases in no time? That was my thought, and that is why I have chosen to release the bases I have designed. These bases are designed to be easy to print, and easy to place miniatures on while still being as epic and detailed as possible to really set the mood for your miniature. \nSo, let\u2019s dive into the themes and see what it's all about!\nI play Malifaux a lot, and I play Ressurectionists among other factions, so a Victorian graveyard was on the plate. There is ofcourse loads of tombstones, but also vines, roots and roses are growing all over the place, as I wanted it with a feeling of neglect. The place is holding the dead, and therefore shouldn\u2019t look too new. You will also find such things as a shallow grave being covered with dirt, Victorian lampposts and crucifixes. If I could add a low hanging mist to these bases I would, but that\u2019s the image I have in my mind, with the light from the lampposts seeping through and shadows moving just out of sight.\n5 examples from the Graveyard. Click the image for more renders\nA mosaic for every base, an image that I find well suited for all those awesome factions inspired by the far east out there. Whether you play as Yakuza, Ten Thunders, New Tokyo or some other far east inspired faction these will add so much atmosphere to your setting. This set, as the only one, is without further assets, but are solely focused on the mosaics. This is intentional and to avoid cluttering the base, as the base should set the stage and support the miniature, and with mosaics on all of them, I think a good balance was struck. \n5 examples from the Asian Temple. Click the image for more renders\nIn my mind I imagined some dusty, cluttered laboratory or floor in a wizards tower. Books, scrolls and runes should be all over the place. Reading spaces, experimental vials, potions and flask are of course also a big part of the scenery. I love the thought of elementals, summoned demons as well as wizards, sorcerors, conjurers and every other school of magic could reside on these bases. Good times in the raids of World of Warcraft in Kharazhan was just behind my eyes, while designing these spaces. Explore the cover of the different books, and you might be inspired to what magic user or bound creature should fit that particular base.\n5 examples from the Wizard Lab theme. Click the images for more.\nI really like the story behind this set. A major human settlement has fallen, are you placing the villain or the hero on the base? Do you choose a kobold, a skaven or an orc on top of the debris crying out their victory at the end of the sack? Or will it be the knight, the paladin, the adventurer exploring the ruins, retaking the settlement from evil? You will find leftovers in the ruins, and I hope it will inspire you to new adventures.\n5 examples from the Ruins theme. Click the image for more renders\nAmong one of my favourite races in RPGs and Warhammer when I was introduced to fantasy books and games at the age of ten, this race needed some awesome custom bases. As both Druuchi and Drow alike are very slave centric cultures, I chose to center the feel around chains, manacles and other uncomfortable stuff to lock up all the nice people that they raid. Runes for dark elves are pointy in my mind, like so many other\u2019s, and the floors are plenty decorated to give just that feel.\n5 examples from the Dark Elf theme in 30, 40 and 50 mm sizes\nIt could be Arakoa, Gryphkin, harpies, phoenixes or some other fantasy race or model with an avian feel you place here. In my mind, these are intelligent beings set in a civilized environment with pavements, art, statues and mosaics. I have tried to bring forward a sense of pride in their heritage or a cultural feel, where their own civilization is at the center. Feathers are abound, along with symbols of wings, birds, nests and eggs in different sizes and statues revering the avian forms. I hope you get the same feel.\n5 examples from the Skyhall theme in 30, 40 and 50 mm sizes\nThe Norse theme is as a dane close to my heart, so real runes and and runestones with a twist of fantasy has been my main inspiration for these bases. As most fantasy Dwarf lore is based on a lot of Viking art as well, the bases will also fit dwarves and even Space wolves for Warhammer 40k perfectly and so will any other miniatures in a cold setting.\n5 examples from the Norse theme. Click the picture for more.\nThat's the previews of the 7 themes. During the campaign, you will see spotlights on each theme, and there you can read more of the background behind the design, as well as see renders of every single base in that theme. \n\nAs a backer of lots of other campaigns, I love stretchgoals and how I keep checking on where we're at during a campaign, so I planned alot of very cool stuff for you guys! Here you can see into the future as we hopefully make this Kickstarter as full of content as possible!\nAll above are unlocked!\nAll the above are unlocked!\nFree Halloween gift for all backers!\nA special Halloween gift from BasicAid to all of you :) click the image for more info\n\nFREE GIFTS FROM THE 3DPRINTINGPRO!\nAs I have mentioned, I have collaborated with Greg Kourakos aka 3Dprintingpro on his Kickstarter:  Pit Fighter, Blood on the Sands and there are 4 scenic bases there made by me as a gift for backers, if you haven't already seen them. Now Greg has been so kind as to give all backers here, one of his fighters to you guys, whether you back his campaign or not! So as a free gift to all backers of my campaign, you get the Barbarian Queen!\nHere she is painted by the master of the cartoon style: Epic Duck Studios\nA wonderfull sculpt by RN Estudio who is among some of the best out there\nActually it was her who inspired me to my Gates of Valhalla base, and because of that, she will be bundled with the scenic base I made for her, so not only will all backers get this awesome sculpt thanks to the charity of Greg, you will also get this:\nOk I know that technically the gates of Valhalla should accomodate several hundreds of warriors marching abreast, but it's a sidegate, ok... :P\nHere they are together just like the base was made for her ;) (it's bluetack under her feet, not a fail)\nPrinted on Phrozen Sonic Mini, Elegoo ABS-like grey.\nMERCHANTS: the Barbarian Queen and Gates of Valhalla are both off limits, and NOT a part of the license, unless you are a merchant of both this Campaign and Pit Fighter: Blood in the Sands.\n\nFree gift from Mythic Miniatures!\nAs another gift I got a fine terrain set from Mythic Miniatures for you. These guys focus on modular terrain and really take it to a new level. See here how you can use these parts one by one or all together :D\nThey are live with their own campaign right now. Give it a look :)\nAs a gift these are EXCLUDED from merchant license and provided for all backers of \"all about the base\" and upwards (ie. not for solo theme backers).\n\n\nCollector pledge:\nOn top of the \"It's all about the base\", you will also get a pack of assets for you to change up your bases. The pack is from the start full of more than 30  different assets that fit one or more of the themes from this kickstarter. This pack will be increased as part of this campaign as we break through the stretchgoals! (50+ assets now due to stretchgoals)\nIt's more than fifty assets now thanks to the stretchgoals unlocked by the supporters, click the image to read more about added assets\n\n\nMerchant pledge:\nIf you want to sell physical prints of the files you will need a merchant license \u2013 see the Merchant pledge level. The license runs for just over a year from the 1st of December 2020 until the 31st of December 2021. You can print and sell as many copies as you like in that period, but you have no further rights to the digital files, which may not be sold, shared, loaned or in any other way made available for anyone else than you. After the period expires, you are welcome to contact me regarding an individual extension.\nBe aware the license is for 3D printing. Casting, making molds of and any other manufacturing proces other than 3D printing the files is not a part of the merchant license.\n\nDesigner pledge:\nWe will be part of the design proces together for a whole new set! You will inspire and set the overall tone for a set of bases I will make. You get to be part of the design of 3-5 bases depending on their size. You get to decide whether it's circle, square, oval or even hexagonal bases, if that's what you like. You will be the first to receive the bases you're part of, and when the rest of the set of at least 10 bases, are ready for release, you will also get that. You will also be mentioned as co-designer on the set.\nWill you ask for? sci-fi? Jungle? Egyptian? Something I haven't imagined yet? I look forward to the inspiration and ideas you bring.\n\nConcept:\nBasicAid delivers STL. files for bases. This means that after the kickstarter have ended, you will receive the files for which you have pledged and will be ready to print straight away without supports in most cases, see the print guide for more information. The pledges will be fullfilled via MiniHoarder.com who will ensure reliable and safe transfers of your files. \nEach set consists of seven 30 mm bases, five 40 mm bases and three 50 mm bases. If you need some other size, the bases can be rescaled in your go-to slicer before you print, though you should take one of the bases closest in size to the size you are rescaling to. Be aware that some details are so fine, that scaling down might tamper with the level of detail. The bases are designed with 28-32 mm scale miniatures in mind.\nDuring the campaign I will add a spotlight for every theme, so you can see closeups of the different bases for each theme along with more painted examples. Watch the update section.\n\nPrint guide:\nI testprint each and every base in this kickstarter before you get them. I printed them all on a Phrozen sonic mini and below you will find my settings in the screenshot, be aware that every printer is different, and that these are just my setting. I printed in Elegoo ABS like grey resin.\nMy Chitubox settings\nAs a hobbyist myself I know the value of getting pressupported items for your printer, and I have designed most of the bases in a way, that you can print them perfectly, directly on the plate. I did not want my ideas constrained by only making things to print supportless, so if the design needed it to be right, I did what I think looks the best. So some of the bases need support, and those supports are already included. So you don\u2019t need to do anything but add the files to your slicer and go print.\nNOTE, the supported versions are chitubox files.\nHere is a great guide from 3Dprintingpro to printing bases perfectly and easily on the plate. \nGreg from 3Dprintingpro is a friend and we have collaborated on his kickstarter: Pit Fighter: Blood on the sands, where I have made 4 custom, scenic bases for the backers there.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe themes presented here are 90 % done.

Although brave and determined, adventurers are only human! They are prone to the madness and pain the twisted dwellers of the dungeons will inflict upon them. Death can occur, but is not the worst fate: heroes can be driven mad and beyond help!\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nThe game is played in campaigns of 11 missions. To reach the Darkest Dungeon itself, players will undertake 3 missions per threat level and vanquish the boss. Then, they will be strong enough to face the horrors of the Darkest Dungeon! They may emerge victorious... if they dispatch the source of evil that plagues the land.\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nFor each hero, select 3 skills out of 7 before heading into your mission (and level the heroes up to gain access to more skills). In each room, pick the most suitable stance to best resolve the conflict! Then, on each turn, a player chooses two of the available actions of moving, interacting with the environment, changing their stance or using a skill (if eligible for their current stance). Triumph over encounters, resist rampant madness and emerge victorious before throwing yourself into another battle. Between missions, spend your time in the hamlet, visiting various buildings to find relief from the physical and mental trauma you\u2019ve just endured. Restore the hamlet to its former glory and it will reward you and help you to fulfill the ultimate goal.\nRPG-like heroes  \u2013 A robust level up system with a ton of customization for unique playable characters.\nStressful Affliction System \u2013 Heroes' personalities are paramount!

Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 and Reichbusters: Projekt Vril have been delivered. Super Fantasy Brawl is going to complete fulfillment by the end of the month. Solomon Kane, a big scope project, is at the printer and will be delivered in two waves. In specific wave 1 is in mass production now and the wave 2 moulds are also now being produced. Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters: East Quest has been printed and is going to ship this month. Steamwatchers is on track and will go to production soon, to make the March fulfilment. HEL: The Last Saga is currently in development.\n\nFor all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates on Kickstarter and on Gamefound (for our late pledgers) You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Discord, learn our news and project updates through our weekly Newscast and ask all your questions in our Q&A with Leo on YouTube every Wednesday evening.\n\nPlease note that the components, component counts, quality and rules, are all work in progress and subject to change.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur experience in our previous KS has shown us that there can be variances in terms of timing and remaining in schedule when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\nAt the same time there are also the unpredictable factors; recently it was the Coronavirus outbreak, but there can be others such as weather conditions, strikes and others.\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is October 2021, but please bear in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nShipping\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available.\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card.

Relax while enjoying this elegant game of picking and potting herbs. Pot the best collection of herbs in your different containers, but don\u2019t wait too long or your friend might grab them first.       \nA Tiny Edition for Travel\nHerbaceous Pocket is the same great game in an even smaller package. Herbaceous is a simple to learn, push your luck, set collection game. \n Smooth, streamlined rounds make Herbaceous a fast-moving, engaging game of picking and sharing herbs.\n The Pocket Edition is complete with all cards, dividers, and rules included. Visual adjustments were made to maximize clarity of the smaller size cards.  \nSteve Finn (Dr. Finn's Games) - renowned designer of Biblios and The Butterfly Garden - has created a wonderful compliment to Beth Sobel's stunning herb art. Eduardo Baraf is at the helm of Herbaceous Pocket to ensure it delivers Herbaceous' perfect balance of simple play, interesting moments, and wonderful art in a fantastic, tiny, package.   \n Keith Matejka (Thunderworks Games) - designer of Bullfrogs, Roll Player, and Skulk Hollow - created the additional rules for solo play, loved for its easy, rapid play.  \nHerbaceous is Zee Garcia's #1 relaxing game (and Mike Disilio's #4). The new, great way to experience Herbaceous with a cup of tea.  \n\n\nThe pocket edition of the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion includes Cinnamon, Star Anise, and Peppercorn and adds a little extra spice to Herbaceous' flavorful play. \nAll Kickstarter backers who pledge for Herbaceous Pocket Edition will also receive the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion for Free. This expansion will be available for sale typically for $5 separately on BGG, at Conventions, the PFG Store, etc. It will not be packaged within the base game.     \nMy Mother Gives an Overview of How to Play the original Herbaceous - she has the prototype from our first KS.\nRodney Smith from Watch It Played teaches Herbaceous .

We set out to make a perfect, pocket, edition of the classic game. Aside from size, card and component quality is in line with the original game.\n\n\n\nPFG worked with various partners to find a cost effective way to ship a single copy of Herbaceous: Pocket Edition internationally. Unfortunately, in a padded envelope, it is just a smidge too thick for international letter shipping. Therefore it is basically the same cost of shipping a small game (and there are a lot of additional shipping fees these days). \nHowever, since it is so small / light, it doesn't cost more to ship 2 or 3 copies in the same box. If you are outside of the US, I highly recommend buying the double or triple pack to split with a friend or give it as a gift.

Think of it like an escape room you can do at home! In this game you're searching for hidden clues and puzzles in beautifully created notes from an alchemists' apprentice. \nMysteries of Alchemy : Collector's Edition\nThe notes are sent to you by James, the butler of late Bram van Amstel, one of the first professional treasure hunters from the previous century. Try to unravel the puzzles and clues to find the treasure! You can play alone or with friends. You might be really surprised when you finally find the treasure and see what it is.\n\nWHAT'S INSIDE\nMysteries of Alchemy exists on a number of papers (a4 size) containing the notes from an alchemists' apprentice. In the picture below you see an overview of some of the papers. Extra papers will be in the game but we are keeping them a surprise for now. \nOverview of some of the papers\nOne of the puzzles called Tabula\nOne of the puzzles called Distillation (SPOILER FREE IMAGE)\n\nHOW TO PLAY\nPlay solo or work together as a group. Each separate puzzle takes approximately 15 minutes or up depending on the previous experience of the player. \nAge 14+\n1 to 4 treasure hunters\n Appr. 90 to 120+ minutes \n\nThe puzzles are a variety of different kind of puzzles and no outside knowledge is needed to solve the puzzles.\nStep 1: Transform the room into one that is an alchemy lab from ancient times (optional)\nStep 2: Make sure you have some snacks and drinks\nStep 3: Open the envelope\nStep 4: Study Little John's notes and try to find and solve all puzzles\nStep 5: Check the separate solutions on the game's website\nStep 6: Celebrate your successful treasure hunt\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\nFor those who already played and found The VOC Treasure, the name Bram van Amstel should ring a bell. For those who don't know Bram van Amstel, he was a very successful treasure hunter in the 20th century. A few years ago he passed away as an old man. In his last years he continued his treasure hunts from his home by doing lots of research in books, documents and online. He was an old man and traveling was impossible but he kept on researching and gathered lots of information about treasures yet to be found. \nIn his will he stated that all heirs would not receive any money from his inheritance. Instead Bram's butler James is going to send you unsolved treasure hunts. James started shipping The VOC Treasure last year and very soon he will send you the Mysteries of Alchemy.\n\nMaking Of\nTop: Aging papers with tea and coffee - Middle: Printed on hand pressed paper - Bottom: Drying aged papers\nThe last treasure hunt called The VOC Treasure had some unique items like a wooden box, a glass wine bottle and a fabric sea map and more. To match the same level, Mysteries of Alchemy is also made from quality materials and the production process is a mix from old and new techniques. \n\nThese are the steps for creating this game:\nstep 1: Research in archives looking for inspiration\nstep 2: Choose the books and pages which can be used for puzzles\nstep 3: Create the puzzles\nstep 4: Draw the pages by hand on normal A4 paper\nstep 5: Scan the pages and adjust them with Photoshop\nstep 6: Print the pages on hand pressed paper\nstep 7: Manually age the hand pressed papers\nStep 8: Drying the manually aged papers\nstep 9: Scan the manually aged hand pressed papers\nstep 10: Send the scans for beta testing\nstep 11: Adjust puzzles and redo step 4 to step 10\nMysteries of Alchemy : Collector's Edition will be printed on hand pressed paper and all pages from each Collector's Edition will be aged manually.\nPicture taken in a Dutch city tower called Sassenpoort\nFor those who love the looks of the game but can't or don't want to pay the price for the Collector's Edition there are two other options:\n Option 1: A digital game existing of scanned pages from the Collector's Edition in .pdf format. To make home printing easier (and cheaper) I'll include a .pdf version of the game on a white background as well.\n Option 2: Mystery of Alchemy existing of scanned pages from the Collector's Edition, printed on 200-250 grams uncoated paper\nMysteries of Alchemy - (option 1, the Standard Edition)\n\nSTORY\nThis is a story of a teenage boy named John Kleyne or as his fellow alchemy students would call him Little John. \nAs alchemists' apprentices one of the many things they were trying to discover was chrysopoeia, the art of turning base metals into nobel metals like gold. This process symbolically indicates the creation of the philosophers' stone.\nOne by one the students had interesting discoveries. But once a student told the alchemist about his discovery this student would disappear. At first it didn't seem alarming to the other the students but in the following months, other students would just simply vanish in thin air, after they made a discovery.\nWeeks went by before another student made a great discovery and he shared it immediately with the alchemist. It was a joyful moment in the middle of a wet and rainy week. Later that night, John had to clean some things and walked around the shed which the apprentices used for sleeping. It was still pouring rain when he heard some cracking sound coming from the woods. Over a couple of months the neighbourhood had some problems with wolves, so John hid himself behind a pile of chopped wood. He peeked through a hole between some larger logs and he was surprised to see the alchemist sneaking out of the woods holding a shovel. John thought to himself how strange it was and started thinking about the missing students from earlier that year. His curiosity took over and he waited five minutes after the alchemist entered his house before John cautiously followed the trail of wet and muddy footsteps into the wood. John had always been afraid of this dark and mysterious place but some strange force from within kept him going. Totally wet, he suddenly arrived at a open circle in the wood. Stones were placed in a circle and in the middle of the circle he found something that looked like a freshly dug grave....\n\nTreasure - John knew immediately that he wouldn't be safe if he shared his discovery with the alchemist. Earlier that week he was getting more and more close to creating something really valuable. It was only a matter of days before John would discovered the complete and correct process of (***** spoiler alert).\nAbraham, his best friend among the students always told him stories about treasures maps with clues, puzzles and immense hidden treasures. What if hid his discovery in his notes like some kind of a treasure map and never tell the alchemist...?\nHe reached over to get the last book. It was just out of his reach so he leaned over a bit more. The ladder made some strange and dangerous noises when he almost lost his balance. His index finger hooked behind the top of the book when he slipped. The book fell down and with an acrobatic move Bram prevented himself from falling. Hanging onto the ladder he saw some old looking papers dropping out of the book on the ground. \"Really, are those the papers I was looking for....?\"\n\nBeta Test and Review\nSome of the leading people in the At Home Mystery industry helped to create this game by beta testing the puzzles. Due to the Corona Pandemic Zoom and Skype are used for long distance contact. For beta testing zoom and Skype were really handy. I got to experience people playing the game and hear them thinking out loud when trying to solve the puzzles. This process helpt me with fine tuning the game.\nBETA TESTERS\n Rita Orlov - PostCurious (The Tale Of Ord & The Emerald Flame)\n Errol Elumir -  Invers Genius (Podcast Room Escape Divas & Cryptex Hunt\n Michelle Rundbaken - Society of Curiosities (Mysterious Map Heist & Mystery Subscription Box)\n Yacine Merzouk - Society of Curiosities (Mysterious Map Heist & Mystery Subscription Box)\n Chris Waters - Constructed Adventures (Numerous Tailored Treasure Hunts & Constructed Adventures Youtube Channel)\n Stephen Lockyer - Escapage (Flatpak, Arrival, Escape The Compound, Vica Versa, Miracle '47 and Prisoner 7)\nJillian Raymond\nTop Left: Chris Waters from Constructed Adventures - Top Right: Michelle Rundbaken and Yacine Merzouk from Society Of Curiosities - Bottom Left: Jachin Letwory the creator from Mysteries of Alchemy - Bottom Right: Errol Elumir from Room Escape Divas and Inverse Genius. *note, the beta testers had individual with Jachin\nREVIEWS\nMichelle Rundbaken - Society of Curiosities \n\"The papers look so authentic and we loved that the puzzles were firmly rooted in alchemy manuscripts.

A hearty set of 10 vibrant and fun hard enamel pins expressing every board game addict's most commonly used sayings and little inside jokes!\nI'm Michelle, I am a designer who married a board gamer, and this pin set is the result. \nIf you missed part one, scroll down to the bottom to see pictures from the previous mega set of board gamer pins. If you're a previous backer, welcome back! To thank you all for your patience, I am just going to come out and give all returning backers 1 free pin! Check the FAQ for more info and thanks for coming back!\nThank you for backing this campaign!\nBy backing this campaign, you get:\nTo be FIRST to get your hands on these pins, before they're available for sale to anyone else\nAccess to these major bundle discounts (including a free pin for returning backers) that won't be matched after the campaign\nFree stickers included with your rewards!\n Free Bonus stretch goals! (scroll down for more info) \nPins that aren't funded during this campaign won't exist later, so thank you for giving these pins a chance!\n(Give this gif a minute to load for maximum shininess!)\nThe Pins:\nThe main funding goal of $400 covers this first tier \"All These Board Games\" pin AND Sticker Sheet. Each additional $400 raised after that funds and unlocks another pin that you will be able to pick as a reward!\n\n\nEach of these pins will be made with :\n Black Nickel metal plating\n 2 pinbacks with clear rubber clutches to eliminate spinning and keep your pin secure\nWhite, grays, and a color pop of these playful, bright colors (except for the first pin, which gets ALL the colors!) These were designed with pantone colors to ensure accuracy in manufacturing, but please note that all screens display colors a little differently. (If you bought the first set, the colors will match, plus two new colors added for this set)\nHard Enamel\nIf you're familiar with the last set of pins, these pins are all the same size as the \"board gamer\" pin, except \"All these board games\", which is a little big taller.\nThe preview images you see on this page are mockup renderings! While the real pins will be shiny and pretty, of course nothing in real life can be as perfectly flat and glossy as a digital rendering (nor can they stand up magically on their own). For a realistic idea of how the final pins will look, please see some actual photographs of the first kickstarter set at the bottom of this page.\nFREEBIE Game-Weight Stickers:\n5 stickers will be unlocked alongside the pins in the campaign and included for FREE according to your reward level! They will be sturdy, glossy stickers, 2.5 in. tall, on heavy duty vinyl. \n\nSticker Sheet:\nThis 5x7 inch sticker sheet is unlocked from the get-go and includes sticker versions of all of the 10 pin designs. These individual stickers are ~1.5 in. tall, the same size as their pin brethren. (You'll also be able to add these to your reward later in the survey if you want.)\nEdit: I realize I left out the sticker sheet as a listed item in the top tier $85 10 pin reward slot but listed it in the description. I cannot edit the reward now that the campaign is running, but just to be clear, backers of this 10-pin reward tier WILL get the sticker sheet AND all 5 game weight stickers!\n\nBonus Stretch Goal Freebies!\nYou have all gone above and beyond what I expected for this kickstarter, so here\u2019s more FREE STUFF!! Magnets are free to ALL pin backers (everyone who has backed for at least 1 pin reward) and will automatically be added to your reward. Keychains are free and automatically added to all backers of AT LEAST 6 pins. If we get all the way to $9000, everyone who has backed at least 1 pin will get a free embroidered patch! These are cumulative, so if we make it to $9000 you\u2019ll get all of these extra stretch goal items for which you are eligible!\nAll of these extra stretch goals that we unlock will be available as ADD-ONS in the backerkit survey, so even if you backed for the sticker-only rewards and aren\u2019t eligible to get a keychain for free, you can still get one for $10 USD plus shipping (or a patch or magnet for $5 USD) and shipped with your other rewards.\nA flexible magnet perfect for your refrigerator or other magnetic surface! \n\nSlightly smaller than the pins themselves (so it won\u2019t be too clunky if it\u2019s on your keys).\nSame width as the \u201call these board games\u201d magnet.\n\nI do not have a realistic looking preview of how this patch will look when embroidered with thread, so you\u2019ll have to use your imagination. It may look slightly different than this mock up, as the edges will be sewn, but I\u2019m confident it\u2019s going to end up looking hella cool. It will include 11 colors of thread and I\u2019m very excited to see it!\nAdd-Ons\nI get lots of questions about add-ons (which you can also read about in the FAQ) but here's some basic info to help familiarize you with what you can do to get more stuff in addition to your pledged campaign reward, that'll be shipped at the same time as your pledge reward.\nYou can either wait for the backerkit survey after the campaign to purchase these items, or you may want to add the extra amount to your pledge NOW in your campaign pledge manager. That way you'll get charged the extra amount at the same time as you are charged for your main kickstarter pledge and the credit will be waiting for you so you can select extra pins and stickers in the backerkit survey and not be charged a second time. This will also avoid any extra transaction fees from a second transaction.\nCool, so some of the things you'll be able to add-on:\nThe previous campaign's 15 pin set \"Board Game Genres\" will all be available to purchase for $11 USD per pin\nThe previous campaign's 2.5 in. stickers (ask me about my kallax, first player, rules lawyer, less AP more VP) will be available for $3 USD per sticker\nThe previous campaign's sticker sheet of 15 game genre stickers will be available for $5 USD per sheet\nTHIS CAMPAIGN's freebie game weight stickers will be available for $3 USD per sticker\nTHIS CAMPAIGN's sticker sheet will be available for $5 USD per sheet\nMy \"Dragon's D20\" enamel pin (view on my site if you're curious!)\nAll additional unlocked Stretch Goal items from this campaign (keychains for $10 USD, magnets for $5 USD, and patch for $5 USD)\n\nTimeline\nAll of the design files have been finalized and approved and quoted by my manufacturing partner, who brought the last gorgeous set to life. Here's how I expect the next few months to go, barring any additional craziness in the world:\nOctober: This campaign will be live\nNovember: Surveys sent out\nMid-November: Funds received, pins and stickers begin manufacturing\nJanuary: Completed pins and stickers shipped to me and I begin checking them for quality and packaging them up for you\nLate January-February: Rewards sent out!\n(A note on international shipping: I am planning to use USPS First Class International Package service to save you all some cash, but it may take the pins weeks longer to reach you. During the last campaign, some people had significant postal system and customs delays. So, while you should expect between 7-21 days, there may be delays beyond this time frame. If you are an international backer and would like faster shipping, you can ADD $12 USD to your pledge, and I will ship your package USPS Priority, which should arrive in about a week. This option will also be available in the backerkit.)\nFunding Breakdown\nOf the initial $400 funding goal - covering the \"All These Board Games\" pin and sticker sheet - the budget breaks down as follows:\n70% Manufacturing costs for pins and stickers\n20% Shipping costs\n5-10% Kickstarter Fees\nThe FINAL first set of board gamer pins from the first kickstarter\nThe FINAL first set of board gamer pins and stickers from the first kickstarter\nThe best way to be sure that your favorite pin gets unlocked is to share this campaign with all of your board game night regulars! You can find posts to share on my instagram and twitter pages @polliadesign (and also a lot of other sketches, dice, and fun designs, if you feel like browsing!)\nThank you so much for supporting this campaign, these pins can't make it off the sketchbook page without each and every one of you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n*Backers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply once the packages are out of my hands.

Because of this, we want to put all our energy into achieving the mass production of the game in the most simple and efficient way. That being said, we would rather not add any more goals to this project, besides, we are more than satisfied with Flora as it is right now!\nTo answer this, we need to explain first why we need funds. As you may now have figured out, this project is a dream for us, and as so we were willing to invest all we could to make it a reality. We invested not only two years of meetings and testing time, but also funds in the design, illustrations, video, sampling, and campaign. But the biggest roadblock we had was when we found out we needed $25000 to pay the manufacturers, print, and ship our game so it arrives on your shelf. If we reach our goal, we will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of the first edition of Flora. As you can see from our campaign, samples of the game have already been produced and designs are complete. Apart from design improvements in some game components, we have our manufacturers lined up and ready to go.\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter Boardgame community when we as individuals started backing projects and saw how we quickly became more than backers, we became a part of the project. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the game, first-in-line knowledge, insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 95% complete, we don't believe this is the least bit likely, and you can rest assured that we have been working for more than six months to keep this from happening.\nWe commit to communicate every step and update accordingly and have open communications to answer any questions or doubts about timing.\n\nRefund policy\n\nWe can make a refund within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, Kickstarter and payment processing fees included. After that, we still have a \u201cno questions asked\u201d refund policy, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days).

This campaign will help give even more! \nWelcome to a delightful realm of beautiful gardens, vibrant flowers, and eye-catching scenery. Take up your spade and hone your finest gardening skills by crafting and nurturing the most majestic display of natural beauty, much to the envy of your neighbors over the wall.

In summary, game-play for Flourish is as follows: each turn, you will begin with 6 cards in your hand. Choose 1 card to play into your own garden and 2 cards to pass over the walls of your garden to your neighbors, who simultaneously play their own cards into their gardens. Once all players have played and passed, all players reveal their played card, add the passed cards from their neighbors to their hands, and draw a new card from the deck. Players will place twelve cards total in their garden, scoring its beauty both by the points on their own cards and their neighbors! Clever passing of cards and shrewd placement each season will ensure your garden is the most beautiful in the realm.\nRules May Change for Final Copy\nRules May Change for Final Copy\nClick here for the full GameTyrant Review of Flourish!\nCheck Out The 360\u00ba View of Flourish Here!\nShipping, Customs, and Brokerage Fees\nShipping and taxes will be charged in our pledge manager after the campaign.\nWe try to use local shipping facilities where possible to keep shipping costs reasonable.

In the first volume, you find a message from Mary:\nBeneath Mary\u2019s letter you\u2019ll discover a treasure trove of gorgeous hand-written documents, 2D and 3D jigsaw puzzles, mysterious objects and artifacts, and devious challenges. Prove your worth by studying the documents, constructing the jigsaws, and solving the puzzles... and you\u2019ll be treated to a heartbreaking story that culminates in a shocking reimagining of the truth behind Mary Shelley\u2019s famous novel.\nCombining the best of escape rooms, board games, and immersive theater, Mother of Frankenstein is a 10-15 hour cooperative gaming experience for between 1 and 6 players, ages 13 and up. Mother of Frankenstein was designed to be as welcoming and fun for newbies as it is rewarding for experts, combining the narrative complexity of a good novel with the physicality and challenge of a puzzle-filled escape room. Throw in a couple of clue-strewn jigsaw puzzles, and our game truly has something for everyone!\nOur final stretch(es)!\nStretchy!\nMother of Frankenstein is divided into three volumes. Volume 1 concerns Mary\u2019s teenage years and her education by her iconoclastic father. Players must complete three assignments\u2014poetry, music, and astronomy\u2014each of which is presented in the form of a puzzle. Simultaneously, Mary embarks on a love affair with the dashing (but married) poet Percy Shelley. The course of their courtship is laid out over 15 love letters, though players must read closely to determine the order of events!\nIn Volume 2, the venue changes to Germany, and Castle Frankenstein, where a fancy ball is being thrown on a balmy night in 1814. Players begin by constructing a 300-piece jigsaw puzzle of the castle\u2019s floorplan, then use it\u2014along with gossip rags, billiard hall schedules, and original drawings by comic book artist Liana Kangas\u2014to track the events of the evening.\nFinally, in Volume 3, you\u2019ll construct an epic 3D puzzle of Castle Frankenstein and descend into the secret laboratory hidden therein, where you\u2019ll discover what Mary learned under the tutelage of the famous alchemist who called the place home, and how it inspired her to write what many call the first science fiction novel, Frankenstein. \nWhen our heroes tweet, we screencap.\nThe Standard Edition of Mother of Frankenstein contains the following: \n The Ultimate Edition adds our special printing of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, featuring original art by comic book artist Liana Kangas (which has its own reward tier, if you just feel like a re-read!), as well as a ton of other fancy stuff.

Adventure gaming at its best!\u201d Jeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\"If 7th Continent was the journey, then 7th Citadel is the destination. This is a great evolution of the game mechanics.

Controlled by a mysterious individual, these elongated worms tirelessly dig underground tunnels, causing swathes of territory to sink into the bowels of the earth. \nAfter years of helplessness, the Protectorate finally found a defense against this scourge in the Necrodruids \u2013 men and women who rejected the sacred principles of the Druidic Order to draw upon blood and forbidden incantations. The Necrodruids used their blood rituals to create monstrous plant-creatures capable of combating the Burrowers.\nIn the Citadels, the Necrodruids\u2019 power centers, YOU grow and tend to the abominations developed within, whose seeds are then spread all over the world to protect the territory against the Burrowers. Working as a slave-gardener, you wish that a fatal accident or death by exhaustion would relieve you of your endless toil.\nThe world has clearly changed since the days of your forefathers. The Collapsing Lands are choked in gloom and dust belched up by the Burrowers. The horrific plant-creatures that were created to protect you have spread, sometimes out of control, and are now just as much of a threat to humanity as the Burrowers.\nOn a cold morning bathed in pale light, you awaken for another long day of hard labor in the sacred grove, unaware that this will be your last day at the Citadel and that the course of history is about to change...\n\nSolo or cooperative game for up to 4 players.\n30 seconds to set up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure per Threat.\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where you are the hero!\nNo die rolls: the more energy you spend, the more you increase your chances of success, but the faster you burn out!\nLive a different adventure every time; there are countless surprises and the game remembers your choices!\nEarn new skills, unlock bonuses, construct buildings: your decisions determine your path. Choose your destiny!\nIn The 7th Citadel, you face a Threat which will inevitably come down on you (unless you perish before you get there!).\nEach Threat comes in the form of a booklet with several scenarios that follow one another, until the final scenario where you either win the game or succumb to the Threat.\nUnlike most board games, you will experience an adventure over time, but rest assured, a simple save system allows you to pause your game at any time to resume it later.\nYou are a slave-gardener, captive of The 7th Citadel for several years now.\nYou start the game by choosing one of the available characters. Each character has an optional quest and a personal Action Deck.\nCasek, female (front) and male (back) version of a playable character\nCasek's personal quest\nAs your adventure progresses, you will choose new skills to create the character YOU want to play. Far from the usual archetypes of warrior, mage, and healer, you will have the freedom to develop your character as you choose.\nAre you more into Cunning or Arcana?\nWhether you want to play a teenage arcane master with a slingshot, an eloquent adventurer who can sneak through the shadows, or an elderly swordsman who summons creatures to assist him in battle, the choice is yours!\nYou progress in the adventure by exploring the Collapsing Lands (the game board, made up of numbered cards).\nHere you undertake actions that usually result in taking numbered cards from the Adventure Deck to progress through the adventure. These are usually terrain cards or permanent events that will progressively form the game board, but also include obstacles and challenges to overcome, equipment, companions, and side quests.\nThe game is full of random events, always consistent with where you are, and many alternative cards to experience a different adventure every time you play.\nPay attention to the details and observe your environment carefully: it contains a lot of hidden information and numbers that will be very useful to you!\nEach turn, you collectively decide which character will take the next action (search, fight, move, speak, and more) from those available to them (on the terrain card where their miniature is, their character card, an event, one of their skills, etc.).\nThere are more than 30 actions that you can perform!\nAll actions have a cost (the minimum number of cards to draw from your Action Deck), a difficulty (the number of successes you must obtain) and consequences that vary depending on whether the action succeeds or fails. \nAn action is resolved in four steps: Preparation (choice of objects, companions, etc.), Draw, Result and Consequence.\nOver the course of the adventure, taking actions will gradually deplete your Action Deck. When you run out of cards in the Action Deck, you must perform a Recovery to replenish it by reshuffling the cards from your Discard, but you will then lose 5 life points.\nWhen you are almost out of life points, or when you've reached your scenario goal, it's time to return to the Citadel!\nThe Threat Booklet will detail the consequences of your actions, which will vary according to your choices and performance, and take you to a new scenario.\nThe Collapsing Lands is populated with dozens of non-player characters (NPCs). \nYou will be able to converse with these NPCs using the \u201cBook of Dialogues\u201d, which is divided into nonlinear numbered paragraphs. You will not only choose what your character says, but also the tone they use. Then you will find out what happens by reading the indicated paragraph number.\nA chapter from the Book of Dialogues\nThe Collapsing Lands is also a hostile world where you'll have to battle strange creatures in tactical encounters that take place over several rounds. \nThese compound actions are identified by the presence of a die, whose value indicates the difficulty of the round and decreases as you gain successes. The encounter ends when the die is removed from the card, usually after you have successfully completed the last round of battle.\nIf you want to get out unscathed, you'll need to equip yourself with weapons, armor, and spells, and you\u2019ll need to seek out companions. That won\u2019t be enough to truly face down the Threat, however! You must also develop your skills and your Citadel, and that's where your Destiny comes in.\nDuring your adventures you will gain Hope through your feats of arms and the completion of side quests.\nYou can spend it to acquire new skills, build buildings, send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands, and much more. There are so many possibilities that you'll have to choose the direction YOU want to go in!\nBuildings will grant you powerful effects once built such as allowing you to start each scenario with more life points, items, or companions. They will also increase the characteristics (defense, knowledge, production\u2026) of your fellowship, in order to defeat the Threat.\nYou start the game with a map of the Kel Protectorate. This world map provides valuable information about places of interest \u2013 city-states, garrisons, waterways, etc. \u2013 in the world as it was before the war started. Unfortunately, things have changed a lot since then. \nYou will be able to send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands to update your world map by inserting numbered cards into the plastic sleeves provided for this purpose. You'll be able to obtain interesting effects,  and might even gain the ability to start future scenarios from a more advantageous position, closer to your target destination!\nThe Collapsing Lands are aptly named. Every step you take could see the ground open up like a gaping maw, eager to swallow you whole. But what if there were a hidden world below, filled with secrets and treasures just waiting to be discovered?\n\u201cOn the Edge of Peril\u201d is an exclusive expansion offered in the Collector's Edition pledge. It includes 2 dividers, 30 cards, 1 rule sheet.\nIt expands your adventures with new Exploration cards that will hinder your progress until you fight off the danger.\nDuring your adventure, you may be instructed (no spoilers \ud83d\ude09) to slip the \u201cPeril\u201d divider behind the 110 card. Whenever you take a Terrain card stored after that divider (card nr. 111 and up), you must replace 1 Exploration card attached to that terrain with one showing the \u201cPeril\u201d (skull) icon.\nLuckily, you possess a Groundquaker, a powerful artifact stolen from the Necrodruids, which will help you push the divider further back and with it the edge of peril!\nWe\u2019ve been working on The 7th Citadel for over a year now.\nThe game\u2019s mechanics have been heavily tested over the last few months. Dozens of players have had the opportunity to try them out, notably at the Essen 2019 and FIJ (Cannes) 2020 trade fairs.

Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the games Serious Poulp publishes: Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nIn 2019, we were honored by the Spiel Des Jahres (kritikerpreis) award for the cooperative party game \u201cJust One\u201d we designed, published by Repos Production.\nBree has worked on Kickstarter campaigns in a variety of roles, from marketing and communications support to community management, a role which she is delighted to be handling for The 7th Citadel campaign. She lives in Las Vegas, NV with her two cats, Samus and Remy.

To date, we have delivered rewards to over 60,000 backers around the world.\n\nWe have accumulated experience and selected our partners (manufacturer, logistics, distribution centers) among the best in the world, so we are confident in our ability to deliver this project and ensure its follow-up (communication with the community, after-sales service) with the same professionalism that we have shown so far.\n\nThe main risk factor, which can never be excluded given the complexity of such a project and the potential number of backers, lies in a possible delay in delivery.\n\nCOMMITMENTS\n\nBecause you place your trust in us and allow us, through your support, to bring our project to life, we are keen to clarify our commitments to you.\n\nTo this end, we commit ourselves, as we have always done, to:\n\n1. not launch a new Kickstarter campaign until we have delivered the previous one.\n2. do everything possible to guarantee the sustainability of our company through sound management: control of its workforce, its operating costs and investments.\n3. ensure continuity as far as possible in the event of force majeure\n4. keep you informed with regular updates about the project until its delivery.\n\nWe would like to thank all our backers for the trust and support they have shown us since 2015!\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\nIf the refund is requested more than 15 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 15% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Kickstarter.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll payments (pledged on Kickstarter and/or in the pledge manager) will be made in \u20acuros. Any costs shown in $ will be based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign (1$ = \u20ac0.85), the levy of your pledges and the pledge manager will be entirely in \u20acuros.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that you are responsible for providing correct address information, and ensuring that this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret that we are unable to ship to PO Boxes in most countries. If you do not reside in a shipping friendly zone , you agree that you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities.\n\nIf you cannot accept these conditions, we advise that you do not back this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac69 or more", "title": "Collector\u2019s Edition", "descp": "Available in English and French.\nShipping charged after campaign ends.\nINCLUDES:\nExclusive Collector\u2019s Core Box\nFree Exclusive Expansion\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["18,695 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac119 or more", "title": "Gameplay All-in", "descp": "Available in English and French.\nShipping charged after campaign ends.\nINCLUDES:\nExclusive Collector\u2019s Core Box\nFree Exclusive Expansion\nThe Last Throne Additional Threat\nKnowledge is Power Expansion\nThe Unveilers Expansion\nThe Alembic of Valengarde Expansion\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["13,216 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "June update \u2013 first glance at Life Counter", "update_content": "[Cliquez ici pour lire cette actu en fran\u00e7ais]\nHello adventurers,\nLudovic continues to work tirelessly on his illustrations and Bruno is making progress on the design of the Threat \u201cDrums of Desolation\u201d as well as writing the text for the hundreds of Terrain cards and permanent events linked to them.

A highly interactive game of fast paced chase & escape.\nSleepy little Cactus Town is going to see some action: you can wear the Sheriff\u2019s badge, join a group of dangerous outlaws, seek ransom as a bounty hunter or even use the power of seduction being an avenging Can Can dancer. Each party has its own objectives and its own unique actions, making this a perfect gateway game for asymmetric gameplay. With playing time of just 10-15 minutes per player, you can swap and play various parties each session.\n The DEPUTY is the game as it comes in retail. Oh wait, not quite, there is a LOT of extra content coming with stretch goals.\nNOW  THAT\u2019S  LUXURY!!!\nAbove Deluxe edition not only features awesome component upgrades (the minis alone will make you drool), but also exclusive game and player boards that will make your gameplay more organized and thematic. \nNote: Any items marked with the term \"KS-EXCLUSIVE\" will only be available on Kickstarter or through direct sales from the Publisher's online store or at fairs.\nThis 3D Print has been made with a non-professional home 3D printer final production quality will be even superior. THANKS to our friend Eva who did this at her home for us. Your minis will obviously come with a base, a 30mm one, but we kind of like the way the mini resembles the illustration on the card without base :)\n\nThe trip in our prairie schooner through \u201cstretch goal land\u201d to Cactus Town has been extremely productive! We finally arrived to Cactus Town with a loot of 26 stretch goals, including 2 social media/comment stretch goals. CONGRATS!\n These stretch goals are based on achieving certain goals based on your support in promoting the campaign. Read about it here. Current status of stretch goal completion (Oct. 20th, 3pm EST):\nKeep those comments, likes and posts coming, and remember that you can win a fabulous unique Dice Tower prototype, created by the talented folks of e-Raptor in Poland (Thanks for offering this as a prize, e-Raptor!).\n Dice Tower (English)\n Above video in English shows the gameplay for up to 3 players \n Above video in French shows the gameplay for up to 3 players \nAbove video in German shows the gameplay for up to 3 players \n Above video in Spanish shows the gameplay for up to 4 players\nPlayers program their actions with 3 out of 4 action cards each turn. Sounds easy enough, right? But careful, actions alternate between players and action cards are programmed in reverse order, meaning they are executed \"the other way around\". Mastering this is a real challenge. Can you out-think your opponents, guess their moves and get in your own. Or will you out-think yourself and create some hilarious chaos?\n\n\nThe player's characters move through a 5x5 building-card grid, which is set up randomly face down each game. The game includes an advanced version with building effects and several variants, giving you even more replay value. You try to position yourself so you can carry out your very personal (and asymmetric) actions to fulfill your objectives.\nAre you ready for a duel? Will you plunder for gold? Are you in the mood to dance a Can Can? Going to steal a horse, are you?

Not only the rulebook will come in your language, but also all cards, since this is a language dependent game.\nAnd the good thing? All languages will leave the factory at the same time!\nThere will also be volunteer-created PDF versions of the rulebook in Dutch, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian and Greek.\nBoardgame Heaven (English) \n  Rincon de Jugones (Espa\u00f1ol) \nShipping will be charged after the campaign through the pledge manager (we will work with Gamefound, the fastest growing pledge manager platform). Above shipping rates are estimates. \nThe exact shipping price will be defined after the campaign is over, when knowing the final weight and size of the different packages, and the backer distribution by region. As a simple rule, the more backers we have, the better we can streamline logistics and reduce shipping prices.\nThe USA, Canada, the European Union, the UK, Australia and many South East Asian countries (see table) will be \u201cFriendly Shipping\u201d. This means we will mass import the product into these regions and handle and pay all the import taxes, you won\u2019t have to incur additional cost. This is provided that legislation stays at it is, should any region (e.g. the US) impose new or significantly increased customs duties on board games manufactured in China, we reserve the right to pass these on to you before delivery. \nEuropean backers, note that we are paying the Value Added Tax due for your product, tax authorities handle this as a product sale, not an investment, so VAT applies. This is a hefty 21% as we are based in Spain. Please take this into account when comparing shipping prices to other regions, we are taking most of that burden on us and pass it on only partly. In future campaigns, we will likely follow the example of some recent campaigns who charge VAT to their European customers, as this is fairest to all. \nFor the overseas freight, we are working with global forwarding agents that allow visibility of the shipment at any time, as they are on their way to the various distribution centers. We will be using established fulfillment companies like Quartermaster Logistic, VFI, Aetherworks, Happyshops, and others, specialized and experienced in the fulfillment of Kickstarter projects, to cover the distance from distribution centers to your home.\nAll steps included, we calculate the product should arrive at your home latest middle of October 2021 (this includes some buffer for expected delays because of Covid).\nAre you a retailer smelling the opportunity of generating business with this great product in its KS exclusive version? This is your only chance to go for it, as the KS exclusive material will not be offered to retailers outside the campaign and pledge manager.\nThe retailer pledges offered are strictly for registered retail business, we require your business registration and tax ID number. Please contact through PM or write to business@secondgategames.com for information on higher volume discounts.\nWant to organize a group pledge using a local forum? Please contact through PM or write to business@secondgategames.com for information on what we can do for you at different volumes. You will have to be a group of 12+ backers.\nThis is Second Gate Games\u2019 third Kickstarter project, and the second we are doing as an independent publisher. We are extremely excited and motivated!\nIf we have learned one thing from our previous projects, it is to \u201cdrown you with stretch-goals\u201d ;) We have also learned that we should make the stretch goals available to gamers who miss the campaign, so they will be available on our online store afterwards (possibly at slightly higher prices).\nBut even more important than the campaign is the desire to provide you with a game that is both fun to play and beautiful to behold.\nThis high-end miniatures studio has created a wealth of awesome miniatures for games like Dark Age, Rum and Bones, Marvel United and others. Miniatures for our own B-Sieged were created by them, too. EXTREMELY talented guys!\n This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\nAccelerating the creation of amazing games and giving amazing, free tools for creators to communicate with the community", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe creation process for a board game is a complex enterprise, especially for a game like ours with multiple languages and variants: design adjustments, approval processes, pre-production samples, printing & assembling, freight shipping, handling in logistic centers and finally the last shipment to your door. \n\nIf anything goes wrong or isn\u2019t perfectly right, there is a risk of delay at any of those steps. This is a simple reality that you as backer need to be aware of. If anything did indeed go awry, we would communicate this to you openly.\n\nHowever, we feel that we are well prepared for a good fulfillment process and minimize the risk of delay, for the following reasons:\n\n1. We have done about 95% of the illustration work and graphic design of the game, we are almost ready to push the button. Unless you crash all our planned stretch goals and we come up with more, of course ;)\n\n2. In our timing forecast, we have built in a buffer to allow for delays caused by the Covid Pandemia. If all goes to plan, we are going to deliver earlier than announced. It is quite likely that Covid WILL have some impact on the plan, though, so we are taking that into consideration.\n\n3. Our manufacturer has a proven track record in the gaming industry and the quality of our prototypes has been outstanding. Communication has been very smooth so far and we are sure this will continue.\n\n4. We are working with specialized fulfillment companies, we are sure they can handle all your pledges easily, they have the systems and the experience.\n\nLet us also point out that Cactus Town is not a one-off stunt for us.

Ian Kensington, captain of the British Engineering Forces, is responsible for the first successful recovery of a sunken ship. In the report to His Majesty King George I of England, Kensington mentions Davy Jones' locker for the first time.\nDespite it being a real artifact, he describes the locker in the context of a legend about the sea devil Davy Jones, who supposedly locks away the wandering souls of all sailors who lose their lives at the sea. It is told that on each sunken ship, he hides a replicate of the locker, promising to release all souls if someone manages to open the box.\n Since the first find, similar lockers were found in shipwrecks scattered around the world. Some of them are still kept in private collections, others in museums. However, nobody has been able to reveal their secret so far.\nWe are sure that you are the one, who will finally be able to open the locker and force Davy Jones to admit his defeat.\nTHE DESIGN AND PRODUCTION\nAccording to Davy Jones he decided to create a special version of the box and release it to the community of Kickstarter. His crafty and intrepid team of developers has spent the last eight months designing and testing this special version of the locker. The team explored a wide variety of interlocks and functionalities, and ultimately settled on a final version which was confirmed by Davy Jones as the most sophisticated version of his locker. \nWe will not hide that our team participated in the creation of the box, but even we don't have the details how to open it as the final mechanisms were personally crafted by the Sea Devil. In any case the Cluebox \u201eDavy Jones Locker\u201c is our most complex project to date\u2014 both from a design and manufacturing perspective. The puzzle is made with loving care out of birch wood and wood oil, consists of 72 individual parts assembled with care by hand.\nTEAM\nOur international team of game and puzzle enthusiasts, mainly based in Germany, established in 2015 company  and developed several innovative board game and puzzles focusing in escape games niche. Today we're very excited to present our first Kickstarter and will appreciate your support to bring our product to life. \nPirate music theme credit to Ross Bugden\nPackage design Federico Meloni/Chris Lattner\nMeet our team member locked in Davy Jones' cabinet and requested to announce start of the campaign.\nMEGABOX (Kickstarter special)\nFor Kickstarter we will produce a special edition of Megabox in multi-color.

We're really excited with number of people who decided to support us and we made a serious effort to match the level of expectations and get more mysterious artifacts from hands of Davy Jones.\nAnd today we succeed!  We achieved to get plans of his sundial, which is an important element in the process of solving Davy Jones' Locker: when solving the Locker, keep an eye on the time shown on the clock and don't ever cross the number 12. Otherwise the Locker will turn into ... actually you better don't know what is it, just trust us ;)\nEach one of our bekers will receive a wooden kit of sundial as a big thanks for your support.\nThe size of sundial is 6x6 cm.\n\nOther iDventure Puzzles\n Cluebox - Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat \nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat is a thought experiment by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger that illustrates the problem of quantum mechanics in every day objects. In this experiment, a cat and some poison are locked in a closed box.\nAccording to Quantum Mechanics after a while the cat will be both dead and alive. Only by looking at the object, in this case the cat, the status will be determined. \nUnfortunately, Schr\u00f6dinger completely forgot the cat because of his busy daily routine.\nWe are sure that the cat is still alive, and you must save it!\nBox size: \nSecret space size: 1,5*4,5*8cm\nPlay time: 45-60 min\n Cluebox - Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat - MEGABOX \nFor Kickstarter we will produce a special edition of Megabox.

The reality is that shipping and sales taxes are expensive. To offset this we worked with our shipping partners to get the best conditions for our bakers on Kickstarter.  \nFor the EU, UK, US and Canada, your rewards will be sent duty-free from within your region - there will be no additional customs charge. We cannot guarantee customs-friendly shipping in areas outside of the US, Canada, UK and EU. There maybe additional duties and/or fees charged by your country\u2019s governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a shipped pledge, nor will we pay those fees. In the event that a package is returned or destroyed due to the non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled.\nShipping charges will be added after the Kickstarter ends - every backer will be responsible for paying these in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nApproximate shipping prices listed in the table below, but subject to change based on the pledge size.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt iDventure, we have a lot of experience fulfilling large orders on strict timelines.

Just multiply your pledge amount by however many more necklaces you want.

This can take anywhere from 2-8 weeks to arrive, depending on destination.

Each character has their own unique backstory.\n\nThe story behind this project\n Merchant : This merchant offers a broad range of wares, from llama spit to dragon scales! Find what you need, as long as you have the money!\n\n Merchant`s wife : selling medicinal herbs and spices. If something ails you she might be able to sooth your pain!\n\n Fortune teller : A woman with a good heart and the founder of the caravan, this fortune teller can reveal what lies ahead of time. She possesses magical abilities, among which is transforming herself into a younger and more seductive self! Who knows, it might come in handy one day! If you enter her tent please do not touch anything! Especially not the chest! Everyone has their secrets, right?\n\n Sisters of the war pact : Every camp needs guards, and these three sisters are it for our caravan! They have a strong bond with the caravan's founder, our fortune teller, who brought these orphaned girls up as her own daughters. With the proper fee, they'll happily join you in your adventures!\n\n Torn face : Fighting a ferocious monster with sharp claws left his face torn and disfigured! Lacking the proper expertise, the fortune teller resorted to just stitching the two sides of his face together. Blindness has sharpened one of the remaining senses, the sense of hearing, into an almost superhuman ability! His physical strength remains! No one can survive under his iron fists! \n\n Hunter : A sharp shooter with high visual acuity! No hunt is undergone without securing a bounty, bringing game and valuable live specimens back for trading.\n\n Dishonored knight : Only a true warrior knows the depths of shame after a defeat in combat. Being overwhelmed by his loss in combat, he wanted to take his own life, but some events, and the arrival of the caravan, prevented this outcome. He lost one of his arms, which made room for a curious innovation!\n\n Troupe group : Sit a while and listen! You will find entertainment for hours while you repose after a long day's journey.\n\n Servant girl : She was found unconscious, with the recent events being a blank. The only thing she can recollect is a dragon... yes, there was a dragon somewhere! (Stay tuned for future project!)\n\n Hunter - zombie version : Damn, that crate definitely had a \"do not touch\" sign on it! Our brave and curious hunter dared to get near a zombie that he found in the jungle, where it was dormant. The creature quickly sensed his presence and fiercely attacked him, succeeding in infecting him with a bite. He got bit but eventually managed to put the creature back in his crate! Our hunter has a secret now, that will end up transforming him! (Stay tuned for future project!)\n\n Dwarf : Who ever heard of a dwarf that doesn't like his liquor!? This renowned merchant sells the best wines around, sometimes rarities found in deep and forgotten cellars! \n\n Merchant`s daughter : Are you looking for fresh wild berries, fruits and vegetables? This is the place to look! This young merchant has a vibrant connection to nature and is easily able to source food!\n\nThe scale\nAll miniatures and props are scaled at 32 mm. All miniatures come in two version: with one inch round base and without a base. You can easily scale it in any size you want.\n\nDelivery time\nAll of these pictures are 3d renders or just rough sketches so please be mindful that changes can occur.

Other than this we have collaborated with dozens of Kickstarters during these last two years. Providing models all round to community members in some of the most popular campaign offered in Digital on Kickstarter.\n\nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. All Stretch Goals have also been completed, but need to be tested and will be available shortly after that.\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA:\nWe strive to produce models that will print with as little support and parts as possible. Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled.\n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com\n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce.\n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round.\n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible.\n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print.\n\nAll the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk.\n\nAll the files have been checked using Netfab, this means that PrusaSlicer should have no problems slicing these files. Many of the files are also tested using PrusaSlicer.\n\nAll accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models, also known as Daily Bonus or Free Models are given freely, under no obligation, as is and as a gift and don't form part of the campaign or responsibilities associated with this.\n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user.\n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how.\n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they may not be an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary.\n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nDigital distribution, no impact to the environment", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Super Backer and Add-on", "descp": "Help us by contributing and following this project.

Unravel the dark secrets the island holds as you venture deeper into the caves in search of mystery and treasure.  Len's Island is a blend of peaceful building, farming and crafting, mixed with intense combat, dungeon battles and deep questing and exploration.\nReaching our funding goal will mean we will be able to create Len's Island to the level we are happy with releasing. If we reach further funding milestones, we will be able to use this money to add many additional features, continue expanding the game post-release and overall make the game better and more polished.\nStarting as a solo weekend project just under three years ago, Julian Ball / Flow Graphics created Len's Island as a way to make his own vision for the perfect game come to life. Now developed by a small indie team, development has progressed over the years to form a beautiful, immersive, captivating and meaningful experience which we call Len's Island.\nLen's Island brings excitement and progression for many playstyles, all within a vibrant and engaging world. Catering to the hardcore dungeon-crawler fans, home-builders and decorators, explorers and completionists, farming fanatics, collectable hoarders, and people who just want to live the simple life chopping trees as the sun goes down.\nLen's Island is planned to release late March 2021, on Steam for PC and Mac. With potential plans for other platforms, but you'll just have to wait and see...\nWhy are we on Kickstarter? The short answer is, making games is expensive!! We have been working tirelessly to make this game a reality, some of us for years, some months, all without pay, just with a passion for making a great game. But.. we need some funds to finish this project and let it become the amazing experience we wish it to be.\nLen's Island has been in development for just under three years. The first year was Julian, working alone to get the game into a prototype state and see how it played. Making the prototype was a quest to find a perfect blend of creative building, intense dungeon-crawler action, and calming exploration, all inside of a lush and vibrant world that makes you feel right at home. Now with a small team, we have rewritten the original code and rebuilt the game from the ground up.\nAt this stage of development, we have the core systems built, the starting levels and core design almost finished along with a small library of content. We are in the middle of production, starting the alpha-testing phase and iterating on the content we have so far. The next stage of development is polishing the systems we have in place, filling the game with more content like quests, items, more dungeons, and just generally more fun stuff to explore and do.\nThis is a sneak peek for one of the background tracks. Give it a play, read through the Kickstarter page and imagine you're exploring your own island.\nBuild the home of your dreams. Build wherever you want, make it as big as you want, paint the walls, add some decorations, make it your own.\nWe have developed a building system that functions using an easy drag-n-drop interface, with deep customization and limitless creative freedom to build. Start with the structure using the ever-growing library of building pieces. Then choose what style you want to build in, whether it's basic wooden beams, cobblestone, ornate brickwork or a blend of them all. You can paint and customize styles so you can make it truly YOUR home. Want blue walls, white window-frames and a red door? DONE. Then for the finishing touches. Add some decorations, place your bed, build a wardrobe, a weapon rack, a tool chest, and much much more.\nAfter a treacherous journey into the dungeons or a long day completing a quest, you need a haven to come back to that makes you feel right at home. Our goal for the building in Len's Island was to create a system that allows you to create a home that you can truly be proud of.\nLen's Island is also a fast-paced, skill-driven dungeon crawler with a strong focus on engaging a wide range of combat types and loadout combinations. There are many ways to progress in Len's Island.  If you're getting bored of building your home, tending to your crops and meeting the local townsfolk, there are deep, dark caves below the Island with plenty to explore.\nAs you clear the dungeons you will defeat dark creatures, unlock mysteries, complete challenging puzzles, and better your skills in combat. There's also lots of rare ores to mine, hidden areas to find and broken paths to repair. When you travel deeper into the caves you will start to unravel the mystery of what makes the Island so unique.\nCombat is agile and skill-based with a high skill-ceiling for experienced players wishing for a more nuanced experience. Customize your loadout with over a dozen weapon classes and a wide selection of niche weapons. From wielding magical staffs and iron daggers to fiery war axes and rapid-fire bows. Take your own journey through Len's Island and fight the way you want to fight.\nThese are all work in progress animations and attacks. Player animations and more weapon variants are a couple of the key areas that benefit greatly from Kickstarter. We're not animators so we're doing our best with what we have so far.\nThere's more than one way to make some coin in Len's Island. You can loot the dungeons, complete quests, or gather resources and sell produce grown from your farms. Discover rare fruits, attract new wildlife to your home, make your crops look beautiful and make some good money while doing it. \nUse farms to grow the food which fuels your ventures into the dungeons and long days exploring the Islands; as well as grow exotic plants and flowers to sell back to the villagers for gold.\nGrow large-scale farms throughout the forest, or care for small garden beds on your balcony. Or if you're not the green-thumb type, place some pot plants and call it a day. \nWe will have a lot more farming features to show further as we progress deeper into development. Farming is essential if you want to keep your health topped up and your belly happy. You can also use farming as a great way to earn gold to craft better weapons, upgrade your backpack and buy exotic items.\nQuesting plays an important role within Len's island. Help villagers with simple tasks like gathering some wood for Martinel or take on more dangerous ventures like finding lost loved ones trapped in the dungeons. You can make a big impact within the town and make some nice coin while doing it!\nYou're not the only person who's called this Island home. Rescue villagers, fix up the run-down cabins on the island and help them get back on their feet.\nYou can repair and upgrade more than just your own home. Fix broken bridges leading to hidden treasures, upgrade parts of the local town, and uncover secret areas.\nWhen backing Len's Island you will receive a small demo a few weeks after the successful completion of the Kickstarter. Demo copies will be sent on the 24th of September. This demo will be a little mini-Island that we've created. A place where you can build a house and get a feel for the game. \nWe may look like all fun and games, pun intended, though we have been working tirelessly for years to make this project happen. We all share a common passion, and that is to create games and experiences we care about and are truly proud of.\nOur collective professional background and complementary skills are what makes us a great team. Julian's experience ranges from freelance graphic design and game art, to working within large companies as a marketing director and chief operations officer.  Lars has worked as a professional music composer, sound designer and graphic designer for many years, releasing various self-titled tracks and composing for games such as Team Fortress 2. Martin has lectured in game design and game programming, as well as worked on various indie-game titles over the years.\nKickstarter will help immensely with filling the game with more great content, paying expensive bills that any start-up indie studio has to pay, along with expanding upon our current scope. We can hire an artist to make more weapons, character animations and a variety of visual assets. As well as paying our music composer and SFX designer Lars to continue to create beautiful tracks and much needed audio effects for the game. The vast majority of the money raised will simply go directly back into the game itself to make it that much better, adding more content and a higher level of polish. We will need some of the cash to pay business costs, things like accounting, trademarks, set up fees, software licensing, legal fees, etc. Then if there's any money left over, we can use it for marketing and help pay the bills to make sure none of us ends up homeless while working on Len's Island.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreating any game has its risks.

Having to keep big publishers happy, or even being forced to change key elements of the game is super risky in our minds. We just want to make the game that we know is great, into a completed and polished title ready for launch.\n\nAll of the funds from Kickstarter have 1 key goal in mind, to make Len's Island the best it can possibly be.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Hellscape pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.  \n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Take charge and direct the immune response in this inner quest: Become the hero you need!\"  \nCup of Hygeia (Goddess of health)\n I am a biologist and I have worked on viral evolution for more than 15 years. Around 2010, I started pondering the idea of a cooperative game where you fight a viral infection. At first, I simply wanted to share with people the immense awe I feel when I learn about the beautiful, constant struggle of the immune system. However, several events resolved me to finish it and to strive to give it a wide exposure.    \nMagnification level 1: Human body\nFirst, a beloved friend died of AIDS, when he was only 33 years old. His death was a heartrending blow for me and our tight-knit group of friends, especially because nowadays infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus can be treated so easily. He loved board games and I promised myself to finish the game one day and dedicate it to his memory.       \nMagnification level 2: Heart cross section\nSecond, I grew increasingly worried by the rise of misinformation regarding the boon for humanity that vaccination has been. These feelings gave way to a conviction: that a way to inoculate the minds of people against this pernicious idea is to provide an accessible experience that would teach them the basic workings of the immune system.          \nMagnification level 3: Heart tissue\nMost people live their lives unaware of the epic fight between life and death that takes place inside the complex microcosm of their bodies every day. However, I didn't want a dry simulation or lifeless educational tool: I play board games every week and I wanted to create an easy to learn, dynamic and fun experience.       \nMagnification level 4: B-cell, the hero with a thousand trillion faces\nThird, the COVID-19 pandemic brought a sense of urgency to this endeavor. I recoiled at the myriad of misconceptions and I think it is this lack of knowledge that brings panic into many hearts. I know that a board game sounds banal in these trying times, but  the huge awareness caused by the disease has generated unparalleled interest in learning about how the immune system fights a virus.       \nMagnification level 5: Virus\nFinally, I really wish you enjoy playing this game. It would make me very happy to know that at least one person will become a scientist because of this gaming experience: we need more scientists in the world. Along the same lines, for every 20 copies rewarded during this campaign, we will donate 1 copy to a public school or library. I sincerely hope you support us!     \n You can now take \"immune\" for a spin yourself! \nTabletopia link\nGame rules: For a detailed description, please see the game rules, which come in both English and Spanish versions. For more information, resources and discussions, please see our BoardGameGeek page. \nBrief overview:\nComponents and first turn:\nDetailed description of gameplay:\nTurn description: Briefly, each player\u2019s turn consists of three steps: viral replication, energy allocation and immune actions.\nViral replication: The player takes 2 viral tokens from the infection bag and places them on the corresponding organ of the same color. When both tokens go to the same organ, a debilitating disease symptom occurs. \nEnergy allocation: The player can move one energy token to an adjacent action tile: The more energy tokens, the stronger the action is.\nImmune actions: The player can perform two immune actions, out of the 9 available ones. The immune actions allow players to collect necessary resources, maturate their skills and attack the virus on each organ.   \nImmune actions\nEnd of the game: The game continues until either the virus conquers the human body or the immune system learns to recognize the viral strain: the body is now immune.   \nMagnification level 6: An example of some of the amino acids needed to learn to recognize the virus\n\n I hoped to create a game that:\n Was easy to explain. Although I wanted the game to be faithful to the science behind the immune system and thus encourage the player's curiosity, I primarily  wanted a fun and accessible experience. Most of the time we prefer playing games with streamlined rules that are easy to pick up but still provide a meaningful challenge. However, if you wish to play with people without any experience on strategic boardgames, please follow the simplified variant included in the rulebook.\n Was replayable. I like cooperative games because they play differently depending on the group of people. Besides that social aspect, each \"Immune\" session is different with three difficulty levels and a combination of 1 out 16 viral threats (each with its own stats), a subset of the disease symptoms that can come during game play and a random spatial array of the immune actions. \n Was mostly language independent. All action tiles and many cards have iconography to show what they do. Although several cards are written in English, each card's description can be found in the rulebook (which contains both English and Spanish versions). I hope to translate the cards to more languages with the help of the board gaming community. However, if you wish to play a completely language-independent game please follow the simplified variant included in the rulebook.\n Could be played solo. In case of victory, the game provides a score to measure and encourage the player's improvement over time. When you have defeated the highest difficulty, you can increase the viral defense value, which will result in even higher scores.\n Didn't have prescribed roles. Roles are interesting in some cooperative games, but I often find them restrictive: there is a single thing you must do, because it is the best thing you can do. Although each player has a once-per game special ability, there are no different roles in \u201cImmune\u201d: each player in this game specializes as the game progresses. \n Worked at all difficulty levels. After play testing enough the core engine of the game, I searched for the best parameter combos (for example how many disease cards, resource values, etc). Thus, I created a python program (MARVIN) that played the game randomly until victory or defeat. Then the combo's fitness was calculated as how far the average winning rate was from a desired target on each difficulty level. I searched exhaustively over all parameter combos and those that made it into the game were the fittest ones.    \nPlease see the interview below, where these and other topics are discussed: \nThe game will be delivered only to USA, Mexico, Canada, countries in the European union, UK and Australia. The game will be shipped from within the country or region, thus avoiding import fees and taxes. The shipping cost is: \"Inner quest\" - $7, \"Plenty\" - $10 (must ship to the same address). \nAll pledges must be made in full during the campaign, so we wont allow late pledges or pledge upgrades. \nWe estimate that backers will get their rewards on March 2021.\nFor every 20 copies rewarded during this campaign, we will donate 1 copy to a public school or library.     \n Immense thanks to Alice Steel for her artistic contributions: \"Hygeia's cup\", body, organs, tissues, B-cell and the virus.

Who know's there might even be an Artificer and Dungeon master available if we beat these goals!\nThe pins are going for \u00a37 early bird, \u00a38 once we get passed the first 48 hours and then \u00a39 when they find their way onto my Etsy store, so make sure to grab them as soon as you can!\n Pin Specifications\nComes with character sheet backing card\nSoft enamel\nBlack Dye backing (This means we don't have to go pure black on the pin edges)\nTwo black rubber backings to make sure they are really stuck to whatever you attach them too.\n\n\n If you guys really want to help unlock these stretch goals, please share the campaign with your friends on social media! you might have some secret nerd friends you didn't know about! Also to make it easier i'll include two big blue buttons.\nThis project is now our third Kickstarter, All previous works can be found here, on our Etsy page. Our last kickstarter was fully funded in 90 minutes and all stretch goals were unlocked in less than 24 hours! Also we will be working with the same manufacturer that produced our Menagerie of Monsters pins, we trust that they will produce the same high quality product that they did before.\nHow can I choose which pins I would like?\nWhen the campaign ends i will be sending out surveys where you will be able to select which pins you would like! \nWill I get a tracking number?\nMost rewards are sent out untracked due to the high price of tracked shipping here in the UK. If you would like tracking please add \u00a39 to your total pledge amount, as per my pricing list above. \nWill I be able to get these pins after the kickstarter has ended?\nYes! When this campaign ends i will order extra stock encase we have any B grade or none perfect pins, any of the left over pins will be put on my Etsy store, but they will be \u00a39 on there so backers will be getting a discounted price\nOnce you've chosen you're favourite little adventurers or decided to grab all of them, all that's left to do is sit back and relax whilst we get to work. The pin manufacturing process can take several weeks up to a month, depending on the amount of designs that are ordered, but we will be working with the same manufacturer that produced our last kickstarters pins, we trust them to be on time and deliver a high quality product. Then all that's left is assembly and postage, i can assure you i will be taking a couple weeks off of DnD to get all of your orders ready!\n July 20th - Campaign Begins\n August 20th - Campaign Ends\n Mid August - Surveys Sent out\n Last August - Funds arrive and production begins! \n Early October - Pins arrive with me\n Mid October - pins begin shipping\n Late October - All Pins Shipped\nInternational shipping may take an extra week or two\nNow onto the budget\n70% Production\n25% Shipping\n5% Kickstarter Fees", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't my first kickstarter and i have been running an Etsy store for two years now so hopefully everything will run smoothly, the only risk we have falls to the pin manufacturer but i have been speaking to this company for a while and have made sure they can fulfil everything that we need.\nAlso all 12 of my pin designs have been checked by the manufacturer but they are still subject to minor changes like colour and details. If we do have to change anything i will put out an update to all backers. Also i will update you every step of the way!\nYou will only be able to pick from the pins we unlock\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a38 or more", "title": "1 Adventurer Pin", "descp": "One (1) enamel pin of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["31 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "2 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "Two (2) enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "3 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "3 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a327 or more", "title": "4 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "4 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a333 or more", "title": "5 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "5 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a339 or more", "title": "6 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "6 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a345 or more", "title": "7 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "7 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "8 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "8 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a355 or more", "title": "9 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "9 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a360 or more", "title": "10 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "10 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a365 or more", "title": "11 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "11 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a370 or more", "title": "12 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "12 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a374 or more", "title": "13 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "Thirteen (13) enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a378 or more", "title": "14 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "Fourteen (14) enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3110 or more", "title": "20 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "20 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Early Bird -

Players take the role of fantasy heroes: facing challenges, adventuring through the realm of Ulos, and making decisions that change the story \u2014 and the kingdom \u2014 forever.\nAfter a thousand years of peace, Dragul armies raided from the north, prompting you and every other loyal citizen of Nalos to sign up as soldiers of the King\u2019s Guard. The armies of Nalos fought long and hard against the North\u2019s monstrous generals and their minions, finally turning the tide of the Dragul Invasion.\nIn each of the game's 12 storybooks, you\u2019ll be asked to make choices, complete skill checks, and fight battles that will permanently alter the world of Ulos for that adventure and in future adventures. You\u2019ll find new allies, make enemies, and uncover secrets that will change the world around you.\nWhatever choices you make, someone will remember \u2014 and respond.\nChoose from one of 21 pregenerated characters, or import a favorite Roll Player character and take them on a heroic journey. Each character brings unique attributes, starting cards, class abilities, and backstories to your adventure.\nPregenerated Characters\nImporting Characters from Roll Player\nRoll Player Adventures does NOT require the Roll Player base game or any of its expansions to play, though it\u2019s possible to import characters generated in Roll Player using any number of its expansions. Do you have a favorite Obnoxious Saurian Fighter who grew up as a Street Urchin from your last game of Roll Player? Bring them along\nEach of the 17 races and 36 classes have unique portraits and class abilities in Adventures!\nConvert your attribute scores and use them to build dice pools during your adventure!\nEvery market card from Roll Player has a new dice-manipulating counterpart in Roll Player Adventures!\n Note: Roll Player products will be available individually in the pledge manager.\nRoll Player Adventures has 11 adventure books that form a continuous campaign, and 1 infinitely replayable sidequest that can be played at any time. In a session of Roll Player Adventures, you\u2019ll explore a new area of the world of Ulos, represented by a unique adventure map. As your party travels around the map, you\u2019ll read aloud from that adventure\u2019s storybook and choose how you\u2019ll approach each encounter.\nDuring your adventure, you'll encounter strange creatures, solve puzzles and mysteries, and discover new areas of the map to explore.\nRoll Player Adventures blends an immersive branching narrative with cooperative skill checks and combat encounters. These dice placement puzzles echo the satisfying, puzzle-solving features of other Thunderworks Games hits such as Roll Player and Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale. In each combat or skill check, players manage their resources to fill dice slots with dice of specific colors and numbers. With clever play and the players can attempt to overcome the obstacles on the path of adventure.\n\nSpend stamina from your character\u2019s attributes to add specific colors of dice to the dice pool: \nThen play cards from your hand to manipulate the dice and solve the puzzle:\nIf you lose a combat or fail a skill check, there\u2019s no replaying a scenario or rolling up new characters. You now need to deal with the consequences of your failure, and see how the world changes in response. Even death is a new adventure \u2014 with its own 10-encounter storyline.\nRoll Player Adventures has several systems dedicated to remembering the results of your actions. Together, they represent an incredible amount of responsiveness from the game world to player choices. Importantly, these systems also can interact with each other, giving nuance to relationships \u2014 you may choose to gain a temporary ally in an adventure, but be regarded by them differently because you\u2019ve offended their faction in the past.\nAt the end of each adventure, you\u2019ll spend your earned gold and experience points to advance your characters, improving your party for the next adventure. There are 100's of unique abilities to discover and many ways to specialize.\nWant to try Roll Player Adventures for yourself? You can play through a draft of Adventure 1: Battle at Blacklake on both Tabletopia (Free!) and Tabletop Simulator. \n Rahdo Runs Through - Runthrough\nThe Nefras's Judgement expansion is available as part of the Immortal Knight and World of Ulos pledge levels. In this expansion, Nefras, the Snake of Years, will judge each character in your party as they make personal choices that are woven through the storyline of your campaign. Uncover your backstory and choose your alignment in Roll Player Adventures: Nefras\u2019s Judgement.\nDuring a campaign including Nefras's Judgement, each character in your party plays through one unique backstory quest that spans across multiple adventure books.\nFor example, if a character in your party had a \u201cDetective\u201d Backstory, you might slowly uncover clues about a murder, scattered through the adventures in the main campaign, finally either solving the mystery or sending an innocent insectoid to Kulbak prison in the storyline's climax.\nWhen setting up the Nefras\u2019s Judgement expansion at the start of a Roll Player Adventures campaign, players can use the backstory provided with a pregenerated character, or they can import the backstory and alignment from a character built using Roll Player.\nAs with previous projects, we'll be shipping all pledge levels from reputable fulfillment partners around the world. This project is EU, UK, CA, and AU friendly. This means that rewards bound to those regions ship from within their respective regions so backers in those regions will not pay any VAT, customs, or duties on their games upon arrival at their address.

Here's how you play!\nThe Thunderworks team has been working on this project for over three years. The scope is bigger and more ambitious than any project we've done in the past. It's a project born out of love for both narrative adventure games and the passion players have for the other games in the line. We are excited to bring such a big game to you from a small team.\nBut, printing a board game with a scope this large is expensive, and Thunderworks Games is a small company. Without the help of backers on Kickstarter, Roll Player Adventures simply will not exist.\nWe need your support to make this game a reality. The design is complete. The art is complete.

I've outlined some common areas of risk in boardgame projects and how I've done my best to address them.\n\n> Artwork: All the artwork for the game is complete, with the exception of any images added due to achieving stretch goals or any last minute tweaks before sending the final files off to the manufacturer.\n\n>Development: All twelve books of Roll Player Adventures are complete and have been extensively playtested. We are currently playtesting the full campaign with final art and most of its graphic design to make sure everything is just right before we send the game into final layout for manufacturing.\n\n> Component Quality: I've worked with and built a great relationship with one of the best game manufacturers around, Panda Game Manufacturing (www.pandagm.com). Their proven track record on games like Eclipse, Terra Mystica, Pandemic, Belfort, and Mice & Mystics, proves they make great games with a high standard to quality. They've printed all Thunderworks titles to date.\n\n> Delivery Timeline: Unexpected delays out of my control can always occur (i.e. component shortage, manufacturer issues, customs delays, etc...). For the production schedule of Roll Player Adventures, I've used conservative estimates to account for unknowns and bumps in the road.\n\n> Fulfillment: I have received multiple estimates and will be working with established fulfillment companies that have proven track records for delivering quickly and efficiently all over the world.\n\n> Eighth Project: Even though this is my eighth Kickstarter project, I have continued to spend endless hours researching Kickstarter as well as participating in many Kickstarters. I have done my best to foresee and minimize any obstacles or stumbling blocks.\n\nIn addition, in my life outside of this campaign, I have over a decade of project management experience on large-scale software projects.

In order to fully close this case, the Police have now released three items, containing over 90 puzzles and mysteries, and are calling on you to help solve them...\n You can play Full Deck several ways:\nBacking BOOKSHELF, which includes all three books\nBacking ONLOOKER (digital) or CRIME BOARD (physical), which is a self-contained puzzle\nBookshelf \nThree distinct books make up the Full Deck set.\nThis  is a collection of three books, each set inside a crime narrative, where you have to piece together the clues and solve the 90 puzzles contained within.\nThe books consist of:  \nA full-colour textured paperback book\nMasterpiece - Released by the Police, this is a facsimile copy of the serial killer's diary. Read through the diary and see if you can uncover their motivation, plans and other nefarious ideas. The diary is written in broken prose, so you will need to have your most cryptic, riddling minds active to solve the challenges contained within.  \n54 images of crucial evidence to solve the case.\nEvidence - 54 specific items of interest to the Police, from ticket stubs to menu orders and receipts. This is a self-contained puzzle book, as each item also gives clues to a specific playing card value and suit. The items contribute heavily to the storyline, and will give valuable clues to solving the other puzzles.\nThe Evidence book also has answer grids. The Full Deck series uses a brand new answer validation system (BinCheck), so you will not need access to a computer to see if you are correct. This book will be fully printed in colour.\nIf you'd like to have have the actual pieces of evidence, please look at our Crime Board or Expert Reward. \nA full colour, glossy journal.\nRedacted - A facsimile of the journal kept by the investigating Police Officer during the event. The pages have been written in detail, but you will need your powers of deduction (as well as some cross-referencing) in order to work out the information which has been redacted by the Police, for fear of reprisals or lawsuits. This book will be fully printed in colour.   \n Want to play the standalone game, with 54 pieces of facsimile evidence? Dust off your cork board, get your pins ready, and take a look at our Crime Board Reward...\n Crime Board \n54-pieces of facsimile evidence, from tickets stubs to crucial ephemera.\nAlso available is Crime Board. This is a physical collection of all the items of evidence, complete in a genuine evidence bag. Now is your chance to recreate your own crime board, by using these tickets, leaflets, photographs and receipts to build either a timeline of the events, or connect them together as a standalone puzzle.\nCrime Board has a game built into it - each of the 54 items has a playing card suit and value hidden within it, so can be played either on it's own (find all the playing cards), or as part of the Full Deck game (for example, seeking out a name that visited a specific location from one of the pieces of evidence).\nSome of the Crime Board elements in action!\nPlease note that the items in Crime Board are the same as those in the Evidence book, but we believe these add an exciting element to the game, and are perfect for a group of detectives to work through together! Below are some ways backers could play Crime Board:\nThose with books might find the places items are mentioned at or hinted towards, and put them in those sections of the book.\nBlu-tack a deck of cards on the wall, and see if you can place the right item on the right playing card (good for sifting evidence).\n\"Borrow\" a rolling whiteboard from work and create a visual timeline.\nClear the table, and have friends over to sift and sort the clues, uncovering all the puzzles (remember, this is a standalone game, AND can be used with the books).\nReward Options \nFor those on a budget, we are offering a digital-only copy of Evidence. If you love the idea of being your own detective, we are offering Crime Board, which is a physical collection of the evidence, supplied in a genuine evidence bag. For booklovers, you can back to get either the three copies on their own (Bookshelf Pledge), or you can upgrade to the Expert pledge, which includes all three books AND the Crime Board reward. Lastly, we have an extremely limited number of naming rewards available. Please note that these prices are below eventual retail prices.\nBackground\nThis has been created by Stephen, one half of The Escapages, publishers of Escape Books. We have published eight books so far, the most recent one, Flatpak, being successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2019. Flatpak was an interactive puzzle escape book in the guise of a furniture catalogue, and the full-colour print contained over 120 puzzles. \n\"As a lifelong fan of crime fiction and drama, I have always been most interested in the little details; the crime board of evidence, the whiteboard timelines, the little baggies of clues, the serial killer's diary. I felt that there was an extraordinary opportunity to build a pacy narrative simply by using these materials alone. The result is this; an incredibly complex intertwining set of storylines, combined with photorealistic detail and some deliciously-challenging puzzles.\"\nSee Stephen talk about Escapages and the Full Deck project here (18 minute video).\nSolve the riddles within the diary to help crack the case.\nDetails\nHow will the puzzles work?\nThere are three distinct types of puzzle included in Full Deck, outlined below. They are are ordered by difficulty, starting with the easiest.\nEvidence - In this book are photographs of 54 key pieces of evidence from the Full Deck crime story. Contained within each item is a clue or hint toward an ordinary playing card suit and value - including two jokers.\nRedacted - This book is the sleep journal of the investigating Police Officer, which has been check through by the Crown Prosecution Service, and key elements of the story have been redacted. The puzzles within this book rely on you drawing information from the journal itself, and Masterpiece.\nMasterpiece - our killer wrote his plans and thoughts in prose, list, diagrams and poetry. You will have to dig through the book, sometimes linking information from Evidence and Redacted, in order to solve the riddles and puzzles contained within.\nThe journal will guide you, if you can only solve the redacted sections...\nSchedule\nTo avoid any disappointment, we have created a schedule with enough breathing space to allow for any unforeseen minor delays, as outlined below. We aim to complete different milestones ahead of this, but hope that this gives some idea of what we are working toward.\nAugust - October 2020 Completion of the text for Masterpiece and Redacted.\nOctober 2020 Generation of the BinCheck grids. First Play test round.\nNovember 2020 Typesetting of all three books.\nDecember 2020 Printing of proof copies.\nJanuary 2021 Professional copy editing and proofreading. Play testing.\nFebruary 2021 Revisions made. Shipping costs and addresses confirmed.\nMarch 2021 Worldwide dispatch.\n\nStretch Goals\nWe have built two complimentary products for Full Deck - the books, and the crime board set. Below are the stretch goals for them both:\nAs you can see, there are dedicated upgrades for both the books and the crime board. Please bear in mind that if you pledge at EXPERT level, you are contributing to scores for both! If someone backs just the books, that is added to the Bookshelf tally, and so on.\nAt the time of writing, we are already over halfway to our first Stretch Goal for both, so please read below to see how we can achieve this faster than you might expect.\nWe are trying something a little different for this campaign, and asking you to really help get the word out about this project on Social Media. To that end, we have built in a Sharing Stretch range of rewards too!\nAll you have to do is share the above link (bit.ly/BackFullDeck), and we will do the rest. Every validated click counts, and will earn more puzzles for the book set. Plus, if/when we reach 2,000 validated clicks, we will include a customised pin badge for all physical backers!\nIf you have a large fanbase online and would like a customised bit.ly link, please do get in touch via our messages, and we can provide one bespoke for you. Please get in touch for more details.\n\nShipping\nPlease note that shipping is not included in your pledge, and will instead by charged after the campaign using a pledge manager. There will be the option of standard or tracked shipping. Shipping is likely to be around \u00a36 domestically, and \u00a310 internationally, and will be calculated near to dispatch based on current rates and accurate weights.

We want to give back to the 3D Printing Community that has supported our work by offering this project at the most affordable price possible. We love you guys and the support that you have given us over the years. A special thank you to all our backers who supported our last project 'Viking Legends'. We loved your feedback and all the great ideas you came up with for that project. We hope that our little community will contribute in the same way towards this new campaign.    \nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. Most Stretch Goals have also been completed and will be available shortly after that.\n Accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models.\nThese models in the grab bag are accumulated during the campaign and feature many of our backer's suggestions. They will be delivered to all our loyal backers who have pledged for any 'All In' tier at the end of the campaign.

All Terrain models print without support and have all been previously test printed.\nMiniatures contain a high level of detail and are mainly meant to be printed in Resin, but can be printed on FDM with supports and preparation work, although it is not recommended.\nThis Project is a limited collectible and is only available as a one time Kickstarter project. The project will not normally be available for online after-sales of digital media. We value our loyal backers in Kickstarter and will continue to offer these products for them on this platform at the best possible price as exclusive collector items.\nIf you missed this Kickstarter, we will be offering part/re-bundled  models from this campaign as add-ons on other similar themed campaigns that we will launch during the year.\nWe work on backer patronage and loyalty and hope we can give back as much as you have given us. We hope you enjoy our future campaign and models.

Other than this we have collaborated with dozens of Kickstarters during these last two years. Providing models all round to community members in some of the most popular campaign offered in Digtal on Kickstarter.\n\nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. All Stretch Goals have also been completed, but need to be tested and will be available shortly after that.\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA:\nWe strive to produce models that will print with as little support and parts as possible. Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled.\n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com\n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce.\n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round.\n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible.\n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print.\n\nAll the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk.\n\nAll the files have been checked using Netfab, this means that PrusaSlicer should have no problems slicing these files. Many of the files are also tested using PrusaSlicer.\n\nAll accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models, also known as Daily Bonus or Free Models are given freely, under no obligation, as is and as a gift and don't form part of the campaign or responsibilities associated with this.\n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user.\n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how.\n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they may not be an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary.\n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nDigital delivery, no impact to the environment.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Super Backer and Add-on", "descp": "Help us by contributing and following this project.

To make sure there are no delays on the creative front, we've decided not to wait until the end of the campaign and we've already hired the illustrator & extra writing staff. If we reach certain stretch goals, there may be additional artwork to produce, but we don\u2019t foresee this causing any delays.\n\n\u2022 Shipping\nWe are planning to begin the shipping process immediately following the end of the campaign.

This is why our biggest pledge for all 13 games offers most of the games to be shipped in one box. This way we majorly reduce the chances of one of your 13 envelopes to be lost, damaged, or delayed when sent as a letter mail.\nPlease note that if you're outside of US & Canada and you add the \"Almost Subscription\" add-on that offers all your 13 envelopes to be shipped separately, the shipping will be considered to be \u201cat your own risk\u201d, meaning we cannot be responsible for mishandled packages.\nAny issues with delivery will be handled individually and in-house. We're prepared to send replacements when it makes sense.\n\n\u2022 Additional Fees & Customs\nOne of the reasons we're heavily subsidizing our shipping costs is because VAT, customs, or other local shipping fees are unfortunately not covered and processed on our end. We currently have only twenty EU & Asian backers, so we are prepared to serve you personally and case by case.\nTo be more accessible for International backers of all 13 games, we added the \"Almost Subscription\" add-on that offers all your 13 envelopes to be shipped as letter mail, not in a box. According to our research, letter mail is exempt from VAT in most countries, so we're hoping this option will help you save some $.\n\n\u2022 Refunds\nAs of launch, we haven't found any pledge managers for post-campaign processing we're happy with, so we'll be handling everything in-house.\nYou are welcome to manage your pledge during the campaign (we really hope that 40 days are enough for you to make a final decision and we will make sure to send an update 48/24h before the end of the campaign to remind you to manage your pledge.) Once the campaign ends, we will send out final surveys and we will start the shipping process immediately. Once your order has been processed for shipping, we will no longer be able to offer refunds. \n\n\u2022 Unforeseen Events\nWhile we can't anticipate everything, we feel that we are prepared to deal with all the issues if and when they occur. We are committed to you all and will always keep you updated about any changes that might affect this project. We respect our backers and we have a moral obligation to ensure everyone receives what they pledged for. By pledging to this project, you are indicating that you understand and give consent to the risks, challenges, and pledge terms laid out above.

Click the big button at the very top of the page to get connected.  It might put you on our mailing list for when we announce it, or bring you right to the Backerkit late-pledge store, depending on timing.    That button is your key to unlocking the Mystery!\nThank you for your interest in Gate Keeper Games and our dice!\nLet\u2019s unlock the Mystery!\nALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED!\nThere are currently...\n50 brand new dice sets unlocked (pic & details below)\n7 Weird Stuff unlocked (pic & details below)\n5 d2s unlocked (pics & details below)\nUK & EU VAT Friendly Shipping (details below)\nA free shipping box upgrade! (details below) \n\nWhat are Mystery Dice?\nOver the last 7 years I've produced over 90 custom dice designs.  I'm really proud of that work.  But my supporters have put a bug in me: They want me to make All The Things!  ...now I do too.\nSo here's the plan.  We set a funding goal of $25,000 together.  That allows us, you and me, to make 10 totally new dice designs.  Never before seen things.  Insane quality designs, even better than you know to expect from me. \nBut that's all I'm gonna tell you!\nHow's it work?\nYou pledge for dice sets at an immense discount, and we make and ship them to you as a \"Mystery Set\".  Meaning we don't tell you what you're getting, you find out ...when you open the box!\nEndless surprises await as every set you add to your pledge is guaranteed to be unique, with no repeats unless you ask for them.  It's going to be an unboxing experience like no other!\nWhat might we make?\nThere might be new molds, new sizes, new colors, new patterns, opaque and transparent.  There might be sparkles, neon, glow in the dark, layers and swirls, inclusions... or maybe even all of the above at once! \nAnything goes!  We're putting no limits on ourselves! \nI promise this: \nAll 7-die and 11-die sets will be the polyhedral shapes you expect, and they'll have the numbers you expect.  All the rest...?  That's where the fun happens!\n Our first 10 sets are out of Dice Jail, and ready to be added to your pledge!\nAt funding, $25,000, we released ten (10) sets for your enjoyment.\nThen, every $5,000 in funding past the initial funding goal we've unlocked another set for \"as long as that model holds\".  That is: 11 sets at $30,000, 12 sets at $35,000, etc. All the way up through 25 sets unlocked at $100,000.  Now that we're at 25 sets, 2d2s, and 4 Weird Stuff that model needs to be adjusted slightly.\nNow, every $10,000... in funding past $100,000 in funding we'll unlock yet another set until the end of the campaign.\nALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED!\nTo keep things simple, we'll have one ever-changing \"Stretch Goal\" image below.\nTotal Sets Unlocked: 50! The final total! Everything's unlocked!!! : D\n\n\nVia your awesome support you have more than QUADRUPLED the original set quantity release!  That is truly awesome.  There are no chains on the options.  Let's make \"all the things\"!\n7-Die and 11-Die Sets*\nAll unlocked sets above will be available as 7-die and 11-die set options, with standard numerals for normal play.\n7-die sets: $9 per set.  (40% off average MSRP of $15)\nEach 7-die set contains: 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d%, 1d12, and 1d20.\n  11-die sets: $14 per set.  (40% off average MSRP of $23)\nEach 11-die set contains: 1d4, 4d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d%, 1d12, and 2d20.\n  The 3 extra d6 are great for all your backstabbery needs, and the extra d20 is perfect for Advantage/Disadvantage.\n  *We reserve the right to add free stuff to any dice set at any time.  - We've already applied free upgrades to 4 different sets.  More are likely.\nPlus we've got: Weird Stuff! \nYup, we've got Weird Stuff too!\nWe made the first one available at funding, and through Daily Puzzle Challenge submissions we've unlocked more!\nTo keep things simple here too, we'll have one ever-changing \"Weird Stuff\" unlock image below.\nTotal Weird Stuff Unlocked: 7!\n\nWait... \"Weird Stuff\"!?\nNot everything we want to do fits the traditional mold.  Literally and figuratively.  Therefore, in addition to the main unlocked sets, we'll occasionally add a totally new, totally different \"Weird Stuff\" option to the campaign.  \nAdd a \"Weird Stuff\" item to any pledge tier for: $24 each.  At funding there was only one, but now there's more, and we'll unlock even more still as we go!  Therefore the same No-Duplicates guarantee applies when you add more than 1 to your pledge.\nWhat will they be like?\nWeird.  I promise one thing and one thing only: They'll technically count as 'dice' and be well worth your money.  Beyond that, anything goes here!\nThey may or may not be: extra large or small sizes, over-full sets, special single dice, new materials, unusual numerals, odd molds, and all manner of chaos.\nWe're giving away zero other details here. : )\nLet me be clear: you do not want to miss these! \nNew Weird Stuff will unlock and be added as often as we think is good.  Sometimes with Daily Puzzle submissions (a community building must-see below), sometimes with funding, sometimes because I had a cool idea.  : ) They'll never take away from normal set unlocks above.\nPlus! For breaking $300,000:\nI'm going to upgrade the shipping box.  It's small little thing I've got in mind, especially as compared to the bajillion sets of dice inside of it, but I believe it'll increase your pleasure in even receiving your box ...and that for me is reason enough to do it.  \n\"What is it?\"  ...It's a Mystery! : )\nAlways loving to work together with others in this great gaming community, we invited the following people / organizations to Guest Design a Mystery Set.  It's our way of bringing people together.  Their brains design it, our hands make it.  Honestly, it's a lot of fun!\nWe've unlocked ALL of the Guest Designer Dice!  \nTen traditional sets, and two \"Weird Stuff\" from Jamey Stegmaier and Norse Foundry! \nNewest Addition: YOU!  We've named you, the Kickstarter Backers, the final Guest Designer on the campaign!  Post your suggestion in the comments.  Vote up suggestions by commenting on them.  From the top 10 ideas chosen by you, I'll secretly select the final winner at the close of the campaign!  \nGuest designers were given free reign to design a set as they see fit, with no real design limitations.\nThe following guidelines were given: It must be a new set nobody's ever done before in design and/or colors, it must have standard numerals on all faces*, and you can't tell anyone what it looks like till it ships.  ...naturally.\n*We have allowed the two dice groups, if they want to, to put their group's symbol/logo on the d20 and/or d6 (not all have accepted or even decided).  We leave it to them.\nWe only have one add on option, and that's our all new custom d2 design, created just for this campaign.  During the course of the campaign, we will unlock additional d2 coins as add ons.\nThere are currently: FIVE designs available...\nFirst d2 Option:\n#1) You may add the Campaign-Exclusive \"Mystery Die d2\" to any Pledge Tier for only $2/per. No limit.\nSize: Approx 25mm across, 5mm thick.\nRenders shown. Final design may vary.\nNew D2 Option! \nUnlocked for Making this the best GKG Campaign of all time!\n#2) You may add the Campaign-Exclusive \"Best Kickstarter Ever d2\" to any Pledge Tier for only $2/per. No limit.\nRender Shown. Final design may vary.\n\n3rd D2 Option!\nUnlocked for submitting 1750 correct puzzle submissions!\n#3) You may add the \"Decision Maker\" to your pledge for only $2/per.  No limit.\nColor Scheme chosen by the backers: \"Blazing Red and Free as the Sky Blue\"\nRender Shown. Final design may vary.\n4th D2 Option!\nUnlocked because you're awesome!\n#4) The \"Sun & Moon\" d2!  You are welcome to add \"Sun & Moon\" d2s to your pledge for only $2/per.  No limit.\nPossible uses for the Sun & Moon d2:\nDay or Night\nLight or Darkness\nGood Effect or Bad Effect\nGood Mood or Bad Mood (for random NPCs encountered)\nYes or No\nWin or Lose\nLife or Death\nFinal D2 Option!\n\"The Gate Keeper\"\n#5) Added on the final day to celebrate how amazing you all are.  This coin will likely become the icon of the GKG d2 line, and you'll be the first to own one.  Featuring our GKG invented color (sorta, but yes, but not really, buy heck yes), 'Power Teal'.   You are welcome to add \"The Gate Keeper\" d2s to your pledge for only $2/per.  No limit.\nRender Shown. Final design may vary.\nWe've got just two Pledge Tiers: \n The Grab Bag, for 7-die sets\n The Mystery Box, for 11-die sets\nPledging is easy!\nWant 7-die sets?  Choose \"The Grab Bag\" and pledge $9 for each 7-die set you want.\nWant 11-die sets?  Choose \"The Mystery Box\" and pledge $14 for each 11-die set you want.\nWant to add the Weird Stuff?  Simply add $24 for each Weird Stuff option you want, to ANY pledge tier.  Yes, you may add multiples/duplicates.\nWant to add special d2s?  Simply add $2 for each d2 you want, to ANY pledge tier.  Yes, you may add multiples/duplicates.  \nWeird Stuff and D2s do not count toward free shipping but will be included in free shipping if you have 3 or more normal sets in your pledge.\nMix and Match?\nYes, you can mix-and-match adding 7-die or 11-die sets along with Weird Stuff and d2s to ANY pledge tier, as freely as you like by pledging for the correct totals.  We'll clarify exactly what your pledge value is for in Backerkit during Pledge Management.\nNO DUPLICATE GUARANTEE:\nAll sets in your order will be unique; there will be no repeat/duplicate sets in your order.  So if you want all of them you are guaranteed all of them if you pledge for all of them.  If you DO want duplicates, you can A) Ask for them in Backerkit, or B) Pledge for more total sets than are offered.\n Wait, are you not going to show us the dice...? \nNaturally, because this is a Mystery Dice Campaign, to show you the sets would remove the Mystery!  Dice included will not be revealed until they ship to you this fall. But we're so confident in our quality, that we guarantee you'll like them!

FREE DICE! - I'm going to choose 3 sets, one will get +1d4, one will get +1d6, and and one will get +1d8.  I figure this will help Monks, Rogues, and Paladins respectively!  Thus the 7-die set of that type will become an 8-die set for free, and the 11-die set just became a 12-die set!  Maybe you'll get lucky and fetch one of these sets in your glorious Unboxing!  ...I told you \"I reserve the right to add free stuff to any set at any time\", didn't I?\n 1000 submitted correct answers: Now Unlocked! - A new \"Weird Stuff\" Guest Designed by our friends at Norse Foundry!  The theme is still TBD, but we'll let you know as soon as we do!\n 1750 submitted correct answers: Now Unlocked! - The ultimate d2 with it's colors selected by the community \"The Decision Maker\".  Now found in the Add-Ons section above.\n 2500 submitted correct answers: Now Unlocked! - A new Weird Stuff has be added as our final Puzzle Submission unlock!\nWe believe in our dice, and we believe in you.  We stand by everything on this campaign with the following 3 guarantees.\nGuarantee #1) No Duplicates: There will be no repeat sets in your order unless you specifically ask for them or if you pledge for more sets than we've unlocked.\nGuarantee #2) Quality Promise: After receiving your Mystery Dice, we're going to give you 14 whole days to play with them, and play with them you should! If you discover any quality issues, what-so-ever, we'll gladly replace your set or give you your money back, 100%.  Quality promise applies to all reward items; and \"Quality promise\" shipping is on us.\nGuarantee #3) Like Em, or Send Em Back: (LEOSEB) We're going to try new things, but have no intention of making ugly dice.  We're so certain they'll be gorgeous that if after receiving your Mystery Dice if you actually don't like them, for personal aesthetic reasons, we'll allow you to send sets back to us for a free Mystery replacement.  LEOSEB applies to normal sets only (7-die & 11-die), but due to the inherent weirdness-factor of Weird Stuff it does not apply to those items, or any d2 add ons.  To ensure this is a promise we can keep, all LEOSEB shipping will be the responsibility of the backer.  \nShipping should be simple, and the unboxing experience should be exciting!\nIt's flat rate.  No guessing, no games.  We're covering all weight upgrade costs for you world-wide. \nWe're offering to pay for your shipping in the USA.  Doesn't get easier than \"Free\". : )\nWe're covering all VAT charged in the UK, EU, and Canada.  Doesn't get any better than duty-free!\nVAT pre-paid and shipped directly to your door! No customs, no fees. I'm going to cover them for you personally.\nShipping fees, where applicable, will be collected after the campaign during Pledge Management in Backerkit. Note: Currently, Kickstarter has applied a $15 shipping fee for ALL international backers at the time of pledging. We've been working with Kickstarter to help us resolve it but they're unable to help.  Please know that this is ok, and we'll get it sorted in the Backerkit. For backers in the EU and \"Worldwide\" the small price difference will be collected after the campaign in the pledge manager.\nFor additional details on EU shipping, and a cost break down, I welcome you to please check out the FAQ tab.  Thank you.\nPlease note, to ensure our \"no duplicates\" policy is correctly applied, that our \"Like em or Send em Back\" policy can rightly occur, and to be able to offer Free Shipping in the USA, most fulfillment will be handled in house by me personally!  : )  In the UK and EU we'll be shipping from inside so that you don't have any VAT or import fees!\nBeyond these locations some countries may be responsible for customs or import fees.  You can calculate the estimated fees for your country here.  Import fees are usually 8%-20% of your total pledge value, while some countries do not charge fees for \"toys & games\" which our dice count as.  We believe our exceptional dice and shipping costs should help to offset some customs fees.  -  You are our first priority!\nBrought to you by:\n\"These are your dice!\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISK: You won't trust me.\n\nThoughts on Risk: You're going to have to decide this one for yourself, but to help, please know this: I've been in this business for 7 years, and this is Gate Keeper Games' 16th Kickstarter campaign with over 90 Gate Keeper Games & Dice exclusive sets under my belt so far. I've shipped every reward and kept every promise along the way. Your pledge will receive the same hands-on care and concern as every one that has come before you.\n\nRISK: You fear you might not like what you get.\n\nThoughts on Risk: See, that's kind of the fun of it.

UPDATE: Because we have hit a stretch goal, Kickstarter backers at the Junior Alchemist and up level will receive a 2nd refill kit. More on the refill kit below.   \nIt would mean so much to us if you would help us reach our funding goal by pledging for a copy of the game! We do also understand that everyone\u2019s circumstances are different in these uncertain times. As long as supplies last, Patron and Apprentice backers will be able to upgrade their pledge at a later date when things are hopefully more certain.    \nUPDATE: The enamel pin poll is open in update #8. Because we reached our $150k stretch goal, the winner of the poll will be included for Junior Alchemist backers, and BOTH pins will be included in the Apprentice Pack! \nJoin us for puzzles throughout the campaign! \nThe story of The Emerald Flame revolves around working with the Koschei Historical Society to analyze a legendary alchemist\u2019s work\u2026 but The Koschei Society first needs your help to find that work! You are being invited to join the investigation at its earliest stages and help them follow a series of clues that will hopefully lead to the location of the alchemist\u2019s hiding spot.   \nWe expect to find 5 artifacts, one of which will be posted on the Koschei Society forum every Wednesday evening, before being shared publicly on Thursdays in our campaign updates and on social media. You can join the forum to see the puzzles early and/or to solve them with others as a group!\nTo join the forum, find the two words hidden somewhere on this Kickstarter page. One will complete this link www.koscheisociety.org/__________ (10 letters) and the other will give you a 5-letter password (enter in lowercase) to access the page. Regardless of whether or not you join the forum, any backer who submits all 5 correct answers before the end of the campaign will be entered to win a special art prize! You can submit your answers at www.koscheisociety.org/submit.\nIf you're having trouble figuring out the password, take a look at the banner below and see if a tilt in perspective helps. :)   \nNow that we have hit our funding goal, we\u2019ve got lots of great stretch goals for The Emerald Flame, including upgraded components and additional items! You can help us reach them by sharing the project on social media - the more people we can get it out to, the more we can unlock all sorts of goodies! \n Share the project and follow at the links below! \nPostCurious Website\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nBoard Game Geek\nAlways another puzzle! With The Emerald Flame in your hands you can discover 3 secret messages hiding in the box artwork.\nAbout the refill kit: Now that we have hit our first stretch goal, the refill kit will include one set of replacements for the non-reusable components, should you want to repackage and pass the game on to someone else. PDFs will be also be provided for the paper components in case extras are needed or if you are playing with a friend remotely. One of our next stretch goals is an additional copy of the refill kit, which would mean a total of 3 possible play-throughs of the game.    \nRest assured we did our best to find the most reliable and affordable shipping options we could, and are also subsidizing shipping to all regions by $3 USD. Please note that the chart below shows shipping estimates, and shipping will be charged after the campaign using a pledge manager. Depending on your location and postage prices at the time of fulfillment, it may be necessary to adjust the shipping cost by a small amount.   \n**Rest of the world disclaimer: We are willing to ship worldwide, but please note that countries not listed in the shipping chart above will be considered \u201cship at your own risk\u201d areas, meaning we cannot be held responsible for mishandled packages. COVID-19 guidelines have also forced the USPS to temporarily suspend shipping to certain countries around the world. We do not know when these restrictions will be lifted, and it\u2019s very possible this won\u2019t be relevant by the time rewards are shipped out, but for the time being we will not be able to ship to the countries on this list.\nTo streamline the process as much as possible and offer more affordable shipping to international backers, we plan to warehouse in the US and UK, partnering with Quartermaster Logistics for backers in the Americas, Oceania, and Asia, and GamesQuest for backers in the UK and Europe. Please note that while we are offering customs friendly shipping to USA, Canada, UK, EU, Australia, New Zealand, & China backers, we cannot be responsible for VAT or customs charges incurred outside of these regions. \nPlay The Emerald Flame in your language: The majority of puzzles in The Emerald Flame do not depend on language and the few that do require only a very basic understanding of English. To make The Emerald Flame more accessible to a global audience, we currently plan to translate all the text in the game to make playing in Spanish, German, and French as easy as possible. Players will be able to download a free PDF and read all the clues and letters in their chosen language while using the physical components to solve the puzzles. For other language requests feel free to reach out to us and if there is significant demand we will look into the possibility.\nJuega a The Emerald Flame (La llama esmeralda) en tu propio idioma: La resoluci\u00f3n de la mayor\u00eda de los acertijos de Emerald Flame no depende del idioma, y los pocos en los que es necesario basta con unas nociones b\u00e1sicas de ingl\u00e9s.

If everything goes according to plan we should be able to deliver MUCH SOONER than what is shown on this schedule, but due to the complexity of manufacturing this game and the current global circumstances, we are being overly cautious with our promised ship dates in case we encounter any unexpected delays.\nDesign and development - May 2018 - March 2020\nKickstarter campaign - May - June 2020\nKickstarter funds deposited, format files for printing - July 2020\nSampling and production - August 2020 - May 2021\nDelivery of The Emerald Flame & standard reward tiers - Aug 2021\nDelivery of Collector\u2019s Edition reward tiers - Sept 2021\nPlease note that due to the personalized nature of the Collector\u2019s Edition, delivery for these tiers will come shortly after the standard version. We hope you\u2019ll understand these will require a little extra time to get the special attention they deserve. \nWe want to be as transparent as possible with our funding. Although there have been many costs incurred throughout the development of the project, our funding goal includes only what we need to make the game and deliver it to you.

After working in the escape room industry, she was inspired to create her first game, The Tale of Ord, by her love of nature, mythology, and the journey of discovery that can be created through puzzles and gamified storytelling. The Emerald Flame follows this inspiration, and after nearly two years of development and meticulous crafting, Rita can\u2019t be more excited to finally bring it to Kickstarter and share it with the world. \nPLAY\n\nRita holds a BFA in Furniture Design from the Rhode Island School of Design and loves talking to other creators about making things.

These will be done immediately after the Kickstarter campaign ends while we wait for the funds so there should be no delays on the creative front. If we reach certain stretch goals, there may be some additional artwork to produce, but we don\u2019t foresee this causing any delay as it can be completed during the sampling phase.\n\nManufacturing \n\nThis will be PostCurious\u2019 first time working with a manufacturer, which comes with its own challenges. The Emerald Flame is a complex game to produce, so sampling with the factory may take some time. The production copy will be fully inspected by us to make sure everything looks and works the way it should. Please note that due to material availability and manufacturing processes, some components may appear different than shown in the prototype images. As with any project that has complex custom components, there is also a risk of changes or delays, which is why we\u2019ve factored in extra time for manufacturing. We want to make sure the game is perfect for all our backers, and will always keep you updated in case of any changes.\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\n\nDelivering hundreds of games around the world is not an easy task, and there are many potential factors that could cause delays. We\u2019ll be partnering with Quartermaster Logistics for backers in the Americas, Australia, and Asia, and GamesQuest for backers in the UK and Europe. Both companies are experts in the field and we have full confidence in their ability to troubleshoot whatever obstacles may arise. Please note that while we guarantee customs friendly shipping to USA, Canada, UK, EU, AU, NZ & China backers, we cannot be responsible for VAT or customs charges incurred outside of these regions. Please also note that shipping will be charged after the campaign, and the numbers shown in the shipping chart are estimates only.\n\nCountries not listed in the chart of the \u201cshipping\u201d section above on this page are considered to be \u201cship at your own risk\u201d areas, meaning we cannot be responsible for mishandled packages in those regions. It is unclear how Brexit will affect shipping into the EU, but we\u2019ve been assured by GamesQuest that there are contingency plans in place should the outcome create obstacles in fulfillment. We do not expect this to affect anyone\u2019s rewards, but we will keep you posted if any changes occur. \n\nUnforeseen Events\n\nThroughout this process there is always a large number of variables at play, and many factors that could cause delays or changes. This could include severe weather, a global pandemic, or other unexpected circumstances. It is impossible to predict the outcome of such events or how they might affect the production of this project, but we will do everything we reasonably can to make sure the rewards are produced and delivered as promised. We are 100% committed to our backers and will always be sure to notify you with any changes that might affect this project\u2019s content, timeline, shipping, or otherwise. \n\nRefunds \n\nRefund requests received within 14 days of the end of the Kickstarter will be honored in full. Refunds requested after two weeks have passed will be subject to a 15-20% cancellation fee due to Kickstarter fees and administrative expenses. Once your order has been processed for shipping, we will no longer be able to offer refunds. Please note that anyone who does not complete the pledge manager by our required deadlines will not be eligible for a refund, and may encounter delays in receiving their rewards. \n\nBy pledging to this project you are indicating that you understand and give consent to the risks, challenges, and pledge terms laid out above.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Watchful Eye", "descp": "Just curious?

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge, with 1 or 3 comics and their related promos. Estimates for 2 comics will fall in the price range between the 1-3 estimates. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.  \nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 44th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays \n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is February 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).
