You pile of shit.\nIf there is ONE THING every human can agree on, it's that 2020 was an absolute shit show.\nWhile some bullshit continues to linger into 2021, we'd like to commemorate our specie's survival the only way we know how; with a new, fun, 39mm 1oz. coin!\nAvailable in 3 Colors\nThis coin is available for a limited time in three colors. You choose which you'd like, or mix and match your favorites! They are available in:\nCopper (Shiny) \nGold (Shiny) \nBronze\nFine Details\nNothing says \"SHIT SHOW\" like an anus stretched out to the MAX, birthing mammoth clumps of crap, and spurting splatters of pressurized feces! (Bronze Coin)\n\nIn 2020, all arrows missed the mark! (Copper Coin)\nWe came, we saw, we survived! (Gold Coin)\n\nWhat a circus it's been! (Bronze Coin)\n\n Coin Size/Specs \nEach of the \"SHIT SHOW\" coins is 1.54\" (39mm) in diameter (approximately the same as a Silver Dollar) and .116\" thick (3mm), and weighs in at a solid 1oz. These coins are an extremely high quality mint and are akin to a traditional military challenge coin (noticeably larger and heavier than our other regular coins).\nCoin Materials/Metals\n Copper - Copper - Our Copper coins are made from .999 pure 1oz AVDP Copper. It is bright in color and very durable. These coins will gain a beautiful patina over time if not polished.\n Gold - Proprietary Blend  - This blend is a solid brass alloy, formulated to look like 18KT gold. Aside from its durability and weight, this alloy reproduces the finest detail. After minting, each coin is individually coated with fine jewelers lacquer to retard tarnishing.\n Bronze - Proprietary Blend  - This blend is the same brass alloy used in the gold version, but is then chemically aged to build up a rich oxidized coating giving it the bronze finish. Upon completion, each coin is also individually coated with fine jewelers lacquer to retard tarnishing.\nStretch Goals\n1st 500 Backers a FREE Limited Edition Golden 2021 Zero Fucks Coin!\n#1 - **UNLOCKED**  - $5,000 - Once our initial goal is reached, all first-day backers or the first 500 backers (whichever is reached first) will receive a FREE LIMITED EDITION Gold \"2021\" Zero Fucks/Middle Finger Coin! These coins are a 1-time minting, EXCLUSIVELY for this Kickstarter project!!!\n\n#2 - **UNLOCKED**  - $30,000 - All \"Shit Show\" coins will be automatically upgraded to be packed in FREE clear protective capsule hard-cases!\n\nReceive a free coin capsule with every coin if goal #2 is unlocked!\n\n#3 - **LOCKED**  - $75,000 - All backers who've pledged $25 or more will receive TWO FREE blemished \"2020\" Zero Fucks/Middle Finger Coins! 2020 was a \"blemished\" year in general, so this only seems appropriate.\n\n#4 - **LOCKED**  - $100,000 - All backers who've pledged $25 or more will receive an additional TWO FREE blemished coins, for a total of 4 FREE COINS (or 5 FREE Coins if you're also one of the 1st 500 backers)!!!\n\n100% Designed & Manufactured in the USA!\nAll of our coins are our original designs, and we take GREAT PRIDE in the fact we design and manufacture all of our coins right here in the good ol' USA!\nTimeline\nPunctuality is important to us, and we plan to have everything shipped on or before May 1st.

With over 30 000 desk toys delivered to more than 16 000 people all around the World we are back to show you our newest creation\na Spinning top like no other, designed after a beautiful motion found in nature- the moment of a falling raindrop hitting the surface of water and creating ripples all around.\nCombined with the precision machined desktop stand mezmoTop\u2122 makes a timeless desk sculpture- kinetic art piece to compliment any tabletop or shelf.\nUNIQUE SPINNING MOTION\nDue to it's unique shape and low gravity center mezmoTop\u2122 presents truly amusing and surprisingly stable spinning characteristics. It will spin in multiple ways depending on how you interact with it.\nExplore endless ways of motion- spin it smoothly or from an angle, launch them together, throw from a distance or upside down. \nBEAUTIFUL METALS\nCrafted out of a solid block of Stainless Steel or Titanium and carefully shaped to replicate the surface of a rippling water. An object that is bending the borders between engineering and art. \nPolished VS Bead blasted\nSPINNING BASE\nPrecisely fitted base combines with the spinning top body creating a one of a kind desk sculpture. Flip it over and it becomes a concave spinning base which allows to achieve rotation times up to 5-6 minutes.\nThe connection tolerance between mezmoTop\u2122 and the base is so precise that it creates a slight air resistance when the top is placed into the stand. In the close up it looks very satisfying- like the top would slide in a slow motion for a second.\nA mesmerizing desk sculpture\nTHE PERFECT DESK COMPANION\nWe specialize in creating unique and extraordinary kinetic desk toys that bring a bit of magic in our daily routine and mezmoTop\u2122 is no exception.\nThe solid body and smooth finish make it very pleasant to interact with and it spins with ease on any desk or flat surface. A simple way to get out of your daily routine and relax between busy working hours.\nRotating still it creates an almost magical impression of a moment when the time stops.\nORIGINAL GIFT\nWant to surprise someone? mezmoTop\u2122 makes a truly great and original present that creates a bit of magic every time you interact with it. Each unit is designed with attention to the smallest detail and built to last a lifetime. \nA conversation starter- an eye-catching centerpiece that won't stay unnoticed on any desk or shelf.\nBut don't take just our word for it.  See what our previous backers are saying about our products:\nEXCEPTIONAL PRECISION\nWith our CNC machines, we are able to achieve such level of precision that is rarely found in regular everyday objects. You\u2019ll instantly notice minutely milled lines and smooth surface texture upon touching mezmoTop\u2122 for the first time!\nA tungsten carbide ball is pressed in as a contact point for each spinning top. It guarantees the perfectly smooth rotation and durability. Every unit is manufactured in our local workshop and goes through high standard quality check. The final result is a machined masterpiece that you would enjoy to use every day.\nmezmoTop\u2122 is available in two metals and two surface finishes. We offer Stainless steel or Titanium versions, both metals are available with polished or bead blasted (matte) surface finish. \nThe finish of the bead blasted Titanium version has a slightly darker tone than the Stainless steel and it is lighter as well. The looks of it reminds me of the surface of the Moon:)\nGet both surface versions and switch between bases to create mixed design combinations.\nEach spinning top originally comes with a plastic stand to keep it still on your desktop while not spinning.The metal bottom which also serves as a spinning base is available in specific reward levels you can check out below.\nI am Kristoph, the 10-time Kickstarter creator, and designer of mezmoTop\u2122. You might know some of my previous projects like Moondrop, Vortecon, Mezmoglobe, ManualPen, Mezmocoin and others. Together with my two brothers and team, we have previously created 9 campaigns with more than 16 000 backers joining us. Our greatest inspiration is the amazing feedback from our supporters.\nThis is our passion, our hobby, and our job. With every project, we try to bring something new to the World and Kickstarter is an amazing platform to do that. Our supporters get the best price and a unique chance to follow the whole manufacturing process.

It has the unique ability to brighten someone's day, or ruin it, in record-setting time! It all depends on the situation and circumstance you choose to use it!\nAt first glance, the recipient of this coin will smile as they gaze upon this classic smiley face. They will continue to be delighted as the flip it over and read \"Have a nice day...\" Watch as you see their demeanor quickly change (to either laughter or outrage) as they find themselves being addressed as an ASSHOLE and punctuated with a glorious middle finger to really drive the point home!\nFront: The antiquing effect applied to these coins really brings out the depth!\nBack: The star-bursting middle finger really let's them know what time it is!\nTwo Cents Coin: \nWe've all said it, and now we can actually give it \u2013 My two cents!

For that reason the lids will be white not turquoise. Countertop Fitness will have different colors in the future and goals for licensing sports teams, comic book characters, movies, ect. We plan to scale having more products like a carrying case, vitamin holder, wall mount system, and different configurations.\nWhy Crowdfunding?\nOur trusted manufacturing partners need a minimum financial commitment from us to get started on a larger manufacturing run. This is why we have set our funding goal to $5,000. By achieving this funding goal, we are able to put in a larger order to enable us to serve the customer demand, as well as packaging, shipping, marketing, ect. We will be able to reinvest those funds back into the business to fund a larger continuous marketing campaign with more ads, attending events, and seeking distribution. We want to reach our goals as a successful company with the ability to increase the workforce, empower women as ambassadors, and give back to community. \nSpecial thanks and heartfelt appreciation to our backers and friends who have helped along the way.

Even your friends and few will back your project. (The 80-20 rule is real) Lesson 2: The word \"Fitness\" in Countertop Fitness scares people. Or at least people who didn't get that fitness meant making your countertops less bulky and trying to get the assumed main market to take notice. Lesson 3: Marketing takes money. Lesson 4: Facebook Ads are hard but are a necessary evil. Lesson 5: People have and extremely short attention span and don't like to read. Lesson 6: Kickstarter tells you people want to hear your story. No one wants to hear your story. They want to know what your product is and how it will enrich their lives...

We will use the money raised to start producing and selling Ogre Sauce Hot.\nA hot version of Ogre Sauce has been the #1 request since day one. We have been working on adding the perfect amount of heat without changing the flavor of the original Ogre Sauce for a long time. We've done it. Now we need to raise enough money produce a batch for you and the world.\nAbout Ogre Sauce\nOgre Sauce is an All-Purpose BBQ Sauce created in Charlotte NC. We call it \"All-Purpose\" because it can used on so many foods, with mouth watering results - not just traditional barbecue. Mike \"Ogre\" Weeks found his grandmother's recipe, made it his own, and before long he was selling it in 5 gallon buckets out of the trunk of his car. With the recipe perfected, we bottled it, and now want the whole world to taste it.\nWe are back with a new spicy version of the original Ogre Sauce recipe. We are still all natural, with no high fructose corn syrup or preservatives, but now our sauce has a very very small amount of Carolina Reaper. Don't be scared - even though South Carolina's Reaper is called the world's hottest pepper, we use such a small amount that it has a kick without being too hot. \nOgre Sauce Hot is a medium-hot version of the award-winning Ogre Sauce. \nNot too hot, but spicy enough to give your food a kick.\nNot too hot. Middle Weight.\nWe are going on the Tijuana Flats hot sauce bar. How cool is that?\nThank you so much for your support. The prices were set so that we can not only cover the cost of making and shipping some sauce to you, but also use the money to help us produce some inventory and bring it to the world. Thank you again for all of the love and support you have already given us.\nAs a Thank You all Rewards come with an Ogre Sauce beer Koozie, a sticker, and the one-of-a-kind Ogre Sauce cookbook.\n July 2nd   \nKickstarter Campaign Begins\nAugust 2nd \nKickstarter Campaign Ends\nBacker surveys sent \nSauce ordered\nAugust 12th  \nSauce arrives from manufacturer\nReward fulfillment.

We began with a simple keychain as a jumping-off point but also wanted to design a tool that would handle every step when preparing a meal around the campfire. \nEvery function of the Wootz EDC had to work great in its own right.

As you\u2019d expect from Quiet Carry, we\u2019ve worked in some gorgeous lines to create a grippy workhorse worthy of the centerstage.\nThis is an EDC tool that produces real results.  Function, beauty, and value...\nThe Inspiration\nThe is Chase is designed to do what a everyday knife is supposed do - excel at a variety of tasks. We found our inspiration for the Chase in the utility of the classic fixed blade knife and gave it a stellar appeal. With its delicate balance and ergonomics, this style of knife is designed with utility in mind. We wanted to bring the rugged and utilitarian features of the fixed blade into a sleek and civilized package that is just at home in the woods as it is at the office. The Chase is the amalgam of these two philosophies.\nPlease note: You will be able to choose your handle and blade finish in the ending survey for all pledges >>\nThe Form\nThe Chase boasts many rugged features that suggest hard use, but you certainly couldn\u2019t tell by just looking at it. It features clean lines \u2014creating a satisfyingly symmetrical silhouette. Let\u2019s just say that this is one of those times when it\u2019s okay to stare...\nWhen closed the sleekness of the Chase also shows through. We\u2019ve generously recessed the blade for a slim carry and more discreet look that won\u2019t startle the passer-by.\n Specifications\nBlade Length: 2.95\u201d \nHandle Length: 3.96\" \nBlade Material: N690co Stainless Steel Blade \nBlade Type: Drop point \nOption 1 Handle Material: G10 fiberglass epoxy resin weight: 2.8 oz \nOption 2 Handle Material: Sea GreyHand poured resin weight: 2.6 oz\nBlade Grind: Flat\nLock: Liner Lock\nBlade thickness: 0.104 inches\nBlade Coating: PVD coating\nClip Coating: PVD coating\nWashers: Phosphor bronze\nCarry Type: Tip-up\nThe N690 grade of steel is produced by a small Austrian steel plant that also provides steel for surgical instruments. The key to the hardness of N690 is the addition of cobalt in the steel matrix. The cobalt creates uniformity in the structure within the steel. The value of cobalt in a knife blade is it produces a fine edge with excellent edge retention. Target hardness is 60 HRC. \nThe Handle\nA hard use knife needs some hard use scales/handle, so we\u2019ve outfitted the Chase with textured G10\u2014a fiberglass-based epoxy resin laminate that is impervious to water, easy to maintain, and extremely strong. Naturally, the Chase excels outdoors and is eager to get dirty. What\u2019s more, these G10 scales are lightweight for unobtrusive everyday carry.\nThe Chase measures in at 6\u201d but with the wider blade helps with bigger tasks. We\u2019ve also added a bit more width into the handle/scales to help fill your palm for a comfortable and secure grip. It also has a deep finger notch with a tucked away liner lock release to further promote grip and control.\nThe Chase is also offered in gorgeous Sea Grey scales with a smooth matte finish. Made of hand-poured resin and made in small batches, this handle option features a mesmerizing marbling pattern of sea green and dark grey. What we really love about these scales is the authentic feel. No two scales have the same pattern\u2014making for a knife that is truly one-of-a-kind.\nThe Clip\nWhen you\u2019re on the move, a deep carry pocket clip affixed to the handle ensures you can carry the Chase discreetly. This knife disappears in your pocket and is as unassuming as a ballpoint pen. We find that big clunky clips are not necessary and a small secure clip placed in the right location is all you need. Of course, with the understated beauty of the Chase, you\u2019ll hardly want this knife disappearing anywhere in all honesty.\nStreamlined - No Clunk\n The Blade\nWe wanted the Chase to excel in a range of tasks, so durability and versatility were our foremost priorities when designing the blade and handle. The blade steel is corrosion-resistant N690 Cobalt Stainless Steel. We also offer a protective PVD blade coating to go the extra mile in wet environments.\nThe Chase sports a drop point with a generous belly that cuts, chops, and slices. Deep jimping on the spine of the blade enhance traction and inspires confidence in hand. At 2.95\u201d long and 1\u201d wide at its widest point, this blade offers the strength of a bigger knife while staying within legal carry limits. When clipped to your pocket, the Chase features a tip-up configuration that\u2014when combined with the thumb cutout\u2014makes for some easy and smooth actuation. Blade comes with a flat grind.\nThe Feel\nA knife can only be as great as the man or woman that wields it, so we\u2019ve made it a priority that the Chase inspires the utmost confidence every time it\u2019s in your hand. Its full, curving body sits naturally in your palm for a comfortable and secure grip. The textured G10 scales double down on traction even in moist conditions.\nThe Chase uses phosphor bronze washers for smooth action and easy maintenance. This versatile EDC is equipped with a stainless steel liner lock and a crisp click that accompanies the locking of the blade.\nThe Function & Practicality\nThe Chase is one tough knife\u2014one that handles various tasks with ease. Given that our inspiration was the classic fixed blade knife, the Chase is a folding knife that boasts practical and utilitarian features that will get the job done. Where the Chase distinguishes itself is its sleek and elegant form that lends itself to fuss-free carry in more civilized settings.\nQuality\nThese knives are custom manufactured. Every corner has been meticulously machined. The phosphor bronze pivot, PVD-coated N690 steel blade, strong deep pocket clip, and textured G10 are quality materials that make a knife that lasts.\nThese knives are exceptionally made with tight tolerances, which demands more time, skill, and precision to make them. We make well-thought out knives and cutting tools.  We combine simple clean design while excelling in function.\n The Warranty\nHere at Quiet Carry, we\u2019re proud of our work, and we never settle for anything less than the best. The top quality materials, machining and construction. We\u2019re so confident that our knives will serve you and serve you well that every Quiet Carry knife comes with a lifetime warranty.\nWe are humble yet proud of our products, and we\u2019re glad that those of you that have your own Quiet Carry knife love them, too. Here is what our supporters have to say about our products: \nan Jelinek on December 21, \"Received both of my knives and I\u2019m highly impressed with the craftsmanship, superb fit and finish.

TONY\"\nMark \"HoverDonkey\" \"Craig on April 23, \"Received mine today and was immediately impressed by the quality. Obsessively opened and closed it for a couple of hours whilst watching TV, the action was so satisfying! By no means cheap, but I'm confident that it will last for decades - really well constructed item, made with well specced materials. Not only that, but it was manufactured, shipped and delivered well in advance of my expectations! Thanks!\"\nYair Gal on April 16, \"My two arrived today. Nicely made and well finished.

We have learned that with time and patience our vision will come together, and it goes without saying that a lot of work went into getting the Chase just right.

Simply rotate it to reveal the mind-bending effect of a continuously flowing helix. \nA piece of kinetic art that invites you to transform it from precisely engineered still shape into hypnotic optical illusion. Vortecon is made out of solid stainless steel, brass or copper. It has a helix-shaped groove milled alongside the edge that continues as a symmetrical spiral on the top plane. \nWhen revolving it creates an almost magical effect that looks like continuously flowing helix would merge into a surface of tabletop.\nVortecon is designed to spin on any desk or flat surface. The solid body and smooth finish make it very pleasant to interact with. It spins silently so you won't be bothering anyone around.\nPerfect for creators, makers, thinkers and anyone who wants to release their inner creativity and imagination. Keep focus, relieve stress or simply relax during working hours or brainstorming sessions.\nSpin Vortecon and it will turn into a dynamic sculpture that changes its patterns along with direction and speed of rotation. There are multiple ways you can interact with Vortecon - spin it as a single unit or stack them together to make it look even more impressive.\nEach Vortecon has a rotating base that is equipped with high quality stainless steel bearing. It guarantees smooth and silent spin as well as long lasting. The base is removable to easy access the bearing.\nWe believe optical illusion is a unique way to bring excitement to anyone. Vortecon makes a truly great and original present that creates a bit of magic every time you interact with it. Each unit is designed with attention to the smallest detail and built to last a lifetime.\nWe love to see the reactions when someone spins Vortecon for the first time. It instantly creates that ''WOW'' effect. The most frequent ones: WHAT?!..., Again please..., HOW?!....:)...\nEvery Vortecon is manufactured on aerospace-grade lathes from solid brass, copper or stainless steel. With our CNC machines, we are able to achieve such level of precision that is rarely found in regular everyday objects. You\u2019ll instantly notice minutely milled lines and smooth surface texture upon touching Vortecon for the first time!\nStainless Steel Vortecon\nStainless Steel is durable and corrosion resistant metal. It is perfect for creating an object that will last forever- even after hundred years it will look as good as new. \nCopper Vortecon\nCopper is very dense and unique metal that will attain beautiful tarnish over the time. It means that it will slowly darken and get its own unique pattern. \nMany love copper for its characteristics. It is pretty easy to renew the shiny surface with any of widely available polishing kits. \nBrass Vortecon\nBrass is beautiful metal with a yellowish tone. It has pretty similar characteristics with copper- it is very dense and heavy. After a bit longer time it will attain the unique patina effect as well.\n               Know someone who you think might be interested in this project? Spread a word- it will help us bring new upgrades and stretch goals.\nHello, I am Kristoph, the creator, and designer of Vortecon. You might know me from my previous Kickstarter projects - Moondrop, Gr2 Spheres and others. Together with my two brothers and team, we have created four successful campaigns with more than 4000 backers joining us. One of our greatest inspirations is the amazing feedback we get from our supporters:\nIn our team, everyone is a creator and we truly love what we are doing. This is our passion, our hobby, and our job. Kickstarter is an amazing platform where we can offer our supporters a great price and unique chance to follow whole manufacturing process.

Upon completion, each coin is also individually coated with fine jewelers lacquer to retard tarnishing.\nDecision Maker (Silver) - Nickel-Silver\nNickel-Silver is a heavyweight alloy that is is bright silver in color, scratch resistant, non-tarnishing and very durable.\nRat's Ass - Nickel-Silver\nNickel-Silver is a heavyweight alloy that is is bright silver in color, scratch resistant, non-tarnishing and very durable.\nHoliday Delivery\nNothing Says \"Season's Greetings\" like a close up of a rat's anus\n  Punctuality is important to us! If you are a previous customer, or previous backer, you know we always deliver! Just look at our previous project, we actually delivered ahead of schedule.\nEach side of the Decision Maker is marked with a ZFG (Zero Fucks Given) \"H\" for heads, and \"T\" for tails\n  We plan to have ALL REWARDS shipped in time for X-mas! (for US/Domestic orders)\nOur estimated Ship date is December 15th.\nShipping generally takes 3-4 days for US/Domestic orders, so we estimate that you should receive your rewards (in the US) by December 20th. This IS NOT a guarantee, but it is the most likely scenario.\nInternational orders, we CANNOT promise delivery in time for X-mas. Most transit times take about 10-days, and that does not include any delays with customs, which there usual are. Because of this, it is highly unlikely any International shipments will arrive before December 25th.\nShare Our Project\nThe more you share our project by posting it on Facebook, tweeting about it, emailing it, sharing on Reddit etc. the more likely it is we'll be able to unlock all the stretch goals and give you some free coins.\nSo if you're in a good fucking mood, and like what you see, please help us spread the word!

It is a retro throwback integrated with modern technology. And it sounds incredible. \nEach ROTO is a custom-built 3-speaker system of the highest quality, encased within an ACTUAL upcycled vintage rotary phone. It is the first functional conversation-piece that proudly pairs the innovation of yesterday with the innovation of today. And there will only be 100 of them created. Ever.\nThe Western Electric Co. produced this iconic piece of technology during the mid-20th century. Since the advent of digital phones, these rotary phones have disappeared into obscurity. Now they are back (for a limited time) with a twist of functionality, sounding better than ever.\nROTO connects wirelessly to your smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc... using the wireless technology that your device already has. \nThe handset rotates horizontally to reveal two additional speakers.\nThe speaker system boasts a 4\" mid-bass driver with excellent bass response, and two 1\" tweeters for crisp high frequencies. The back panel features an AUX cable jack, two USB ports for charging your phone/tablet/laptop/etc..., a power switch, and a DC power jack.\n  AUX cable jack, two USB charging ports, power switch, and DC power jack\n  ROTO provides stellar audio while adding character and interest to any room in your home.\n  it sounds as good as it looks\n  disassembly and upcycle\n  \"holed\" the phone!\n   FAQ: the nuts & bolts\nPlease read all of this section. These are things you should absolutely know as you pledge on this project...\n1. Is ROTO \"brand new?\" Yes and no. The audio components are brand new and of the highest quality. The phone case is NOT new. It is vintage; that is a large part of the appeal and uniqueness of this project! These phones come from multiple sources, and in some cases the date of manufacture ranges from 30-60 years ago. They will have wear, they will have scratches. That's what gives them character. With that said, they will not have humongous cracks or be structurally unsound. These phone cases were built tough and rugged (as was typical of things from that era), so the durability is there, but, again, they will definitely have the look of some wear and tear.\n2. Can ROTO connect (get signal) from the USB ports? No. The two USB ports are solely for charging your devices. With that said, you can certainly have your device charging via the USB port while it is simultaniously connected wirelessly to ROTO, playing sweet music while your device charges. \n3. Why is the price so high? The parts and components are high quality and pretty expensive. Additionally, the amount of time it takes to disassemble, upcycle, build, and test each unit is considerable; many hours for each unit. Many comparable in-home (non-portable) wireless speakers available at major electronics stores cost upwards of $200-300. Finally, this is not a mass-produced product; this is a hand-built item of my own creativity, made just for you.\n4. Can I choose the color? Yes, unless there is an unforeseen shortage. They will be black or white. With that said, if I receive an overwhelming amount of orders and my supplier cannot supply enough black or white phones, I will have to use whatever color is available to me. I don't foresee this actually being a problem, but please remember these phones are fairly scarce nowadays and I will have to work with what is available. You may wind up with a white one, a red one, a green one, etc... If it actually comes down to that, I will attempt to ask for each backer's preference, and while no guarantees will be made on color, I will try my hardest to accommodate requests.\n5. How long will they take to deliver? A while! 2-3 months minimum AFTER the campaign has ended. Maybe even slightly longer. I am one person, not a giant company, and I will be building each one with as much care and precision as possible. It will take time.\n6. Is it battery-powered or does it plug into the wall for power? It plugs into the wall. It has no batteries. The DC power adapter is included with the unit.\n7. How does the handset stay in-place when it is rotated up horizontally? Two sets of hidden neodymium magnets hold the handset rotated up. The magnets are hidden when the handset is in its original orientation (speakers facing the floor). You can choose to rotate them up, or leave them down. It's mostly an aesthetic choice on your part, but keep in mind that the tweeters will have better projection if the handset is rotated up. There is no switch to turn the tweeters on or off. They are always on when the unit is powered on.\n8. Does ROTO have a volume control? No. Volume will be controlled from the device that is supplying the music.\n9. Is there a cover/grill for the exposed speaker? No. If you have kids that like to poke shiny expensive things, keep ROTO out of their reach!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBuilding each ROTO by hand, with a high level of care and precision, will take a fair amount of time. That is the challenge. Luckily, I have developed an efficient approach that should minimize build-time and maximize efficiency. With that said, I will ship the rewards out as each one is built, not all at once. Therefore, some of you will receive your reward before others do. There isn't any favoritism happening here, just the nature of taking care and time with building each ROTO individually.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 300 or more", "title": "ROTO speaker (black color)", "descp": "One (1) black-colored ROTO.

Stretch Goal #2.\nIf we reach $50,000 everyone who has backed us for $5 or more will receive a Free Ogre Sauce T-shirt.\n_____________________________________________\nOgre Sauce is a Different kind of BBQ sauce.\nAbout Ogre Sauce \nOgre Sauce is an All-Purpose BBQ Sauce created in Charlotte NC. We call it \"All-Purpose\" because it can used on so many foods, with mouth watering results - not just traditional barbecue. Mike \"Ogre\" Weeks found his grandmother's recipe, made it his own, and before long he was selling it in 5 gallon buckets out of the trunk of his car.  With the recipe perfected, we bottled it, and now want the whole world to taste it. \nWe are making a name for ourselves in the Charlotte area, but we have hit a wall. In order to continue innovating and growing WE NEED YOUR HELP. \nOur vision is to continue to be different than other sauce companies. We will use the money raised towards Ogre Sauce product innovations.\nYour support will help us bring new and innovative products to the sauce market, such as\nYearly sauce subscription plans \n Craft 6-packs \nWork towards becoming Certified Organic and Certified Gluten Free \nCreate new varieties such as Vegan and Spicy\n The funding will help with\nResearch and Development \nTesting for Certification \nIngredient sourcing \n Packaging\nOgre Sauce is in a few stores and restaurants in the southern U.S., but if we raise $6,000 or more:\nWe will be able to place a minimum size order that is big enough to bring our manufacturing costs way down. \n Big savings for us means big saving for our backers. \n More resources for marketing, so we can tell the world what our fans already know, Ogre Sauce is amazing! More food and beer festivals, more food trucks, more restaurants, more stores. We love being in Whole Foods, but we love meeting fans directly more!\nFrom our bottle, to our name, to Ogre's remarkable story, to our one-of-a-kind recipe, Ogre Sauce is unlike any sauce you've tasted.\nYou wouldn't call Prince \"just a musician\".\nYou wouldn't call bacon \"just food\".\nYou wouldn't call Sriracha \"just hot sauce\".\nOgre Sauce is not \"just BBQ sauce\".\nWhen grilled, Ogre Sauce caramelizes. Your food will have an amazing crispy bark on the outside, and a bold juicy flavor inside.\nAs a dip or condiment, Ogre Sauce packs more flavor than Ketchup, Mustard, and Hot Sauce. You wouldn't believe how good Ogre Sauce is on a Cuban sandwich instead of mustard, or on a hotdog instead of ketchup, or on a pretzel or veggie instead of ranch. Try it with Tater Tots...your head will explode.\nAll-Purpose Craft BBQ Sauce \n\"All-Purpose\"\nOgre Sauce can be used perfectly on traditional BBQ foods like ribs, chicken, wings, brisket, tips, chops, porkbelly, sausage, burgers, and hotdogs...but also can be eaten on pizza, sandwiches, steak, tots, fries, and in a Bloody Marys (see Ogre Mary recipe below).\n\"Craft\"\nThis is a homemade recipe made with only the highest quality, all-natural ingredients in small batches. Like craft beer-brewers, we are small, independent, and dedicated to quality.\n\"BBQ Sauce\"\nMake no mistake...we love barbecue. Ogre's grandmother didn't set out to make a condiment that can be used on pizza, she had pork in mind. Those of you who love barbecue know how smoke, heat, meat, and sauce combine to make something irresistible. Ogre Sauce combines elements of traditional Eastern North Carolina BBQ (vinegar) with traditional Western North Carolina BBQ (tomato) elements of traditional South Carolina BBQ (mustard, honey) to create an award winning flavor.\nSince Ogre Sauce is sold at Whole Foods Markets, we meet their strict standards...\"We feature foods that are free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.\"\nWe use all-natural ingredients. That means:\nPreservative Free \nNo high fructose corn-syrup\nDye Free \nVegetarian Friendly \nWe are in 6 Whole Foods now, but lets go for all of them!\n Our All-Natural, Preservative and Dye Free Ingredients:\nKetchup \nMustard\nGarlic Powder\nSugar\nWorcestershire Sauce \nApple Cider Vinegar\nWater\nVegetable Oil\nSalt\nHoney\nNatural Vanilla Extract\nBlack Pepper\nCrushed Red Pepper\nGarlic Salt Silicon Dioxide - sounds scary, but it's a totally natural compound to absorb moisture so the garlic salt isn't all clumpy\nXanthan Gum (Natural plant based thickener)\nDextrose (a fancy word for a natural sweetener)\nBeer festivals, food trucks, bourbon tastings, chill cook-offs and hotdog eating contests are way more fun than store shelves. Even though being in Whole Foods, Southern Seasons, and other boutique shops is great for Ogre Sauce, we want to engage directly with our customers. We would love to meet our customers at events like the Alpine Village Oktoberfest in Torrance CA, or the Bacon and Bourbon Festival in Delray Beach FL, or the Waikiki Spam Jam in Hawaii, or the Zoo Brew at the Toledo Zoo in Toledo OH, or the Roadkill Cook Off in Marlinton, W. VA, or the Vegetarian Food Truck & Craft Beer Festival in Watertown, MA.\n\nHow cool would it be to have our sauce on every foodtruck around the world, the same way ketchup and hotsauce are?\nWith your help, WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN. \nWe are different than the big companies like Sweet Baby Rays, KC Masterpeice, and Kraft Original. Those corporations make a fine sauce, but they make it in bulk to sell in bulk via big box stores. We make craft sauce that we sell to our friends, new and old, who often find us online after tasting our sauce at backyard bbq's with friends, beach parties, beerfests, and kickball tournaments.\n  Big props to Ogre's grandmother for the base of our recipe!\nWe love the support from our home town establishments who proudly carry Ogre Sauce. Thank you Charlotte, NC!\n ------------------\nMichael \"Ogre\" Weeks\nOgre is the chef, heart, and soul of this sauce. He makes it taste like we are always grilling at his house. He is also a proud husband and father who lives in Charlotte. Ogre's daughter might be the best spokesperson Ogre Sauce will ever have.\nPLAY\n\n\n------------------------\nMike Vagianos\nMike is Ogre Sauce's accountant, graphic designer, web developer, janitor, and taster for Ogre Sauce. If he isn't running to the post office to ship orders, he's designing new labels for the 6-pack. Mike is the steam and the wheels of this locomotive. He also lives in Charlotte NC with his family. Mike's two boys can eat more Ogre Sauce than he can.\n------------------------- \nChris Lawson\nChris is the digital voice that helps to engage with customers, spread the word, and get people's mouths watering. Mostly, Chris get's to try, photograph, taste, then publish new recipes and talk about it with Ogre Sauce's extended family online. His wife and son enjoy the Cuban Ogre in Orlando FL year-round.\n\n    All proceeds from this Kickstarter will be used directly on the operations of Ogre Sauce.\nWe have an amazing manufacturing partner in Bobbee's Bottling of Louisburg, North Carolina. They are experts at making and shipping Ogre Sauce on time. We have full confidence they can meet our order without delay.\n If we reach our Goal of raising $6000 we will be able to place an order of 1000 gallons, dropping our price-per-bottle so we can offer to our backers for less and make a profit on the remaining sauce we sell. If we earn more than our goal we will be able to invest in marketing, which for us is spending more time meeting new people and having them taste our sauce at food and beer festivals. If we meet our stretch goal we will be able to fund new flavors - like \"Spicy\" or \"Vegan\"\nWhat people are saying about Ogre Sauce\nCUBAN OGRE \n1 baguette or use ciabatta bread \nThinly sliced cooked ham \nPulled pork \n1 bottle Ogre Sauce \nThinly sliced Swiss cheese \nWhole dill pickles, thinly sliced lengthwise 2 tablespoons \nunsalted butter (1/4 stick), melted \nHeat the oven to 200\u00b0F and arrange a rack in the middle. Cut the loaf of bread in half horizontally and open it up like a book. Spread the Ogre Sauce on the bottom piece of bread. \nEvenly place the ham and roasted pork on top of the Ogre Sauce. Evenly arrange the cheese and pickles on the meat. \nPour Ogre Sauce liberally over meat and pickles and top piece of bread and close the sandwich. Press gently on the top to compact the sandwich slightly. Cut it in half crosswise; set both halves aside.\nLay 2 (20-inch-long) sheets of aluminum foil on a work surface. Brush half of the melted butter on the tops of the sandwiches. Place each sandwich butter-side down on the sheets of foil. Brush the bottoms of the sandwiches with the remaining butter. Fold the foil around the sandwiches to cover. \nHeat a large frying pan on low heat until hot, about 4 minutes. Place 1 wrapped sandwich in the pan. Place a cast-iron skillet, Dutch oven, or heavy pot on the sandwich, push down on the skillet or pot to further compact the cubano, and cook undisturbed for 10 minutes. \nRemove the skillet or pot (careful: It may be hot). Flip the sandwich and place the skillet or pot back on top of it. Cook undisturbed until the cheese has melted and the sandwich is warmed through, about 10 minutes more. Remove to the oven and repeat with the second sandwich. When both are ready, remove the foil, cut into pieces, and serve.\nOGRE CHICKEN THIGHS\n4 pounds of thighs (wings are great too), skin-on \nKosher Salt \nVegetable oil \n1 cup Ogre Sauce\nSalt and oil chicken pieces: Coat the chicken pieces with Ogre Saucel and sprinkle salt over them on all sides. \nPrepare the grill grill: Brush grill grates with vegetable oil to prevent sticking. Prepare one side of your grill for high, direct heat. If you are using charcoal or wood, make sure there is a cool side to the grill where there are few to no coals. \nSear chicken on hot side of grill, move to cool side: Lay the chicken pieces skin side down on the hottest side of the grill in order to sear the skin side well. Grill for 5-10 minutes,. Once you have good dark color from the Ogre Sauce on one side, move the chicken pieces to the cooler side of the grill. Cover the grill and cook undisturbed for 20-30 minutes. \nTurn over and baste with Ogre Sauce: Cover the grill again and allow to cook for another 15-20 minutes. Repeat, turning the chicken pieces over, basting them with sauce, covering, and cooking for another 10-30 minutes. The goal is to maintain a low enough grill temp so that the chicken cooks \"low and slow\". \nFinish with a sear on the 2nd side: The chicken is done when you insert the tip of a knife into the middle of the thickest piece and the juices should run clear. \nPaint with more barbecue sauce and serve.\nBLOODY OGRE\n8 shots vodka \n5 pieces of bacon (1 piece of bacon for crumbling into drinks, 4 for garnish) \n2 cups tomato juice \n1 cup Ogre Sauce\n2 teaspoons prepared horseradish \n1/2 teaspoon celery salt \n2 teaspoons hot sauce  \n1 teaspoon Worcestershire \nCracks of black pepper \n2 cups ice \nPickled stuff like olives, green beans, pickles, etc.\nPrepare bacon* for drink and garnish by heating a frying pan on medium heat. Fry the bacon until extremely crispy.\nRemove to a plate with a paper towel to absorb the excess fat. Crumble one of the pieces of bacon into very small pieces.\nPour all ingredients and the crumbled pieces from one slice of bacon into a blender and blend on high for 1-2 minutes.I love using the blender because it breaks down the bacon into very fine bits.\nPour over four glasses full of ice.\nThanks to everythingbutthe.com for the original recipe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have an amazing manufacturing partner in Bobbee's Bottling of Louisburg, North Carolina.

I've play-tested this multiple times and am anxiously awaiting the Kickstarter\"\n- nlwelch\nYou can download the rules here\nDuring the game each player will have a limited number of Mint Tokens, which represent their workers.\nPlayers will use these mint tokens to earn more tokens, take first player or buy and build plans.\nPlans are how players earn points. Some plans will only give points, others will give extra powers to the owner.\nOnce a player has at least 7 points, play continues until the end of the the round, at which point the game ends.\nWhoever has the most points provided by plans they have built wins! \nFive24 Labs on Social Media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nNewsletter\nMint Works was created in response to the 2015 Mint Tin Design Contest created by R4D6 on BGG. The list of constraints for the competition were as follows:\nThe game must fit within a mint tin.\nThat was it! Such a simple constraint, but it gave me the push I needed to come up with a fun idea.\nBecause a mint tin is so easily portable, and designed to be rugged enough to fit in a pocket, I considered making a game that would be good on the go. (Initial versions of the game actually used the mints that came in a tin as the tokens. This stopped shortly after my children ate them.)\nI thought, what would be a good game to carry around in your pocket that isn't typical for that form factor. Worker Placement would be neat, I thought and so I ran with it. The rules turned out to be fairly simple and so I realized I had a super portable gateway worker placement game.\nMint Works will be something you can carry with you on a day to day basis and use it to introduce new people into our amazing hobby of strategic gaming.\nThat wasn't enough though, the game shouldn't be boring after a few plays. I wanted something that would be re-playable. Something that, once you got the initial concepts down, you could start to really dig in with other players.\nReports from testers over the months have come in saying that they enjoy playing, and will sit down 1 v 1 and play several games in a row and discuss theories about optimum turn sequences, what plans are best picked up at which parts of the game or when the lotto might show up.\nThis blew my mind! I had managed to do it, make an easy to learn fun to continue to play type of game.\nThe wall of contributors is my way of giving people some recognition regardless of the amount of contribution they have provided. It's small currently, but as I continue to do more and more campaigns I hope it can grow large enough that I'll have to re-consider how it works.\nIf you are excited enough for Mint Works that you just can't wait for the fully produced copies to get here from the factory, I have provided a limited pledge level.\nThis level will entitle you to a copy of the fully factory produced version of Mint Works as all other backers, but it will also include a hand made advanced copy delivered shortly after the campaign ends.\nThe advanced copies will be entirely hand made by me in my workshop and numbered. (e.g. 03/50.)\nThe advance copies will be of similar quality to the prototypes that you  see in the review videos. See below for examples.\nBecause Mint Works is a small game in terms of physical size and weight, shipping costs are very reasonable. The manufacturing costs are low enough that VAT shouldn't be a concern.\nI wish that I could provide free shipping to the majority of places, however the low price point of the game means I have very little wiggle room for costs. That said, I will be providing free shipping within the US, and applying a discount to shipping elsewhere equal to the cost of shipping within the US.\nHere is a brief chart explaining the shipping costs:\n* The vast majority of countries falls in this region, including: Argentina (AR), Australia (AU), Austria (AT), Bahrain (BH), Belarus (BY), Belgium (BE), Belize (BZ), Bulgaria (BG), Brunei Darussalam (BN), Canada (CA), Cayman Islands (KY), Chile (CL), China (CN), Colombia (CO), Costa Rica (CR), Croatia (HR), Cyprus (CY), Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Estonia (EE), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), Hong Kong (HK), Hungary (HU), Iceland (IS), India (IN), Indonesia (ID), Ireland (IE), Israel (IL), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Korea, Republic of (KR), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxembourg (LU), Malaysia (MY), Malta (MT), Montenegro (ME), Netherlands (NL), New Zealand (NZ), Norway (NO), Peru (PE), Philippines (PH), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Qatar (QA), Romania (RO), Saudi Arabia (SA), Serbia (RS), Singapore (SG), Slovakia (SK), Slovenia (SI), South Africa (ZA), Spain (ES), Sweden (SE), Switzerland (CH), Taiwan (TW), Thailand (TH), Turkey (TR), Ukraine (UA), United Arab Emirates (AE), United Kingdom (GB)\n** Brazil, Mexico, Russia and any countries not previously listed fall into this category.\nI would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Works before the game makes its way into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information. \nCurrently we are a small but potent team that consists of myself, my buddy Mel and my awesome testing group. I'd like to use this space to acknowledge and thank them.\nI have an amazing, excellent and dedicated group of players that tolerate my crazy ideas and endless iterations. They are up to the task of attempting to break things, and giving real feedback as we develop projects.\n I can't possibly thank them enough for all the work they do for the wages of snacks and fun!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign is only my second campaign, and my first (Area 1851) didn't fund initially. This was the result of some poor choices I had made during setting up and ramping up into the campaign, that in turn resulted in its funding failure.\n\nFortunately enough, Game Salute was able to bring it back a while later and that project successfully funded and is in stores now. This has provided me with a little more insight into what goes on beyond the campaign.\n\nThis means that a lot of what will be going on post funding will be new to me. So I'll be doing a bit of learning on the job as this project progresses. That said, I'm always open to hearing advice and willing to take reasonable suggestions into consideration.\n\nSince my previous campaign, I've also backed a lot more projects, and I've seen a lot of good examples of what to do, and what not to do. I'm going to be taking all of those lessons to heart.\n\nAnother thing going for me with Mint Works is the size of the project. This will greatly reduce the risk of the entire endeavor.\n\nThe biggest risk I foresee at the moment is coordinating the production of the mint tins and the game. This is because the manufacturers I've talked with either can't get tins in the right size, or the cost of the ones they offer in the right size is far too high.\n\nThis means I have to have the tins produced in a second factory, then sent to the game manufacturer, where they will affix labels to the tins and pack them with the game components.\n\nHaving the tins meet the game components and getting all of that packaged up in a timely manner will be the toughest part I suspect.\n\nHowever, I'm committed to full transparency of the project and will do my best to ensure things go according to plan.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Contributor", "descp": "Option to have your name (or pseudonym) posted with a message up to 140 characters in length on our \"Wall of Contributors.\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}], "stat": ["33 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Standard Supporter", "descp": "One (1) copy of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\nMint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5,346 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Double Down", "descp": "Two (2) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["723 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "The Triple", "descp": "Three (3) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["128 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Gift Giver", "descp": "Five (5) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["56 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Glorious Gamer", "descp": "Ten (10) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n10\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Standard Supporter", "descp": "One (1) copy of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\nMint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "247 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Double Down", "descp": "Two (2) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Eager Enthusiast", "descp": "One (1) limited edition hand made and numbered advance copy of Mint Works to be delivered by October 31st 2016.\nOne (1) copy of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\nMint Works\nHand-Made Numbered Mint Works Advanced Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "50 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Gift Giver", "descp": "Five (5) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "25 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Glorious Gamer", "descp": "Ten (10) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n10\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "4 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Mint Delivery - Coming to Kickstarter August 29th", "update_content": "Hey there!

Our mission is to make quality everyday gear for the modern professional. We're always looking to find ways to streamline how we carry, travel, and go about our daily lives. All of our products are designed and crafted in the USA.\nThe PMK - Paracord Magnet Keychain & Badgeholder\nThe PMK is a detachable keychain and badge holder that combines the convenience of magnets with the strength of a snap buckle.\nThe concept of the Paracord Magnet Keychain & Badgeholder (PMK) was inspired by our Riflesnap Keychain. We liked the security of the snap-hook design, but wanted to expand upon the idea. After a few months of prototyping, sampling, and road testing, the PMK was born. Created with the urban professional in mind and designed for everyday carry, the PMK stays secure to your belt loop via a stainless steel snap shackle and is fitted with a Fidlock magnetic snap for maximum convenience.\nBuilt Tough and Handcrafted in the USA\nThe PMK is built with a heavy duty, black-oxide, stainless steel snap shackle that securely attaches to your belt loop and/or backpack clip. The snaps can be quickly released by tugging on the pull and easily closed with one hand. Shackles are made here in the USA and laser engraved in California.\nLaser engraved stainless steel snap shackles. Note: We etched our logo on the backside so you won't be a walking billboard.\nThe PMK is hand-weaved in our San Francisco workshop from Type III 550 paracord, commonly used in parachuting and survival gear. In emergency situations, the paracord on the PMK can be used for survival purposes.\nParacord has an internal 7-strand nylon core for added strength.\nThe Convenience of a Magnet with the Strength of a Snap Lock\nThe magnetic snaps allow quick and easy access to your keys - simply pull the magnet lever to release your keys/badge when needed, and snap them back on when done - all without having to remove the PMK from your belt. \nDesigned with Fidlock magnetic snaps for convenient access to keys. Snaps are made from Neodymium magnets coated with hard Delrin.\nThe magnets eliminate the need to fumble around for your keys and lock securely in place when not used.\nOnce engaged, the magnetic snap is extremely strong.\nThe magnets automatically guide the pieces together without you having to fish around for a connection. Once engaged, the snaps will not come apart unless the main lever is deliberately lifted by the user.\nCompact Design\nMost quick-release and magnet keychains are bulky and tend to be very long due to the large footprint of either the snap or the magnet. We've designed the PMK to be compact and slide neatly into your pockets.\nMultipurpose and Flexible\nWhether you commute by foot, drive, frequently valet, or badge in for work, the PMK is designed to help serve any daily purpose.\nCustomized to Your Style\nChoose from three base colors and customize it with your own unique paracord pull.\nPull colors available in Crimson, Charcoal, Olive, and Black.\nAdditional Pull Colors - Navy Blue, Camo Green/Brown, Yellow\nFeatured On:\nRewards\n$3 - A Big Thank You! \n$18 - Thank You & Special Gift - our very own ARKTYPE Masterkey made for KS backers.

Two black anodized stainless steel mini split O-rings. We've all had instances where we have a bunch of keys and/or large fobs and having these mini O-Rings would help immensely with management and preventing them from bumping into each other. The O-Rings also double to help with attaching your work badge. All PMK backers will get a set of two.\n----\nShipping Info:\nFor this campaign, we ship to destinations around the world. Please note that you will be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region.\nWe will be shipping via USPS First Class / International / Priority Mail (Domestic).

We love Kickstarter and seeing cool projects develop, but know how frustrating it is when a project just fades into obscurity (we're all backers ourselves too). We also understand the complexity associated with new product development and fulfilling orders. Our first priority is to ensure fulfillment of all backer rewards. If we see that our funding is approaching our realistic capacity to deliver, we will cap our funding early to ensure all of our backers get their rewards, even if we raise less money. We also will keep backers posted on progress and be transparent in our processes so no one is left in the dark. This is our promise to you.\n----", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team is experienced in new product launches and understand the risks involved. We've all backed kickstarter projects before where the creators couldn't deliver, and we're mindful of this. Our first priority is to ensure fulfillment of all backer rewards. If we see that our funding is approaching our realistic capacity to fulfill, we will cap our funding early to ensure all of our backers get their rewards, even if we raise less money.\n\nWe've already gotten a head start and pre-ordered supplies for our early-bird backers, and will start early production during the campaign. Our product is handmade in the USA and thus requires a higher level of labor. We want to ensure that each PMK meets our quality standards, and we will not rush through the manufacturing process at the expense of compromising product quality.\n\nWe build the PMK in-house at our workshop in San Francisco, so we have substantial control over production and fulfillment. Nonetheless, there still are risks involved with turnaround time for raw materials from our suppliers. Most of our materials are sourced right here in the USA, with the magnetic snap being the only part sourced overseas (manufactured by Fidlock, a German company). A risk we foresee is the extended turnaround time to bring in additional magnetic snaps.\n\nTo mitigate this, we have pre-established relationships with our U.S.-based suppliers and distributors. We have reconfirmed that supply levels will be available and with reasonable turnaround to mitigate this risk. As the product is hand-assembled, there may be some risks with labor capacity, but we look to manage this with capping the amount raised. Nonetheless, we are committed to be transparent to our backers, and to keep them regularly updated with production progress.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "A Huge Thank You!", "descp": "A big thank you from the ARKTYPE team for your generous support, it really means a lot to us.

It combines machined looks with pure elegance using anodized aluminium, polished brass and copper. Every detail is made to perfection with precision machining.\n    Created to store and protect all those precious small items and keep your space beautiful and minimalistic. The goal was to make it look outstanding without any signs of opening. A simple and modern design piece that compliments any desk, table or shelf.  \n    SECRET STORAGE: Gr2 has a screw off top that reveals the secret place inside. It is perfect to keep any small valuables or make a luxury gift box. You can store pretty much anything that comes into your mind and fits in the bore. It's machined with precision so the fact that it opens will be secret of yours.\nLUXURY GIFT BOX: Unique and beatiful way to present a gift to your loved ones. Comes with black foam to put most exclusive gifts.\nLOW CENTER OF GRAVITY: Even whithout the acrylic glass stand Gr2 will stay still on flat surfaces. The copper and brass tips are much heavier than aluminium which makes gravity center lower and prevents sphere from rolling.\nCONVERSATION STARTER: While creating our project we met lots of interested people and enjoyed many exciting discussions. Gr2 is certainly a great way to start a conversation. \n  We all love to make our environment more beautiful and more personalized. Our space is where we feel good. Design elements can be a reflection to our personality or even tell a story about us.\nCrafted with precision and perfected to the smallest detail Gr2 is meant to be a statement of your best qualities.\nIt is unique way to show how different materials can highlight and complement each other. An optical pleasure on your table with a secret inside.\nWe use two color options for anodized aluminium body and two tip materials. Altogether four design choices are available. You can combine various designs or choose the most suitable for your taste.\n4 different designs\n  CNC Machined: Precisely machined on CNC lathe from solid piece of aluminium, copper and brass. Both parts have a thread to open the sphere. Aluminium body has drilled bore inside to create the storage space. Video shows a part of machining process:\nPLAY\n\n  Anodized finish: To get the best looking and most durable surface finish for aluminium we use anodizing. This process strengthens and dyes the metal so the surface is very durabe and the color won't flake off or scratch.\nPolished: For copper and brass parts we use polishing. It creates a stunning mirror clear finish which is even more highlighted when combined with anodized aluminium. \nPatina process\nBrass and copper are unique metals that will attain beautiful tarnish over the time. It is slow and very interesting process that can be followed day by day. The parts will slowly darken and get their own unique pattern. Whenever you like to reset the first day shiny looks it is super easy done with our polishing kit (felt cloth & polishing paste) -included in rewards. In less then two minutes it is clear as new.\n    outside diameter 2.13in (54mm)\ninside: bore diameter 1.22in (31mm), bore lenght 1.18in (30mm)\nweight: 8.50 oz (240 grams)\nsphere material: aluminium (anodized finish- silver or black)\npolished copper or brass tip (unscrew to open the sphere)\nsilicone handle for easy opening and not leaving fingerprints\nacrylic glass stand to put in any position \nblack foam to put luxury gifts \n                      Make a pledge\nChoose one of the reward levels to support our project.

My biggest passion is to create original and innovative products that can make our environment more enjoyable. \nTogether with my two brothers we have started a series of CNC machined spheres with unique design and functionality. We are very grateful to everyone who helped bring the first Graviton sphere to life and hope you will enjoy the Gr2 as much.\nWhen launching a new product there is nothing more important than good relationship with our supporters.

Here are a few ways to describe it:\nSPILL PROOF GLASS FOR WINE AND SPIRITS\nAERATES WINE WITH A TOUCH OF A FINGER\nFUN. ELEGANT. CONVERSATION STARTER\nHow many different styles of wine glasses have you used? Traditionally there are 2 basic categories \u2013 a stemless or stemware.\nAura Glass redefines the basic shape of the wine glass. Unlike any other glass, this patented glass pivots on a stainless steel ball. The weight of the ball, the resting height and the angle of the glass, together provide stability, preventing accidental spills even with full pours.\nAnd it is easy to swirl without requiring any more than a touch of a finger. Spins easily even with a 12 ounce pour...\nCheck out the Coasters added as the stretch goal. Spin it, Sip it, Rest it... Repeat! And when you're done, Stack it away! More information on Update#7, 8 and  9. Click on image below for update#7.\n    We are currently offering a large sized Aura Glass ideal for wines, brandy, whiskey, bourbon, and plenty of other drinks including craft beers.\nNow you can enjoy any drink without the fear of knocking over your glass.\n Enjoy Wine\n And/Or Spirits\nAnd storage is easy too...\nHere's the near-final packaging.\nPlease note all rewards will come in packs of 2 regardless of the quantities ordered. That will allow you to order as many for yourself, and more to gift to friends and family. Remember you will have these glasses much before Christmas, so stock up and create that unique surprise!\n  Few of the many reactions on social media:\n\"The aromas are magically enhanced in this glass. No need for aeration because this ingenious glass helps the wine open up with each sip...\"\n\"This is so cool... I have never seen anything like this before\"\n\"I always spill wine... I need these\"\n\"Such a great idea... great design... where can I get these?\"\n\"The base is nice and stable... I like the quality of the glass... very unique\"\n\"These would make a fabulous gift!\"\nHere's a peek at different phases that have brought us to this stage.\nOver the past 2 years, we have created dozens of prototypes using different shapes, angles, materials, and sizes.\nThere's more science in the design than meets the eye. With our engineering backgrounds we've been able to optimize the center of gravity, the resting height & weight of the glass. And we now have a final design to bring to market.\n  As part of product testing, we validated the 2 most essential elements of Aura Glass.\n1) The stability of the glass: We spun the glass multiple times, with different pour levels, including with the maximum of 15 oz, and the result was that Aura Glass spun easily without spillage or tipping over.\n2) The effectiveness of aeration: We used a Dissolved Oxygen Meter and tested the impact of aeration on Aura Glass, along with a control group (a regular wine glass) and another aerating device.\nThe results of the study was: Aura glass' \"swirling\" generates an increase in the dissolved oxygen rate within the wine (2 revolutions per minute in this study).\nUsing the 20 minute average mg/L measurements, Aura glass showed a 25% increase in oxygen over the control (stem glass) and 18% increase over the pour thru aerator, that showed an initial spike in oxygen which dissipated over the next 2 mins. (Refer to the graph below)\n  The design of Aura Glass promotes what we refer to as \"continuous aeration\", meaning that the user is likely to spin Aura Glass more often than a traditional wine glass.\n  Through targeted market testing and exhibiting at wine festivals we have gathered valuable feedback attesting the need for a spill proof glass. The response has been extremely encouraging, endorsing the authenticity, quality, and uniqueness of Aura Glass.\nDuring market testing, we offered large and small sized glasses and found that 73% customers preferred the larger size. Based on this feedback, we are focused on bringing the large glass to market as our first product line.\n  With an impeccable design and strong demand projections, we are focused on making the business scalable. We visited 4 key suppliers, which are leaders in their respective industries. We evaluated the suppliers across parameters such as general capability, design control & consistency, quality control, reliability, and sustainability.\nAs a result we have chosen the key suppliers and have approved the 3-D models (the white model shown below) for the next steps, which is the sampling run followed by the large scale production run.\nThat's where we need your help. Both of those final steps require upfront capital.\n  As mentioned above, we are at the final stages of going into mass production which requires upfront commitments for expensive tooling. We want to exploit the cost efficiencies of minimum production runs, and pass those savings on to you, making this product more affordable.\nBeing made in the USA is one of the founding principles of our company. Additionally, high quality and certainty of execution are central to our business.\nKeeping the above in mind, we are here on Kickstarter requesting you to help us bring this product to life.\nBy backing us you will:\nbe one of the first owners of this chic product \nsupport American jobs\nBy combining our capital with the funds raised on Kickstarter, here's how the capital will be allocated:\n  We are committed to quality and delivery timelines. We have done all the leg work and are ready to hit the production run. So together let's create a Different \"Pour\"spective.\n      Keven and Ankana have 32 years of combined experience in Quality, Sales, and Operations.\nAs the head of Quality, Keven led a large team supporting an organization of 8,000 employees, focused on continuous product and process improvement. What does that mean for you? With his leadership and entrepreneurial mindset we are confident about certainty of execution and high quality products.\nAs for Ankana, her diverse experience from process improvement, project management to sales & account management across North America, Australia, Europe, and Asia has helped create a very strong foundation for Aura Glass. Thanks to her attention to detail and keeping the customer at the center of solving any problem, we know we are off to a great start.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe already have overcome our biggest challenge of perfecting the prototype.\n\nHaving said that, meeting demand is an anticipated risk that many startups face.

Ascent\u2019s conception started out of necessity for a better way of keeping crucial survival tools within reach. We designed our survival watch to withstand the lifestyle of a person who is constantly exploring and pushing their boundaries. With the Ascent Survival Watch unique design, overcoming adversity is never an arms' length away.\n  The Conception\nCreating the Ascent Survival Watch began after a simple realization. Keep the tools you need the most, right where you want them. We noticed casual hikers and the most extreme outdoor enthusiasts needed a better way of keeping their most essential tools close by. With this is mind, we knew that assembling the perfect collection of survival tools should not mean you have to sacrifice style for functionality.\n        Understanding that the most essential elements in a survivor\u2019s kit usually has to do with three elements: Navigation, Food Supply and Safety applications. Encompassed in Ascent\u2019s closure are the necessary tools packaged in a sleek and minimalistic way that makes sense. The enclosure unit composed of: Emergency whistle that emits a high pitch distress call that can alert rescuers. Miniature compass enclosed at a glance. Ferro Rod that when used with striker creates the necessary spark needed to start your fire. Serrated Striker that is used to spark a fire as well as strong enough to cut through necessary brush and shrubbery to build your fire.\n    Paracord was first used as suspension lines for U.S parachutes during WWII. Paracord has proven itself useful in hundreds, if not thousands of other lifesaving ways. The braided sheath has a number of interwoven nylon or polyester fiber cords. The braided sheath around the nylon fibers adds strength and flexibility to its overall design. This makes it compact, fashionable, and highly useful in survival situations.\n  Our team of designers have made numerous renditions to ensure our design and functionality made it more efficient when accessing the tools you need. After testing multiple watch faces, we found the traditional 3-hand illuminated analog face with date feature offered the easiest way to tell time in any situation.\n    One of our biggest challenges was finding a way of combining a braid that would maximize the amount paracord per band as well as disassemble quickly when needed.\nWe found that the most commonly braided paracord patterns allowed for quick disassembly, yet sacrificed the overall length of paracord in the band at a common length of 5-feet per band.\nTo combat this, we designed our own Ascent Survival Paracord watch band weave, handmade to ensure optimal disassembly speed, maximum paracord length at 9-feet per band and unique customizable cord options.\nMovement\nWe sought out to find the best input components on the market to make sure the Ascent Survivor was reliable when you need it most. Inside of the Ascent watches are Miyota 2415 Miyota which has been a reputable and reliable movement components for brands like Citizen for decades. Their movements are backed with industry leading accuracy and built to last.\nThe Miyota  2415 exceeded our needs perfectly and ensured a quality timepiece. Furthermore, their movements are made with mercury-free batteries and in RoHS compliant facilities which is important when it comes to ensuring the well-being of our planet as we explore it.\nMany believe that automatic watches are unmatched when it comes to reliability and timekeeping capabilities. That is a bold statement often said yet not typically the case, a quartz will tell time just as well, if not better.  A quartz is a phenomenal alternative to an automatic movement.\nASCENT WATCHES ARE BACKED WITH A WARRANTY\nWe believe in our watches. And you should too. If anything were to happen to your watch within the first 1 years, we hope that you will send it back to us for repair or replacement. We will cover all internal parts should they ever fail you.\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n- Case Diameter: 48 mm Case\n- Thickness: 12.1 mm \n- Face Diameter: 35.9 mm\n- Band Material: 550 Grade Paracord\n- Band Width: 20 mm - Crown Material Stainless Steel \n- Case Material: Steel \n- Back Plating: Stainless Steel \n- Clasp: Fire Starter Buckle \n- Clasp Material: Industrial Grade Plastic\n- Dial Window Material: Crystal Mineral Glass \n- Display: Analog \n- Movement: Japanese Miyota 2415 \n- Date Function: Yes \n- Seconds Function: Yes \n- Water Resistant: 5 ATM / 50 Meters\nEach band is equipped with 4.5 ft of paracord (data was based off the average wrist size of 7.5in).\n        We are well aware of the trend of wearables hitting stores everywhere and are excited to say we have come up with our own version of the perfect balance of sleek design with rugged accents. \n     We have established a solid relationship with our manufacturing partners over the last year.

Its innovative design helps eliminates clutter, noise, and other hassles associated with regular keychains.\nCAMPAIGN\nThank you for your interest in this project. Our goal for this campaign is to be able to fund the first production run of the XR Key holder. \nTeaming up with a local machine shop (friend owned), has allowed us to have maximum access over production and quality control. Most importantly, we will be doing a lot of work ourselves, which saves us labor cost, and allows us to bring Kickstarter lower prices.\nWe really appreciate your support. Together we can make this campaign a success. Thank you backers!\nDESIGN\nAfter many trial and errors, we finally decided on a design which focused on ease of use, and comfort. No sharp edges or rough corners. The XR simply feels good in your hand.\nShaped to \"feel good\" in the palm of your hand\nslotted end for better thumb grip\nDesigned for one hand operation, the XR allows you to browse through your keys with just a few finger movements while leaving your other hand free.\nDURABLE\nMade from 6061 T6 aircraft-grade aluminum, the XR is carefully cnc-machined from a solid aluminum block to its final design. Upon inspection, the XR makes its way to the anodizing tanks to get its final protective coating and color.\nMULTI-FUNCTION\nThe XR can also have multiple uses besides a key holder, such as bottle opener, can opener, window breaker and more. Most importantly, the XR can be used as a hex bit driver. Simply remove the bottom screw to expose the hex opening! \nHEX BIT READY\nCOLOR OPTIONS\nThe XR key holder will be available in 4 anodized colors. Blue, Black, Red, and Silver.\nXR in anodized blue\nXR in anodized silver\nXR in anodyzed red\nXR in anodized black\nPRICE POINT\nIn order to successfully fund the campaign and meet our minimum production numbers, we decided to cut keep the price of the XR below $30 for the first 200 XRs sold. This will get us just passed our $5,000 goal and take us into production! This price is way below the price point of other similar key holders, and our post-kickstarter pricing of $37!\nFollow Us For More Pics and Vids!\n    TIME FRAME  \nIf funded successfully, our manufacturing will run through December and a few days into January because of the Holidays. We expect shipping to begin early to mid January.  \n Thank you for your interest in the XR Keyholder!

If you would like to get AKO DICE but missed the campaign (or want to get more), please visit www.ako-dice.com\n                AKO DICE\nHi, everyone! My name is Kacha. While my educational background is in architecture I have always been passionate about product design. I was fortunate enough to have great supports with my previous 2 funded Kickstarter projects (Mochi & Zen Dice), and was able to create my website store at : http://www.monkeyteam.net/. After these 2 projects, I realized that creating unique designs is something I really enjoy. I hope to bring yet another new project with unique \u201cspin\u201d to traditional dice which I call it \"AKO DICE\".\nThe Impact:\nThe use of dice has been recorded to ancient times. The oldest known dice were excavated as part of a 5000-year-old backgammon set at the Burnt City, an archaeological site in south-eastern Iran Dice collecting began with the popularity of the Dungeon & Dragons series of board/role playing games. Since it's inception, players have grown attached to and have collected a wide variety of dice. This started a trend in unique dice designs incorporating various aspects of the gaming world and tapping into themes such as space, fantasy, and more.\nFor the newest design, I have taken the traditional dice and turned it on it's head. I am using a simple idea, yet complex design concept. The new design is inspired by new age concepts, and has a sleek, space-age, cutting-edge technology style. AKO DICE takes the traditional dice design and improves upon it for a trendy, one of a kind design perfect for all gamers as well as collectors.\nA set of AKO DICE with natural finish.\nA set of AKO DICE with black anodized and natural finish.\nA set of AKO DICE with black anodized finish.\nClose up AKO DICE with natural finish.\nClose up AKO DICE with black anodized finish.\nPackaging prototype.\nEvery set of AKO DICE is made of quality aluminum and is available in anodized black and natural aluminum color. The packaging contains 2 dice per boxed set.\nConcept\nAKO DICE utilizes a redesigned dice pip with custom engraved artwork on 16 mm 6-faced dice. Each side is flat with beveled edges, contributing to a sleek, comfortable feel for game play. Rather than using traditional dice pips, each number (1-6) represented by line on each side. To continue the design, each side are connected by pip line, creating links between the numbers. \nWhat I Need & What You Get:\nAs you can see from the photos above, the design and prototypes have already been created to my satisfaction. I am now seeking your supports to help bringing this dream to the production. The first portion of the fund will be used for all tooling setup. Funding will then be spent on the initial order, packaging, shipping & handling, and other related costs. We hope to offer free shipping to our backers all over the world, so we will need some capital to help make this particular portion of the project possible.\nFor early bird backers, we are offering this reward for $12! This option will only be available for a limited time, going up to a $15 soon! Estimated shipping is expected around June of 2015.\nIn addition, we are offering a $12 add-on for backers that are interested in acquiring another set, with your choice of finishes. This is perfect for backers who would like to share our product with others as a gift!\nIf AKO DICE is generously successful in funding, my goal is to carry forward the results. The production costs will be reduced and stretch goal rewards will be available to all backers with more choices and FREE shipping all over the world.\nAKO DICE - Unlocked new color, Red Anodized!\nAKO DICE - Unlocked new color, Blue Anodized!\nAKO DICE - Unlocked Special Edition, Stainless Steel with natural bright finish!\nAKO DICE - UNLOCKED RPG Fan, Grey anodized aluminum Fudge Dice.\nAKO DICE - Most Requested Unlocked, Green Anodized!\nAKO DICE - Most Requested Unlocked, Black Groove!\nAKO DICE - Most Requested 2 Unlocked, Purple Anodized!\nAKO DICE - Most Requested Unlocked, Gold Brass!\nBacker Bonus as a special Thanks!

Thank you for being a part of it.\nIf you have just found the pencil and like the look of it, don\u2019t worry, you can still pre-order at www.modernfueldesign.com\nThe Design Thinking\nI\u2019m a Mechanical Designer in Austin, Texas. I have always been obsessed with taking things apart to figure out how they work, so becoming a mechanical designer was a natural choice for me. Because I use a mechanical pencil everyday at work, I wanted to design one that didn\u2019t reveal how it was put together or the different parts it was made of at first sight.  With this design, you really have to investigate to find where the pencil breaks apart, the different pieces it is made of and how the parts are held together.  This to me as a designer is as intriguing as the pencil itself.\nLess throw-away, more lifetime\nMachining the pencil from one solid piece of metal means that it is incredibly strong and durable.  So durable that I am confident that it will last you a lifetime. If there is any issue with the pencils you buy, send them back to me and I will fix your pencil or make you a new one.\nSleek on the outside, highly engineered on the inside.\nThe project started when I noticed I was using packs and packs of mechanical pencils at work as disposable items. I set out to design a mechanical pencil that would reduce the waste, be a testament to U.S. manufacturing and design, and not break the bank. Having a single mechanical pencil that replaces the endless packs of plastic that end up sitting it landfills and floating in our oceans has to be a good thing.\nWell-engineered, durable, simple and sleek\nThe pencil has been designed to last a lifetime. If there is any issue with the pencils you buy, send them back to me and I will fix your pencil or make you a new one. No questions asked.\nI have been working on this design for over a year now and it is ready for production. The factory is ready to go and I have tested the first samples.\nThere have been some great pen and pencil projects on Kickstarter, but not many mechanical pencil projects.  The complex and intricate inner workings of a mechanical pencil are difficult and expensive to manufacture, which is why the majority of them are made from plastic. My design uses standard drill sizes to reduce the manufacturing costs and has been precisely engineered to be replicated at large numbers while maintaining an extremely high level of quality and sleek design.\nTimeline\nIt is my aim to set realistic goals and pleasantly surprise my backers. The first run of pencils is set to be finished on the 15th of December 2014, I will then test and package them up ready for shipment. If the project reaches the goal before the end date, I will ship the early bird rewards before the end of the campaign. If there are pencils left over from the first run that are not claimed by early backers, I will use the extra pencils to fulfill additional orders. I plan to ship the early bird rewards no later than January 2015 and have all other orders shipped by February 2015.\nI will keep everyone updated on when to expect their pencil via the comments section. If you have any concerns or questions please add a comment to the comments page and I will get back to you right away.\nStretch goal - $10,000.00\nI will offer personalized etching of initials along the length of the pencil. The cost to have your pencil personalized will be $20.00, please add this to your pledge amount.\nHave your pencil engraved with your name, company\u2019s name, life motto or just your initials.

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

It will showcase the best, most creative, and rawest skateboarding happening in the five boroughs by locals, natives, and visitors. Stoops will give you a look into the diversity of spots and the potential that the city offers.\nWhy:\nNew York is one of most photogenic cities in the world. Couple that with amazing and creative skateboarding and you will find it hard to beat the photos it will (and does!) produce. The problem is that there is no solid outlet for displaying these photos. You may get lucky to see a low-resolution version of one or two of them floating around some blogs, but is that sufficient? A lot of major European cities have their own mags to help represent their cities (Grey Magazine out of London, for example), so it's time that the world's city had its own. This would benefit many. For one, it would let outsiders into our world of skateboarding through one of the most chaotic cities. It would also help shine light on the local companies, filmmakers, photographers, and skaters that are pushing the boundaries with no mainstream support. \n$20k?\nThe reason we are asking for $20k to start this project is that we want to have the capacity to print and ship enough magazines to our list of over 500 shops around the world. There is interest not only in the U.S., but in Canada, France, the U.k., Germany, Japan, etc. Once we account for the costs of fulfilling the incentives and paying the Kickstarter/Amazon fees, most of what is left will go straight to printing, distribution, and paying contributors.\nRob Gonyon - FS Nosegrind.

While we do intend to have a high standard set for the photography in Stoops (hence Allen coming on board as the photo editor), our focus is specifically on NYC. As a precursor to launching Stoops, the last issue of 43 was actually an NYC issue, which was the best issue thus far!

Thank you! \nUPDATE #1: Clarifications\nWe've had a few questions about our project that we wanted to make sure we answered!\nThe Aqualibrium Garden can be used as an aquaponic or a hydroponic system. An aquaponic system is one where fish supply the nutrients that fertilize the grow bed. In a hydroponic system, fish are not required and all that is needed is the placement of nutrients into the water tank.\nAdditionally, the Aqualibrium Garden will come with four snap doors that attach to the bay openings on the bottom of the system to keep out curious pets or kids!\nFinally, the final product will be clear (the product in the video is the prototype and is not representative of the final product's color).\nGROW FRESH ORGANIC FOOD ANYWHERE\nThe fish in the self-cleaning aquarium in the bottom chamber of the Aqualibrium Garden provide the nutrients that feed the plants in the self-watering grow space in the upper chamber.  This cycle\u2026 like nature herself\u2026 is automatic, providing the potential to grow an abundance of fresh vegetables, herbs and flowering plants all year.\n-\nThe Aqualibrium Garden - Perfect for City Apartments\n-\nTHE VALUE TO HUMANITY \nAs our food supply becomes even more threatened by toxic chemicals and GMOs, it becomes critically important for people to take charge of their own food security.  With the Aqualibrium Garden (and the included grow lights), you can now have the freedom to grow anything you want, any time of year\u2026 knowing that your food is fresh, natural and organic.  \nIn addition, watching the fish swim and seeing how plants grow can be a great hobby, a wonderful educational tool for children and a smart way to save on the high cost of food.  Best of all... the aquarium is self-cleaning and the grow space garden is self-watering!\n-\nThe Aqualibrium Garden - An Endless Supply of Organic Food\n-\nSUSTAINABILITY AND QUALITY\nOur vision at Aqualibrium is to help reduce human impact on the planet by working with the cycles of nature to create a renewable, self-sustaining, locally sourced and abundant supply of food.  We believe we\u2019ve found part of the solution with aquaponics, an ancient technology with tremendous potential for today\u2019s world.  \nWith our Aqualibrium Garden, anyone anywhere can grow anything they want\u2026 free of pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers and genetic manipulation.  You\u2019ll be amazed by the amount of fresh produce and herbs that it is possible to grow in the two square feet of upper chamber grow space.  Tomatoes, eggplants, basil, mint\u2026 wheatgrass for juicing.  Virtually anything that can be grown in a standard outdoor garden can now be grown in an Aqualibrium Garden.   \n-\nThe Aqualibrium Garden - Fits Anywhere\n-\nFREEDOM TO GROW A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE\nInspired by the designs of futurist Jacque Fresco, the Aqualibrium Garden is modular, sturdy and very stylish.  You will have the option of leaving the lower chamber fish tank open (as shown in the above drawing)... or closed by using the four removable clear doors included with each garden.  This is a great option for homes with pets and small children.  \nAlthough our prototype (as featured in our Kickstarter video) is white, the Aqualibrium production model will be manufactured using clear, UV protected, scratch resistant plastic and will be shipped fully assembled\u2026 ready to fill with water, fish, grow medium and plants\u2026 perfect for either aquaponics or hydroponics growing.  \nOne Aqualibrium Garden can supply a steady stream of fresh greens for one\u2019s own needs or enough fresh basil or other herbs to generously share with friends and neighbors.  Multiple gardens have the potential to meet all the fresh produce needs of any family\u2026 meaning that the Aqualibrium Garden can pay for itself with food cost savings alone.\nThe Aqualibrium Garden is a great gift, a great educational tool\u2026 and a great way to help move the world to a better, fresher, sustainable source of food.\n-\nThe Three Aqualibrium Founders - A Team Effort\n-\nTHE AQUALIBRIUM GARDEN - DETAILS and SPECIFICATIONS\nThe Aqualibrium Garden is beautifully designed and sized to fit in any room. While the prototype is white, the final product will made of sturdy, UV protected, scratch resistant clear polycarbonate\u2026 this is truly the Garden of the Future... a wonderful conversation piece, an exceptional educational tool for children\u2026 and a great way to have an unending, locally sourced supply of fresh food. \nThe Aqualibrium Garden - Shipped Fully Assembled\nYour new Aqualibrium Garden will be shipped fully assembled... all you do is add water and fish to the self-cleaning aquarium (the bottom chamber)... and grow medium and plants in the grow space (the top chamber).  \nDimensions - 4' high x 2.2' wide \nLED Grow Lights Included (9W Waterproof)\nWater for Self-Cleaning Aquarium - 13 gallons\nPet friendly with four snap doors covering the aquarium included in every set\nWeight (without water or plants) - 40 lbs\nMaterials - UV Protected Clear Plastic\nSturdy and Scratch Resistant\nSelf-Watering Grow Space - 2 square feet\nGrow Medium - We recommend hydroton or a similar medium\nMinimal Energy Use (53.5 Total Watts - Similar to a Lamp)\nPlacement - Anywhere, Indoors or Outdoors\nFish - Choose Your Favorites\nPlants - Anything You Want\nGrowing Season - Year Round\nIncludes complete setup instructions\nFunction - Aquaponic or Hydroponic Growing\n-\nOUR FUNDING NEEDS and HOW YOU CAN HELP\nWe\u2019ve built and extensively tested our first prototype (which you can see in the attached Kickstarter video).  The system is sturdy, durable and has already provided our team with an amazing abundance of fresh vegetables, herbs and flowering plants.  But now, we need your help to be able to fund the cost of the industrial molds that will allow us to go into full production.  \nOnce we have those industrial molds in place, we can manufacture the Aqualibrium Garden at a price point that will make this unit affordable for most families (especially considering that each unit will virtually pay for itself in food cost savings alone).  Our challenge now is that our unique, futuristic modular design requires the creation of molds that have never been built before\u2026 and this is your chance to help bring this amazing, sustainable technology to people worldwide. \n-\nThe Future is Now.

And yes, we know that is a somewhere between a double and quadruple negative. We don\u2019t care \u2013 we\u2019re excited and we freaking love you folks.\nThis is more than just designing new products to help photographers carry their cameras. This is a way of running a business, and ultimately for the Peak Design team, a way of living our lives. Our Kickstarter backers, many of whom supported us during Capture v1 and Leash/Cuff, make it possible for us to spend our time doing exactly what we want to do: design rad photography gear and enjoy putting it the hands of people who appreciate it. The funds generated from this campaign will support the research, design and development of newer, better solutions to problems that camera owners face. As we do this we will continue to look to you, our most die-hard, passionate supporters, for feedback and direction.\nOnce again, thank you for your generous support!\nQUESTIONS? ANSWERS IN THE FAQ!\nWhether you're a new backer or existing backer, we've got a massive (we're talking laughably long) FAQ at the bottom of this page. We bet you'll find you'll find an answer there!\nWHAT IS CAPTURE?\nWe believe Capture is hands-down the best way to carry your camera. The beauty of it lies in its simplicity. Capture is a compact metal clip that lets you carry your camera on any backpack strap, belt or bag. Its unique quick-release system keeps your camera rigidly secure, yet instantly accessible with the click of a button.\nCapture Camera Clip v2: Carry your camera on any backpack strap, belt or bag.\nCapture frees you from cumbersome camera straps and holsters and lets you go anywhere and do anything with your camera safe and in reach, making sure you never miss another shot. Whew, it feels good just typing that.\nAlong with Capture v2, we're launching 2 new accessories:\nPROpad\u2122 gives you extra stability and comfort when carrying very heavy cameras with Capture.\nPOV Kit (formerly called the GoPro Mount) lets you mount GoPro and point-and-shoot cameras on Capture to take POV video.\nSO WHAT'S NEW IN CAPTURE V2?\nBack in 2011, Peak Design launched the original Capture Camera Clip right here on Kickstarter. We\u2019ve spent the past 2 years building our team and reinventing our solution from the ground up, incorporating feedback from our thousands of awesome backers and customers. Here's a high level look at what is new in v2...\nTo walk you though the big new things one by one...\nThere's a Standard and Pro version now: Hobbyists and beginners have different needs than serious pros and adventurers, hence 2 versions of our clip. Read the \"Capture vs. CapturePRO\" section below to learn more.\nBeautiful new ergonomic shape: The new Capture looks sleek and stunning - but the new shape is more than just eye-candy. We\u2019ve redesigned it to give you total comfort no matter where on your body you wear it. We also redesigned the clamping bolts to make them easier to screw down, even if you\u2019re wearing gloves.\nLighter and slimmer: We\u2019ve trimmed the fat, making our (already compact) product lighter, slimmer and more unobtrusive. See FAQ for size specs.\nBetter security features: We created 2 new secondary locking systems to give you more security options. A safety lock has been added to the quick-release button, giving you a quick and easy way to prevent accidental release. For maximum security, the all-new twist lock tightly clamps your camera in. The new twist lock also stabilizes your camera if you\u2019re using Capture as a tripod clamp. Wait - did we just say you can use it as a tripod clamp?\nThat\u2019s right, it works as a tripod clamp too (PRO): CapturePRO has a \u00bc\u201d tripod mounting hole in it\u2019s back plate. This means you can put it atop your tripod or monopod and have a fully functioning quick-release clamp for your camera.\nWorks with more tripod heads (PRO): CapturePRO comes with one of our three PROplates. These plates offer compatibility with more tripod heads (ARCA and Manfrotto RC2) and camera types (SLR and Compact Mirrorless). See the FAQ for info on choosing a plate.\nWorks with sling straps (PRO): Capture, equipped with the standard plate, is designed to work with Leash and Cuff using our micro-anchor attachment system (see FAQ). CapturePRO, equipped with one of our PROplates, works with Peak Design straps as well as classic sling-style straps made by companies like BlackRapid\u00ae. PROplates feature a special load-bearing D-ring that lets you attach your sling strap directly to your camera when you\u2019re not using Capture.\nCAPTURE VS. CAPTURE PRO\nHere's a look at Capture, CapturePRO, and the different quick-release plates that you can get with them:\nCapture\u00ae is a simpler, less expensive camera clip for folks who just need a better way to carry their camera. CapturePRO\u00ae is the full-featured all-aluminum Cadillac of camera clips - designed to meet the strength and compatibility needs of serious photographers. Both clips are designed to carry cameras of any size. CapturePRO\u00ae just has a bit more functionality:\n\nWHAT CAN I GET BY SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT?\nIf you to like go places and do things with your camera, you'll get a big fat treat. In addition to Capture v2, we've got some amazing new accessories. Behold:\nCapture\u00ae: The standard entry-level version of Capture has a glass-reinforced nylon backplate and comes with our standard quick release plate (see FAQ for details). Pre-order at the $50 reward level.\nCapturePRO\u00ae: Our flagship professional version of Capture features an all-aluminum body and comes with one of 3 PROplates. It can be used as a tripod head and is compatible with multiple tripod systems, as well as sling straps and hand straps (see FAQ for details). Pre-order at the $65+ levels. Also, note the limited \"Naked Edition\" early bird specials!\nPROpad\u2122: This accessory (for all versions of Capture including v1) provides additional support and padding for folks who want to use Capture with heavy camera/lens/battery grip combinations, or those who are just looking for maximum comfort. Projected delivery in September. Included at the $95+ levels, or you can order it \"a la carte\" for $20 by selecting the $1+ reward.  This may seem obvious, but note that the PROpad is only useful if you have Capture.\nPOV Kit: We formerly called this the \"GoPro\u00ae Mount,\" but we've renamed it because it we've broadened it's capabilities. This accessory lets you use Capture as a rigid, positionable video-capture mount for your GoPro\u00ae, or other brand POV camera, or your point-and-shoot camera. This means you can take POV video from any backpack strap, belt or strap-like object.  The GoPro\u00ae Mount is best suited for Capture v2, but works with v1 too.  Projected delivery in October. Included at the $95+ levels (except the Early Bird Special).\nLeash & Cuff (not pictured above): Leash is our quick-connecting, uber-versatile camera strap. Cuff is our quick-connecting minimalist wrist strap. We launched these straps on Kickstarter in 2012. Included at the $150+ levels.\nWHAT ARE THE REWARD LEVELS?\nWe would love your support, and created reward levels based on what we think you'd love to get in return for your generosity. See the FAQs for information on adding individual products to your reward a la carte.\nPROPAD: USING CAPTURE WITH BIG OL' CAMERAS\nGot a heavy camera/lens/battery combo? Watch this video to see how PROpad\u2122 + Capture is the ultimate carrying solution for you:\nBased on feedback from our customers with super-sized rigs, we\u2019ve developed a supportive pad accessory that makes Capture an ideal solution for even the bulkiest of cameras. We call it the PROpad\u2122, and whether you have a large camera/lens/grip or you just want extra comfort when carrying your gear all day, this is the accessory for you.\nPROpad\u2122 allows you to side-load or top-load your camera into Capture when you wear it on your belt, and it can be worn on your backpack strap as well. PROpad\u2122 is constructed from super-tough Hypalon and has a gel-like compression-molded EVA foam back pad. We expect PROpad\u2122 to be ready to ship by September.\nPOV KIT: USING CAPTURE WITH GOPRO & POINT-AND-SHOOTS\nWant to know what the POV Kit is all about? First, watch this video.\nIf you can attach a DSLR to any strap or belt, then why the heck shouldn\u2019t you be able to do that with a POV video camera? Well, we\u2019ve got good news for you. Soon, you\u2019ll be able to use Capture (any version) to mount your GoPro\u00ae camera directly to any backpack strap, belt, or strap-like substrate to capture point-of-view video in exciting new ways. This accessory will also let you take POV video using other brand POV cameras, as well as point-and-shoot cameras. We plan on having it ready to ship by the beginning of October.\nMAKING CAPTURE\nWe care immensely about the quality of our products. 8 different materials go through 15 different transformation processes to produce 26 different parts for Capture v2.\nThis video gives some insight into how these raw materials are processed and assembled to become Capture. It also shows how closely we work with our manufacturing team in Wuxi, China to bring Capture to life. We filmed all of the footage in this video during a recent week-long trip to Wuxi to hash out our final production process for Capture v2, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed filming it.\nREWARD FULFILLMENT, SHIPPING, AND TIMING\nWhen this campaign ends on August 23rd, all backers will get a survey sent via email. We'll ask you to provide your shipping address, and you'll also specify which quick-release plate you want (if you pre-ordered CapturePRO\u00ae) and which items you want from the a-la-carte menu. Until then we don't need any shipping info from you - so just sit back and relax. You deserve it!\nWe have every intention of shipping Capture\u00ae and CapturePRO\u00ae starting shortly after our funding campaign ends, no foolin'. That means most of you will be receiving your rewards in the month of September, international backers maybe early October. Leash\u2122 and Cuff\u2122 will also be shipping immediately after the campaign ends.\nThe PROpad\u2122 and POV Kit might take a little longer to ship. We're still finalizing our supply chain for those products. We don't want to hold up shipping of Capture, so for that reason these accessories may ship separately. So you might get your rewards in 2 shipments. We won't make you wait too long though - we should have them ready to go in October.\nIf you've chosen one of our limited Naked Edition early bird rewards, your CapturePRO Naked Edition units, your reward should be on it's way! If you haven't gotten a shipping notification from us, please check your Kickstarter messages immediately.\nWe kindly ask international backers to add a single $15 amount to their pledge to cover shipping. If you have questions about international shipping, please see our FAQ.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSupply Chain Risks\nHoly smokes, have we learned a thing or two about our supply chain over the last two years! One of the main ingredients in making Capture V2 an outstanding product was improving our supply chain by selecting the right manufacturers, the right materials and the right processes. We can't even begin to convey how monumental of a task this has been, but the short and sweet answer is that it's paid off - we have a high-quality product, and we have a much higher confidence in our ability to build lots of them, and do it on time. But, things can still go awry. A supplier may slip a deadline or their machines might break down or they might run out of a certain type of paint. Those things would delay fulfillment.\n\nDesign Risks for Future Products\nPROpad\u2122 and the GoPro\u00ae Mount are not quite as far along as Capture V2. PROpad\u2122 has a complete design but we still need to create packaging for it. the GoPro\u2122 Mount is getting a couple small tweaks to the final prototype. We anticipate these products being ready in September, but it could take a bit longer if we have to do any major redesign work. Highly unlikely though.\n\nActs of God\nWe're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, God forbid, the Dodgers could come to town.

Thank you!  \n\"This is the single most important robotics product since the Arduino.\"  Ted Macy, Contributing Editor, Robot Magazine\n\"Charmed Labs is bringing the eventual robot uprising one step closer with their camera sensor.\"  Chris-Rachael Oseland, Austin Post\n\"This vision sensor could be the future eyes of robots.\"  Mashable.com\n\"The sheer power, flexibility and ease of use of Pixy could kick-start a whole new generation of robotics.\"  Codeduino.com\n\"It\u2019s revolutionary because of its speed and simplicity.\"  StartupsFM\nUpdate: we recently made another video!  It shows Pixy playing with some lasers, and potentially bugging some cats, although no actual cats were annoyed in the video.  Watch below:\n\nBackground\nImage sensors are useful because they are so flexible. With the right algorithm, an image sensor can sense or detect practically anything.  But there are two drawbacks with image sensors: 1) they output lots of data, dozens of megabytes per second, and 2) processing this amount of data can overwhelm many processors.  And if the processor can keep up with the data, much of its processing power won't be available for other tasks.  \nPixy addresses these problems by pairing a powerful dedicated processor with the image sensor.  Pixy processes images from the image sensor and only sends the useful information (e.g. purple dinosaur detected at x=54, y=103) to your microcontroller.  And it does this at frame rate (50 Hz).  The information is available through one of several interfaces: UART serial, SPI, I2C, digital out, or analog out.  So your Arduino or other microcontroller can talk easily with Pixy and still have plenty of CPU available for other tasks.  \nIt's possible to hook up multiple Pixys to your microcontroller -- for example, a robot with 4 Pixys and 360 degrees of sensing.  Or use Pixy without a microcontroller and use the digital or analog outputs to trigger events, switches, servos, etc. \nPixy easily connects to Arduino or other microcontrollers.\nPurple dinosaurs (and other things)\nPixy uses a hue-based color filtering algorithm to detect objects.  Most of us are familiar with RGB (red, green, and blue) to represent colors.  Pixy calculates the hue and saturation of each RGB pixel from the image sensor and uses these as the primary filtering parameters.  The hue of an object remains largely unchanged with changes in lighting and exposure.  Changes in lighting and exposure can have a frustrating effect on color filtering algorithms, causing them to break.  Pixy\u2019s filtering algorithm is robust when it comes to lighting and exposure changes and significantly better than previous versions of the CMUcam.  \nSeven color signatures\nPixy remembers up to 7 different color signatures, which means that if you have 7 different objects with unique colors, Pixy\u2019s color filtering algorithm will have no problem identifying them.  If you need more than seven, you can use color codes (see below).  \nHundreds of objects\nPixy can find literally hundreds of objects at a time.  It uses a connected components algorithm to determine where one object begins and another ends.  Pixy then compiles the sizes and locations of each object and reports them through one of its interfaces (e.g. SPI).  \nPixy can track multiple objects with multiple color signatures (PixyMon view shown.)\n50 frames per second\nWhat does \u201c50 frames per second\u201d mean?  In short, it means Pixy is fast.  Pixy processes an entire 640x400 image frame every 1/50th of a second (20 milliseconds).  This means that you get a complete update of all detected objects' positions every 20 ms.  At this rate, tracking the path of falling/bouncing ball is possible.  (A ball traveling at 30 mph moves less than a foot in 20 ms.)   \nPixy is fast, so your robot can be fast -- shown with glasses and wig (optional).\nTeach it the objects you're interested in\nPixy is unique because you can physically teach it what you are interested in sensing.  Purple dinosaur?  Place the dinosaur in front of Pixy and press the button.  Orange ball?  Place the ball in front of Pixy and press the button.  It\u2019s easy, and it's fast.    \nMore specifically, you teach Pixy by holding the object in front of its lens while holding down the button located on top.  While doing this, the RGB LED under the lens provides feedback regarding which object it is looking at directly.  For example, the LED turns orange when an orange ball is placed directly in front of Pixy.  Release the button and Pixy generates a statistical model of the colors contained in the object and stores them in flash.  It will then use this statistical model to find objects with similar color signatures in its frame from then on.  \nPixy being taught. When color LED matches the color of the object, release button. Pixy will then find objects that match.\nPixy can learn seven color signatures, numbered 1-7.  Color signature 1 is the default signature.  To teach Pixy the other signatures (2-7) requires a simple button pressing sequence.      \nAbout the cost of two sonar sensors\nWe\u2019ve done our best to keep the cost of Pixy as low as possible.  Improvements in technology deserve much of the credit, but this Kickstarter campaign is a big help also.  The Kickstarter funds allow us to manufacture in sufficient quantity to get the parts and manufacturing costs down.  The result is that Pixy is available to a wider audience, which has always been the point of the CMUcam: to put a capable, easy to use vision sensor in the hands of lots of people.\nPixyMon lets you see what Pixy sees\nPixyMon is an application that runs on your PC or Mac.  It allows you to see what Pixy sees, either as raw or processed video.  It also allows you to configure your Pixy, set the output port and manage color signatures.  PixyMon communicates with Pixy over a standard mini USB cable.\nPixyMon is great for debugging your application.  You can plug a USB cable into the back of Pixy and run PixyMon and then see what Pixy sees while it is hooked to your Arduino or other microcontroller -- no need to unplug anything.  PixyMon is open source, like everything else.  It's written using the Qt framework.  \nPixyMon runs on PC or Mac and allows you to see what Pixy sees. Communication takes place over standard USB cable.\nWhat\u2019s a \u201ccolor code\u201d?\nA color code (CC) is two or more color tags placed close together.  Pixy can detect and decode CCs and present them as special objects.  CCs are useful if you have lots of objects you want to detect and identify (i.e. more than could be detected with the seven separate color signatures alone.)  \nSimple color code (left), as Pixy sees it (right, shown via PixyMon)\nIn the video, we created CCs with 2 color tags using 4 different colors (identified by teaching Pixy 4 different color signatures).  Depending on your requirements, such a scheme (2 tags, 4 colors) can detect up to 12 unique objects.  CCs with 3, 4 and 5 tags and/or more different colors are possible and can allow for many, many more unique objects.  (In fact, thousands of unique codes are possible by using CCs with 5 tags and 6 colors.  Hello inkjet printer!)  \nWhy Color Codes?  \nCCs are useful if you have lots of objects you want to detect and identify, more than could be detected with the seven separate color signatures alone. CCs also improve detection accuracy by decreasing false detections.  That is, there is a low probability that specific colors will occur both in a specific order and close together.  The drawback is that you need to place a CC on each object you\u2019re interested in detecting.  Often the object you\u2019re interested in (yellow ball, purple toy) has a unique color signature and CCs aren\u2019t needed.  Objects with CCs and objects without CCs can be used side-by-side with no problems, so you are free to use CCs for some objects and not others.\nCCs give you an accurate angle estimate of the object (in addition to the position and size).  This is a computational \u201cfreebie\u201d that some applications may find useful.  The angle estimate, decoded CCs, regular objects and all of their positions and sizes are provided at 50 frames per second.   \nCCs might be particularly useful for helping a robot navigate.  For example, an indoor environment with CCs uniquely identifying each doorway and hallway would be both low-cost and robust.  \nThe team\nRich LeGrand has been playing with robots and embedded systems for 25 years.  He started Charmed Labs in 2002 with the goal of \u201cbringing advanced technologies to new audiences by making the technologies easy to use and affordable.  And to have fun in the process.\u201d  (That's Pixy!)  \nScott Robinson started working on Pixy as a graduate student at CMU.  His focus has typically been in embedded systems, AI, and computer vision, which is why the CMUcam has been such a great fit for him. He's now working at Sandia National Laboratories as an R&D Engineer and is continuing to provide frequent updates to the CMUcam project. You can check out his blog at stackabuse.com\nAnthony Rowe is a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University who has worked in the area of embedded systems for more than a decade   His group at CMU studies the design of next generation connected sensing and control systems.  Part of this work included earlier versions of the CMUcam, which we hope to take to the next level through this project.  \nHow will the funds be used?\nIn order to get the pricing down for Pixy, we need to manufacture in sufficient quantities (1000 or more.)  The funds will be used to buy parts and to make manufacturing and test fixtures for future builds.  \nTechnical specs\nProcessor: NXP  LPC4330, 204 MHz, dual core\nImage sensor: Omnivision OV9715, 1/4\", 1280x800\nLens field-of-view: 75 degrees horizontal, 47 degrees vertical\nLens type: standard M12 (several different types available)\nPower consumption: 140 mA typical\nPower input: USB input (5V) or unregulated input (6V to 10V)\nRAM: 264K bytes\nFlash: 1M bytes\nAvailable data outputs: UART serial, SPI, I2C, USB, digital, analog\nDimensions: 2.1\" x 1.75\" x 1.4\"\nPixy running your algorithm\nPixy will ship with the software and firmware that will do everything seen in the video and described here.  You can use this software and firmware as-is (we expect 90% of users to do this.)  Or you can build on it, modify it, or completely replace it.  Pixy is a good, low-cost, general purpose vision platform for running other algorithms -- a QR code decoder, a face detector, an interactive pointing device (a la mouse), or something entirely different and new.  All software and firmware is open source and GPL licensed.  All hardware is open under the Open Source Hardware License. (This means you can do pretty much anything you want -- even sell what you've created.)  \nPixy's ports (back of Pixy)\nI/O port pinouts\nCommunication (protocols and such)\nPixy communicates through UART, SPI, I2C, digital or analog output.  You can configure which interface you want to use through PixyMon.  The serial interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C) use a simple binary protocol.  Every 20 ms, Pixy outputs a list of objects it has detected with each object represented by an \"Object Block\" (see below).  \nThe protocol is data-efficient binary.\nThe objects in each frame are sorted by size, with the largest objects sent first.\nYou can configure the maximum number of objects sent per frame\nI2C relies on polling to receive updates.  \nUSB is also available, and uses a different protocol (same protocol Pixymon uses.)\n\nObject Block data fields. Pixy sends an Object Block for each detected object in each frame.\nNo microcontroller necessary\nPixy can also use a simple digital and analog output to communicate with simple devices such as relays, motors and lights.  \nWhen communicating via analog, the analog output represents the X or Y position of the largest detected object of a specified color signature that exceeds a specified size.\nWhen communicating through digital, the digital output goes high when an object of a specified color signature exceeds a specified size.\n\nDesign longevity\nImage sensors are consumer devices -- new sensors are released every year that take advantage of new process technologies, and older sensors are discontinued.  It's not unusual for an image sensor to have a lifetime of only a couple years.  Any device that uses an image sensor will have to contend with this issue -- there will come a day when the specific image sensor in the design will no longer be available.  Previous CMUcams had this problem and had to be discontinued.  \nPixy addresses this issue on several fronts:\nWe chose an image sensor that is targeted for the automotive industry.  Automotive products (silicon devices) have longer lifetimes.\nWe chose a basic sensor with raw Bayer output.  This is the most common type of sensor, and when/if we need to switch sensors, we will have a large selection to choose from, and the code changes will be minimal.\nWe did not choose a camera module (sensor/lens combination).  We mount the image sensor ourselves and use a standard M12 lens holder and lens.  Camera modules tend to have the shortest product lifetimes because they target the fast-paced smart phone, tablet, and laptop industry.  An M12 lens is also replaceable -- you can choose a different lens with a field-of-view and f-stop that works best for your application.  (We chose a lens with a 75-degree horizontal field-of-view and f1.2, which is great for robotics applications, but you can easily replace.)  \nPixy is ready \nWe have lined up a reputable contract manufacturer that can easily handle the quantities we anticipate.  They will handle all component procurement, PCB fabrication, component placement and assembled product testing.  This contract manufacturer was able to complete every manufacturing step and deliver a working product in our most recent production run.  When we have the funds for a larger production run, our contract manufacturer will be ready!   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPixy has already been through two revisions and two small production runs. The current version is mature and ready for production. The latest was a trial production run with the contract manufacturer that we plan to use for large-quantity production. Still, there are risks with any hardware product, particularly with parts procurement and manufacturing issues, but we feel we have reduced these risks significantly. \n\nWe have verified all algorithms that will ship with the completed version, but there is still a fair amount of software that needs to be readied for release. Reducing the amount of time this takes will be our biggest challenge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "What should we talk about?", "update_content": "Hi everybody!\nJust a quick update for y'all.

They are unicellular algae of the division Dinoflagellata and of the species Pyrocystis fusiformis.\nQ2 // What is the life expectancy of the Dino Pet?\nA2 // The life of the dinoflagellates vary based on their exposure to sunshine, temperature and how quickly they require new nutrients to be supplemented. Typically, a Dino Pet will live for approximately 1 month to 3 months. You can extend this period by adding Dino Food (supplemental growth medium) which can be purchased from Yonder Biology. By regularly adding Dino Food, the dinos can live indefinitely.  You can also purchase refills of the dinoflagellates for your Dino Pet from Yonder Biology.  A complete care manual is included with the shipment of your Dino Pet.\nWe guarantee that your Dino Pet will arrive alive and healthy. If the dinos are not alive upon arrival, we will issue a replacement order immediately. Please contact us immediately and we will process the new dino shipment right away.\nQ3 // How are the Dino Pets shipped?\nA3 // Yonder will ship the Dino Pets with an expedited delivery service (FedEx or USPS Priority Mail). This is particularly important when shipping to extremely warm or cold destinations.\nQ4 // What happens if I drink the dinos?\nA4 // We recommend that you do not drink the dinoflagellates. However, the Pyrocystis fusiformis species of dinos we use in the Dino Pet are not toxic and are safe for children.\nQ5 // How do I care for the pet?\nA5 // Just leave the dinos in a sun lit room out of direct sunlight. You can also leave them under a low watt bulb for 10 to 12 hours/day. They should be kept between 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit to live optimally. Detailed care instructions are included with the Dino Pet.\nQ6 // How fast do these Dinos grow?\nA6 // The dinos' growth is dependent on the amount of available light, dark and nutrients.  You can control dino growth by the amount of light they get every day. More detailed care instruction are provided with the Dino Pet.\nDinos will live for 1-3 months without doing anything but giving them light.  Yonder sells dino nutrients or new dinos to extend the life of your pet. \nQ7 // Please explain how this container works...\nA7 // The Dino Pet is delivered full of dinoflagellates.  The container may be opened to add dino nutrients or fresh dinos.\nQ8 // What is the Dino Pet made of? PET? Glass?\nA8 // The Dino Pet will be made from a polyethylene based plastic.  \nQ9 // Why does your apatosaurus not have a tail?\nA9 // Would you like a tail on your Dino Pet?  Let us know your thoughts and we'll consider it.\nQ10 // Will you explain the light / dark cycle of dinoflagellates?\nA10 // Dinos grow and recharge during daylight hours by converting the sun\u2019s energy (or light energy) into chemical energy that they use to live and grow. Bioluminescence is visible only during dark cycles due the dinos\u2019 circadian rhythm that\u2019s based on light-dark cycles (typically 12-hours light / 12-hours dark).\nQ11 // What makes this a good pet for kids?\nA11 // Dinos are non-toxic, safe and teach kids how to care for a pet while not having to directly feed, walk or pick up after the pet.  The better they care for their Dino Pet the more light they will get in return.  Happy Dinos = Bright bioluminescence\nQ12 // What makes this a great present?\nA12 // Dino\u2019s make a great gift because they are easy to care for and unique.  Do you know anyone who has living, glowing pet? \nQ13 // Do I have to find a dinositter if I go on vacation?\nA13 // Nope! Just leave your Dino Pet in a sun lit room out of direct sunlight\nQ14 // Where did dinoflagellates originate? Where are these Dinos naturally found?\nA14 // These particular dinos are from the ocean.\nQ15 // How will the funds raised be used?\nA15 // We will use the funds to create the tooling for the Dino Pet, scale up our bio-manufacturing of the dinoflagellates and perform the first production run.\nQ16 // How much is the \u2018Dino Food\u2019 and how long will it last?\nA16 // The Dino Food is $10 for a liter which should last 4-6 months depending on how frequently you change the water.\nThe Dino Pet currently holds ~500mL of liquid. We've had dinoflagellates living in closed containers for 9 months and they\u2019re still bioluminescing, although not as bright. However, we prefer to pour off ~half of the container and fill it back up with Dino Food (sterile salt water + nutrients) as soon as they start to dim to keep them at their brightest.  You\u2019ll see dimming somewhere between 1-3 months.\nQ17 // Where is the opening on the Dino Pet to insert the food?\nA17 // We\u2019re still evaluating several options for the access port on the Dino Pet. These options are undergoing final evaluation now. Ideally, it'll be on the bottom of the rear right foot or under the belly. Importantly, we want to make sure there is no leakage. Our team is testing this thoroughly now. Some of you have mentioned that a tail could be a good place for the port -- we\u2019ll take a serious look at that option too.\nQ18 // How long do the dinoflagellates bioluminesce after shaking?\nA18 // The dinoflagellates must be shaken in order to maintain an intense bioluminescence. However, after shaking, they will continue to propel through the water for a while allowing you to see individual cells.\nTHE NEXT STEPS // MANUFACTURING PLAN\nOver the last year and a half, we\u2019ve worked with marine biologists and thermoplastic engineers to refine our concepts for the Dino Pet. Upon successful funding, we\u2019ll advance to the next stage of development of the Dino Pet: manufacturing.\nBIOMANUFACTURING\nWe will biomanufacture the dinoflagellates in our own facility in Carlsbad, California. This requires a scaling of our current operations from 300L per year to a capacity that meets the demand of this campaign\u2019s goals. To successfully scale to meet demand we\u2019ll add lights, bioreactors, temperature controllers and purification systems to our current work flow.\nMANUFACTURING\nFor the Dino Pet production (the container), we have partnered with an experienced, domestic thermoplastic manufacturer. Successful campaign funding will trigger mass production of the Dino Pet archetype to fulfill our campaign goals. The production units will include a valve to fill the Dino Pets, replenish nutrients and add/remove dinoflagellates.\nThanks for your support. We are ready to glow!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYonder has developed a robust method for growing dinoflagellates, the bioluminescent algae that are used inside the Dino Pet. We have also developed great relationships with manufacturing partners. We are prepared to move quickly to meet the delivery dates projected for the Dino Pets. If there are any set backs or changes along the way, we will remain transparent and update our community of supporters accordingly.\n\nShip date: We are confident that the Dino Pets will ship on schedule. If either the manufacturing or biomanufacturing take longer than anticipated, we will update our community in real-time.\n\nProduct changes: We will continually refine the Dino Pet to ensure optimal health, growth and bioluminescence of the dinos during the tooling development.

It exceeded our goal, our hopes, even our understanding of what's possible. If you missed getting involved as a backer, please visit spurcycle.com.\nOur objective was simple: design a bell that is exceedingly effective in a busy, urban environment AND that looks sexy on any bike. We tasked ourselves with distilling your average clunker bell into a smaller, more potent, and more streamlined form\u2014befitting even a peleton-crushing road bike. To do so forced us to reconsider every design aspect and engineer to a higher standard.\nFORM:  We set out to design a compact, well-integrated component. A large bell may sound great but protrudes and looks bulky installed on many modern bicycles. Meanwhile, the tiny micro bells on the market are too small\u2014dinky really, and generally cheaply made. We pursued the best form by way of the cleanest execution, encompassing both modern and classic aesthetics. It\u2019s a bell that\u2019s just the right size, tidy not tiny. Streamlined and effective.\nMOUNT: Even a bell of the right size and shape flows best if it can be reoriented and positioned to match the bike's form. Our mount was engineered around adjustability. A single fastener is visible through the top of the dome, and that\u2019s the only bolt needed to secure the entire assembly. This thru-bolt design allows the overall form to stay super clean but fits a broad (22-32mm) range of diameters. That means you can mount it near the brake of your flat-bar commuter or near the stem of your oversize road handlebar. \nACTUATION: Our unibody wire lever is a powerfully simple design. Utilizing the wire's natural torsional springiness, we can deliver proper ergonomics and modulation while maximizing aesthetic simplicity and functional reliability. \nWe wanted an actuation that doesn't require much reach, just a flick of your thumb without repositioning or stretching the width of your hand. Moreover, modulation is key: from a light courtesy \"ding\" while passing another rider to an alarming \"DING-DING-DING\" to grab a driver's attention. \nBetter still, our bell doesn't rattle or ring when it isn't supposed to, over rough road or potholes. In fact, we've raced mountain bikes with our bell, which made not a sound until we needed to pass.\nSOUND: We didn't work on a beautiful bell and ignore the critical function of a bell. It's got to be loud enough to alert other riders and drivers. Of course, it's nicer if the sound is effective without losing its pleasant tone. That's why we've chosen to work with Bevin Brothers\u2014a company that's been making bells since the Industrial Revolution\u2014and why we've chosen alloys that make an inherently better sound. After all, if you just want to annoy people, you can always buy a horn.\nMATERIAL: To make the highest quality bell, you need premium materials. We've chosen metals that will never rust: stainless steel, aluminum, and brass. No plastic. No junk \"pot metal\". No shortcuts. \nDome size: \u230030mm x 20.5mm Total bell weight: 42g\nFunding\nWe've spent hundreds of hours designing and working out production. The next part is relatively simple. We need money to buy enough bells to make factory production feasible. We have quotes to produce only a few hundred bells and quotes to produce several thousand. We've set our goal at just $20k, because that's the minimum we need to get started down our path and deliver a limited batch of bells into the hands of our supporters. \nTimeline\nWe're lucky. We've found some great partners with whom to collaborate on our bell design & production. We have our GripRings Kickstarter project experience to draw on. It allows us to timeline this project with confidence.\nAUGUST: Finalize production design & successfully fund Kickstarter project. \nSEPTEMBER/OCTOBER: Work around the clock to hand craft and assemble the best bells you've ever seen. \nNOVEMBER: Ship. \nPledge for RAW or BLACK. Or both.\nLimited Kickstarter POLISHED edition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe used Kickstarter to launch GripRings last year, funding our compression tooling which helped us deliver to 252 happy backers and\u2014as of March 2013\u2014to distributors in Australia, Holland, Italy, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, and of course to several domestically. We're very familiar with the challenges of design, production, shipping and communication. \n\nIn the last 8 months, we've made many (many) versions of our bell. We've hacked a few materials in our own workshop. We've 3D printed them in durable plastics. We've even \"printed\" a few metal domes to help us refine the geometry of this critical bell component. We have Bevin Brothers and Peridot (an amazing facility in nearby Pleasanton, CA) awaiting our cue. We've already met with them dozens of times and will be on-site during our initial phases of production. The risks are as minimal as they get going into a project like this. \n\nThat said, to make more than a couple bells, we need to establish proper manufacturing and assembly fixtures, so that we can work much more quickly and ensure a high level of consistency. This will take a wad of cash, some ingenuity, and likely some period of trial until we get everything just right. \n\nA distant concern is with regard to mass production costs. We'd like to be able to offer these high quality bells at a price point that isn't out of reach for the average rider. Lucky for anyone that backs this project, you're sure to get the highest quality materials and construction at a known pledge level. Of course, we'll also continue to update you on the finer points of process and progress.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "One Bell Year later...", "update_content": "We have spent the last few weeks assembling thousands (and thousands) of Raw bells.

We've been working on this extra-long update, packing in detail for an important milestone: many bell parts have arrived and subassemblies are underway.\nWe're pushing vendors to produce parts as quickly as possible, but several issues have caused further delays. On a positive note, the last few weeks have been a bit of a parts party for us. We've driven around the San Francisco area picking up components from our manufacturing partners, and we're very happy with the quality. Here's a quick breakdown of parts received."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 353, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/139160027/a-better-bicycle-bell-made-in-the-usa", "project_name": "A better bicycle bell, made in the USA."}}]
