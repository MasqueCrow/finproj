Today, this new home offers opportunity and peril. Remnants of ancient civilizations hold dangerous knowledge and forbidden power. Your people build settlements on new worlds, but those places rarely offer a safe haven. Conflicts often rage between people and factions. Pirates prowl the spaceways in search of easy prey. Baneful creatures and dark forces dwell on corrupted planets and in the abyssal void between stars.\nEncounter creatures both wonderous and horrifying (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nThe default tone for Starforged is human-centric science fiction on a perilous frontier. This is a scavenged future, with starships cobbled together from salvage. People cling to survival on inhospitable worlds and in remote space stations. Much has been forgotten or lost.\nVisit Remote Settlements on perilous worlds (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nIt's a dangerous life for anyone living in the Forge, and doubly so for the Ironsworn\u2014those adventurers bound to sworn quests.\nSwear iron vows and see them fulfilled or forsaken (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nInspiration comes from the the quest-driven adventures of The Mandalorian, the lived-in aesthetic and outer-rim locations of the original Star Wars trilogy, the workaday exploits of Firefly, the isolated suspense and industrial grittiness of Alien, the desperation and retro-tech of the modern reboot of Battlestar Galactica, the mysticism of Dune, and the cosmic mysteries and class struggles of The Expanse. It's all blended together into a heady stew of perilous sci-fi adventure, and topped with a dollop of Guardians of the Galaxy gonzo.\nMost aspects of the setting can be adjusted to your preferences. The campaign launch exercises offer inspiring prompts and guidance to immerse you in a galaxy of your own creation. \nThe Art\nStarforged is packed with amazing illustrations by lead artist Joshua Meehan. Josh composites photos, textures, 3d objects, and hand-painted elements to create a vibrant, cinematic rendering of the people, places, and perils of the Forge.\nSet off on perilous expeditions (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nJosh uses the Starforged oracle tables and generators to help build the unique subjects and aspects of each illustration. The art is directly inspired by the game!\nDevelopment process for an Ironsworn: Starforged illustration - from initial concept to finished piece (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nExplore mysterious precursor sites (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nIt's a perilous galaxy, so consider bringing an ally (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nFace deadly foes in high-action battles (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nThe System\nStarforged is true to Ironsworn's roots, tuned to fit the spaceborne setting, while incorporating experience and feedback from years of development and play. \nIf you're new to Ironsworn, here's a summary of how it works.\nThree Ways to Play\nLike it's predecessor,  Ironsworn: Starforged offers three ways to play.\n Guided: One or more players take the role of their characters, while a guide moderates the session.\n Co-Op You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A guide is not required.\n Solo: You portray a lone character driven to fulfill vows in a dangerous galaxy. Good luck!\nYour Character\nThe Starforged playscape, with print-and-play asset cards and character sheet.\nYour character in Starforged is composed of stats and trackers. These elements help you determine the outcome when you perform risky actions.\nAs you complete quests, make discoveries, and form bonds, you gain experience. You spend this experience to add assets\u2014vehicles, modules, paths, companions, and deeds\u2014which deepen your abilities and options.\nCharacter creation is fast and flexible, with a guided exercise to help define your background, resources, expertise, and goals.\nMoves\nMoves are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or question. There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations you encounter in Starforged. \nFor solo and co-op play,  moves help resolve your actions and trigger new opportunities and complications. For guided play, moves take an active role in the conversation between the guide and the other players.\nSample move from Starforged.\nIronsworn: Starforged moves are inspired by the innovative, fiction-first mechanics of the Apocalypse World system created by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.\nMomentum\nThe momentum meter is one of your character's most important mechanical attributes.\nMomentum is a special mechanic which is core to playing Starforged.  You can gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. This represents securing advantages, acquiring new insight, and making progress in your quests. You lose momentum when you suffer a cost which causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage.\nYou can use momentum to gain a decisive result \u2014 or avoid dire failure \u2014 on a critical move.\nAction Roll\nWhen you make a move representing a risky or uncertain action, roll three dice at once:  An action die (D6) and two challenge dice (D10). Add your relevant stat and any bonuses to your action die. This is your action score.  Then, compare your action score to each of the challenge dice and check for a strong hit, weak hit, or miss. The move will tell you how to interpret the result.\nThere are three possible outcomes for the action roll:\n Strong Hit: Your action score beats (is greater than) both the challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.\n Weak Hit: Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.\n Miss: Your action score doesn't beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions\nThe Oracles\nStarforged Oracles are random prompts and generators which help answer questions in solo or co-op games, or provide creative backup for the guide in guided play. They are an inspiration engine--ready to introduce amazing locations, surprising revelations, and dire challenges to your Starforged campaign.\nMockup of oracle tables within the Starforged rulebook.\nIf you loved the oracles in Ironsworn, you'll find much more to love here. It's an entire galaxy of possibilities! Plus, these tables are largely system agnostic and can be paired with other sci-fi systems. \nStarforged oracles are included in the Preview Edition, which is an immediate reward for backing this campaign.\nShipping Info\nThe pledge levels do not include shipping. After the Kickstarter concludes, you will pay shipping for any physical rewards through the pledge manager. \nHere is a list of shipping estimates by region. \nContiguous USA: $11-$16\nEU/UK: $20-$25\nNorway/Switzerland: $33-$41\nCanada: $20-$25\nAustralia: $21-$25\nNew Zealand: $21-$34\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong: $12-$17\nRest of Asia: $24-$36\nAll Other Countries: $57-$120\nWe are customs-friendly in the UK/EU and many other regions! Check the FAQ for details.\nPledge levels and the shipping fees above do not include VAT. If VAT fees apply in your region, you will be charged those fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. However, we want to alleviate these charges as much as we can,  so we will cover 50% of your VAT fees!\nLegacy Add-Ons\nIn collaboration with DriveThruRG, we are offering Ironsworn books and cards as add-on rewards during this campaign. These materials are not completely compatible with Starforged, but include mechanics, tips, and guidelines which might help enrich your Starforged campaigns. Plus, they allow you to experience vow-driven quests in the perilous fantasy setting of the Ironlands. These are the existing editions of these books and cards, and are not new versions or reprints.\nThe bad news: Shipping on these legacy items is managed separately through DriveThruRPG, and shipping cannot be combined with physical Starforged rewards. \nThe good news: You'll receive your reward codes after this Kickstarter campaign ends. You can order your legacy books and cards at that time, rather than waiting for release of Starforged. \nAs a thank you for supporting Starforged, printed legacy add-ons are discounted from current prices by about 15-20%. You can select these add-ons when choosing your backer level. If you add a legacy item to your pledge, you'll receive a code to purchase that item from DriveThruRPG for the cost of production and shipping.   Check this page at DriveThruRPG for current estimated shipping costs.\n Ironsworn Print Edition - Set off on perilous quests with this 270-page core rulebook. Winner of a Gold ENNIE award! \n Ironsworn Asset Deck (Printed Deck) - Upgrade your Ironsworn playscape with a deck of printed asset cards.  \n Ironsworn: Delve - With a vast array of new options and tools, Ironsworn: Delve is the perfect companion for your Ironsworn campaign.

They have experience with fulfillment and logistics, and will help ensure a smooth delivery for our valued backers.\n\nBecause this project involves a larger team than previous Ironsworn products, we may encounter delays due to a specific individual's availability. We will put measures in place to ensure that no one (including Shawn) is an indispensable resource that would cause a failure to deliver. We will keep the backers informed about what is happening with the project, and will provide regular preview releases of the book as it is developed. \n\nWe may also encounter delays due to unexpected issues with production and shipping. Working with our fulfillment partners, we will make our best effort to identify and resolve any issues before they impact the backers. \n\nShawn has always believed in open and transparent communication with Ironsworn fans, and this project will be no exception.

The book will feature the beautiful art work of  Joel Bisaillon,  brought to you by New Comet Games, the same people who brought you the award-winning Call of Cthulhu book Devil's Swamp.\nCorsairs of Cthulhu is a rules and setting supplement to the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game and focuses on the period between 1650 and 1730 CE. Your keeper can set up your investigators as crew on a pirate or privateer ship, freelancers in one of the Caribbean ports who love the gold doubloon more than a foreign governments rule, or even provide your investigators with their own ship. Working together the investigators must face evil Mythos, real and imagined. Curses left by ancient civilizations and hidden nightmares around the world.\nThe golden age of piracy is a time of spreading empires. England, France, Spain, Italy as well as several other smaller countries are planting their flags and colonies on any piece of land they can find. Empires rise and fall, Spanish ships are hauling new found gold from the new world back to Spain and ships are lost to pirates and storms regularly. Governments authorize privateers to sail under their flag but can raise the black when needed.\n There are new skills, new professions, famous NPCs and new weapons that the investigators must learn to use if they want to survive against not only the dangers of the Mythos, but also against disease, dehydration, sea monsters, warships, and other pirates.\nCorsairs of Cthulhu is not just a setting book anticipated to be approximately 360 pages, but also contains a full campaign, The Map of the Astronomer. This campaign will take your investigators to ports unknown, fantastical lands out of this world and come face to face with some of the most dangerous Elder Gods and dark creatures ever faced. Can anything prepare the investigators for the finale and the most terrifying deity of all time.\nMany of the adventures could be run as standalone, but it is designed as a full campaign. Your ship and ports of call will provide replacement investigators as needed. \n $10,000 FUNDED (UNLOCKED!) \n $13,000 Add Silk Ribbon Bookmark (UNLOCKED!) \n $16,000 Add 4 More Art pieces (UNLOCKED!) \n $20,000 Add 2nd Pirate Port of Call (UNLOCKED!) \n $25,000  Add Player Characters (UNLOCKED!) \n $30,000 Add 3rd Pirate Port of Call (UNLOCKED!) \n $35,000 Add 4 More Art pieces (UNLOCKED!) \n $40,000 Add 2 Adventure Plot Hooks (UNLOCKED!) \n $45,000 Add extra ship layout Map (UNLOCKED!) \n $50,000 Add 2 More Adventure Plot Hooks (UNLOCKED!) \n  $55,000 We're adding material for the Pulp Cthulhu\u2122 source-book!

A roleplaying love-letter to off-beat sci-fi, vintage music, and cooperative old-school styled roleplay, Orbital Blues allows you to play out rules-light tabletop adventures in the style of space westerns such as Cowboy Bebop, Firefly and Guardians of the Galaxy.\nStepping into the shoes of Interstellar Outlaws, players band together to form Crews, and navigate a hard-going, gig-economy living on the fringes of a space-faring society.\nDeveloped on the critically acclaimed rules-lite system of Best Left Buried, Orbital Blues uses a simple D6 based system with 3 basic stats - MUSCLE, GRIT, and SAVVY - to handle rolls and uncertainty - putting the narrative and relationships of the player characters at the heart of play without the baggage of hefty mechanics, classes or roles. \nIn addition to the three core stats, characters also have GAMBITS, and TROUBLES. Gambits are a measure of a character's special talents or unique abilities, whilst Troubles track the heartbreaks, set-backs and blues that Interstellar Outlaws gather around them on their adventures in a difficult universe.  With these simple values and a wealth of gambits and troubles in the core book, players can build a wide variety of unique, storied characters to explore the Frontier Galaxy. \nWorking together, Crews generate a scrappy ship to call home, and must balance their Credits & Debts  in order to stay afloat. Whether it's knowing how they'll pay for a bowl of bell peppers and beef, or where they'll find another clip for their 9mm, the session-by-session play of Orbital Blues is driven by  the rollercoaster lives of Interstellar Outlaws and the work they have to constantly seek out.\nWhether it's hauling salvage across back-water systems or getting boots on the ground sniffing out the Frontier Galaxy's most dangerous bounties, the core book of Orbital Blues is brimming with generators, adventure hooks, play prompts and even a sand-box setting for storytellers to get memorable campaigns going, whilst player characters contend with their own interpersonal relationships and troubles. \n\nOrbital Blues is a 120-Page Trade 6\"x9\"Hardback Book,  with writing and creative direction from Sam Sleney and Zachary Cox, furnished with stunning art from Josh Clark and layout work from Lone Archivist. Edited by Jared Sinclair, Orbital Blues is tight, stylish roleplaying package for all your lo-fi, sci-fi needs. \nWe're printing Orbital Blues with two alternative covers; the standard Day cover, saturated with the big blue sky and the desert dust,  and a Kickstarter-exclusive night-mode cover for those who like to keep their book collections subtle and sophisticated. \nDay Cover\n*WIP - As a Kickstarter Exclusive we really want this one to shine...\nWe use a size slightly larger than A5, Trade (6\" x 9\") across all of our books, to help us stuff more goodness into each page. The hardcover books are planned to be offset, allowing us to feature higher-quality paper, smyth-sewn bindings and all kinds of bells, whistles and ribbons with additional funding.\nThe internals of the book are being beautifully laid out by Lone Archivist, incorporating art, text and tables seamlessly into visually stunning and easy to navigate pages and spreads.\nSpread pages from Crew Ship Generation.\nA spread from The Sutler System, a sandbox adventure included in the core book.\nAs for shipping physical books,  US Distribution will be handled via Exalted Funeral, and the UK & RoW distribution will be handled in house by the SoulMuppet Publishing team. If the campaign is successful and exceeds expectations, we've got specialist fulfilment contractors in place to help fulfil and navigate shipping.\n For backers who pledge for the PDF version, we\u2019ve successfully distributed files via DriveThruRPG and Kickstarter previously and are confident we can do it again.\n\nThis campaign aims to fulfil orders for a print-run of Orbital Blues. At the time of writing, the manuscript is finished, gone through extensive playtesting with a public playtest beta, and is currently being laid out - we're just looking to get it finalised and printed in the quality it deserves, and into your hands. We have pledges for the core book at .PDF and Physical Hardback tiers to deliver on this plan.  \nFollowers of SoulMuppet Publishing know the work and care that's been put into our flagship game, Best Left Buried. With Orbital Blues, we're looking to do the same for sci-fi roleplaying as we did for dark fantasy roleplaying with BLB. We want to make a modern, robust,  and affordable game with a lifetime of support and releases.  Once this Kickstarter funds, we'll immediately start enacting plans to give this game the same longevity, support and accessibility that Best Left Buried enjoys.\nTo stay true to the vintage music roots that inspired the game, we've also collaborated with musician and tabletop writer Chris Bissette to create a  cassette tape LP of music from the universe of Orbital Blues, with Chris performing as the fictional band The Deltas. The tape comes beautifully packaged in a crimson red rave case with an small adventure on the case insert. You can pick the tape up with your book in our Bounty Hunter pledge.\nIf you're eager to dive into our visions and the sounds of Orbital Blues, Creative Director Sam has compiled a living playlist of music, containing tracks and artists that inspired the writing, creation and atmosphere of Orbital Blues.\n Music has been a huge influence in the writing of Orbital Blues, and Sam has curated this playlist to reflect the sounds and styles that have imbued the project with so much life. We have no affiliation with any of the artists in this playlist (though if anyone knows anyone, hook us up... - S) and it's purely a curation of tracks that inspired the making of the book. You can listen and follow on spotify here, and you can expect updates to the playlist whenever we have pen to paper in the future.\n\nWith Orbital Blues already sitting pretty as a completed product, and now funded, the only way is up. We're looking to support Orbital Blues as a flagship game here at SoulMuppet Publishing, and we know the best way to do that is with more adventures and expansions to the core book. Along with additional art and higher production values, each incremental amount raised for this campaign after we hit goal will fund further material from guest writers. Depending on how far we go after funding, we'll also look at adding additional tiers with extra merch. Keep an eye on the tracker below!\nOnwards and upwards, and as we approach the final 24 hours of this campaign, we're setting our sights on one last stretch goal - an upgrade to the cassettes that so many of you have pledged for. How much can you upgrade a 60 year-old storage medium, we hear you wonder. Well, at 700% funding we'll be;\nAdding Limited Edition Orbital Blues Guitar Picks to each Cassette\nPutting more content on the inlays\nAdding an A6 Tri-fold Scenario to every Cassette\nWe're looking into ensuring the Cassettes are of the highest quality, so even if you don't have a tape player, they will still make for stylish display pieces in their own right. Currently we're looking at BandCDs to fulfil the cassette prints, and you can see a portfolio of their work below - we're confident the Orbital Blues Cassette will be a gorgeous compliment to an already stunning game.\n\nUpon reaching \u00a360,000, we're proud to announce we'll be putting this additional funding towards adding the talented Basheer Ghouse to our roster of contributing writers on Orbital Blues, with one last job...\n The job was simple. Run the briefcase to the Rock of Tariq, make sure no-one opens it, and get the sort of pay-out that crews retire on. The journey wasn't exactly safe, but for that sort of money, who cares?\nYet when you arrived at the Rock, you found your employer dead and no-one able to pay you.\nNow half a dozen factions want the cargo, and most of them are willing to kill to get it. Now you're in a race against time. Figure out what's going on, offload your cargo, and get out of there. Or else you'll join the growing list of bodies on the infamous Rock of Tariq.\nBasheer  (@BasheerGhouse) is a writer and cultural consultant based out of San Jose, California. In addition to work for companies like Kobold Press and Rowan, Rook, and Deckard, he's independently published RPGs that range from absurdist comedy to collaborative horror. His contributions can be found in products like Alien Archive 4, Warlock Grimoire 2, and Spire: Shadow Operations, and his personal work can be found at his itch.io page.\nFor us, Basheer is delivering a pulp pressure cooker of an adventure, where Interstellar Outlaw Crews will find themselves pitted against dangerous opponents in a high-risk, high-stakes, and high-reward play of intrigue and action.\nIn reaching 50k, we're confident in announcing that a set 4 Orbital Blues dice will now be included with all Interstellar Kingpin pledges. This will not increase the price on that pledge.\nWe'll have some proofs of the dice with us within the week, but rest assured, they're just as glossy and polished as the rest of the project.\nIf you want to pick up these dice outside of the Interstellar Kingpin pledge, they'll be available in the post-campaign pledge manager for add-ons.\nUpon hitting \u00a345,000 in funding, we've added Giuliano Roverato (@KnightRamen) to our ever-growing team of contributing writers! Giuliano is a Brazilian narrative designer that lives for good food, tough choices and exploring weird dungeons forgotten on the corners of our reality. Best known for the culinary adventure, Bakto\u2019s Terrifying Cuisine, he is wondering if the post-fantasy RPG Brave Zenith will ever see the light of day. Oh, and he really wants to write a bossanova inspired adventure for Orbital Blues too, so let's hear about what he has in store for us!\n\"I want to see the golden shores of my old home, feel its warm sands on my feet, hear the bittersweet melodies, the ones sang to me in bedtime stories by sobbing workers. Day and night the people of Tradis station toil away, forced to clean the planet-side wasteland that the corp calls the \u201cfuture of living.\u201d\nWe are tired, angry and dying. We have nostalgia for a home that is unknown to us. This is not a strike. This a call for help. Bring us home, outlaws. Chega de Saudade.\"\n\nIn Giuliano's stirring exploration of themes of home, nostalgia, place and being, Interstellar Outlaw Crews will visit Tradis station and discover the meaning of Saudade, know the plight of its workers, and be tempted by corporate money beyond their wildest dreams. Here, you can\u2019t save everyone.\n\nThought-provoking and emotive, Giuliano's pitch is one we're incredibly excited for, and we're thrilled to have him onboard.\n Music is a key part of Orbital Blues, and we want to make sure that comes across in a full and proper way. At 400% funding, we've commissioned Chris to further extend the EP Cassette by a third, adding 3 all-new, original tracks to the runtime on both the cassette itself, and in the MP3 collection. These tracks will be perfect for use as background in your games, as atmospheric cornerstones or rip-roaring soundtracks to the adventures of Interstellar Outlaws.\nAt \u00a335,000, we added the work of Tom Mecredy to Orbital Blues' roster of adventures, providing an open, sandbox-styled storyteller's toolkit adventure for your games of Orbital Blues.\nPlaceholder!\n You'll have seen Hagstrom's glossy ads, with their smiling, weather-beaten workers mopping their brows, or relaxing in sleek habitation units, surrounded by their enthusiastic families. You'll have also heard the rumours that Hagstrom's workers are actually indentured to the company, forced to pay off their passage with hard graft. Wollaston's Hold is only a jump away - spool up the drive, and find out the truth.\nAll That Glitters pitches your outlaws into a system full of trouble - a corporate cold war is about to turn hot, revolutionary workers are amassing arms to throw off their oppressive masters, and an ambitious pirate queen is looking to pull off an audacious bullion heist. Keep a hand on your gun, don't trust anyone, and you might just make it out in one piece.\n\nTom Mecredy (@TomMecredy) is a writer and game designer based in the north of England, drawing upon his passion for history and Cold War espionage thrillers to weave tangled conspiracies and revolutions across the stars.  Tom's recent work includes High Speed Low Drag, an introspective, solo-play experience about going to war and the effects it has on soldiers, and Condotto, a Forged in the Dark game about running a company of mercenaries in 14th century Italy.\nAll That Glitters adds a true sandbox experience to Orbital Blues' adventure roster, with a variety of Factions, NPCs and jobs for crews to engage with - it's a style of play that fans of games such as Blades in the Dark will be familiar with, and we're super excited to see it added it to the ever-growing library of supplemental content storytellers can utilise for Orbital Blues.\nUpon reaching \u00a330,000, we added Momatoes to our writing team! Momatoes (@momatoes) is a Filipina game and graphic designer who has written RPGs about memory, legacy, and the dear price wizards pay for their ambition. Her biggest project, ARC, is a rules-light, tension-heavy RPG that\u2019s coming to Kickstarter in 2021 and is one of Dicebreaker\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d upcoming RPGs. For her stretch goal, Momatoes plans on writing a confounding yet compelling mystery wrapped around a deeply human heart. Not a literal heart, though\u2026 unless\u2026? \nPlaceholder!\n Alexin Arius was a pioneer, an eccentric inventor who built wondrous automatons and augments. Now, decades after their disappearance, a desperate sheriff hires a crew of Interstellar Outlaws for what looks to be a straightforward bounty: track Alexin in a promising new location, the long-forgotten Everjoy space station and amusement park.\nBut not all is what it seems, and the supposedly abandoned Everjoy is steeped in endless mystery. Rust and decay run rampant - but why does the jingle still play over the stale air? No customer had set foot in its towering rides or souvenir shops for years - but why do the animatronic mascots still greet you with a smile? And the wide-eyed children who watch you from edges and corners - who are they, and what secrets lurk in the utopia they\u2019ve built?\nVisit Everjoy now, where the good times must never end.\n\nMomatoes' EVERJOY adventure will now be available in .PDF, and will be distributed, fully illustrated, along with Sinta Posadas' A STARBORN RESISTANCE, once the core book has shipped, ensuring that everyone will have a nice shiny core book to run their adventures with! We can't wait to see what Momatoes has in store for us, and what else the future may bring for Orbital Blues!\nWe've received nothing but kind words and praise for our art direction, so as such we're taking the leap to collect all the creative energies that have made this project a reality, with Wayward Stars: The Art of Orbital Blues. A coffee table art book in miniature (we're looking at 6\" x 9\" A5 horizontal) Wayward Stars will delve into the artistic process, world-building and step-by-step explorations of how a tabletop game's art is made, with words from Josh Clark.\nPlaceholder!\nA deep-dive into the worldbuilding of Orbital Blues.\nWayward Stars will be available as an add-on, or available in the WAYWARD STAR, SPACE COWBOY 2 or INTERSTELLAR KINGPIN pledge levels, and physical copies of Wayward Stars will ship alongside core books in August 2021.\nPostcards from the Frontier Galaxy were our first stretch goal,  available from \u00a315,000. These will be included free at all pledges levels of Space Cowboy and above. We're polling 12 pieces of art to decide 3 final pieces, and Bounty Hunter pledges will receive a collection of all 3. Interstellar Outlaw pledges will get 2 of the postcards, and Space Cowboy pledges will receive one.  These Print Postcards will add no additional costs to pledges or shipping. \nAt \u00a320,000 we added the talented Sinta Posadas to our writing team! Sin Posadas (@diwataMANILA) is a game designer and illustrator obsessed with the galaxy and all of its possible tragedies that lie in wait, just out of reach. \nSin has pitched us an adventure called A STARBORN RESISTANCE, which we'll be releasing in .PDF form.\nPlaceholder Cover.\nVaris X-0 was once a gleaming jewel in the crown of the Wings of Valor Confederacy. The Confederacy constructed \"Harvester Homes\" of the Scintilla Commune, a string of asteroid belts fitted onto an intra-atmospheric nuclear power harvester, home to any colonist willing to risk their necks for the promise of cheap lodging and a regular wage.  \nAfter a cheaper extraction method was found a few million light years away, the Confederacy abandoned the system, leaving the Harvester Homes to rust. These days, it's just a few Interstellar Outlaws trying to keep the place afloat: salvaging equipment, finding food and power, fighting off bandits and worse. In this delapidated backwater, communities need help to keep things afloat. But what happens when a representative of the Confederacy returns, promising to restore glory to the Scintilla? At what cost? To what end for the Confederacy? And what's in it for you?\n\nUpon reaching \u00a320,000 in funding, A Starborn Resistance began development, and will release as a .PDF adventure shortly after the release of the physical Orbital Blues core rulebook in August 2021. Should we reach levels of funding to commission a several contributing writers, we'll compile their works into a compilation for physical release later in the year.\n\nOrbital Blues is a SoulMuppet Publishing Production, but it has been brought about by a crack-team of independent talent to make something fresh & exciting. Here's the run-down on who's who.\n\nSam Sleney (@samsleney) is a freelance writer, and Creative Director for First Falling Leaf Publishing. Orbital Blues is Sam's manuscript and creative vision, born out of a lifetime love of space westerns, and being raised on the records of Bruce Springsteen in lieu of a father figure.  Together with artistic realisations from Josh Clark and the mechanical mind of Zachary Cox, Sam has fused the team's talent into the Interstellar Blues Explosion that is Orbital Blues. \n\nJosh Clark (@tinywoodsman) is an artist and creator who has worked on everything from album covers to business cards and video games to podcast art. His work can be seen in First Falling Leaf's \"Sins: Dead City \", From Sorrow To Serenity's \"Trifecta EP Project\" and in the worldbuilding booklet \"The Quiet Future\". He can be found at TinyWoodsman. As our lead artist, Josh brought the world & creative vision of Orbital Blues to life from the Day 1, and made the project what it is today. \n\nZachary Cox (@JellyMuppet) is the Managing Partner of SoulMuppet Publishing, dabbling in everything from printing, distribution, management and social media. The original creator of Best Left Buried, Zach has contributed to the mechanical writing and masterminded improvements on Best Left Buried's engine for Orbital Blues, adapting the original SRD and mechanics to perfectly accompany lo-fi, space western roleplay.\nJared Sinclair (@infinite_mao) is an editor and sometime writer of games and games-related material. His work as a writer includes Anti-Sisyphus, What's So Cool About Outer Space?, Prismot!, and The Vanilla Game. He also runs Spear Witch, an independent online bookstore specializing in small-creator game books and zines. As our editor, Jared cut the manuscript of Orbital Blues into shape, making it into a lean, cohesive and accessible book that cuts right to the heart of thematic play. \n\nLone Archivist (@LoneArchivist) is a game and graphic designer based out of Southern California. His work includes writing and design for a handful of third-party modules for games such as Mothership and Best Left Buried as well as several self-published system-agnostic game supplements. When not working on games he can be found crate-digging for a new Jazz record or adding yet another book to the TBR list. Lone is currently hard at working coalescing the manuscript, art and style of Orbital Blues into a tight, stylish and striking print. \n\nChris Bissette (@Pangalactic) is a Manchester-based game designer and musician. His game The Wretched - along with its original soundtrack - was selected as one of Tabletop Gaming Magazine's Best Games of 2020 and has spawned hundreds of games using its Wretched & Alone engine. Chris is performing as the fictional band The Deltas on their debut Cassette LP, Orbital Blues, which you can pick up alongside the core rulebook as a keynote piece. You can find Chris' music, games, and more at LootTheRoom. \n\nSin is the designer of the Planted RPG series, a small collection of tabletop rpgs where you play as sentient plants defending your homes from evil bugs. Their other works include explorations into your deepest fears in the Deep, Deep River, fanciful food trips in Lutong Banwa, and playing out the dramatics of being agents of a Tower racing against the Apocalypse in Navathem's End. They're currently working to complete Navathem's End after it was successfully funded as part of the recently concluded #OurShores Kickstarter campaign. You can find their other melancholic games here, on their itch.io page. Sin will be writing A Starborn Resistance, an adventure for Orbital Blues achieved as a stretch goal. \n\nMomatoes (@momatoes) is a Filipina game and graphic designer who has written RPGs about memory, legacy, and the dear price wizards pay for their ambition. Her biggest project, ARC, is a rules-light, tension-heavy RPG that\u2019s coming to Kickstarter in 2021 and is one of Dicebreaker\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d upcoming RPGs.  Momatoes will be writing EVERYJOY, an Orbital Blues adventure that we unlocked as a stretch goal.\n\nOrbital Blues began life as an internal passion project, that snowballed into release through enthusiasm and available connections in lockdown. We're looking to diversify the team for Orbital Blues with immediate stretch goals for writers and contributors from a greater wealth of backgrounds than the core team, and will be adding such individuals here once we've hired them at competitive rates. If you're interested in writing for Orbital Blues, get in touch here, with writing samples, pitches or portfolios.\n\nWe've had a few people now from various parts of the world asking for more detailed shipping information so they can make an informed decision about pledging. When you take Brexit, the global pandemic and shipping delays, and add them to the fact SoulMuppet Publishing only has experience in smaller scale print-runs from calmer times, it's been hard to make estimated guesses on the prices of shipping for a project that's shaping up to be this successful. However, we've gone away, done our homework, made some enquiries and ran some numbers, and below are our current shipping estimates.\nWe'll update this image where it appears on the main campaign body actively whenever anything changes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our book already being in final stages of completion and this Kickstarter serving as a means of production, we don't have any concerns for the completion of this project. As we already navigated the fulfilments in previous campaigns such as Best Left Buried: Deeper and Stygian Library, we also don't have any concerns regarding deliveries and distributions.

The one people whisper about. The one that has gone unlived in for years. Sometimes a few hearty souls creep in, it is said, to see what treasures or secrets they can find. Most find nothing\u2014just an empty old house. Some return shaken. A few don\u2019t return at all.\nYou\u2019ve seen this house before. If not in this city, then in some other. You\u2019ve heard the rumors\u2014and if you haven\u2019t, well, someday they\u2019ll find you.\nWhat happens to a house when it sits alone for so many long years? What jealousies and hatreds does it quietly nurture? What whispers echo through its empty hallways? What waits, crouched within its dark rooms, hungering for the return of life?\nFor you.\nThe Darkest House is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) product built from the ground up for online play, with unique features that take advantage of the online environment for an awesome experience. It's compatible with the game you're playing now. In fact, it's made for it! That\u2019s because The Darkest House derives its horror from the bonds, backstories, ideals, loves, and fears your existing characters bring into it. Experiencing it will add depth to your campaign, your party, and your characters\u2014those who come out alive!\nCross the threshold. Explore The Darkest House. The experience will change and challenge your PCs, their party, and your gaming group. And you won't have to wait long: You'll  have everything you need to bring The Darkest House to your campaign in May (with extras and exclusives to follow).\nScroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House!\nThe Darkest House is a digital product designed specifically to the needs of running and playing games online\u2014and built to take maximum advantage of that mode of play. Think of it like an RPG book reimagined to make the most of the online environment. Every image and map is conveniently shareable and downloadable. Each encounter is formatted to your screen, giving you everything you need in a single view. Text for sharing with the players is easily copied with a single click. A rich network of hyperlinks makes navigation simple and intuitive. The Darkest House is as easy on the GM as the house itself is challenging to the PCs.\nUse The Darkest House in conjunction with your preferred online TTRPG platform: run your game on Zoom or Discord, or use a virtual tabletop (VTT) like Roll20 or Astral. Only the GM needs a copy of The Darkest House\u2014like a conventional RPG product, it gives the GM the information, resources, and tools to run the game, plus loads of handouts, images, and other sharable items to distribute, as appropriate, to the players.\nThe Darkest House consists of:\nThe downloadable product, containing the many dozens of rooms of the house itself. This is what the GM will primarily use during play. There\u2019s enough content for many visits to the house, and dozens of hours of play\u2014and through stretch goals the house continues to grow!\n The Darkest House: Secrets of the House in PDF, a GM's guide detailing the House's background, conversion rules, and the House Rules set you'll use as your PCs explore, and try to escape from, the Darkest House.\n The Darkest House Player's Guide in PDF, which gives players the character conversion rules and everything they need to explore (and try to escape from) the Darkest House.\nTo use The Darkest House, the GM will need a desktop or laptop computer running macOS or Windows and a broadband internet connection. Scroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House.\nHow It Works\nAlthough The Darkest House is a completely new type of product, you'll use it in basically the same way you use a typical RPG book or PDF\u2014it's just easier and has a lot more features for online play. You'll still use a VTT or videoconference platform (such as Roll20 or Zoom) to run your game. Your players won't access The Darkest House app itself\u2014like a physical adventure book, it's just for the GM. (You will share The Darkest House Player's Guide PDF, and loads of handouts, maps, and images with them, though.)\nHere's an example: Charles normally runs his games using Zoom for audio and video, and Slack for text messaging, sharing JPGs of handouts, and rolling dice. In addition, he has his game books and notes open on his desk beside him, or PDFs and other files open on his computer. When running The Darkest House, he'll use Zoom and Slack the same way, and keep The Darkest House app open on his computer in place of all those books or PDFs. He can share maps, images, and text with just a click or two, pasting them into his Slack channel as the PCs encounter new rooms, creatures, and clues.\nLaTia runs her games on Roll20. The Darkest House works the same way in that environment, with one additional advantage: LaTia can set up her encounters in advance, downloading the maps and resources before the game starts and setting them up within Roll20.\nTry It!\nWant to see how it works?

Open it, have a look at the intro page, and explore as you see fit\u2014or take this little tour:\nClick Explore The Darkest House Now on the right side of the intro page and you'll find yourself in the Boundless Room, just one example of the House's many, many rooms.\nSee the words Pried Up Floorboards on the map?

Click The Giggling Ghost at the bottom right of the screen.\nUnder the first set of boxed text, and click the Copy Text button. Return to this Kickstarter, go into the comments, and paste. That's how easy it is to copy and paste info for the players. Features like these make the most of the online environment\u2014making it an advantage instead of an impediment!\nYou can also share images and maps just as easily. Go to The Family Portrait and click Download under the handout to download the image, or \"Copy Link\" to paste the link into a chat or browser window to share it that way. You can do the same with the room map and main illustration.\nThe portrait holds the secret to escaping this particular room. Click the link to the Interior Courtyard to continue your exploration of the House.\nContinue to explore to discover the many ways The Darkest House stands apart from conventional RPG products. This preview of the app is not final and only demonstrates a small portion of The Darkest House. The final product may differ slightly.\nThat old house that everyone whispers about. That apartment at the end of the hall where no tenant ever stays for long. That strange unit in the station quarters sector, where everything seems a bit off. These are among the many entrances to the Darkest House.\nLike an invasive vine or a creeping shadow, the Darkest House insinuates itself into any universe. It is a malignant and primal force, unconcerned with the specifics of the worlds it seeps into. The Darkest House exists in our world\u2014in your world\u2014in any world. Wherever there is hunger, the Darkest House can gain a foothold. It is perfectly happy to take root in your campaign.\nOr campaigns. The house draws from the many worlds it touches. It need not pull all its victims from the same setting. Imagine an experience that gathers your favorite characters from different campaigns to work together to survive its horrors. As a product specially designed for online play, scattered gaming groups can come back together for a unique reunion experience.\nThe Darkest House\u2019s effect on character development and backstory makes it really shine when introduced to existing characters and campaigns. It will influence the quality of play for long after the characters have escaped it. \nInject the Darkest House into your ongoing campaign as a horror interlude or as a recurring encounter. It works as a standalone one-shot, but there\u2019s far more to the house than that. With many dozens of rooms (and growing, through stretch goals) adding up to 30-50 hours of game play, PCs who escape the house might stumble upon it later, seek it out to further plumb its mysteries, or find themselves drawn into it again to free themselves and their world of its darkness.\nThe house has many aspects, and there will always be more to discover.\nThe House System\nThe Darkest House isn't just compatible with the game you\u2019re already playing\u2014it was made for it! Within The Darkest House, you\u2019ll use the House System. You\u2019ll quickly and easily convert your existing characters (it takes about five minutes) and use those stats while in The Darkest House. Once the PCs emerge, your players will return to their regular setting using their regular character sheets. The House System is a sort of RPG Rosetta Stone, allowing easy translation into and out of any game system\u2014and even letting you bring characters from different games together.\nThe House System is tailored for tension and terror. With each die roll, the players roll the House Die, which might indicate that the house itself takes an action. Players can call upon the essence of the house while they're within it to turn a failure into a success, but every time they do so they accumulate personal Doom. Escaping the house with the weight of such Doom on their shoulders, characters may find themselves scarred, cursed, or haunted in all manner of disturbing ways, carrying remnants of their experience back into their home campaigns long after they've left.\nIt's possible to launch a campaign centered around the Darkest House. But that's not what the house wants. It is strongest when it reaches into an ongoing campaign to test and challenge existing characters. That\u2019s because events in the Darkest House will change characters and alter the campaign setting. The house gets its metaphorical claws into those that cross its threshold, and the house itself changes based on who those characters are, who they have loved, who they have hated, and where they have been. Characters who explore the house and make it back out are never quite the same.\nWant even deeper mysteries? More secrets? More dangers? The Devoured Halls is a separate portion of the Darkest House, with its own rooms, its own secret entrance and exit, and its own mysteries to uncover. Within this section of the house, characters might discover that perhaps the house isn't fully in control of itself\u2026 the house itself might be broken. While The Darkest House is a complete package, The Devoured Halls adds its own flavor and offers its own experience in keeping with the rest of the house. It fits in seamlessly and offers additional depth and an entirely new mini story for characters to investigate. \nThe Devoured Halls backer level includes the complete Darkest House plus the additional content in the Devoured Halls\u2014a Kickstarter exclusive available only through this campaign. Backing at this level has even more exclusive benefits\u2014you also get:\nMonte Cook's secret tour of the Darkest House: In the style of a director's commentary track, Monte takes you on a video tour of the House covering his favorite rooms. He delves into their genesis and inspiration, gives you insights into the lore behind them, and talks about how he's used them in his own games.\nThe Darkest House digital art book: The Darkest House contains dozens and dozens of illustrations, all as mysterious as they are beautiful. The Art of The Darkest House presents all of them\u2014including illustrations from the Devoured Halls\u2014in beautiful detail. Annotations by Monte and Art Director Bear Weiter accompany many of the illustrations, and several also include details or alternate versions calling out their secrets and hidden features.\nMonte Cook has designed many RPGs over his 30+ year career, including Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, the Cypher System, Numenera, and Invisible Sun. He wanted to share why he he was inspired to create The Darkest House, and what design decisions he made. Check out his insights below.\nI'm Monte Cook, and I created and designed the Darkest House. I've been using the essence of it in various campaigns for years, and I thought I'd take a moment to describe why I designed it the way I have, and hopefully why you'll find it intriguing and interesting as well.\nWhy Focus on Online Gaming?\nAt Monte Cook Games, we're spread out all across the continent. We've been regularly playing RPGs on Zoom or Roll20 since well before the pandemic, as of course many gamers have. In the 21st Century, gaming online has become a standard feature of tabletop games, and the last year or so has accelerated that aspect of running and playing games to an incredible degree. Gaming online has its own challenges, but it has its own strengths as well. As a designer, I've been pondering how to not just focus on the needs of online play, but to in fact embrace online play, bringing the aspects of gaming that it does particularly well to the fore. The ability to share art, to share text, and to send individual players direct messages are just some of the things that The Darkest House not just enables but shines a spotlight upon. Meanwhile, the difficulties of online gaming, such as managing lots of information, maintaining a mood, and dealing with cumbersome mechanics are all facets of the experience that the Darkest House eases.\nWhy Focus on Cross-System Play?\nOne of the things that's been true of a lot of us over the last year is a desire to reconnect with old pals or faraway friends. If your primary means of socializing is a video conference, people a thousand miles away are no farther away than those up the street. Still, talking to your friends through a computer screen can sometimes be hard. With all the additional barriers that online gaming can create, why should game systems add another?\nThe Darkest House offers an easy way to quickly convert the essence of any character from any system into a simple but interesting character who operates within the house's own, specific rules, tailored to the experiences within. My dream is that people will use The Darkest House as an excuse to rekindle that lapsed campaign with their old gaming group separated by time and distance, regardless of what system was being used. Or, perhaps even more exciting, the GM who's got a selection of friends who never regularly game together and use different systems can take their existing characters, temporarily convert them to the House System, and all go on an exciting and challenging (or horrifying) adventure together.\nI believe that RPGs bring people together, and I hope that The Darkest House brings people together who might not otherwise get to easily enjoy each other's company. (And what better way to rekindle old bonds than in absolute terror?) \nWhy a Haunted House?\nInspired by games like Kitty Horrowshow's Anatomy, books like Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and films like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, I realized that the horror genre and haunted houses in particular offer unique opportunities to shine a light on characters, and RPGs are all about characters. I wanted to create an adventure that would deepen the characters even as it put them through their paces.\nWhen PCs enter the Darkest House, they'll find far more than just a haunted house. It is a crucible of sorts, where their mettle and their minds will be tested. Those who fall short will suffer heavy consequences. Those who can hold their own, however, emerge more deeply developed with a greater insight into their world, their companions, and most of all themselves. The Darkest House forces players to think about their characters' deepest fears, dreams, their families, and their faith in their friends. Encounters are designed to focus less on damage dealt or resources used and more on the personalities, past experiences, and fundamental truths of a character. And if a character is lacking any of those, the Darkest House will enable the GM and players to work together to create them, or flesh them out, as needed.\nIf you've read this far, you've very likely picked up on the fact that within the Darkest House, it's the house itself that is the enemy. I have long had a fascination with fictional places with a mind or an essence all their own. And when that essence evolves over a long period of loneliness, neglect, and exposure to darkness and suffering, it makes for a truly unique \"villain\" far different than any ghost, specter, or demon could ever hope to be. And if that location, that house, grows and seeps in both space and time, devouring the very locations and loved ones important to those that cross its doorstep, well... I don't want to get into spoiler territory. Let's just say, if nothing else, The Darkest House certainly offers some unique experiences that will create stories your players will be talking about for years to come.\nIf you choose any physical add-on items, please check our Kickstarter Redemption page for information on reward redemption and shipping costs.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the nineteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

Well, provided you can survive the dangers lurking just beyond the edge of the known!\nBoth in ENGLISH and ITALIAN, plus a bunch of FREE CONTENT!!\nProduced by Lightfish Games during years of design and playtest, FARSIGHT is finally ready to project players into the future!\nIts game system, evolved from the 5th edition of the most popular rpg of all time, is simple and easy to learn, but capable of giving you all the depth and details that science fiction demands.\nWith an extremely flexible character-building system, players will be able to create the heroes they want and forge their own destiny, while game masters will have at their disposal fine-tuned tools for creating endless worlds for their adventures and campaigns.\nThe game places an emphasis on the far future and the ultimate frontier of sci-fi that is space exploration, but it's designed to allow you to shape the setting to suit your style and preferences: from the most epic space-opera to the darker cyberpunk or post-apocalypse!\nIf you have always wanted to explore the future in its endless possibilities, FARSIGHT RPG is the game you've been waiting for!\nFARSIGHT RPG will be available in two languages (English or Italian), thanks to the joined efforts of professional writers and translators.\nAt the end of the campaign you will be sent a survey to provide your address and select your preferred language.\nWe are open to collaborations to localize the game in other languages, contact us!\nAll pictures are for illustraton purpose. Final products may vary due to product enhancement.\nOther Add-ons will be added if we hit their stretch golas\nIf you\u2019ve already selected a reward tier but are still interested in adding some extra items without changing your pledge level, follow the instructions below.\nClick the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\nEdit your pledge amount adding the extra cost of the add-on(s) you want.\nConfirm and save your pledge, without changing  the tier of your original pledge.\nAfter the end of the campaign you will receive a survey to your Kickstarter e-mail, to confirm your address and to introduce you to the pledge manager. The pledge manager will enable you to choose your add-ons, to add in some more if you want, and of course to change your selection later.\nPlease note: If you select some physical add-ons starting from a PDF only pledge, you'll be charged for shipping fees. Add-ons may also increase the weight of your pledge and as a result the shipping costs (see the SHIPPING section below for more details).\nStretch Goals will expand the book contents, provide adventures and additional exlusive materials, and more! But we need your support to make this happen! Help us unlocking as many stretch goals as possible! Share the project with your friends and on social media to help us grow Farsight RPG!\nFARSIGHT RPG is based on the 5E EVOLVED game system, a carefully designed adaptation of the 5th edition rules of the world's most popular RPG to science fiction. But don\u2019t get it wrong, it is not a simple hack!\nWhile retaining the essential style of 5E, the 5E EVOLVED implements new basic mechanics, major changes and several features designed to best fit a more sci-fi oriented game style, going as far as to change the canonical ability scores and even to abandon the iconic d20 by changing the basic ability check mechanic (WHAT? Well, yes).\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there! Here's some key features:\n\n Double twelve craziness: Instead of using a single dice (d20) to perform most checks, you will use two twelve-sided dice (2d12). Such a roll creates variety in the outcomes, with a wide range of exploits and setbacks instead of simple critical successes or failures. But don\u2019t think that\u2019s all: advantage/disadvantage, EDGE Cards and other new mechanics will bring bustle and fun on your table!\n\n Fully customizable characters: Character creation and progression is handled in a modular and versatile way, allowing players to fully customize their characters\nSeveral playable species and lots of different backgrounds.\nThree fully customizable classes: the tough DELTA, the reliable SIGMA and the enigmatic PSI.\n Characters who grow with the story: Gain fame and wealth, weave important connections, or instead mess with the wrong people and fall into misfortune! Interludes in between adventures will allow characters to use their \u201cdown-time\u201d to pursue their personal goals, to build relationships, work, trade, do research or simply to recover.\n\n Tactical and deadly combat: Combat is frenetic and merciless. Surely you are heroes, but weapons are deadly and enemies are fighting for their lives as much as you are. Strategy is key: cover, distance, position, weaponry. All of this and countless other tactical choices can make the difference between victory and defeat.\nTactic and strategy are the key to survive. Well you will also need gear, weapons... and luck!\n Gear, vehicles & starships: Can a sci-fi game don\u2019t take into account technology in all its applications? Of course not! You'll have advanced and customizable weapons, armors and tech gear of all kind, and specific rules to create and customize any kind of means of transport, from the smallest planetary vehicle to the most huge starship!\nAn old and rusty spaceship is better than no spaceship at all... Well, maybe.\nAnd if you are wondering, yes, all the 5E EVOLVED core system is released under OGL! So, if you want to learn more about it, come visit us on our WEBSITE!\nFarsight RPG is designed to adapt to any sci-fi setting you want, but its main focus is the ultimate frontier of science fiction: space exploration. \nTo give you a glimpse of these frontiers, the Corebook will include an introduction to Chronicles of the Edge, a space opera setting that we hope to expand with your help, through a series of modules and adventures unlockable as stretch goals! Here\u2019s a brief presentation of what awaits you on the verge of the Known Space!\nCenturies ago, the Collapse forced the Union to retreat to the Central Systems, forsaking large portions of the Orion Arm.  After an era of oblivion, the now called Outskirts are finally slowly re-flourishing under the influence of new interstellar nations.\nThe 79 Suns Confederation claims the title of heir to the ancient Union while the Nargor Empire expands its domain by ensuring protection and civilization under an iron fist. Meantime, the traders of the Arkead Cross roam the old stellar routes seeking for deals and the envoys of the misterious Concordate bring reason and aid wherever they can.\nWhile the Known Space is shaken by tensions and turmoils, remote planets and unreached frontiers await to be explored. Artifacts emerge from ancient times, forgotten mysteries awaits to be revealed and unknown threats lurk just beyond the Edge, where every knowledge fades into the depths of uncharted space.\nOnly pledge levels with physical rewards require shipping. Shipping fees cover adequate packaging, fulfillment center costs, and postage. We'll ship anywhere in the world and, if this campaign is successful, shipping costs will be collected after the Kickstarter campaign. We work hard to keep these costs as low as possible.\nESTIMATED SHIPPING COSTS:\n Italy.   ~4\u00a3  (~5\u20ac) (tracked)\n Europe.   ~9\u00a3  (~10\u20ac)\n US & Rest of the Wolrd.   ~13\u00a3  (~15\u20ac/18$)\nWe ship all over the world by economy mail (no tracking) but you can upgrade to a faster and tracked solution...\nINTERNATIONAL TRACKED SHIPPING UPGRADE. 9\u00a3 (~10\u20ac/12$)\nYou can add the cost of the international tracked shipping to your pledge, as per add-ons (see above).

But I've formatted a special version of the PDF that should allow anyone who wishes to print off their very own copy to go in their collection. \nPlease take time to check out all the other amazing RPGs on Kickstarter during Zine Quest, they all look amazing!\n\nNow down to business. Here is my story:\nLockdown has been tough on everyone, and people have tried to find different ways to fill their time whilst stuck in their homes. This is what led me to designing and writing Captain's Log.\nI was inspired by the classic opening moments of every episode of Star Trek TNG, and those immortal words..\n\"Captain's Log..\"\nThat always let you know, you were in for an out of this world adventure, and I wanted to simulate the fun and excitement of those missions.\n\nCaptain\u2019s Log is a solo journaling RPG where you find yourself in the command of a ship, its crew embarking on a vast mission through space. \nThe limits to this mission are defined by your imagination, and the stories you bring to life.\nPlaying the Captain's Log is simple and offers hours of creative storytelling fun.\n\nCaptain's log has two modes:\nCampaign\nA 50 entry mission journalling adventure where you will be given the scenario outline of each log entry. Each of these entries will journel a mission, a day and event of note onboard your very own ship.\nFrom there it's up to you to decide where the story goes and what twists and turns await the ship and its crew.\n\nScenario Generation\nThese are one off scenarios that can just be generated by simply using a 6 sided dice, or failing that the random number sheet located at  the end of this RPG.\nThis system will see you generate a unique combination that becomes your scenario.\nThe system will give you:\nA location\nA Plot Event\nA Subplot\nThen as with the campaign the rest is up to you. \nThese can be played in single stand alone missions, or perhaps you want to chain them together and make another campaign to take your crew on.\n \nThis project is for anyone who enjoys creative writing.\nOr perhaps someone with a simple love of SCI-FI, who doesn\u2019t know just how creative they can be.\nThe results of your \u2018Captain\u2019s Log\u2019 can be as public or as private, as long or as short as you decide. Writing each entry should be a way to challenge yourself into being creative. You might expand characters and plots over the full campaign, or might just take it one scenario at a time and see where you take your adventure.\n\nThis RPG can be played however you want, and I encourage you to be creative. \nBut every new scenario dictates an adventure, a fresh scenario for you to bring to life.\nThen with each entry you make the world around you and your characters will grow, becoming ever more vivid as you journal the history of your ship, and it\u2019s colourful crew.\nTo start the campaign:\nYou pick your crew\nYou design your ship\nYou create new alien races\nYou create a nemesis, and give them a back story\nYou decide your ships mission\nPerhaps you'll borrow ideas from mainstream SCI-FI? Or Mix multiple films and shows together to create a new larger expanded universe?\n\nYou'll decide how your adventure unfolds.\nYou are the Captain, and this is the Captain\u2019s Log.\n\n\nMy name is Matt and I live in Leeds, and I own and play more tabletop games than I should admit. You can find me on Instagram  HERE \nI'll be honest I was undecided as to if I would ever complete this RPG, let alone share it with others. From my initial idea for the RPG I've been plagued with self doubt about how this would be received, and visions of having to refund the small amount of people who actually backed it.\nBut this isn't about failure, this is about creating something I'm proud of and sending it out into the world for the purpose of saying I did. Like this RPG it's about being creative to challenge yourself. So now I can turn round and say I created something.

The last vestiges of humanity are spread out across the Coil\u2014a megastructure built over the course of multiple lost civilizations. 2-4 players will build a Coil unique to your play session and then search the remains of what they build. Reliquary is designed to be played either as a one-shot or as a longer campaign as you explore multiple layers of the Coil.\nThis game is inspired by the brutalist environments of the game NaissanceE and the manga BLAME! as well as the weird architecture found in the art of H.R. Giger and Zdislaw Beksinski.\n\nCover details and design subject to change. Art by Juan Ochoa.\n\n\nThe Coil is made up of seemingly endless strata\u2014overlapping layers of ancient buildings, artifacts, and machines. One strata may house an entire culture, while another is an uncanny beast\u2019s personal hunting grounds.\nYou live in the city of Vasq\u2014the only major human settlement known to you\u2014and the Prytanium will always pay for maps, data, and relics from past civilizations. Players create Wanderers to try and deliver them, motivated by duty, honor, or profit.\nIn progress layout mockup: design and text not final.\nIn each play session, players will build their own unique version of the Coil by creating ideas for locations, spaced out on the table to create a map. These locations, situated around the home city of Vasq, create one strata of the Coil. Players will answer additional questions about their strata and about Vasq itself to give it their own flavor.\nEach player also creates a Wanderer and chooses a Perspective\u2014answering unique prompts through which details can be added to the world. Wanderers are our player characters, and discoveries will be interpreted through their eyes.\nPlay consists of moving between locations to explore them, interpreting what these locations hold based on playing card suits and values, and rolling dice to salvage supplies or information. Players will encounter new cultures, signs of past civilizations, artificial landmarks, and hostile entities lurking among the ancient machines.\nArt by Thomas Novosel\nPlayers manage a dice pool representing the resources available to them, choosing how many dice to risk when they set out to a nearby location. Each location contains a chance to acquire supplies as well as powerful Relic Dice that will help keep their society afloat. As players uncover Relics and explore locations, they'll build a timeline of the Eons of humanity, assigning their discoveries to the timeline to uncover the Coil's vast history.\nArt by Thomas Novosel\n\n A surreal, far-future, brutalist world: The Coil\u2019s strata could go on forever and wait to be explored.\n Clean, simple rules: Simple mechanics allow you to bring depth and detail to the world your characters are exploring.\n Emergent storytelling: Players work together to create the Coil and populate its enigmatic places. No GM or preparation needed.\n Millions of years of history: Create and recreate eons of human\u2014and inhuman\u2014civilization.\nIn progress layout mockup: design and text not final. Interior art by Juan Ochoa.\n Digital Backers will receive a PDF file of the game.\n Physical Backers will receive a 8.5x5.5\" saddle-stitched printed zine of the game as well as a PDF copy.\n Thematic Trilogy Backers will receive the physical and digital versions of Reliquary, as well as two other games that are very thematically connected: Palimpsest and Apotheosis. Both deal with the change in civilization over long periods of time, and are great games to play in tandem with Reliquary to create even more in-depth settings.\n Deluxe Backers will receive all of the above, but your physical copy of Reliquary will be signed, with a personal note included. I'll also write out on index cards 10 custom locations for your game.\nStretch Goals:\nUNLOCKED - At $3K I can commission 3-4 more pieces of art for the book from Thomas Novosel to help bring the setting of the Coil to life even more. \n\nShipping\nOrders will ship weekly in batches per received surveys until they're all out the door. I expect delivery to begin in June 2021.\nUS orders of the physical zine will ship USPS Media Mail, at $5.\nInternational orders of the physical zine will ship at $18.\nContributors to Reliquary include:\n Gordie Murphy, writer and designer (Apotheosis, Mainframe, Palimpsest)\n Thomas Novosel, artist (Runaway Hirelings, Greeblin's Journey)\n Juan Ochoa, artist (After the War, Callisto, Hall of Judgement)\n Tyler Crumrine, editor (Beak, Feather, & Bone)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, but I have seasoned Kickstarter veterans advising me.

The campaign funded and reached all of its stretch goals, with the support of over 500 backers,  and has since sold a further 800 copies on DriveThruRPG \nThis campaign is for DM Yourselves \u2013 a companion volume to the original \u2013 which explores a whole range of new techniques to add to your solo play, and introduces ways in which to play published adventures DM-less with one or more friends. \nDM Yourself introduced a new method for solo roleplaying, a way to play all those adventures I had lying around gathering dust. Its goals were:\nTo be able to play the adventure as close to written as possible, with minimum rule changes or preparation.\nTo be able to play with a single player character, but without that character needing to be an invincible superhero.\nTo achieve maximum immersion, so that the experience recreated some of the feel of playing a roleplaying game (rather than just reading-with-dicerolls).\nTo find a way to deal with the inevitable spoilers and hidden information, so that the player could still experience the story.\nTo provide a small set of unobtrusive rules to stop the player from cheating or bending the rules (DMing yourself is hard!).\nDM Yourselves takes these ideas and techniques further, giving new ways to bring your solo roleplaying fully to life, whether this is with D&D 5e or another RPG system, played out in full detail or just in casual story mode, on your own or with a friend (when neither of you wants to DM).\nDM Yourselves will be a 32-page A5 zine with the following content:\nCharacter Creation\nDM Yourself balanced the game for a single PC & Sidekick. DM Yourselves will give rules for having more than one Sidekick and/or PC and how to balance accordingly.\nPC Default Behaviours and Binding Decisions for Wilderness and Urban adventures.\nGold and Equipment for PCs/Sidekicks starting at higher levels.\nMultiplayer Solo/DM-less Play\nDM-less Duet (and general DM-less play). How to play solo together \u2013 for when nobody wants to DM or bother with the prep.\nAutonomous Sidekicks and PCs\nEmulate Sidekicks with depth and their own agenda and flashes of brilliance \u2013 \u201cWatch this!\u201d (alignment, secrets, goals, loyalty, suggestions, tricks, moments of inspiration). This means that sometimes your Sidekick may not do exactly what you want (and other times they may do more than you thought possible) \u2013 just like another player.\nIf you want to use DM Yourselves as a way to practice your DM skills, you can even go one step further and emulate the main PC as well as the Sidekick.\nMore Tips for Solo Play\nStep-by-Step Turn Summary (and Flowchart) \u2013 to be honest, this should probably have been in the first book.\nSeparating your DM and Player Role \u2013 more ways to keep yourself honest when dealing with spoilers and hidden information.\nGetting Started and Overcoming Blocks \u2013 it can be so difficult to actually pull the trigger and start an adventure, and sometimes a difficult encounter can derail you. DM Yourselves will give techniques for getting past these problems.\nEnemy Combat AI \u2013 more tips for handling combat (developments, surprise, tactics etc.) and examples for how to use the AI combat tables from the first book.\nExtended NPC Reaction Tables \u2013 methods for weaving together the information given in the scenario with tables to flesh out the characters and reactions of NPCs you meet.\nHow to Read Other Styles of Adventure \u2013 DM Yourself was based around the scenario format most often used for modern 5e adventures (numbered maps, boxed location descriptions). What do you do if your adventure doesn\u2019t fit that format?\nGroup Checks \u2013 and other rules to watch out for with low player counts.\nMaking Mistakes and Happy Little Accidents \u2013 and playing it your way.\nExperiments with Time and Space\nMontage (and other non-linear timescales) \u2013 experimental tables for breaking away from always being in linear time and instead using some scenes as montage, skipping travel with highlights, slow-motion etc.\nViewpoint/Framing/Scene Tables (and other film techniques) - experimental tables for breaking away from always being in first person and instead doing some scenes using other viewpoints and cinematic techniques.\nGetting Inside the Head of Your Character \u2013 sort of like the Immersion Table, but inside your character\u2019s head.\nZoomed-Out Play (how to drop the details but still get the story) \u2013 sometimes you want the story but without playing out every scene turn-by-turn.

In it, you play an ambitious minor wizard who's come into possession of a grimoire beyond your arts. Can you study and unlock it? What wizardries does it contain? Into what troubles and adventures will your ambitions lead you?\nSince then, I've written several more games set in the same world -- The Barbarian's Bloody Quest, The Last Adventure, The Thief & the Necromancer -- and also additional grimoires for the original game. Each offers new characters to play or new wizardries to unlock and master.\nI'd like to bring these games to a wider audience. In all, I've already written enough material to publish 7 issues of a zine, so that's what I'm going to do!\nGameplay: the Grimoire\nAt the heart of the game is the grimoire: a text of many sections and its own set of rules. Each section represents a wizardous advancement you can achieve, a new spell you can learn or act of wizardry you can undertake, but each also has its own rules for unlocking and studying them. Don't read ahead! You can only read the sections you've unlocked and studied.\nMost wizards' grimoires also include \"safeguards,\" sections you unlock by improper study. These include magical curses, setbacks, and disasters. Trigger a safeguard and the spellbook may rewrite itself, summon a destructive creature from another world, or even send you reeling 10 minutes back into the past. Keep trying to study it without disarming the safeguard, and it'll keep sending you back!\nYour first grimoire is a challenging 1st-level text called \"The Signature of Aibesta of the Two Courts.\" Aibesta of the Two Courts was a powerful wizard of an age some four centuries past. Her grimoire includes the techniques to summon an Impeccable Servant, a powerful familiar and bodyguard, an act of wizardry that Aibesta undertook but never accomplished.\nWork your way through the entire grimoire, and not only will you learn powerful new spells, you'll establish your workroom, the foundation of your future seclusium; you'll learn techniques to better subdue and study future grimoires; and you'll accomplish what Aibesta herself couldn't: the summoning of an Impeccable Servant!\nGameplay: You and Your Volunteers\nTo play The Wizard's Grimoire, you need two volunteers (or three works fine) to play against you. Only you, the wizard player, need to know the rules. You're responsible for knowing your own rules and making your own calls. You're also responsible for telling your volunteers any points of continuity that you want them to know.\nIn this way, the game upends the normal player-GM relationship. Instead of a GM saying, \"hey, I have this game I'd like to run, who's in?\" you say, \"hey, I'm trying to get my wizard through this spellbook, do you have a minute?\"\nEach session that you play is an episode in your wizard's study and adventures. They can be as short or as long as you like, you can play as often or rarely as you like, and you can have different volunteers, or the same ones, every time you play.\nGameplay: System & Dice\nThe Wizard's Grimoire uses a dice pool version of the good old PbtA moves.\nYou have ratings for your moves based on your qualities -- for instance, your rating to exert yourself subtly to take surreptitious action is equal to your Ambitious + your Cunning, while your rating to exert yourself violently against an enemy is equal to your Bold + your Cunning. Roll that many dice, count the 4s, 5s and 6s as hits, and if you roll no hits, it's a miss. Usually, you get to spend your hits on things you want to happen or questions you want to ask, but you know how it is with moves, they each work a little differently.\nSince you both call for your own rolls and interpret their results for yourself, the moves answer to different design concerns than they do in a conventional PbtA game. I think they're pretty interesting, and if you're a PbtA-head like me, I think you will too.\nFuture Issues (Spoilers!)\n The Dictum of Polume the Farer: An easy and useful 1st-level grimoire, including such spells as creating a scampering lantern and summoning a jarful of plasmic hornets. You can study it alongside Aibesta's Signature for very good results.\n The Barbarian's Bloody Quest: Can you find and slay the wizard who butchered and subjugated your family? Includes \"The Book of Doomed Wizards.\" \n The Three Scrolls of Jorvelte Wild-Crowned: A 2nd-level grimoire, including the wizardous techniques to enchant magical items, including a useful and dangerous staff of glimmering menace.\n The Last Adventure: In your youth, you were a warrior and a hero. Now you're dead, but no one brought you the sup of oblivion. Take up the memory of your old sword, the memory of your old helmet, and make your last adventure here in the land of death. Includes \"In the Land of Death\" and \"Answering the Calling Voice.\" \n The Red Tome of Salabrusto the Wise: A 2nd-level grimoire, including an almanac of alien worlds and planes, and wizardous techniques both to travel to them and summon entities from them.\n The Thief & the Necromancer: You're friends, a gifted necromancer and a thief and street performer. You've both escaped bad situations and you've thrown in together to take on the world. Includes \"Goerne, a Ghostly Tutor.\" \nAttention: Patrons\nIf you support lumpley games on Patreon, you'll already get the digital version of The Wizard's Grimoire as a patron reward. Don't sign up for it here!\nIf you'd like a copy in print, though, this is the best way to get one.\nReduced Price Level & Community Copies\nTimes are tight!\nIf you want to support the project but the full price is a stretch, or if you're curious about the game but can't justify paying full price sight unseen, we've been there!

For a free introduction to an earlier iteration of some of the game's core mechanics check out my game Alien Dark. \nPlayers take the role of people who previously made their living in Europe's overlapping  crime and espionage communities. That's how they discovered the Conspiracy behind the skein of what passed for their normal lives. The die was cast; they can never unknow what they have discovered; never go back to what they were before. \nDoing dubious and dangerous things for their country &/or personal gain has left them with few ties to family or friends, making the ones they have left all the more important. That's why they have to make a stand and take the Conspiracy down one corrupt piece at a time, before it catches up with them and anyone who still cares about them. \nYou can see the first of a 3 session series using the current playtest packet of Against the Dark Conspiracy, here.  If the players are happy for them to be released then Session 2 will be available during the campaign and Session 3 just after it finishes - find me on twitter @AlunRees14 for updates. I'm running a one-shot of Against the Dark Conspiracy for Gauntlet Community Open Gaming on 27 February.\nYou can also find a 'design diary' I wrote for The Gauntlet RPG Community blog, here.\n                                  The Zine\nThe Zine will be a 40-page, 8.5\" x 5.5\" PDF graced with greyscale cover art by Kasha Mika.\nIf, together, we successfully reach stretch goals then the page count will increase to match the growth of content and art options.\nThe Zine will offer tables to help the GM and players define the nature of the operations they will embark upon, as well as the powers and weaknesses of their supernatural foes. The GM will choose from those lists to create the kinds of supernatural threat they and their players want to see in their game.  The default antagonists are vampires, but stretch goals will expand the options.\nBackers at the Digital Enhancement ... level, and above, will also receive a code enabling them to get an at cost physical copy of the Zine shipped direct to them via DrivethruRPG.  \n The Game \nIn a setting inspired by Night's Black Agents (by Ken Hite), Against the Dark Conspiracy builds player characters based on what they used to do for an intelligence or criminal organisation along with their particular area of brilliance. This creates characters with a specific skill-set and expertise and ensures everyone gets their time in the spotlight. It explores their motivation for standing up to the Conspiracy and their relationships with other characters and the non-player character they need to protect from their foes. This gives the players plenty of hooks on which to hang their role-play.\nIf they lack a necessary expertise or need fictional positioning for some action, they can flash back to call on a contact for help, developing a network of NPCs they can (usually) rely on, but who may in turn attract the attention of the Conspiracy. Having your network driven underground is a real pain!  \nGameplay is designed around a cycle that sees characters:\n Gather Intel: to get answers to specific questions about their current operation but also increase their broader understanding of the Conspiracy and its activities. \n Spend Intel: to take some narrative control by defining the location, target, likely opposition and even the specific obstacles they'll face in an upcoming operation, or to force the GM to reveal the Powers or Weaknesses of their supernatural foes. \nCycle of Play\nDeciding how to spend Intel gives players some control over how quickly the level of threat increases, from mundane criminal or para-military pawns of the Conspiracy to supernatural foes of increasing potency. They decide if they want to know more about the supernatural or about the immediate obstacles they'll face in their operations. How much do they want to know for certain before they try to put a stake in the very heart of the Conspiracy?\nAll the while, there's a risk that the Conspiracy is finding out as much about the characters as they discover about it.  Clumsy and noisy failures move the Conspiracy from being just suspicious, through alarmed, to the point where they come after the team wherever they are. Alternatively, the Conspiracy may go after their network of contacts or the person they want (and need) to protect.\nDuring play characters will, inevitably, accumulate Stress and when their Stress track fills the player narrates how they leave the game. Heroically? Or will it be to become a pawn? Character generation takes only a few minutes so characters can be replaced on the fly if a player gets careless and fails to seek relief from the horror. Whether it's being drunk on the job, or indulging some other vice, or seeking solace from a friend or mentor in moments between the action, there's always a price to pay, but it can keep you going. Sometimes that price is paid by the character or the person that matters most to them, sometimes by the operation, and sometimes by another player character.\nFor a free introduction to an early iteration of some of the game's core mechanics look at Alien Dark.\nYou can see the first of a 3 session series using the current playtest packet of Against the Dark Conspiracy run for the Gauntlet RPG Community, here.

You play as trained agents of the External Containment Bureau, an organization tasked with the study, identification, and containment of paranormal phenomena. The Bureau authorizes agents to make use of these phenomena to give yourself incredible powers (so long as the proper forms are in order). But take care: using paranormal energies inches you ever closer to joining the ranks of the paranormal yourself. Will you transcend humanity in the line of duty? Play to find out.\nIf you enjoy media like Control, Fringe, The Magnus Archives, Men in Black, SCP Foundation, or X-Files... you'll love External Containment Bureau!\n\nCheck out the current state of the game in this actual play(test) session on our YouTube channel:\n Like what you see here? Eager to try it out for yourself? Click the button below to generate your own copy of a FREE Quickstart Keeper document powered by Google Sheets. Inside, you'll find an overview of gameplay and basic rules, pregenerated character sheets for up to four agent players, and a GM tab that tracks all important agent information and provides a sample mission to introduce you to the paranormal nature of the External Collections Bureau.\nClick the button above to access the Quickstart Keeper!\nThe Game\nThe Bureau\nThe work of the External Containment Bureau (ECB) is founded on three principles:\n Identify: Both in the office and in the field, it's the responsibility of agents to study and identify paranormal phenomena. The Bureau's various departments work together to add to the Bureau's knowledge base.\n Obscure: Paranormal phenomena and the mundane world don't easily mix. For the sake of both the public good and the health of paranormal sentience, it is the prerogative of every agent to obscure the true nature of paranormal phenomena.\n Contain: The Bureau's purpose is to preserve a healthy balance between paranormal phenomena and the mundane world. Agents are expected to find safe havens for the paranormal in their local environments or, failing that, provide adequate accommodations at Bureau HQ.\nWhile creating your agent, one of the major considerations is which department you work in at the Bureau. You'll transfer departments throughout your time with the Bureau, learning new skills and making use of specialized gear in each:\nExternal Containment Bureau Departments: Administration, Field Operations, Human Relations, Records, Research + Development, and Sanitation.\nGameplay\nExternal Containment Bureau makes use of a streamlined version of the Forged in the Dark design framework. Cut to the drama, take action, deal with the consequences, and balance your life between Field and Bureau phases of play.\nTwo of the core mechanics in External Containment Bureau are redaction and resonance. Don't like the consequences of your actions? Redact them from the record and roll the dice to see how much resonance you gain with the paranormal energies around you as a result. Gaining resonance gives you incredible paranormal powers but beware: eventually you might resonate so much with these energies that you transcend humanity. At that point, the work of the Bureau is beyond your consideration.\nTrained agents of the Bureau\nRedacted Material License\nFrom the very beginning, External Containment Bureau has been designed with easy hacking in mind. If you want to create your own games that make use of ECB's streamlined mechanics, paranormal themes, or bureaucratic processes, the game includes a free license to help you out. We're still working out the details, but all games inspired by ECB will be known as REDACTED MATERIAL.\nRedacted Material License Logo\nThe Campaign\n We're keeping our backer levels nice and simple for this campaign:\n Intern ($1+): Back at this level and receive our thanks for helping the External Containment Bureau succeed in its mission!\n Digital Agent ($10): Back at this level to receive a digital PDF copy of External Containment Bureau. This PDF is print-ready so you can print your own copy at a local print shop.\n Print Agent ($20): Back at this level for a print-ready digital PDF and a printed zine of External Containment Bureau. \n Manager ($50): Receive a print-ready digital PDF and five copies of the printed zine. You'll have enough for an entire team of agents!\n Director ($100): Receive a print-ready PDF and a printed zine of External Containment Bureau.

We'll commission Julianne Griepp (www.juliannegriepp.com) to create a gorgeous piece of art to replace the standard cover seen at the top of this page.\nUNLOCKED! Every $1000 More: New Art! After our first stretch goal, every additional $1000 in funding will give us the budget to commission a black and white illustration to appear on the game's pages. If we raise $10,000, we'll have paid for a full slate of art from Julianne. Everything beyond that will continue to raise the shares of each core collaborator.\nJulianne's work as seen on the cover of Alice is Missing, an RPG by Spenser Starke.\nFulfillment\nJust like with last year's Zine Quest game, The Mythic Gazetteer is handling fulfillment of physical copies of the zine in-house. Digital copies will be fulfilled via DriveThruRPG or Itch.io, whichever you prefer as a backer. \nDriveThruRPG is phasing out their saddle-stitched Print on Demand option so at the moment, this Kickstarter is the only way to get a print copy of the game.

It\u2019s both an open-ended adventure and plug-and-play setting; envisioned as a cyberpunk Xmas mashup of Die Hard and Alien Resurrection. In the adventure, your team of grizzled PCs will be torn between saving friends locked in the Medtech facility or crawling to freedom in the vents of the corporate-controlled Hardlight Station; all while avoiding capture by the brutal Blackshield Mercenary Company. Unbeknownst to all, however, Blackshield\u2019s invasion has caused the containment protocols at the Healthtek facility to malfunction. Now, in the bowels of the station, something horrible has awoken, and, after a long, torturous sleep, they hunger to feed.\nWritten by D. Kenny with layout by Eric K. Hill & art by Vil, we've designed Hardlight Station for flexible play. It works as a one-shot, mini-series, or as a part of your ongoing Mothership (or any other Sci-Fi RPG) campaign. It\u2019s filled with unique locations, scheming NPCs, and terrifying horrors on the hunt. A night on Hardlight Station is one you won\u2019t soon forget.\n\nDying Hard on Hardlight Station takes inspiration from two of the greatest sci-fi horror and action franchises of all time and jams them into a compact, highly gameable surface for your enjoyment. Every page of the station is packed with efficient, evocative details big on imagination and light on overlong prose to make the book as table-ready as possible.\n\nTons of sci-fi mayhem and haunting horrors await in the pages of Dying Hard on Hardlight Station, including:\n Three or more fully mapped station locations - Loaded with loot tables, adventure hooks, custom encounters, and interesting NPCs.\n   Three Original Factions - The Blackshield Mercenary Company, Station Administration Nakatomi Solutions Inc, and the ravening Alien Hybrids. Each vying to come out on top in the battle for the station.\n   The Hardlight Station Directory - a guidebook filled with shops, entertainments, NPCs and jobs for your crew... should anyone survive the initial adventure.\n   Custom art and professional design - Bringing it all to life in glorious red, black, and white.\n  Plus a whole lot more!\nWe've worked hard to make this the most gameable, tightly written, evocatively illustrated, and designed module it can be, and we are very excited to get it into your hands and onto tables around the globe.\nDying Hard on Hardlight Station is designed to be played using the rules for Mothership, the ENnie award-winning (Best Game, Gen Con 2019) sci-fi horror roleplaying game. Both the Mothership system and this module pride themselves on offering easy-to-run rules while keeping the stakes high. You can find the full rules for Mothership in the Player's Survival Guide which is Pay What You Want on DriveThruRPG. That said, if you already have a game-system of choice, this module is built to easily adapt to any TTRPG system you may prefer.\n\nDying Hard on Hardlight Station is written and produced by a top-notch team:\nWritten by D. Kenny (Nirvana on Fire).\nLayout and Design by Eric K. Hill (Nirvana on Fire, The Third Sector, and Dinoplex: Cataclysm). \nArt by Vil (Dissident Whispers, Horrible Wounds, and A Fistful of Creeps).\nEditing by Jarrett Crader of the Moonrat Conspiracy (Mothership Player's Survival Guide, The Ultraviolet Grasslands, Troika!, and many more).  \n\n\nDying Hard on Hardlight Station is on its second draft and is currently being polished through supplemental playtesting. We've completed initial layouts and commissioned our first round of illustration.  We're on track to fulfill before our August estimate which has a built-in cushion for any complications that may arise. With that in mind, here is our timeline:\nFebruary 2021 - Dying Hard on Hardlight Station Kickstarter.\nMarch 2021 - Writing, playtesting, editing complete.\nApril 2021 - All art submitted, layout and text finalized.

London\u2019s deeper secrets will only emerge over multiple playthroughs!\nThe gameplay of Mask of the Rose extends beyond dialogue. You'll open new locations on the map, gather outfits and disguises, work odd jobs and collect resources. Together, this will determine what you can attempt in social situations \u2013 and how much you can get away with!\nMask of the Rose will be coming to console platforms as well as PC, Mac and Linux. We\u2019re offering Steam or GOG keys as backer rewards. Mask of the Rose will also be available on Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox One and Series X/S. \nMask of the Rose is set in Fallen London: a darkly hilarious gothic underworld where death is a temporary inconvenience, the rats talk, and Hell is only a train journey away. \nWe\u2019ve been exploring the Fallen London universe over eleven years and five different games (including Fallen London, Sunless Sea, and Sunless Skies). If you\u2019re a newcomer, Mask of the Rose is the perfect jumping-on point. If you\u2019re already a fan, it offers new discoveries and a chance to explore more personal stories, including encounters with favourite characters.\nMask of the Rose begins in 1862, just months after London was stolen by bats and relocated to the Neath: a vast cavern far below the earth. Down here, the sun doesn't shine, and Parliament has sunk into the Thames. Queen Victoria never emerges from her palace. Cats spy on their owners and whisper their secrets abroad. And it's rapidly becoming clear that London isn't going to be returning to the Surface any time soon\u2026\n\nWhen you create your character in Mask of the Rose, you\u2019ll choose what your life was like before you were caught in London\u2019s fall. Were your family landed gentry? Or did they own a tailor\u2019s shop, or work on the docks? Your choice will determine how you dress, what you know, and where you fit in.\nWhatever your origins, the Fall cut you off from your family and resources. Now, you are beginning a new job for none other than Mr Pages, one of London\u2019s mysterious new Masters...\n\nThe old laws are suddenly in disarray, and London's citizens must make new lives for themselves.\nFor your fellow lodger Griz, the Fall is a liberation \u2013 the chance to be taken seriously in a position that would have been denied her when she was 'Miss Griselda'.\nFor your other housemate Archie, the change is terrifying. What is a medical student supposed to believe in when even the laws of death no longer apply?\nAnd when Archie is arrested for murder (even though the victim has since returned to life, and is feeling much better now thanks) you may begin to moonlight in detective work. Can you crack the mystery of London's first homicide since the Fall?\nLondon is rather the worse for wear after being dragged below ground. Not everything survived, nothing is the same, and no one can quite explain what has happened.\nIn Mask of the Rose you'll be able to visit a number of different locations in the city, including:\n\nBefore London fell, Horatia\u2019s was your temporary home. Now it\u2019s the only place in the city that feels familiar \u2013 until, that is, one of your own is arrested, and Horatia starts taking in new lodgers \u2013 not all of them human.\n\nAfter surviving the Fall relatively intact, Tentergrounds has become a home to many. Among them is David \u2013 Fallen London\u2019s first murder victim \u2013 as he tries to understand his own death and return.\n\nCrucial secrets are hidden in your own fragmented memories of London's Fall. But are you brave enough to relive them?\n\nA new literary salon is gathering all the brightest stars in London. The host has amber eyes, a scalding handshake, and a previous address in Hell itself, but he\u2019s an excellent listener.\n\nOnce a 40-gun frigate, the HMS Ungulate has been converted into a temporary prison. Unless you can prove his innocence, Archie may be spending a very long time there.\nMask of the Rose is a story about love, in many forms. The choice is yours: will you be a brilliant matchmaker, connecting friends and rivals while remaining unattached yourself? Or are you looking for lasting love? Or shorter assignations? Or perhaps you're open to whatever comes your way?\nEvery major storyline will be accessible regardless of whether your approach is romantic or platonic \u2013 even if the final endings may vary.\nHere are a few of the characters you'll meet:\n\nRachel was halfway through her latest novel when normal, workaday London ceased to exist \u2013 and her literary inspiration along with it. But meeting Milton has rekindled her passion for writing. He might be her suitor; he might be her Muse; he might be an actual devil, if you believe in that kind of thing. Her brother David hates him, but Rachel isn\u2019t about to let that stand in her way.\n\nHarjit hasn't lived in London long. But when catastrophe struck, he knew someone would need to organise volunteers, dig out basements, and round up the lost. Besides, he had a missing person of his own to find. For lack of other options, he stepped into a constable's uniform \u2013 and into a job that grows daily more unpredictable.\nNow he\u2019s had to arrest Archie for murder. The evidence says Archie did it. Harjit\u2019s intuition points the other way \u2013 but lately, trusting his intuition has led only to heartbreak.\n\nFor a decade, Horatia has taken in lodgers and turned them into family. But since the Fall, supplies are scarce, and her boarders can't afford their rent. So when a man made entirely of clay knocks at the door, offering to pay handsomely for lodgings, she can hardly refuse.\n\nMr Pages runs the Ministry of Accounting and Recounting, which has embarked on the titanic endeavour of conducting Fallen London\u2019s first census! A lover of the written word, Pages has never struck such a rich vein as London.\nIt does have a lot of questions for you, however. How do people declare their affectioniments, in this fair city? How lasting are their attachments? Might a Londoner take an interest in a very tall, broad-shouldered, cloaked personage that leans towards the chiropterous, hypothetistically speaking?\nExpress Yourself through Fashion. In Mask of the Rose you are what you wear. Manage an expanding wardrobe that offers a host of options. Sometimes the right disguise or outfit will get you into a social occasion. Other times, the effect will be more subtle: giving you the confidence to take a reckless action, or provoking the reaction you need from another character.\nExplore widely. Experience the city through three seasons \u2013 the season of confessions, the season of Yule, and the season of the Feast of the Rose. Each day you\u2019ll read the news, learn of any recent events and opportunities, and then turn to the map to choose your next action. Will you find Rachel and interrogate her about the night of the murder? Comfort Archie in prison? Work at one of several jobs to earn money, or use your resources to unlock a new part of the city?\nCollect the stories of Londoners \u2013 and especially their affairs of the heart. You begin as a census-taker with a notebook full of questions. The more you learn, the more it fills up \u2013 and unlocks new lines of inquiry. For some reason, Mr Pages is especially keen for its census-takers to document the \u201cassignations and besotments\u201d of London\u2019s citizens. Why is it that London\u2019s new Masters are so preoccupied with stories of romance\u2026?\nOur digital rewards range from corvid companions to choosing a Fallen London character to feature in Mask of the Rose!

The items can also be accessed via Dropbox if you prefer not to create a Gametee account.\n15 goals unlocked a chance to interview one of the characters from Mask of the Rose! We ran a poll and Milton, he of the amber eyes and scalding handshake, won!\nThank you for the many (184!) questions you submitted for Milton. They have all been received, compiled and submitted for consideration. He answered Mr Pages' approved selection in this update.\n19 goals unlocked a future encounter in Fallen London with Horatia. Your landlady in Mask of the Rose has a heart of gold and a soft spot for the Neath\u2019s more unusual inhabitants \u2013 but how is she doing decades later, in the Fallen London browser game? We will make her current residence open to visitors, creating an opportunity to meet her! This will happen sometime after the campaign, but ahead of the release of Mask of the Rose. In the meantime, Horatia has something for you \u2013 may it keep you company until you meet in Fallen London.\nAll five stretch goals have been unlocked!\nMask of the Rose comes with three initial options to define your protagonist\u2019s background, allowing you to have grown up as a dockside urchin, as a worker in your family\u2019s tailor shop, or among the stifling  pomp and luxury of the aristocracy. Your choice will grant advantages with particular factions in the story, and equip you with some unique clothing options.\nThis is a fourth origin to select when creating your character: the Housebreaker\u2019s Heir, who has a pickpocket\u2019s deftness, several criminal acquaintances, and a fraught relationship to anyone wearing a badge. Each origin grants advantages with certain factions and some unique clothing items!\n Early in Mask of the Rose, your landlady Horatia takes in new lodgers \u2013 some human, some decidedly not. We\u2019ll add one of these lodgers as a new character to Mask of the Rose: a Clay Man, fresh from the living city of Polythreme.\nHe\u2019ll be one of the game\u2019s secondary characters \u2013 not as elaborately woven into the central narrative as the main cast, but an interactive character with his own story to explore. What emotions stir beneath his stony exterior? You\u2019ll be able to get to know him better, and perhaps even learn the secret that brought him to Horatia\u2019s door... \nA fifth potential origin for your protagonist: the Undertaker\u2019s Child! Thanks to your family business, you are acquainted with numberless vicars, solicitors, grave-diggers and hearse-makers. You also know perfectly well how Death is supposed to behave \u2013 even if Fallen London persistently defies your expectations.\nThe deviless Virginia will make an appearance in Mask of the Rose. In the years to come, she will go on to be many things in Fallen London \u2013 including its Lord Mayor \u2013 but she was around long before the city arrived in the Neath. Her story will give us an opportunity to show what she was up to in a newly-arrived, vulnerable London\u2026 \n A sixth protagonist origin will be added to the game: the Scholar of the Occult! The scholar is a historian of esoteric practices ranging from witchcraft to alchemy, and this background gives you an in with academics and the more disreputable sort of artist, and a gift for noticing disturbing things out of the corner of your eye\u2026\nWARNING: while the Neath could broadly be described as very occult indeed, its particular brand of the strange has little to do with alchemy, witchcraft, angelology, or other surface occultisms. A Scholar of the Occult is as likely to be bewildered by London\u2019s new home as anyone else, but perhaps they will be a little more accepting of the eerie and the uncanny.\nOur answer to this might be a little unusual. We're doing okay right now, and can fully fund development of Mask of the Rose (though any pledges we receive will reduce the risk and put us in a better position for the future).\nInstead, we're doing this to find out whether this is a game you want us to make.  We're excited about Mask of the Rose; we hope you are, too. The funding goal is not how much it will cost to make; it's the amount that would convince us Mask of the Rose will appeal to a large enough audience, so that we can safely commit to making it.\nWe won't be making Mask of the Rose available in Early Access, so we're also hoping to learn how you feel about different parts of the game, to help guide development. If you have thoughts to share on any part of the game, please let us know in the comments!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMask of the Rose is in some ways more complex than many visual novels. But it will be smaller and more focused than most of our past games, which can be enormous and \u2013 we confess \u2013 somewhat baroque.\n\nWe're familiar with the technologies we're using to make it, and have already built a vertical slice \u2013 a short, fully playable section of the game. We\u2019ve also had a fair amount of experience fulfilling Kickstarters: we\u2019ve run three successful ones, and delivered on all of them.\n\nFor these reasons, we're confident in our ability to complete Mask of the Rose. We think the biggest risk is instead that it might take longer than estimated. In particular, we have a tendency to delay our games if part of the design isn't working out as well as we'd hoped \u2013 it's more important to us to make good games than to release them quickly. Also, it's very important to us that our team doesn't have to crunch. That means that if some things take longer than we expect, we might have to push back the release (although we\u2019ve included contingency in the schedule to cover a certain amount of this).\n\nIf everything goes to schedule, we expect to be ready to release Mask of the Rose towards the end of 2021, but to account for these risks, the date we\u2019re committing to is June 2022.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nThe scented candles are made with soy wax, a more sustainable alternative to paraffin.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe majority of our rewards are delivered digitally.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "The Citizen", "descp": "Welcome to the Neath!

You\u2019ll play as cyborgs, mech pilots, magic wielders, and rabble rousers pitted against varied factions who are all vying for control over the Garden: demon lords, criminal enterprises, cultists, and a corporate-sponsored fascist state.\nThe Cover\nSetting\nRavenous supernatural beasts roam the streets at night and cruel imperial soldiers march in the light of the day. Infrastructure and utilities are controlled by wealthy corporations based in the Tower, and the promise of admittance is used to exploit the masses who live in the Garden.\nNo one remembers how the world ended, but it did. Generations ago. The Tower was built before then. Back then it served as a testament to humanity\u2019s innovative engineering capabilities. When all of the cities were destroyed, it remained standing, and was a beacon of hope, offering its strength and shelter to travelers from near and far. But then the doors slammed shut and the refugee camps surrounding it grew and grew. They grew so large that they merged together into a sprawling city now known as The Garden.\nLast year, the self-coronated Emperor of the Iron Tower took a portion of their advanced military machine and went on a pointless crusade against a distant demon lord. Corporations have exerted their control and use the remaining military forces to quell uprisings and protect the exposed people of the Garden from demon attacks, while ignoring the basic human needs of the populace. The scene is set for guardians defenders to rise and protect the populace, or at the very least get what\u2019s coming to them.\nThe Enhanced Character Class\nThe Rules\nThe Tower & The Garden is based on a highly modified, somewhat simplified Forged in the Dark SRD.

Together with your fellow players and GM, you create the city of Nagara and its unique locations using a tarot deck. Each session your characters inch ever closer to a Doom they\u2019re working tirelessly to prevent, but must inevitably face as the chronicle ends.\nThe game has the dark horror feeling of a dungeon crawl, while focusing on mechanics that drive in-game drama and push personal stories. You\u2019ll get embroiled in the various wars raging between guilds in the city and try to secure a bit of personal peace, before all your efforts crumble around you. You\u2019ll strive to survive in a city that is literally trying to eat you, and siphon off its power to keep the ones you love safe.\nCity of Flesh takes inspiration from grimdark fantasy combining it with a feminine aesthetic to create an immersive gore-splattered roleplay experience where you delve into the dreams of a sleeping colossus and tear through fleshy reality to make your own fate.\nWhat You\u2019ll Get\n\nCity of Flesh is an A5 sized, 50+ page, soft cover zine.

The world is young, the Age of Titans draws to a close, but the city is ancient. Built in the womb of the slain Colossus, Nagara is both rich and powerful\u2014and already past its prime. A Doom approaches Nagara, as the world rebirths itself into a new, more rational form in which there\u2019s place for neither Titans, nor cities built atop their rotting remains. To facilitate this transition, the city\u2019s dreams birthed the Midwives\u2014people imbued with some of the city\u2019s primordial energy who must guide it to whatever comes next.\nThe Colossus is dead by any measure of human life, and yet she isn\u2019t\u2014 she still undulates with primordial creation, heaving and oozing to form a protective shell around Nagara. The magic of the Sovereigns keeps her dormant, as does the life-leeching magic of lesser citizens and their efforts to keep flesh at bay with fire and blade. Entire city blocks still live under overhangs of flesh as a result of the Years of Suffering, with some citizens carving houses into the red tissue.\nThe need to drive back the Colossus\u2019 flesh becomes more dire as Nagara expands. Sovereign Nemaida offers rewards to explorers who venture in the necrotic parts of the city to slay monsters and burn away the flesh. The Midwives often find themselves called to the danger the endeavor promises, for there is plenty that can go wrong.\nHow It's Played\nNagara is dying and will be reborn. At the start of the game you map the city by performing a three-card reading for each location in the city. You\u2019ll map seven locations and then place a single card on the Blooded Sanctum, the Doom\u2014the end of your story. Each location represents one session (roughly four hours) of your game, therefore you\u2019ll play seven sessions before the eighth final session where you encounter the city\u2019s Doom.\nAt the start of every session players pick a location focus\u2014this is the location the game session is crafted around. The GM crafts the plot of the session based around the conflict and threat of the location.\nDuring the game players perform more readings, drawing a tarot card from the deck, to modify the scenes based on how characters act. Readings help facilitate the drama in your character\u2019s life. Depending on how your Reading turns out, you and/or the GM ascribe meaning to the card drawn.\nExample of Play\nThe Midwives are caught in a waking nightmare of terror and blood where an unhinged Relic stalks and murders people in their sleep. Steffie\u2019s character Torga realizes maybe the Relic can be reasoned with, she asks the Relic if they can help it in some way. Liz, the GM, asks Steffie to make a Pacify reading, because Torga is trying to connect with the Relic.\nSteffie draws the Five of Swords. \nThe Relic explains that it's enraged, not because it can\u2019t fulfill its destiny, but more because it loved Hydrassa deeply and hates seeing her body so defiled.  Torga reveals she knows the sting of unrequited love too and swears to help. Seeing another being who knows its pain, the Relic asks Torga to take action by returning Hydrassa\u2019s body to her burial tomb. \nNice to meet you!\nSteffie de Vaan is a Dutch author and developer of role playing games and short stories.

Our hopes is that this won't affect the project, but if it does we'll keep everyone informed with the most up-to-date information we have.

Serenity. The Millennium Falcon. \nYou can\u2019t have a good space story without an iconic spaceship. Of course, more often than not, the heroes of the story aren\u2019t flying some shiny new cruiser. Those are for the wealthy, the elites\u2014not our lovable scoundrels. No, they fly the bucket of bolts\u2014the outworn, patched-up junker held together with hope, prayers and duct tape.\nThe eponymous 'bucket of bolts'\nThese ships weren\u2019t always hunks of junk though\u2014they have long and storied histories, and might even have been respectable vessels at some point. We only ever see a slice of that story though, a single captain and their motley crew. \nThis game flips the perspective.  \n\nThe Game.\nBucket of Bolts is a hack of Artefact, my game from last year's ZineQuest. Instead of creating a magical item, this time you'll be telling the story of a single spaceship. You\u2019ll create a brand new freighter, fresh off the manufacturing line, and explore its history through each of the people who captain it. Your ship will change as the decades pass - new names, new parts, fresh paint, fresh starts - until your story draws to a close.\nYou\u2019ll choose your Captains, bringing them to life with names and details, and create stories of their time with your ship using prompts and tables. When you\u2018re ready to move on, you\u2019ll choose a Fate for your ship. Maybe it\u2019s traded away fairly, but more likely it\u2019s stolen, captured or even wrecked. You might drift for a while as you wait for your next Captain, or the seat might still be warm when a new one takes over. Either way, the galaxy will change around you, and you\u2019ll see it all from the view in the cockpit.\nLike the original Artefact, it\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or two; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique ships for tabletop games like Edge of the Empire, Traveller or Scum & Villainy, with rich backstories, fun details and tonnes of personality.\n\nThe Zine.\nFormat \nA little paper prototype of the zine opening.\nI'll be using a new format for the physical rewards. Beak zines take an A3 sheet of paper and fold it into an 8-page A6 booklet. This process leaves one side of the paper blank, that people sometimes use to make a poster.\nOne of the things that's always bugged me about Artefact is how much flicking around the book you need to do as you play the game. I thought\u2014why not use the blank side of a beak zine for all of the game's content; the tables, questions and prompts you\u2019ll need during play. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nIn Bucket of Bolts, you\u2019ll be able to read through all the rules in the booklet and then unfold it into a complete reference for play. Pretty neat huh?\nAnd here it is closing!\nPaper\nExtract comes in a range of lovely colours.\nOf course, I'm still taking every opportunity to make this little zine a deluxe product. I'll be using one of my favourite paper stocks, G.F Smith Extract.\nAs well as having some seriously impressive environmental credentials (it's made from recycled coffee cups), it's also just a lovely paper that comes in some great colours. I\u2019m partial to Mustard, as you can see in the prototype, but we\u2019ll see when the print samples arrive.\n\nInk\nCopies of ARTEFACT, outside on a sunny day.\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using Risograph to print the book. That means rich, vivid shades with the aesthetic of screen printing, but viable for large-scale print runs. It\u2019s also one of the most sustainable ways to print, with soy-based inks & low energy machines. It\u2019s going to be beautiful!\n\nIllustration\nTorben is very excellent at drawing spaceships.\nSpeaking of beautiful, I'm also commissioning Torben B\u00f6kemeyer again to do some awesome illustrations for the game. Spaceships are his bread & butter, and I think his sharp, detailed style is a really good fit for this game. You\u2019ll have seen his key art at the top of the page, and he's already hard at work on the game's cover.\n\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nI'm looking forward to an excuse to get wild with paper & ink combos...\nI\u2019m also offering a Collector\u2019s Edition of the game, exclusive to the Kickstarter, packed with bonus printed matter like art prints, stickers and random tables.\nIt\u2019s all paper stuff, but I think it\u2019s gonna feel pretty special.\nAny \u2019game content\u2019 (such as random tables) will be available to all as a digital download.\n\nAccessibility\nLike Artefact and Orbital, the digital edition will also be fully-compatible with screen readers. A second version will also be provided to support a range of visual processing needs. Once again, Yubi will be handling the accessibility design of the digital files.\n\nCommunity Copies\nEvery backer of Bucket of Bolts, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks!\n\nStretch Goals\nThis is intentionally designed as a small project, but I've still got some cool things to announce if we break past our funding goal :)\n\nDelivery.\nTimelines\nI\u2019ve got a draft of the game written, and I\u2019m happy that the core concept works as well for spaceships as it did for magical items (after making a few changes to the design). I\u2019m hoping to get a playtest version out in a month or two, with the full digital version being delivered in late spring/early summer and the physical edition following soon after.\n\nBackerKit\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. This time, though, I\u2019m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn\u2019t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you\u2019ve selected add-ons.\n\nOrbital \nOrbital header art\nMy previous project, Orbital, is going to print imminently which means that the bulk of the work for that Kickstarter is done. I\u2019m not shipping out the rewards myself, and the stretch goal content is coming along nicely. I\u2019ll continue to actively manage the project, but barring any catastrophes it shouldn\u2019t take up much headspace.\n\nARTEFACT: Reviews & Remarks.\nI\u2019m so happy with the way Artefact has been received. Here\u2019s hoping I can recapture some of that magic for Bucket of Bolts.\nIf you\u2019re a returning backer: hi, nice to see you again! I hope you also enjoyed Artefact :)\nPrint copies of Artefact\n\"It combines a little bit of writing and a little bit of drawing with a lot of storytelling to make a game that is one of the most relaxing and mindful experiences I have had this year.\" - Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"This is a great system agnostic supplement that could fit on any gamer\u2019s shelf\". \u2014 Pulp Culture Museum\n\"It was a wonderful game that once I started, I had a hard time putting down.

There's more details about the individual games below, but first let's talk about the broad details.\nMy goal is to take three games that bring me great joy, and send as many copies as possible out into the world. Maybe they'll get played? Maybe they'll change lives? Or maybe they'll get picked up by another trans person who will have a little chuckle about the shared understanding of it all. These are all great outcomes! \nAs a backer at the $10 level, you will get digital copies of all three zines; each is sixteen-pages, black and white, and set up for both A4 and 8.5\"x11\" paper, sent straight to your digital doorstep at the end of the campaign, along with screen-readable copies. In addition, you will get immediate access to the betas of all three zines! These are 99% done, but may be subject to final layout and word tweaking. \nAt the $20 level you get the good stuff: a physical copy of any zine! Choose whichever one makes you feel most euphoric. And hey, you still get the digital copies immediately, so you can read them all and pick your favorite at the end of the campaign when I send out the surveys. \nAnd if you pledge $40, you get the entire trilogy. That's right, if you're going to buy two, you get the third one for free, whether you want it or not! This is my real goal here, getting you wonderful folks out there get a full triple-barreled blast of my Feelings. \nThis is a strictly one-woman affair, so that means I will be printing these out on my very own home laser printer, stapling them with my very own longarm stapler, and sending them to you through the United States Postal Service, First Class Mail. \nI'm Lara! This is the fourth time I've launched a Kickstarter, but the first time I've done so as an out-and-proud transgirl (with the previous three having been run in states of \"completely in the closet,\" \"completely in denial,\" and \"completely oblivious\"). There's a fun rule-of-3 going on here, isn't there? I kickstarted 3 games as Ed, and now I'm doing 3 more as Lara, right here on ZineQuest 3! \nANYWAY. In addition to being trans, I'm a professional tabletop game developer; I've published a bunch of indies as Glaive Guisarme Games, but also worked professionally on a number of games, including Acute Paranoia for Mongoose Publishing, Eldritch Century for Draco Studios, and bunch of games for Evil Hat Productions who were the first to put my real name on a game, Fate Condensed. \nI came out six months ago. It was very dramatic. It's been a rough six months in a lot of ways, but on the whole, even when I'm miserable, I've never been happier. Highly recommended. \nOkay, okay, let's take a look at the three games that make up the Trans Rage Trilogy.\nYou have, for some time, had a bone to pick with RJ McElhenny, author of a series of extremely popular young-adult fantasy novels, but lately she's been saying extremely reductive things about who she thinks deserves to be called a wizard. So, as a bunch of magic-users who she would describe as \"it's okay for them to call themselves wizards but they're not really wizards,\" you're going to heist the hell out of her mansion. \nLet's Rob RJ McElhenny and Steal Her Golden Quill is the \"angry\" part of trans rage. Fuck politeness, let's smash some shit.\nInspired by an author whose name I currently forget, this here is a wish-fulfillment magic heist. Move through the randomly-generated rooms of McElhenny Manor and confront the obstacles she's thrown in your way with your awesome magic powers (which is to say, describe how cool you are and chuck some dice to see if it's cool enough or if you have to describe an even more awesome spell). If you start running low on magic energy, talk about how mad you are at McElhenny and you'll be ready to take on another room. \nThis game was originally released in July of 2020, because That Author was in the public sphere for some reason or another and I was full of feelings that I wasn't quite sure how to express. It would be nice if this game were to stop being relevant, but I just learned she's going to be drawing paychecks for a TV show that's gonna keep her in the public sphere and frankly it looks like \"getting mad at That Author\" is a pretty evergreen situation. Blech. Anyway. This re-release includes:\nRevised rules, including replacing \"flashbacks\" with a simpler, quicker method of regaining Action dice\nCleaned-up layout and a prettier cover \nMy actual name on it because when I first released it I wasn't out yet and didn't know whaaaaat to put on it\nThis is a handsome sixteen-page zine, black ink on off-white paper (the most maaaaagical color of paper), folded, stapled, and delivered to your door so you can perform your own magic revenge. \nGet this one if you want to feel like a real cool wizard doing some cool crimes with your wizard buddies.\nWelcome to the cyber-future, chummer. Is it everything you wanted it to be? Has all the hype really given way to a fully-realized universe with acceptable levels of optimization and a minimum of crashes? The streets are lawless, the corps own your soul, and \"hope\" has lost all meaning, but it's a sweet-ass transhumanist future so even if you don't have control of your life, you still have control of your sex and gender. Probably got a hell of a menu to choose from, right?\nPenis 2.0.77 is the \"manic\" part of trans rage. Nothing makes sense, so make it your own and giggle at the absurdity.\nInspired by a popular AAA video game that had (and let us be extremely generous here) mixed results in its depictions of trans people. This is as far as I can tell, the most complex and full-featured series of crotch-related tables ever put into a zine. There's no other \"game\" here, but there are lots of bad jokes about wobbly bits. Written in a fugue state late in 2020, I have a few regrets about the initial presentation. Most notably, I accidentally aped the last few centuries of male-dominated medical research by almost totally discounting the clitoris. This revision remedies that, and includes:\nMore genital variables, taking us up to approximately 4 trillion different configurations\nParts synergies, which will make random crotches hew slightly closer to \"expected\" without hampering custom design potential\nRe-balanced parts costs, to prevent you from accruing too much MegaCorp MegaDebt\nFor the purposes of transparency, especially with respect to \"what you can and cannot launch a Kickstarter for,\" let me be clear: there is no pornography here. There are no photos or drawings of nude people or anatomical features, nor anything that could be considered \"erotica.\" It's charts with crotch jokes, and RPG jokes, and cyberpunk jokes. You can create a character (sort of) but the real goal here is cathartic giggling about the inherent strangeness of the human underwear-zone. \nThis is a totally cyber sixteen-page zine, printed in black on light blue paper (the color of the digital cyberscape here in Byte City). Finally, you can create those aspirational genitals you've been dreaming of.\nGet this one if you want jokes on jokes on jokes, or to delight in overly-laborious random roll chargen.\nOne day, the dragon crawled out of myth and into the real world. Our real world. It seized control, and bent the people to its will... yourself included. But you have resisted, despite everything you've lost. And now it's time to fight back. This is a fast-paced storytelling game that puts you in the position of... yourself. Not a hero, not a warrior, but your own real-world self, using your own real-world skills to fight a seemingly unstoppable force. You might not win... you probably won't. But you have to try.\nTo Stand Before the Dragon's Wrath is the \"resigned\" part of trans rage. You probably can't fix anything, but you're going to have to try.\nWay back in the forgotten history of our benighted planet, almost a decade ago, a boy named Edward wrote a game which he thought was about cool dragon fights, but which was actually about being upset at a world which was wrong in an way he wished he could put a face on. He found himself living half for reasons he didn't really understand and in his heart of hearts he wished that he had the power to take on the powers that be.\nWhat a dipshit this boy named Ed was. How obvious in retrospect were his works. Let me guess, Edward, if you had a superpower, it would have been shapeshifting? Perhaps you don't think much of vanity and take a grim pride in not caring about your appearance? Oh who's your favorite character on this show, is it the fairly butch lady who cleans up nice? You fool, you transparent buffoon. \nAHEM. This revised and re-imagined version maintains the same broad structure as the one-page original, but includes:\nRevised text to simplify and clarify the main mechanics \nBonus content related to altering the game now included in the main text, rather than some separate pages\nSubtext now more obvious, especially to me, the author\nThere will be a dragon making your lives miserable and you, the players portraying lightly fictionalized versions of yourself, will talk about how it's made you miserable, and then attempt to take out that dragon with your own unique skills. In other words, you'll give the aspects of society that make you miserable a big scaly face, and then punch it. You're likely to get horribly defeated in the process, but, and this is important, you might not! \nThe storytelling system uses simple card draws and light risk-reward mechanisms to tell grandiose stories of epic battles, and the whole thing is being released for the first time as a sixteen-page zine, black ink on pink paper (the color of fierceness, flames, and blood, but without getting so dark that it would be hard to read), complete with additional information on how to adapt and modify the core engine to your own ends. \nGet this one if you want a light-but-robust storytelling engine about confronting enormous odds.\nBonus Content\nIt's like stretch goals, but I was always going to do them anyway. It's just nice to announce them at the same time as some major monetary milestone. \nEach zine comes with its own special single-sheet bonus, delivered with every physical copy. Get the three-pack, get three bonuses! \nTo Stand Before the Dragon's Wrath (Pocket Edition) - Included with the full Wrath, it's an especially tiny version of the basic game. No frills, no variants, just a small package which you can easily tuck into a pocket and take with you to conventions (when conventions exist again).\nAnthony Charterstone and the Unwelcome Intruder dust jacket - The cover of RJ McElhenny's most recent novel. If you aren't quite mad enough at her to steal her golden quill, then you can simply read through her works and allow the rage to bubble up within. \nPenis 2.0.77 Genital Customization Form - A closed envelope containing a character sheet filled out with my own personal genital information, as accurately reflected as I could make it. Importantly, you have no right to this information, but I won't stop you from opening it. Do you respect trans people enough to not give in to prurient curiosity about their genitalia? \nInterview with PlusOneExp\nIf you want to hear me talk a little bit more about this campaign, why I made it, and what I'm hoping to get out of it, check out my interview with Tony of PlusOneExp!

Their mission: win freedom by acquiring a legendary religious relic at the behest of their corporate jailors, PrayCo. \nThe Wheel's hollow internal landscape of barren fields and rusting, bombed out structures swarm with monstrous bioengineered animals and lethal corporate relic hunters. Trenches, minefields, hull punctures and a stalemated battle bar passage from the high-gravity docking bays to the blasphemous prize waiting at the funnel's tip.\nSimple farmers of the rotating colony ship Within Wheels starve as bargain InstaCrops wither on the vine. They turn to faith and ritual, concocting visions of a hell on earth from half-remembered traditions and commercialized lore. Bunker doors seal as their beacon calls upon believers to consecrate synthetic soil with holy blood.\nThe Drain takes a WWI influenced war-as-hell meat grinder and mashes it with bleak, occult survival horror themes drawn from video games like Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Darkwood. This 16-page zine is packed with everything you need to churn out a crop of battle hardened level-1 characters from level-0 rabble, including:\n Brand new rules for running carnage-filled funnels in Mothership.\n A funnel crawl map by Andrew Walter, gorgeously illuminated to chart the party's movement through the conical space.\n Vicious new items to arm your mob of funnel PCs.\n Art on every spread, including illustrations from Mothership creator Sean McCoy.\n\nThis module emulates Dungeon Crawl Classics\u2019 \"funnel\" character generation in which each player pilots multiple level-0 characters through a \"meat grinder\". Survivors, forged in blood, earn their 1st level. If embraced, a funnel becomes a contest to achieve the most spectacular PC death. Players and GMs bond in murderous collaboration, anxieties surrounding character death melting away. PCs become resources to throw at problems rather than precious things to be guarded. Campaign-spanning legends of heroic sacrifice and bitter survival begin here.\nAll backers will receive a 1-page PDF of my funnel rules for Mothership immediately after the campaign ends so you can get started running your own funnels. The rules sheet will include guidelines for creating your own funnel adventures and running existing modules as funnels.\nInterested in a writing sample from the author before you back? My first Mothership pamphlet and Gold DriveThruRPG bestseller Moonbase Blues is free for the duration of this Kickstarter. Snag it if you haven't already!\nhttps://ian-yusem.itch.io/moonbase-blues\nFunnel Survivor backers will receive a limited run double-sided A3 poster of Andrew Walter's map for The Drain. I will hand write custom, unique game content for each backer on the \"secret\" reverse side. Backers will submit a personal theme and work with me to customize Within Wheels for their home game. The content I write is up to each backer, and could vary from a gut-churning table to a terrifying new monster.\nPretty cool video, right? You could own all 3 unique, lovingly handcrafted spaceship models from the trailer to use as props in your game. Should you back at the Within Wheels pledge tier, you will receive: A 5\" x 3\" model of the ill-fated sleeve soldier dropship Genesis, a 12\" x 9\" model of the PrayCo prison transport Charity, and a 9\" x 4\" model of colony ship and adventure setting Within Wheels delivered right to your home (shipping included). The models were made with styrene foam, superglue, \"bits of junk\", blood, sweat, tears, and dreams. The proceeds for this pledge will go to Meredith, our steadfast video producer and master modeler.\nIan Yusem: Pamphlet baron and occasional RPG blogger, Ian (myself) is the author and publisher of The Drain. Mothership fans might recognize some of my 3rd party scenarios like Moonbase Blues and Dinoplex: Cataclysm. I think The Drain is my best work yet, and I'm excited to send it out into the world.\nChristian Kessler: The layout and design genius behind books like Silent Titans and Troika! Numinous Edition is putting his eminent talents behind this humble zine. Christian also illustrated the sweet, Russian constructivism-influenced cover art for The Drain. A man of many talents.\nFiona Maeve Geist: Editing powerhouse and RPG darling, Fiona has been essential to this project's development and she's done a wonderful job tightening up the manuscript. Fiona is a lead developer on Mothership and takes her pen to 99% of everything good in RPGs as part of the editing team MoonRat Conspiracy, including Ultraviolet Grasslands, Troika, Silent Titans, ad infinitum.\nAndrew Walter: Andrew made the best damn map I've ever seen in an RPG for this project. You used to know his illustrations from beloved titles like Troika, Slipgate Chokepoint and Fever Swamp\u2014now you know him from The Drain.\nSean McCoy: Last, but certainly not least, the design legend behind Mothership and co-owner of Tuesday Knight Games is contributing an absolute ton of fantastically horrifying art to this zine. Not a spread will go by without its splendor.\nThe Drain's manuscript is written, playtested, and edited. Christian is underway on final layout and the last pieces of art are rolling in from Sean. We're on track to fulfill well before our June estimate (which budgets an extra couple months for unseen complications). Here's a conservative timeline laying out our internal milestones:\nJanuary 2021 - Writing, playtesting, editing complete\nFebruary 2021 - Kickstarter campaign, PledgeManager opened to Backers\nMarch 2021 - All art submitted, layout and text finalized\nApril 2021 - Printed proofs ordered and reviewed\nMay 2021 - Print run ordered, stretch goals completed\nJune 2021 - Fulfillment begins\nThe good folks at Exalted Funeral will be fulfilling physical orders to the USA and the Rest of the World.\nThe Melsonian Arts Council is handling distribution to the United Kingdom and Europe.\nMonkey's Paw Games has Canada covered.\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge, but will be collected at the time of release via PledgeManager to ensure accurate shipping costs. Digital copies of the zine will be distributed through DriveThruRPG.\nRecent changes to tax policy due to Brexit complicates EU and UK distribution, on top of ongoing Covid shipping troubles.

That's exactly our goal, proposing this setting.\nWe developed 6 playable races, 3 new classes, dozens of character options and rules to manage Time Travel, 20+ New Monsters (together with the Time Dragon!) and Temporal Dungeons. Everything ready to be introduced in your 5th Edition campaigns. \n\nDownload the Quickstart and start your next session jumping through time!\nQuickstart available both in English and Italian.\nDownload the Quickstart (70 pages), learn the basics and play your first Temporal Dungeon!\n\n\n\n\n\nShintiara is a world that combines sci-fi and fantasy, a planet dilated by temporal paradoxes that exists on the event horizon produced by Siray, the sun, and Murya, the black star.\nOn the planet of Shintiara, the Recruits exploit Paradoxes (namely items and places from other ages) and Powers that bend time, driven by an apocalyptic vision and with the aim of favouring their Factions.\nA long time ago, the two stars Siray and Murya which the planet orbits around were in harmony. Shintiara danced in the space around them for millions of years until, about three hundred years ago, the catastrophic events of the Great Darkness changed everything. For reasons unknown, Murya collapsed, turning into a strange black hole and rupturing space-time around Shintiara.\nMurya, the black star, continuously attracts the planet and breaks the flow of time\nAt that very moment, time was ruptured and an unheard-of clash began: on one side lies Siray, that exerts its influence in order to maintain the planet in the Cosmos, on the other lies Murya, the black star, that threatens to make all time end.\nAs a Recruit in the Crusade you can shape time as you please, without magic or technology. You can navigate the flow of time either to prevent the Apocalypse or to bring it about.\nIf it happened, the Apocalypse would be permanent. No journey through time could ever go beyond it.\nRecruit! Accept the consequences of your vision: a new portal has opened already and the Crusade of Time needs a new hero!\n\nPlaying in the world of Shintiara is an exciting and kaleidoscopic succession of adventures, in which characters will literally move and think in four dimensions. Every player character is a Recruit, a scholar and expert of time and its Paradoxes who can bend time.\nExplore a planet full of magic and technology\nAccumulating too many Paradoxes or activating your temporal powers too often can also, however, lead to unpleasant consequences. For example, it is not such a good thing to be inside a temporal maelstrom. Unfortunately for you, creatures and time are fickle, and at times generate places that defy the laws of physics: temporal dungeons, areas of Shintiara that rise within the mazes of Veils. \nA temporal dungeon is a space and a place which is situated around one or more Veils (time portals). This space and moment in time bends the usual laws of physics and time. After entering the Veil one will end up in the same map, but in years or Ages away.\nTake great care during your missions!\n\n\n\n\n Shintiara exists, through time, in eight different Ages, though some documents state otherwise. \nAll Recruits can accumulate tachyon energy in the form of Paradox Points. They can spend Paradox Points to activate many different effects, also called base temporal powers, such as Accelerate, Slow, Pass through a Veil, Peek into the Future and many more. \nThe only way to journey through time is via Veils, which as stated are the thinning of boundaries between different Ages and dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Shintiara there are seven sentient races who live on the main continent and are directly involved in historical and temporal events: Humans, Darqarots, Garduans, Skirths, Wyspers, Zolkanians and Zyrkuls. \nDarqarots (playable). Biped humanoids with hooves and horns, the Darqarot are a race in rapid physical and social evolution, used as slaves by humans for centuries.\nGarduans (playable). Equipped with bat or demon-like wings and lean, skinny bodies, the Garduans are renowned for their warrior culture and ability with firearms and ranged weapons. Garduans are considered harbingers of misfortune by other races.\nSkirths (playable). Peoples of Shintiara call the Skith the Opposite People. This nickname has been given to them for two typical traits: the innate ability to climb upside down and the tendency to act contrary to any expectation. From childhood, a Skirth learns to smile instead of crying and often expresses itself by stating the opposite of what it thinks.\nHumans  are divided into many different playable Cultures, each with its own peculiarities and Social Traits.\nWyspers (playable). The mysterious Wysper are a race of spirits of light from the dimension of Spirits, also called the Otherworld. During the first phase of their life, for sixty years they take on a material body with humanoid shape of noble traits and white, luminescent skin.\nZolkanians (playable). Just by looking at one, a Zolkanian betrays its true \u201cextra- dimensional\u201d or \u201cextra-terrestrial\u201d origin. Quite short and slender in build, these humanoids possess a much larger bald head if compared to a human of the same size. Their skin ranges from blue, light blue and aquamarine.\n Zyrkuls (unlockable). Short in stature but with powerful muscles, it is said that Zyrkul are linked by a hive mind that, whenever necessary, takes over and controls them from afar. The colour of their scales seems to vary according to the role they play in the Hive, their social organization.\nEach of these races, as well as all sentient creatures on the planet, interact with each other also according to the culture that their communities possess.\nNew race: the Wyspers\n\nEvery race on Shintiara possesses an additional trait called Culture which represents what one\u2019s own native community deems useful or appropriate. There are eight types of culture and each character inherits their culture from the place or civilization they grow up in. One\u2019s own Culture and Temporal Renown guarantee access to Social Traits and Cultural Feats.\nNew race: the Garduans\nMagic and technology will fuse and become one in the more advanced ages of Shintiara. This has resulted in the generation of technological spells, which have special rules:  they may, for example, have properties as items do or hack into devices which have digital components. The Recruit\u2019s Guide to Shintiara: Crusade of Time will cover these and many other rules & options.\nNew Class: the Chronoguardian\n\nThe Recruit\u2019s Guide to Shintiara: Crusade of Time will contain 3 new classes (Chronoguardian, Voidwalker and Timedancer) numerous archetypes and backgrounds, as well as skills and spells from Shintiara\u2019s history.\nAbout the Chronoguardians \nFor a Chronoguardian time is always in danger. Not all of them agree on what the danger or its source is, but they all regard the flow of time as a river infected with the very idea of the Apocalypse. The main objective of chronoguardians is to keep Paradoxes and time travel under control, as well as to spy on the actions of the Void faction in order to prevent temporal collapse. \nWould you like more info? Take a look at the Quickstart and attached character sheets!\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery adventure or campaign in Shintiara treats the Apocalypse as one of the protagonists. The Apocalypse is expected at the end of the Eighth Age and the ways in which it will happen are uncertain. Certain events, however, might manage to shift it either forwards or backwards in time.\n                                The shifting of the Apocalypse is managed by the Chronicler via the Apocalypse Clock, a circle divided into the eight Ages of Shintiara and twenty-four circles or phases.\nThe Apocalypse Clock\nAll the rules and suggestions to manage the Apocalypse Clock will be insterted in the Chronicler's Codex rulebook. \n\n\nInterview with the team:\n\nExample of gameplay (Italian):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Funding Goal of the Campaign intends to cover the production costs, including (mainly) illustrations, graphics, game design, translations, and printing.\nWe decided to use any other funds to improve your gaming experience, upgrading the contents, and creating new adventures!

Lovecraft. Through investigation, awareness, recollection and action, the players will experience a time-bending and relentless scenario!\nThe scenario is set in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard close to the North Pole in the year 1993. The players are resourceful soldiers sent to explore the mysteries surrounding a secret Russian mine deep below the frozen landscape. As time is running out, the players need to stop an experiment gone horribly wrong; a warp in the time-space continuum that threatens to unleash the mad will of the daemon-sultan Azathoth.\nThe main mechanism of \u2018Svalbard\u2019 is to Explore, Die, Repeat. If you have seen the movie \u201cEdge of Tomorrow\u201d, played the board game \u201cTime Stories\u201d, read the book \u201cAll you need is kill\u201d or know the concept \u2018roguelike\u2019 from video games, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. If you know none of it, here\u2019s a quick explanation:\nIn this scenario, the characters will die a lot. But it is not a permadeath; they \u201crespawn\u201d and bring back into the game their accumulated knowledge prior to their death needed to progress. As they start to uncover the secrets and puzzles of the scenario, they start to learn how to avoid their deaths altogether, and the goal of the scenario is no less than a \u201cperfect run\u201d where the players complete the entire scenario without a single death!\nThe layout of this book is centred around a specific concept; Rooms. Each page (or sometimes two pages) explains a specific room in the mine. Each room has challenges that need to be overcome, and information needs to be gained. The challenges are often lethal, but as said above; the characters are respawned if killed. Thus, they\u2019ll 'learn' how to deal with each room if they\u2019re killed, and upon their return after respawning, they\u2019ll know how to progress.\nYour players have never experienced anything like this in a role-playing game before. \nWelcome to \u2018Svalbard\u2019\n\n'Lovecraftian': Whereas our first scenario, 'Pax Cthuliana', was heavily influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos, 'Svalbard' takes a lighter approach. Yes, the world is threatened by the deity Azathoth, and yes, horror plays a crucial role, but 'Svalbard' cannot be said to be a classical Cthulhu scenario. It may easily be run by players/GMs without any knowledge of Lovecraft/Mythos at all.\nAction-oriented: 'Svalbard' demands an action-oriented approach. That's why 'Svalbard' comes with a set of pre-determined characters; a team of lethal, specialized, trained soldiers.\nSystem: 'Svalbard' comes with an included, very simplified game system. It is tailored to the action-paced story and the central 'Time Unit' mechanic. If you would like more dice rolling or adaption to your own preferred system, you'll find the scenario easily adaptable, as long as you incorporate the Time Unit mechanic.\nTime Unit mechanic: Our former scenario, \u2018Pax Cthuliana\u2019, could be played without a single die roll, as all progress was connected to handouts the players needed to decipher and deduct information from.\nIn \u2018Svalbard\u2019, we\u2019ve taken kind of a similar approach, based on our Time Unit mechanic. This mechanic does not demand any die rolls, only a tiny bit of bookkeeping. \nLet\u2019s explain: The players will enter Rooms, learn stuff, die, and later return to the same Rooms, but now with the knowledge that might keep them alive and helps them progress through the scenario.\nTo keep things tense, to encourage good judgement and to make smart choices, we\u2019re introducing the concept of a finite time; that is, the scenario must be completed within a set period of time, or else Azathoth is unleashed upon the world and the players lose the scenario!\nThis finite time is called Time Units (TU). The scenario starts at 8 TU before time runs out and they lose. As they explore and learn and do things, time will go, and TU might be lost. Inevitably, the characters will die/respawn during the game, but upon their return, they might now have the knowledge of how to reduce the amount of TU spent on different tasks.\nAn example: The characters see a computer they know holds a password they desperately need. To obtain the password, 1 TU is spent to work into its files to find it. You see? There is no die roll, only the expense of TU. But the best of all? If they get the password, die sometime later and then respawn, they already know the password, and does not have to access the computer at a later run! \nThis is the spirit of \u2018Svalbard\u2019; learn the secrets of the scenario, do smart choices, and allocate your TU wisely so you may complete the scenario within the allocated time and stop Azathoth!\nTo keep track of the spent TU, the scenario includes a simple TU track. Actually, we\u2019ve included several tracks, so you may choose the one you like (or create one of your own). As the game begins, place the included TU marker (or something of your own choosing, like an old coin or a dragon bone fragment) on the \u201c8\u201d space. As TU is spent, just move the marker down accordingly. They use 1 TU to do a task? Move the marker 1 TU down. If it reaches 0 before they\u2019ve completed the scenario, they\u2019ve lost.\nIf you are interested in the full intro story of the scenario, check out our Update # 7 \n\nWith help from you, unlock FREE ITEMS and make this scenario become even greater!\n\nUNLOCKED!!!!

The second token has UniToz written in Cyrillic letters; \u2018\u0423\u043d\u0438\u0422\u043e\u0436\u2019 (short for \u2018\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435'). In \u2018Svalbard\u2019, UniToz is the name of a military research project created back in 1953 by order of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. In the game, the research project unexpectedly threatens to free the daemon god Azathoth himself upon the world.\nThe third token displays our interpretation of the Elder Sign, as created by H. P. Lovecraft himself in 1926. First mentioned in his work \u2018The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath\u2019, it\u2019s a protection against the evil forces of the Mythos.\nYou can but these Tokens individually or as a collection of all three in a special made case.

He grew up playing computers such as C64 and Amiga, role-playing games as AD&D an Call of Cthulhu and board games as Shogun and Axis & Allies. He is a senior high school teacher, the leader of the local gaming club, and still plays on computers, board games and RPGs as often as he can, at least once a week. He is proud to be a geek.\n\nEven Vinjor R\u00f8ssland is a co-author on 'Svalbard'. He is the creative mind behind the Insight Fantasy RPG and several other publications at drivethruRPG.com. He started playing RPGs back in the late 80s. Taking the GM-role some years later, he has entertained countless people through genres such as fantasy, sci-fi and horror. He has done all the layouts, bookbinding, advertising etc. for this scenario and campaign.\n\nJoseph Diaz created most of the art for our previous scenario 'Pax Cthuliana' and was rehired for 'Svalbard'. He has worked as a concept artist for productions like Game of Thrones, Warcraft, Europa Report and Sleepy Hollow. Introducing Mattias Zeballos and Megvin Gjovari, they have given life to 'Svalbard' with their powerful illustrations.\n\nTwo Starving Gnolls (TSG): When Jarle and Even sit down to talk, their heads spin with ideas. TSG was created to set those ideas into motion. As such, TSG functions as a development team to convert RPG ideas into playable material.

Halfway between the realms of life and death, a new civilisation of lost souls has sprung up under the thrall of a creature older than gods that calls itself The Wise Minister.\nIn Caverns, you play denizens of the city of Sepulchre, descendants of those plucked from their homes on the surface, trying to forge a new life in the darkness of the Underworld. If you\u2019re clever, quick, and fortunate, and you live long enough to find your niche, you might learn how you got here. Maybe you\u2019ll even set things right.\nCaverns of the Wise Minister\u2019s core funding goal is \u00a32,000 to produce PDF and physical versions of the 40,000+ word setting guide. The book includes 5 new playable races, 4 new subclasses, and 5 new backgrounds, as well as new monsters, spells, magic items, and equipment. Additionally, we have devised new, setting-appropriate mechanics for Social Standing and enhanced Darkness rules.\nWe want to go further. With your help, we\u2019ll produce a full, level 1-11 adventure path written by some of the best names in the business that explores the mysteries and dangers of the Underworld.\nOnce upon a time, there stood an elven city called Silverhome, and an aboleth and a deity vied for power over it. The god Empyrea struck down the aboleth, and in revenge it drowned her favoured city. The survivors set out for the Underworld to beg for mercy from the god of death and reclaim the souls of their beloved dead.\nThey never reached death\u2019s domain.\nInstead, they fell under the influence of the being called the Wise Minister, the same vengeful aboleth who had destroyed their home. They built a city in its domain, and it delights in keeping them deep below the earth, tormenting the god they have long forgotten. But that isn\u2019t true vengeance. That can only come when Empyrea is dead. She stole the Wise Minister\u2019s city, and it has nursed that grudge for millennia.\nTrapped between life and death, pawns in the games of gods and monsters, thousands of creatures eke out a living in the dark. Those in power know it was not always thus, but it serves their interests to have it remain so.\nSepulchre is a city based on grudges and lies. Stories set here deal with cycles, especially cycles of vengeance, and memory. The aboleth known as the Wise Minister remembers every offence committed against it and plans to avenge them. The cave elves believe its lies \u2014 and create a false narrative about their place in the city. Newcomers resent power structures they had no say in, and outsiders try to leave before they can get tangled in the city\u2019s web of traded favours and obligations.\nAdventures here feel stifling: there are always constraints, be they physical and environmental \u2014 no sky or sun, or dangerous monsters that limit how far it\u2019s safe to range outside the city. Specific themes include:\nPower corrupts. This is morally, spiritually, and physically true. The cave elves gained power from the Wise Minister, and independence through the transgressions of their first leader. The elves bear their own curse, their elders transforming into batlike monstrosities, and the Wise Minister\u2019s borrowed power comes with the requirement of complete obedience.\nWe are all connected. The Wise Minister\u2019s telepathy. The cave elves\u2019 reverie. The nix\u2019s psychic records encoded in coral and the collective wisdom of the uizet. Connections and the community of a shared psychic space are a solace in a dark place. Those connections create in-groups and out-groups, and suspicion between different factions.\nThe lies we tell ourselves. Our leaders are not monsters. Our homeland is gone. This is our home now. We are happy here. None of these things are true, but life would be unbearable if any of these illusions were pierced. Storytelling in Sepulchre should play heavily on confronting, or finding ways to avoid, uncomfortable truths that could shake the whole realm.\nCaught between life and death. Sepulchre and its surrounds are literally, physically, close to the realm of the God of Death. Death is close at hand, and final. For newcomers from the realms above, coming to Sepulchre feels like dying: they are ripped, suddenly and without warning, away from their loved ones and the world they knew. Grief and sorrow are everyday.\nOlefsian, ruler of Sepulchre. Art credit: Liz Gist\nThis book is going to be beautiful. We\u2019ve got some samples of just how it\u2019s going to look when it\u2019s done. None of this is final, but it\u2019s the direction we\u2019re heading in.\nENNIE-nominated designer Jessica Marcrum (Book of Seasons, Uncaged, Age of Sigmar: Soulbound) has written a level zero adventure designed to introduce Caverns of the Wise Minister.

Music is by Chris Bissette (The Wretched, amongst other outstanding projects), and you can hear a 2-minute taster in the campaign video on this age. \nFor this campaign, we are trialing Kickstarter's new add-ons feature!

Set in a world overrun by greenery, Wildsea uses a narrative, fiction-first d6 dicepool system that draws inspiration from games like Belly of the Beast, Blades in the Dark, and 13th Age. \nClickthrough to access the Quick Start Rules!\nThis campaign's goal is to raise funds to produce and print a 1st edition of the Wildsea RPG. This is a production Kickstarter: after the campaign closes, we'll be using the funds raised to create a fully realized beautiful rulebook. The budget goal of $15,000 represents the minimum amount needed to bring the book to life with the resources we currently have available. \nAny additional funds will be funneled back directly into the production of the RPG, adding more content, art, professional layouts, and an offset print run to deliver a premium tabletop roleplaying book that will be a showcase for any collection. \n Some three hundred years ago the empires of the world were toppled by a wave of fast growing greenery, a tide of rampant growth spilling from the West known as the Verdancy. \nNow chainsaw-driven ships cut their way across dense treetop waves, their engines powered by oilfruit, rope-golems, honey and pride.\nYou play a wildsailor, part of a motley crew consisting of humanity's weathered descendants, cactoid gunslingers, centipedal fungi, silk-clothed spiderfolk, and other, stranger things. \nWith your fellow crewmembers, you'll journey across the lingin' tide discovering charts, pursuing drives, and avoiding mires of the deep. \nThe Wildsea hungers and grows, roots sinking deep into the forest floor as the waves above ripple with life.  What will you discover in its depths? \n\n\n\nCheck out our Actual Play on the Don't Forget Your Towel Podcast!\nThe Wildsea is a fiction-first roleplaying game with narrative and character decisions driving your interaction with the mechanics of the Wild Words engine. The game uses a d6 narrative dicepool system that constantly pushes the story forward.\nAt character creation, players select a Bloodline, Origin and Post, each with a variety of options to inform and customize a character's background and playstyle:\nThe four core bloodlines of the Wildsea: the cactuslike Ektus, Ardent survivors, hive spider Tzelicrae, and fungi Gau.\n Your Edges represent the way in which your character is most used to solving problems. Your Grace, Iron, Instinct, Sharps, Teeth, Tides, or Veils. \nYour Skills are more specific areas in which your character has training or a natural advantage. Things like Climbing, Charming, Cooking, Breaking, or Scavenging. \nYou also have Aspects - gear, traits, or companions - that can be used, expended, or damaged throughout the course of play. \n Resources are useful oddities, short term expendables used for things like whispers, scavenge, and specimens.\nYour known Languages allow you to engage with different people and cultures in the diverse world of the Wildsea.  \nFinally, your Drives and Mires define your personality, motivation, and long term goals. \nEach crew will also have their own ship, a vessel capable of braving the unique challenges of the lingin tide. You might cut a path with a chainsaw-ridged prow, drag yourself with hooks and grapples or scuttle from branch to branch on insectile limbs.\nCustomize and upgrade  your ship by designing its Size, Frame, Hull, Bite, and Engine, and outfitting  it with different Fittings. Make it your home on the waves! \nStories and Characters develop as the crew pursues milestones, while time in the game is abstracted through three distinct phases: scenes, montages, and journeys. \nThe Wildsea will initially be presented in landscape, 11.5 x 8.5'' inch (~29 x 22 cm) hardcover book with around 200 pages of mostly black and white interiors punctuated by full color spread chapter headings.  \nMockup. Artwork and Design of Physical Book not final. Design shown is a hardcover perfect bound edition that would only be unlocked should we reach certain stretch goal milestones.\nAs the campaign grows, so will the quality and contents of the book. Should we reach certain stretch goals, we will upgrade the physical book to a 3-piece clothbound, full colour, sewn book sure to be a centerpiece of any collection. For more information, see the Stretch Goals section below.\nThe initial funding goal of $15,000 represents the bare minimum for the creators to produce and print physical copies of the book and recoup the funds already expended by the creator to the artists. \n\nCommunity Copies: At Collector's Edition and above tiers, we'll include additional digital Community Copies to be claimed by the public. Community Copies provide a way for those with less means to enjoy content and are a feature of Itch.io. When our page on the platform goes live, we'll add Community Copies commensurate with the amount of backers we have at higher tiers.\n\nShipping is not included in the pledge levels for this campaign and will be calculated and added on when we are ready to ship via Backerkit. This is a production Kickstarter and it may be up to a year before we start shipping out physical copies. It would therefore be inaccurate  to include the shipping rates as part of the funds raised for this campaign. \nAs in: you will not be charged additional VAT or Customs Taxes on your shipped goods.\nMythopoeia is currently in the process of partnering with fulfillment centers based all over the world to deliver customs-friendly shipping, including to Europe and Oceania.  According to our most recent quotes, packages for a <1kg (~2 lbs) package average around $7.50 to the USA, UK, Germany, and Netherlands and around $20 to Oceania and Canada. \n\nShipping has been quite tumultuous in recent months due to the ongoing pandemic and politics. Canadian postage from the USA seems to have taken a dramatic spike over the past four years. This is a problem we are actively working on. If you know any local Canadian or Australian distributors for USA goods, we would love to hear from you! \nClick through to Felix's Twitter.\nClick through to Pierre's Instagram.\nClick through to Omercan's Instgram.\nClick through to Katy's Instagram.\nClick through to Kyllian's Instagram.\nClick through to Alexis' Instagram.\nClick through to Liam's Soundcloud.\nClick through to say hello to Ric [@Cerebric] on the Discord!\nClick through to Ryan's Twitter.\nClick through to Mythopoeia.\nClick through to Mythopoeia's Itch.io\nIf we reach our initial goal of $15,000, we'll include new Origins for character creation not seen in the Quickstart Rules! We'll also throw in a set of digital wallpapers and other high resolution Wildsea Artwork as part of the Kickstarter exclusive digital bonuses. \nAt $17,000 we will be able to commission a full Wildsea Soundtrack from the amazing Liam P. Vaughan, composer of Thrash, Tangle, Sink, the song used in our Kickstarter video!  \nAt $20,000 we'll be able to afford to turn the book from mostly black and white to full colour! To do so will require us to go back and recolour about two thirds of our total art assets - a significant endeavor! \n\nAt $25,000 we'll bring on board a Professional Layout Artist to help design the final look of the book!  We'll also produce and release Virtual Play Surfaces to facilitate online play on your favorite platforms of choice.\n\nAt $30,000 we'll be able to raise the rates of our artists as well as commission an expanded bestiary from bestiary artist Katy Shmeckerel (@schmeckerel)! \nAt $32,000 we'll release the SRD for the Wild Words Engine, allowing you to hack and release your own games! To celebrate this milestone, we'll also be commissioning Creators to create new content for the Wildsea including new factions, beasts, and  ships, and perhaps even additional Reaches...\nAt $35,000 we'll be able to upgrade the specs of both the Standard and Collector's Edition of The Wildsea! This may include things like an offset print run, three piece clothbound hardcover, and embossed finish. \nAt $37,000 we'll include a chapter on Arconautics - the study of the weird and strange. Arconautics presents an array of additional options for both players and Fireflies that want to embrace the extraordinary - alchemists, augurs, ironbound automatons, manipulators of metal and plantlife. Includes new bloodlines, origins, posts, skills, and hazards! \nAt $40,000 we'll be able to spare no expense when it comes to printing the book, including being able to lower our carbon footprint by printing locally. We will also will look into more printing bells and whistles like foil stamping, endsheets, booksmarks, et. all.\nAt $42,000 we'll be able to bring on even more Creators to create content for the Wildsea! We'll announce if we get here, but preliminary discussions have included an appendix on gardening, and ventures deep into the undiscovered waves...\nAt $45,000 we'll be able to raise the rates of our artists yet again and commission more artwork for the final book. Perhaps we might even be able to include an illustrated Chart or three...\n At $50,000 we'll be able to produce a fully realized actual play of the Wildsea for your viewing enjoyment! This may include partnering with an existing show or perhaps striking out on our own. Details to come if we get here! \nAt $55,000 we'll be able to add a set of ship creation options, unique hazards and Firefly guidance based around the ideas of exploring the upper skies and lower branches. Now we just have to work out what to call a submarine... \nAt $60,000 we'll set aside a portion of the funds to subsidize the shipping fees for the project. This will hopefully enable us to lower shipping rates by $1-2 dollars per package, depending on a number of factors. Internally, what this means is that no matter what we will allocate a portion of our funds raised to shipping costs, which we'll then pass the savings unto you when it comes time to charge and fulfill via Backerkit.\nAt $65,000 we're going to pay Wildsea creator and designer Felix Isaacs more! The majority of funds raised from  the last stretch goal to this one will go directly to Felix in addition to his overall cut of the campaign and future sales.\nAt $70,000 we'll be able to raise the per word rate of the various designers and writers we are bringing on board to the Wildsea (which I promise we'll announce soon in a future update). Freelance game design is not exactly a lucrative profession but we're committed to building a bigger tent and providing opportunities to others when and where  we can.\nAt $75,000 we'll be able to design and manufacture a set of custom  wooden Wildsea Dice which will be available to purchase as an Add-On via BackerKit. This is something we wanted to have ready for the start of the campaign but alas simply ran out of time. Nonetheless, reaching this tier will give us the resources to begin the process of making these dice in earnest.\nHandcrafted dice from Might Dog Games. Now available as add-ons.\nAt $85,000 we'll include the last content update for the core book: The Farthest Reaches. Consider this an expansion of the Arconautics chapter already unlocked detailing the furthest corners of the Wildsea. More obscure content, to be announced if we get here!\n\nFinally, our ultimate goal at $100,000 will allow us to lower shipping rates yet again, reducing the rates by another $1-2 per package. In the interim, the funds raised to get this tier will allow us to pay the principles of the project just that little bit more :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a production Kickstarter, the primary risk is that the book still needs to be created in full before printing and distribution can begin. For that reason we typically like to run print Kickstarters where the product is already completed instead, but sometimes that's not possible when launching a new and amazing project like the Wildsea! \n\nRay and Vince bring over six years and 13 projects worth of crowdfunding experience into this campaign. We know how to produce beautiful books and communicate with our backers and fans on every step of the process. We strive to have 100% satisfaction guaranteed when it comes our projects - ask our past backers about their experience! \n\nWe gave ourselves a wide breadth for the campaign - almost a full year - but should we meet and exceed our goals, we will use that time to build a better world filled with gorgeous art and a handsome book you'll be proud to have on your shelves. There is always the possibility that things may be delayed further. We will do our best to deliver in a timely matter while maintaining transparency and striving always for the highest quality work possible.\n\nShipping is another major uncertainty heading into the year 2021. The state of global politics means that things like postal rates and customs and tariffs are in a constant state of flux. Brexit and the USA/China trade war may impact the printing and manufacturing of the Wildsea in ways we cannot foresee. Nonetheless, we will do our best to navigate these uncharted waters, just as we have done for the past four years. \n\nBacking this project means you're not only buying the book, but helping produce the work to make it real. For that we can't thank you enough. Together, we'll build something amazing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "HARDSHIP TIER", "descp": "A single copy of the Wildsea: RPG Digital PDF at a reduced price for those experiencing financial hardship.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Wildsea RPG [Digital PDF]\nStretch Goal Bonuses [Book Upgrades]", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}], "stat": ["458 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "DIGITAL COLLECTION", "descp": "A single copy of the Wildsea: RPG Digital PDF.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Wildsea RPG [Digital PDF]\nStretch Goal Bonuses [Book Upgrades]", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["509 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "PRINT EDITION", "descp": "A single copy of the physical edition of the Wildsea: RPG.

For years, fans have praised both the game\u2019s effortless explanation of the Powered by the Apocalypse engine and the groundbreaking content on race and urban communities, leading Urban Shadows to be a favorite of urban fantasy gamers, podcasters, and streamers alike.\nNow\u2014more than six years later\u2014we are returning to the dark streets of the city for Urban Shadows: Second Edition, updating the game\u2019s rules, look, and tools to better support moving stories of political urban fantasy. Featuring new playbooks, new faction mechanics, and completely revised materials from first edition, Urban Shadows 2E will thrust you into the danger and drama of the city like never before!\nUrban Shadows is a political urban fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in which mortals and supernaturals alike vie for power in a modern-day city. Vampires, faeries, hunters, wizards, and more clash in the shadows...or make backroom deals for their piece of the streets and skyscrapers. No one is ever safe, and everything is always at stake.\nIn Urban Shadows, you play unique and powerful archetypes, protagonists who are attuned to the supernatural world. While the mortal world remains ignorant of the struggles of the city\u2019s supernatural denizens, you are caught in the middle of the physical conflicts and political drama of the city\u2019s past, present, and future.\nYou might be a spectre bound to an artifact, unable to move on until you\u2019ve resolved your trauma. Or you might be a clever vampire who controls the best blood supply in the city, caught up in a war between your kind and those who hunt you. Or you might be a veteran of your city\u2019s ancient conflicts, someone who got out of the game but keeps getting drawn back in by friends and allies.\nNo matter who you are, you contain within you the power to shape the city\u2019s destiny. What future will you choose? And what will your victories cost you?\nUrban Shadows is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, and many of Magpie Games\u2019s own titles such as Masks: A New Generation, Root: The RPG, and Zombie World. The game uses the core framework of that system to provide a strong, simple way to create your own stories of political urban fantasy. You\u2019ll create a character using one of several archetypes, and then you\u2019ll take action, rolling two six-sided dice to resolve the outcomes of dangerous and difficult situations.\nUrban Shadows creates stories like those you\u2019d find in Constantine, Diableros, The Dresden Files, The John Wick franchise, The Last Witchhunter, Lost Girl, and The Wire. \nIn Urban Shadows, the city is a living, breathing character all its own. It hides dark desires, wicked deeds, and devious schemes, its shadowy tendrils a danger to mortals and supernaturals alike. Some residents have sacred sanctums or secure workshops\u2014places to weather the storms of the city\u2014but a sprawling metropolis lies just outside those little nooks, caring little if you prosper\u2026or bleed out in the gutters.\nBut nobody faces the city alone. Even the humblest of imps has a small community, a circle of those who can offer solace in the face of problems and danger. But community is a double-edged sword\u2014demanding as much as it gives\u2014and the needs and desires of those same circles constantly shape and reshape the vibrant urban landscape of the city. Nothing lasts forever, but the city turns over nearly every night, different forces laying different claims to you and yours.\nThe city hungers. Will you sate its gnawing desires? Or will your enemies make you the feast?\nThe schemes and plots of supernatural beings have been a part of the city for as long as anyone can remember. The faces at the top may shift and change with the tides of fortune, but rarely does something occur in the mortal world without some push from those who lurk in the shadows. A new subway system? A contested election? A bank robbery? Nothing is what it seems.\nBut what is mere money or prestige to wizards, ghosts, and faeries? Who cares about cash or elections when trafficking in human souls or exploring other dimensions? The supernatural forces of the city\u2014and the mortals who deal with them\u2014know only one real currency: debt.\nDebt is the power to influence those who owe you, the chits you call in to get things done, the ties that bind you to the rest of the city, and the proof that your word is strong and your bonds unbreakable. There are few true friends in the city, but your debtors always want to see you survive\u2014you can\u2019t pay up if you\u2019re dead.\nBut there are other ways to triumph in the city beyond the economy of favors and patronage. Cruel rituals. Dark secrets. The temptations of the monster within you. Those who seek power at any cost will find no end to the magics and mysteries available for the merest price of a soul.\nThe streets bleed shadows\u2014your debtors always around the corner\u2014as the city threatens to swallow you whole. Will you die a hero\u2026 or live long enough to become the villain? Will you fight the darkness\u2026or beg for power? The choice is yours.\nOver the past five years, Magpie Games has developed and created multiple games that broke boundaries and redefined what PbtA can do. Now, we think it\u2019s time to apply the lessons we\u2019ve learned to Urban Shadows, making a game that\u2019s tighter and easier to run, but also filled with new ideas and improvements, including new tools for players and GMs. We\u2019re also excited to create a beautiful new book with visionary art and fantastic graphic design. In short\u2026 we\u2019re making Urban Shadows 2E because we\u2019re thrilled to revisit and refine our work!\nHere\u2019s a quick list of the major changes, many of which are already available in the quickstart:\nrevised basic moves, including new versions of turn to violence and let it out \nrevised playbooks, including rebuilt versions of The Hunter and The Oracle \ntwo brand new playbooks: The Sworn (Power) and The Imp (Wild) \nchanging Factions to Circles\u2014see below\u2014and adding Circle Status to represent standing\na new downtime phase of the game focused on player-facing city moves and rumors\nreplacing Storms with a new MC-facing faction turn, including new faction moves\nexpanded MC tools for generating your city and Circles at the start of play\nWe\u2019re also adding a new mechanic to bring PCs into contact more often with each other: City Hubs. Cities are enormous spaces, and we found (in US1E) player characters could sometimes retreat to their different corners of the cityscape, interacting only with their own worlds and not with each other. With City Hubs, we want to create smaller, expandable environments to focus play and create drama. These Hubs\u2014described below\u2014position characters in neighborhoods, institutions, and community spaces in which they interact more frequently and avoid sessions in which PCs rarely come into contact and conflict.\nDownload the quickstart for a chance to test out some of these new features! We\u2019ll be previewing more of them during the campaign, and we\u2019re excited to get your feedback and refine Urban Shadows even more. Thank you to everyone who has given us feedback on 1st Edition since 2015!\n In Urban Shadows, your characters juggle relationships and obligations, seeking allies and opportunities, cashing in debts along the way to get things done. When you seize the day, you reshape the city in your image and unleash your powers on those who stand against you; when your enemies move and hunt, you do your best to stay ahead of the oncoming storm.\nUrban Shadows uses the Powered by the Apocalypse framework to resolve interesting moments of uncertainty through moves, bits of mechanics that say: \u201cWhen you do [x], [y] happens.\u201d Each move trigger\u2014the \u201cWhen you do [x]\u201d part\u2014is designed to help point at moments of uncertainty, when neither the players nor the GM know exactly what happens next. Some examples of such moments include:\nWhen you throw a punch at a loudmouthed werewolf in a demonic club\nWhen you plead with the wizard\u2019s council to return a tome of magic stolen from you\nWhen you try to escape the evil ritual you stumbled onto in the city\u2019s sewers\nWhen you ask one of your companions to forgive the debt your fae lover owes them\nWhen you trigger a move\u2014when you perform the action described in the move\u2019s trigger\u2014then the rest of the move kicks into effect, often requiring a die roll. You roll 2d6 (two six-sided dice) and add in one of your stats to find out what happens.\nEvery playbook has four stats: \n Blood is the measure of your fight or flight instincts. It tells us how tough, dangerous, coiled, and quick to act your character is in a perilous situation.\n Heart is the sum of your passion, charm, and charisma. It tells us how proficient your character is at getting what they want through negotiation and persuasion.\n Mind is a reflection of your critical thinking and analysis. It tells us how perceptive your character can be and how good they are at manipulating others through deceit.\n Spirit is a gauge of your connection to the \u201cother\u201d and your force of will. It tells us how focused your character is under pressure and what kind of power they can unleash.\nEach stat is ranked from -3 to +3. You add your stat to some rolls when you trigger certain moves. For example, when you turn to violence, you roll 2d6 + Blood.\nOn most moves, if you get a 10 or higher (10+), things go your way! If you get a 7-9, you get what you were after, but usually with some cost or complication. If you get a 6 or lower, that\u2019s called a miss, and the GM gets to tell you what happens next as things spiral out of control. \nUrban Shadows has basic moves for all the usual conflicts in urban fantasy\u2014fighting, lying, escaping, magic, and more\u2014along with special moves for managing debts and your relationships with communities at large.  \nThe city is a fierce cesspool of politics and corruption, but there are clear connections and boundaries between like-minded residents, spheres of influence that make up the scope of politics within the city. Most call these divisions Circles, loose political groupings that illustrate the differing affiliations and loyalties in the world, each one a community with its own internal politics and dramas. The Circles are:\nIn addition to the main stats, each character also has ratings (from -3 to +3) for their Circles, measures of how well the character understands each specific community. A character with a high rating in a Circle has contacts and connections within it, and can easily interpret its political information; a character with a low rating in a Circle doesn\u2019t understand how that Circle works or who the power players are within that community.\nCircles aren\u2019t organizations or formal alliances; they are more like broad communities or subcultures. The disagreement between two members of the same Circle may be as\u2014or more\u2014intense than any conflict between two differing spheres. A werewolf and a vampire both hail from Night, but that doesn\u2019t mean they get along. It only means they understand each other...and the violence inherent in the language of their streets.\nYet there are factions within each Circle capable of acting in unison, alliances who can shape the city\u2019s future\u2014werewolf packs, witch covens, faerie courts, and more. In Urban Shadows: Second Edition, we\u2019re giving GMs new tools to support those factions in a \u201cfaction turn\u201d between sessions. We\u2019re also giving players new tools to get stuff done in downtime, acting on the rumors they heard about what the factions have done in the past week or two of offscreen activity, all fueling the drama of the city and the power players have to shape the setting.\nUrban Shadows uses archetypes (The Wolf, The Wizard, The Oracle, etc.) to help players create characters quickly and easily. These archetypes are only ever a starting point; you can always bring in different myths, legends, and ideas to make your character entirely your own.\nCharacters often acquire abilities and powers from other archetypes and may even change archetypes over the course of play. As your character advances, you may also find reasons to retire to safety, securing that character\u2019s place in the city as you create a new character to continue your group's story.  \nAbsolute power...corrupts absolutely. Urban Shadows features a dynamic corruption mechanic, tracking your character's descent into darkness. When you take a life, give in to your monstrous nature, or cross a line you shouldn't cross, you mark corruption. As you gain corruption, you unlock new and potent powers, allowing your character to get what they want\u2014at the cost of further corruption. The dark side of your nature bears productive fruit.\nPower is never free, though. Cross the line too often and you lose your character to the darkness, handing them over to the GM for them to play as a threat. Corruption is a downward spiral threatening to push you over the edge, and not everyone is cut out to make it back from the brink. As your character gains new abilities fueled by the growing darkness within, you face a difficult choice: will you give up what you've gained to save yourself? \nCorruption also encourages you to play to your archetype. Each archetype contains unique boundaries and taboos that define when you mark corruption. Life is always sacred, but werewolves, mages, and faeries all face unique temptations while stalking the city's streets.\nCities are giant, complex networks of interconnected communities caught in an almost constant state of change. In order to focus your characters\u2019 conflicts and provide reasons for the players to consistently play together across those spaces, Urban Shadows 2E uses City Hubs\u2014dynamic sections of urban life that frame the story you\u2019re telling together without cutting you off from the rest of the city\u2019s potential.\nA City Hub isn\u2019t just a physical district or area of your city. Instead, each Hub is a collection of institutions, relationships, and anchors\u2014important NPCs\u2014that create a background for the action in your story. Even better, Hubs can be added over the length of a campaign, expanding the city with new locations, conflicts, and NPCs as your story progresses. \nUrban Shadows 2E features four City Hubs, each dominated by one of the four Circles:\nCity Hall (Mortalis)\nDowntown (Night)\nThe University (Power)\nThe Arts District (Wild)\nPerhaps your Tainted is a student at the local university, the same campus that lies within the Wolf\u2019s territory...and the same institution at which the Wizard recently started working as a professor. Or maybe your Oracle has an occult bookstore downtown in the same office building in which the Sworn is regularly summoned to meet with the wizard\u2019s council, just down the street from the family restaurant in which the Aware still waits tables.\nHubs are also a flexible tool for structuring your campaign as a whole. You can use two different Hubs set in the same city for different campaigns, you can grab elements from any Hub to use as inspiration for your campaign, or you can expand your campaign to include new Hubs as your city grows. We\u2019ll release new Hubs through this campaign as stretch goals and as digital supplements after the Kickstarter.\nPeople have been playing Urban Shadows since 2013, and we love the stories they\u2019ve told during that time.

After the Kickstarter is over, we will use Backerkit to collect address information, handle add-ons and pre-orders, and charge you for shipping. The pledge manager will also allow backers to upgrade their pledge after the campaign is closed.\nWe expect basic shipping for the US2E Corebook to be roughly $10 US Domestic / $15 International Reshippers (CA/EU/UK/AU) / $20 Rest of World. Shipping for add-ons and physical stretch goals will raise the price for shipping an additional $5-$10, depending on the number and weight of the additional items. Our current plan is to ship everything\u2014the core game, all add-ons, all stretch goals\u2014in a single shipment.\nAll basic shipping is US/EU/CA/UK/AU-friendly. We will cover the cost of customs and VAT for those regions, and our reshippers will ensure that you receive the book from a local address within the region. Basic international shipping will not include tracking numbers, but our reshippers are quite fast at delivery!\nIf you are interested in upgrading to faster shipping or shipping that includes international tracking information through FedEx or DHL, you can indicate that you would like \"Advanced Shipping\" in our pledge manager. Upgraded shipping is likely to incur customs and VAT charges.\nRetail shipping for this campaign is free. You will not be charged for shipping if you pledge at a retail tier, even if you are an international backer. Instead, we\u2019ll cover the shipping as a thank you for supporting our work. We know operating a retail store is hard work even in the best of times, and we appreciate you all a ton!\nAll PDF products will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG. We will deliver coupon codes for you to add Urban Shadows 2E to your library via Backerkit digital downloads.

Pursuing power, prestige, and enlightenment - humanity is struggling to find a new place and purpose in a vast and unfamiliar cosmos. Players can focus on the personal struggles and stories of their characters or expand their scope putting emphasis on the fate of humanity as a species and the part they play in this.\nThe princely envoy leans over the gently swaying railing of the massive vessel, his gaze taking in the bustling Dhaarese docks hazily bathed in the dwindling light of the setting second sun of Llyhn.\nA faint sense of contempt and annoyance emanates from his posture as his eyes swerve towards the opposite shore and distant Khameeliyah district. The ruined tower, barely visible among the palaces and villas, is a stark reminder of the envoy\u2019s last visit to the city of the Unseen Rulers.\nSuddenly distracted from its musings by a putrid stink oozing from the nearby island district - known locally as Kimah - the majestic figure lifts an intricately woven and embroidered shawl to cover its delicate features as it turns toward the waiting Je\u2019ehl posse. \u201cFind them or risk your master\u2019s ire!\u201d\nThe envoy\u2019s gaze turns back to Dhaarese as the Je\u2019ehl leap into the waiting dinghies. \u201cIt\u2019s time to hunt humans again\u201d shouts the leader, securing her three-bladed dagger to her hip, \u201c\u2026and remember, we need them alive!\u201d\n\"Black Void: Under Nebulous Skies\" is the eagerly-anticipated sourcebook and campaign for the Black Void role-playing game. \nPacked with new setting material, new character options including playable halfblood selections, and the first part of the grand campaign trilogy; this book is a must-have for Black Void fans.\nThe book's 250+ pages will have abundant beautiful art, detailing new creatures, sentient species, maps, a deep-dive into the Kimah and Dhaarese districts, intriguing NPC's and much, much more.\nDivided into three main sections, this book has something for everyone! An exciting player's options section, a comprehensive travelogue and the first part of the Grand Campaign Trilogy, that will be continued in future volumes.\n\nCrammed with new options for character creation, the Players option is a treasure trove for players and Arbiters alike.\nSeveral new Talents, Skills and Attributes give players a wider selection for character individualisation than ever before. While new halfblood background options such as Talath-kin and Je'ehl-kin now enable players to access and connect with some of the predominant species of the Eternal City.\n\nThe new Attributes allow players to make their characters even more otherworldly and exotic than before, with such options as Symbiotic bond or detachable limbs.\nVarious novel Esoteric Attributes such as translucence allow players and Arbiters to create truly alien characters and NPC's to populate their adventures.\nTen new exotic weapons, such as the Suwayyah dagger, make combat even more interesting (and deadly) than ever before.\nNew Combat specialisations give battle-oriented characters a more comprehensive range of possibilities to employ than ever before.\nA deeper look into travelling the Void, as well as the vessels and crews, give Arbiters and players further possibilities for exploring the worlds beyond Llyhn. \nA comprehensive list of Void vessels, crew options, and vessel upgrades enables players and Arbiters to build their own Void vessels for expeditions into the oblivious depths.\nThis section is an in-depth guide, detailing two of the most exhilarating districts of Llyhn the Eternal: Kimah and Dhaarese.\nImmerse yourself in the perilous underworld of the Kimah district, where thugs and goons hang on every corner, doom-spouting prophets vie for your soul and beggars grasp for your purse. Visit a multitude of enticing and unnerving hidden dives, where shady patrons know secrets best kept in the dark. And peruse the plazas and obscure shops peddling junk, contraband, and filched goods, with the occasional hidden treasure amongst the rubbish.\nThe Dhaarese district is \u2013 in the eyes of some \u2013 the life-nerve of the Eternal City. It is here that the bulk of the massive Red Galleys and other prominent Void vessels put into port. Ships from across the known Cosmos unload their cargoes of rare and exotic substances, objects, and artefacts from faraway worlds while the otherworldly crew bring tales of distant lands, wonders and horrors.\nThe chapter provides a comprehensive look into locations such as the Feeradani enclave, The midnight market, Beggars Court, the Wharves, and many other places. While notable personages, prevalent factions, maps, building layouts provide everything you need to bring the meanest districts of Llyhn to life.\n\u201cThe distant thunder is barely audible over the pouring rain as you move to stand solemnly amongst the gathered mourners. A simple litter holding the shrouded body rests nearby next to a shallow hole and a heap of piled mud and clay. The downpour has soaked the linen covering the body, showing her sunken features, and smearing the funerary cosmetics unto the cloth, giving it the eerie semblance of a skull.\u201d\n- Introduction to \"Under Nebulous Skies: Scene 1\".\n\"Under Nebulous Skies\" is the first part of a Grand campaign trilogy, continued in future releases. The campaign is intended for newly created characters with an engaging storyline taking the protagonists on a harrowing and wondrous journey into the depths of Llyhn, and beyond the Eternal City. \nTrue to form, this Black Void adventure allows players to employ their diplomacy, stealth, combat skills, social proclivities, powers, and any other desperate means as they seek to unravel the mystery thrust upon them and confront the horrors and cruelty lurking under the surface of Llyhn and in the Cosmos at large.\nThe characters can explore multiple locations in Kimah and Dhaarese, interacting with a vast and colourful NPC gallery as the story takes them deep into Llyhn, and later to a Ka\u2019Alum federation world and beyond as they seek to uncover the ominous aspirations of a shadowy perpetrator with its gaze set firmly on the descendants of Earth.\nThe global logistics and trade situation is fluctuating and it is difficult to predict shipping costs for when we begin fulfilment in 2021. However, we are committed to getting the physical books as cheaply and efficiently into your hands as possible and are partnering with a trusted logistical company to do so.\nShipping will be charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign is over based on your pledge and selected physical add-ons (if any).\nThe below are estimated regional shipping costs based on current rates for a single Black Void: Under Nebulous Skies (hardback) copy.\nEU \u2248 $16  |  UK \u2248 $13  |  US \u2248 $20  |  RoW \u2248 $20+\nIf you are intrigued but want to know more before diving in, you can download the FREE Quickstart and accompanying adventure.\nIf you want to grab the Core Rulebook or another Black Void product while you are at it, there is a 15% DISCOUNT on all Black Void adventures, screens, dice, and so on for the entirety of the Kickstarter campaign on the MODIPHIUS WEB SHOP and DRIVETHRURPG.COM", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBlack Void: Under Nebulous Skies is currently 60% written and edited, with significant amounts of artwork either done or WIP.

As they get closer and closer to the location's heart, it does everything it can to tear them apart, drive them mad, and\u2014if they\u2019re lucky\u2014kill them. It's a fantastic one-shot game which has seen great success through its recent Kickstarter and vibrant community of players and writers. Trophy Dark  creates a deeply atmospheric story through its narrative, theme-oriented structure and collaborative format.\nWhat is Alchemy? \nAlchemy will be an offset-printed, smythe-sewn, casebound book containing 9 brand-new incursions for Trophy Dark. Each never-before-seen scenario will allow you and your friends to take on the roles of desperate adventurers, pressing their luck in search of treasure and ultimately meeting their doom! The rules for Trophy Dark  will be included in Alchemy, so you do not need any other materials to play.\nCover concept (design not final)\nThe Incursions\nAL-IKSIR by Nicholas Masyk - Every 1,001 nights, the decaying lich-lords of the blighted city of Shi'Hadith descend from their hideous ziggurats to claim the AL-IKSIR, a bubbling cauldron of distilled souls brewed by faceless servitors in the festering heart of the ancient city. Only through the AL-IKSIR can they maintain their un-life for a further 1,001 nights. Only through grudging cooperation can they slither beneath the watchful eyes of those citizen-sorcerers who seek to claim lichdom for themselves. But there is scarcely enough AL-IKSIR to sustain even a single lich, and so only the most cunning might attain the ultimate goal of immortal life...\nBLACK STAR BOLT by Speak the Sky - DEATH RACE ON A DEAD PLANET UNDER FURIOUS STAR SPEWING DARKNESS. ORGY OF VEHICULAR VIOLENCE. WHAT GORGEOUS ALCHEMY MAKES FIRE AND LIGHTNING OF CRUDE & SAINTS AND HEROES OF KILLERS? DON'T ANSWER THAT LET'S DIE NOW! TOTAL CATASTROPHONY!\nCity of Gold by Amalie McKee - People you thought lost to the desert have been returning to your town of ne'er-do-wells with ears of gold and stories of angels. If you can retrace their steps and meet these angels yourself, you could return to society a wealthy hero, though you might sacrifice your humanity along the way.\nDIE, GRAVE ROBBER, DIE! by Michael Van Vleet - Resurrectionists have wrenched a corpse from out of the sacred soil where it was to find eternal rest. Crawl through rat-filled tunnels, wander among horrifying medical exhibits and storm the Flayed House of Dr. Galfani to get a mourning family their beloved relation back!\nLovelorn Lamentations by Pam Punzalan - The misery, rage, and mourning over love unrequited transformed a once cursed Princess into a feathered Lady of Tears. They say she was killed by the other gods already, and that the empty halls of her palatial home hold wonders that surpass human comprehension. Yet, all who have entered the place don't emerge the same, if they even emerge at all.\nillustration by RAPIDPUNCHES\nSusurrae by Madeleine Ember - Peel back the layers of self along this strange journey into the ruined St. Rheis Monastery, below it to the crypt-rot catacombs, and finally to the caverns of sight beyond seeing. What the treasure-hunters seek is truth - answers to the questions that will otherwise destroy them. Learning the truth can be dangerous.\nThe Dark Ascent by Natalie Ash - One day a year, the entrance to Mount Rames and the Path of Ascent is open. Within its halls, you and your fellow aspirants can gain ultimate power! But at what price?\nIncursions will feature fantastic illustrations (like this one from RAPIDPUNCHES)\nThe Queen of Swords, A Crown of Blades by Jamila R.

Why? Well, because we wanted a simple name that expressed the idea of a container for possibility. There are all kinds of ariums in our daily lives: aquariums, solariums, planetariums-- we looked up the Latin root, and it felt perfect!\nWe like to think of it like this: an Arium is an overarching world, universe, setting, and story/adventure seeds. It contains a collection of fascinating landmarks, people, and items too!\nArium is our answer to a simple question: why play in someone else's sandbox when the whole group can have a blast creating their own?\nThe Arium roleplaying game system is delivered in two full-color books (PDF or print + PDF). \nBoth Arium books will be available in print and PDF formats (mockup). Cover art by Andreas Rocha.\nArium: Create contains our refreshing and intuitive system for creating your own Arium, and you'll do it in one or two hours! The Arium you create will be unique to your group, and we promise everyone will be in love with it.  Create encourages folks to err on the side of awesome when collaborating to build their Arium, and the result is often surprising, but never disappointing! With a little work, you can take your resulting Arium and use it with any game system, or we've built in a seamless transition to our roleplaying rules found in Arium: Discover. \nInterior Arium: Create Art by Tithi Luadthong\nArium: Discover will work with any world. Take your favorite TV series,  your homebrew setting, or a movie/novel and quickly adapt to run it with Discover. Even better, build an Arium together using Arium: Create as a basis for your game. Arium: Discover builds on your universe by letting players take ownership of characters, items, and locations. Then, it's off to tell the story! Adventure, horror, and comedy are all on the table. Sci-fi, fantasy, and intrigue also possibilities! The streamlined d6-based system will feel familiar yet flexible. Additionally, the system of Boons and Banes encourages play that explores the important and meaningful by focusing on the relevant thematic elements of your Arium.  \nInterior Arium: Discover Art by Tithi Luadthong\nThe funds generated by this campaign will fund the printing of both Arium books. Any additional raised funds will allow us to create further products via stretch goals to enhance the Arium experience.\nArium: Create is complete and set for printing and digital distribution. Backers will receive their PDF copy the day we receive funds from Kickstarter. Discover is ready for editing and layout. Based on the length of the process preparing Create for printing and distribution, we suspect this will take a couple of months. As soon as both books are ready, we will submit the files to the printer and order shipping materials.\nThe physical books are digest-size saddle-stitched zines (5.5\" x 8.5\"). Arium: Create is 48 full-color pages, and Arium: Discover is approximately full-color 48 pages. We're printing them through Mixam using high-quality materials and finishes. Backers get all of this content, assuming we fund, and we have stretch goals in place that will add even more helpful tools to Arium.\nEither way, backers will receive both Create and Discover in PDF only for $8 or in print + PDF for $20!  \nInterior Arium: Discover Art by Tithi Luadthong\nThe Digital Arium\nFor those who prefer all digital, we've got you! Our digital tier includes both Arium: Create and Arium: Discover, so your group has everything they need to create your Arium and play in it. Backers will receive PDF copies of both books, as well as Arium reference materials and character/Arium sheets you can print out for the table or use on a laptop or tablet. Includes:\nArium: Create PDF\nArium: Create Quick Reference PDF\nArium: Create Results Sheet PDF\nArium: Discover PDF\nArium: Discover Quick Reference PDF\nArium: Discover Character Sheet PDF\nThe Physical Arium\nIf you collect paper rectangles or prefer to have a physical copy at your table while playing, we have a treat for you! We're printing Arium: Create and Arium: Discover in two high-quality saddle-stitched zines using Mixam (a US-based printer who uses all reusable materials and recycles everything they don't use). We're printing in full color on satin-finished paper with a soft-touch cover on high-density paper. These books will shine in your collection! Includes:\nPrinted Arium: Create 5.5\" x 8.5\" Saddle-Stitched Book\nPrinted Arium: Discover 5.5\" x 8.5\" Saddle Stitched Book\nArium: Create PDF\nArium: Create Quick Reference PDF\nArium: Create Results Sheet PDF\nArium: Discover PDF\nArium: Discover Quick Reference PDF\nArium: Discover Character Sheet PDF\n\"Arium: Create is a system where everyone at the gaming table has a vested interest in the setting they are creating. I found it easy to learn and use [and] I'm excited to put Arium: Create into greater use as I introduce the complete process to my gaming group.\" -Daniel Yocom Guild Master Gaming\n\"Arium: Create strikes me as a very good tool [...] I\u2019d say that even if I were to run a game in an established setting there are elements here that could be used in a session zero to establish some baselines and really explore what my group of players 'want\u2019 from a game. Indeed, I even think that some groups may find enjoyment from simply taking a session to use Arium: Create for nothing other than to let their imagination take hold.\" -Adam Brown Big Comic Page\nArium: Create is all about creating a world your entire group will love using a series of seven steps: Lacunae, Universal, Big Picture, Culture & Organizations, Landmarks, People, and Goodies. These are the essential elements of your Arium.\nDuring each step, the group works through three phases:\n1. First, they generate ideas. Fast! With a timer. Timing the ideating ensures the ideas aren't TOO perfect, and it keeps the session flowing along.\n2. During the second phase, the group reviews the ideas and combines them for one of two reasons. The first is when the concepts are samey, and the second, when a combination is fantastic and the creators agree their ideas should live or die together in the name of awesome.\n3. In the third and final phase, the group brings democracy to bear and votes for their favorite ideas. In this way, the best ideas remain a part of the Arium, AND they live on to be guiding concepts for the following steps! \nWhat happens if your favorite idea didn't make the cut? No problem! Each player receives three creation tokens they can use to make sure their chosen concept becomes part of the final Arium.\nFinally, we have rules for resolving player selection of People, Goodies, and even Locations to be theirs when the group moves on to roleplay in their fresh new Arium!\n\"I first played the RPG gem Arium: Create in its early stages, prior to its current state of elegance, and I've never laughed so hard nor felt so deeply for a new game. I had goosebumps - and that was before we went on to play the brilliant Discover. This is world-building and world-roaming genius.\"  -R. Jon Rock, tabletop gamer, author, RPG & short fiction editor, mental health nurse, professor, pretty good dude.\nArium: Create is complete and ready for digital delivery and printing.\nSee Arium: Create in action:\nArium: Discover is our D6-based roleplay rules that will feel familiar and play fast for streamlined gaming while enabling your group to explore the unique Arium they've created. In our skillless system, characters have four primary attributes: Mind, Body, Spirit, and Heart. The six secondary attributes are all derived from the primaries. They are Offense, Defense, Social, Willpower, Awareness, and Stamina.\nThe final and most crucial part of character creation is the process of assigning powerful Boons and Banes that bring your character to life and give them depth.\nLast, it wouldn't be Arium if we didn't have a little something up our sleeves to help players progress and effect the Arium around them. Everyone receives Discovery Tokens that enable them to add to the Arium and help the group along the way.\nArium: Discover is in final revisions before heading off to editing and layout. We expect to be ready to print by the end of 2020.\nSee Arium: Discover in action:\nSession 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ_Hc3dzDUs\nSession 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhJtw8PRhk\nSession 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jpHUzh4lyE\nWe do have stretch goals planned if we fund! Here's the great news about them: All backers at The Digital Arium pledge level and above get every stretch goal we reach. So please help us spread the word about Arium, and everyone wins! \n Arium: Flash, will be a guide to adapting an Arium to different types of plots for quick game sessions. Our talented stretch goal authors will each provide five story seeds within a theme or genre that you can use to jumpstart your story. At this level, we will add two new special guest authors: Jessica Marcrum and Jason H. Abbott. They will be contributing story seeds that evoke cute fantasy/horror and gonzo themes (respectively)!\nArium: Flash will be a free digital reward for all Digital Arium and higher backers.\nArium: Flash, will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Emmett Nahil and Kristen Devine. Emmett's themes will be post-apocalyptic, and Kristen's will be a mix of fantasy/sci-fi!\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Marlon Moss and Steffie de Vaan. Marlon is going to help us with modular plots for hard-boiled neo-noir Ariums, and Steffie will help groups who want to creep into gothic horror!\nArium: Bridge will be a guide to adapting an Arium to use with other RPG systems. Alan Bahr will create Bridges to 5e, Fate, and TinyD6.\nArium: Bridge will be a free digital reward for all Digital Arium and higher backers.\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Cat Evans and Mario Orteg\u00f3n. Cat will bring us high fantasy plots, and Mario is going to deliver sci-fi with a neat twist!\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from THREE new special guest authors: Chris Bissette, Lynne M. Meyer, and Katie Young. Chris comes to us with inspiration for stories of fae-folklore, Lynne is tackling swashbuckling themes, and Katie will work the western angle!\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Doug Levandowski and Arietta. Doug is going to give us an absurdist bent on victorian gothic, and Arietta is going to deliver a key element for some games, romance! \nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Pam Punzalan and Mitchell Wallace. We're hoping Pam will sneak in some spy/ops themes, and Mitchell will apply his wit to dark humor with a touch of horror!\nWe can't stress enough how much we love our gorgeous cover art! We hope you agree that this art is worth every penny.\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Ezzy Languzzi and R. Jon Rock. Ezzy will be bringing us the darker take on fantasy themes, while Rock is giving us his take on psychological thriller/crime stories. \nNo one likes errors and poorly worded sentences and insensitive writing. Adept Icarus is committed to doing the right thing by all of our players. Editing and sensitivity reads are an important part of that!\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Dan Wells and Emily Earhart. Dan's going to be taking on one of our favorites: cyberpunk! Meanwhile, Emily is going to bring us medieval/Arthurian story seeds... another Adept Icarus favorite. We're sure you won't be disappointed!\nThese are the folks who make it pretty. Otherwise, y'all would just be looking at a bunch of words. Ew. We appreciate them more than we can say!\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Sharang Biswas will join the team and write story seeds around the theme of heists! Second is Yvonne Hsiao (Sen H.H.S.) writing on the theme of Chinese Mythology!\nThat's right, we're doing it again! Arium: Flash will now include story seeds from THREE new guest authors: Mikhail Rekun will join the team and write story seeds around the theme of Eastern European Folklore!  Drew Gerken, one of the core Arium writers, is writing Supers/Mutants, and Horror author Caryn Larrinaga is contributing Modern Horror!\nThe one and only Diogo Nogueira will apply his skill for rules and toolkit design to one of the stickier parts of Arium character creation: creating your Boons and Banes.\nBeen following along with #OurAriumOurWay, and want to see even more from it? The splendid Elizabeth Chaipraditkul will write a complete adventure in this community-created Arium!\nArium: Evolve is the third major chapter of Arium that our team has been dreaming about since the beginning. It will include modular downtime rules for evolving and shaping your Arium between sessions. Evolve will help you keep your Arium fresh and exciting. This planned third core book will have a beautiful cover by Andreas Rocha. We don't plan to release Evolve until well into 2021 but thought we'd give our backers should we meet this lofty goal.\nArium: Evolve will be a free digital reward for all Digital Arium and higher backers.\n\n\n\nWill Munn - Lead Designer/Publisher - @WLMunn - Will is the owner of Adept Icarus.

Adrift between stars after an engine failure, your ship was attacked by a hostile alien lifeform. The crew are dead.\nYou thought you had won. You launched the creature out of an airlock, and that should have meant safety.\nIt didn\u2019t.\nThe Wretched\nThe Wretched is a solo journaling/roleplaying game played with a deck of cards, a tumbling block tower, and a microphone.\nThe Wretched is a game about human resilience in the face of overwhelming odds and almost certain death. It is a game about isolation, fear, and perseverance.\nYou play a lone survivor of an horrific attack. You have seen and done terrible things, you have seen your friends - your found family - brutally butchered by something you can\u2019t even begin to comprehend, something that you were sure didn\u2019t exist until it manifested itself aboard your ship.\nYou are existing on the edges of your endurance, high on adrenaline and fear and desperation. You are sure you won\u2019t survive this, but all you know to do is to keep fighting.\nThe Wretched is inspired by the music of John Carpenter and Nine Inch Nails, as well as You Are Not Alone In This Life and you will die alone out here in the black by Auden Roswell.\nThe Zine\nThe game was originally released in April 2020 with an initial print run of 25 that sold out almost immediately. Since then I've received multiple requests to reprint it, and now I'm turning to Kickstarter to make that happen.\nThe Wretched will be printed on 130 gsm silk paper with a sturdy 250 gsm recycled paper cover. This new print run has a new wraparound cover, an updated layout, and some quality-of-life updates to the text (including a new section covering safety tools). Printing will be handled by Mixam UK.\nMockup of the new zine. The new layout and cover are finalised.\nMockup of the zine showing the new layout.\nThese are mockups of the new zine. The new layout and cover are finalised - all this campaign will be funding is the print run! \nStretch Goals\nYou want stretch goals? We've got stretch goals!\nGoal number 1 is unlocked and I'll be writing more music for the soundtrack - including an exclusive track just for Kickstarter backers.\nGoal number 2 is unlocked and you can now order the Wretched logo on t-shirts!\nGoal number 3 is unlocked and I'll be writing even more music and pressing it on vinyl. These extra tracks will be exclusive to backers.\nGoal number 4 gets a foil stamped cover. Mixam requires a minimum order of 1000 copies for this, so I'm setting a stretch goal of 800 backers at a physical zine level to make this happen!\nI'm using Monster Press in the UK to print the t-shirts. I've worked with them several times in the past to produce my band's merch and know their quality and processes. Shirts will be a single colour print on Gildan Heavy.\nDigital mock-up of the soundtrack vinyl. Final appearance subject to change.\n The Kickstarter-exclusive soundtrack will be pressed on a 110g 10\" disc with printed labels and a 10\" 300gsm printed outer sleeve. Manufacturing will be handled by DMS, a UK-based manufacturer and supplier of vinyl records with an excellent track record of producing quality work.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the writing is already done (the game was released in April along with the soundtrack). The new layout and cover have been finished already, and I've priced everything up with Mixam. Since ZineQuest in February I've printed 6 games with Mixam and fulfilled them all myself, so my process with both the printer and shipping out zines is fairly well-oiled at this point.\n\nObviously unforeseen events could still occur. Last time I ran a Kickstarter, COVID happened right as the campaign ended. But most risk should be minimised here - all I need to do once Kickstarter deposits the money is send out the digital files, upload the zine to Mixam, and get them shipped out to you! Even though this should be very quick, I've given an estimate of December for fulfillment.

Then imagine a lone space station, floating in the cosmos, that is somehow set apart from this conflict.\nThrough significant effort and fortuitous circumstance this place has remained unaffiliated and relatively peaceful, providing a sanctuary for the lovers and thinkers who refuse to side with the two warring powers.\nBut this hard-won neutrality is not secure, not even slightly. There\u2019s always someone offering vital resources in exchange for a little influence, or plotting to displace our leaders, or smuggling military equipment into forgotten corners of the station.\nHolding off these myriad threats is an informal network of dependable sorts, each with a stake in the continuing vitality of the station. These characters; politicos, artisans, brokers and so on, may not be officially recognised leaders\u2014but their influence is felt strongly across the community.\nThey might not get along \u2014 they might not even like each other. But they are united by their belief that the station is a cherished place that must be protected. The question is: when the pressure is rising, can they put their differences & personal motivations aside for the good of the community?\nOrbital\nSo, how does ORBITAL actually play?\nORBITAL employs the No Dice, No Masters system, utilising the core structure & mechanics from the wonderful Dream Askew by Avery Alder. This means two main things:\n There are no dice \u2014players use tokens when they want their characters to take action, making 'moves'. Strong moves, which show the character at their best, require a token to be spent. Weak moves, which show the character's flaws or worst impulses, earn you a token. These tokens help you to weave dramatic arcs for your characters with far more control and simplicity than capricious dice, and make it easy for just about anyone to jump in and start playing.\n There are no masters\u2014each player controls both a character and a share of the role of game master, taking responsibility for all of the NPCs and narrative pressures within one aspect of the setting (for example, THE INTERSTELLAR WAR or THE SCUM & VILLAINY). It's more like you're all taking turns playing the antagonists & introducing complications, rather than playing a game entirely without a GM.\nAlso drawing from Dream Askew, ORBITAL is a game of Belonging Outside Belonging. This means it focuses on stories on marginalised, precarious communities working to live independently from a dominant culture.\nA sneak peek of some of the game's interior art, by turbo.torbo\nLike many of our favourite role-playing games, ORBITAL begins with everyone sitting down to make their characters. You\u2019ll each choose from six CHARACTER ROLES\u2014archetypes that help you create a distinctive main character. You\u2019ll each also choose & personalise one of six SETTING ELEMENTS\u2014aspects of the game world that can introduce challenges and complicate your character\u2019s lives. Filling the two sheets out is quick, fun, and will generate a messy web of story threads to start mulling over.\nFinally, you'll work together to create your STATION. This place, unique to your table, will be a hopeful space that is struggling against pressures both within and without. You'll think about what it looks like, how it's structured, and choose a few things that are frequent sources of strife within the community. You'll also choose one pressing threat \u2014 a perilous event that threatens to light a spark to all the powder built up within your ragtag, turbulent space station.\nAs you start to explore these threats, you\u2019ll ask questions which will lead to scenes between characters, using your various moves to shape the narrative in material, concrete directions. You\u2019ll bargain and gossip, analyse and manage, love and celebrate, struggle and fight, and all the rest.\nUltimately, through play, you\u2019ll decide the fate of your community and the station as equal storytellers in your own unique tale.\nYou can play a satisfying one-shot in 3-4 hours, or play through a series of sessions to explore your station further and further complicate your character's relationships. It can be played with up to 6 players, and also includes rules for playing with a GM and 1-4 players.\nKickstarter\nSo why Kickstarter?\nORBITAL is already mostly written, and I\u2019m deep into playtesting & tweaking all the content within the book. My motivations for bringing the game to Kickstarter are mostly the same as for my previous project, Artefact; so that I can fill it with beautiful art!\nA previous piece by turbo.torbo that inspired me to reach out\nMy collaborator on this project is the wonderful Torben B\u00f6kemeyer, better known as turbo.torbo on socials. He\u2019s got a real knack for sci-fi art - especially spaceships - filling them with life through all these little stories unfolding across the illustrations.\nA sneak peek of some of the game's interior art, by turbo.torbo\n\nAlso like Artefact, I want to fund another high-quality Risograph print run of the zine on premium papers \u2014 which has some minimum quantities required to make it viable. Several of the stretch goals from my last project - namely a larger format, metallic inks and stitched binding - will be part of the funding goal for this project. I can't imagine making the book without them!\nSome RISO print samples from Artefact's production\nFinally, Kickstarter offers a model for my designs that doesn\u2019t threaten to turn a passion into a business. I started going down the road of distribution & managing inventory with Artefact, but I noticed (with some help from my family!) that it was quickly filling my precious spare time with the parts of this endeavour which aren\u2019t much fun for me (emails, contracts, packing, logistics) and leaving no time for design. Also, the economies of Riso encourage you to go in hard on numbers, which would again turn my house into something resembling the big warehouse at the end of Raiders...\nThis all means I have no plans to make physical copies of ORBITAL available through general retail after this campaign. Other than the handful of spares & seconds that I end up with after the campaign, this will be your only chance to get the zine.\nRewards\nFor every backer of this campaign, I\u2019ll make one digital community copy available on itch.io once the game is released. These free copies can be claimed by those who are marginalised / in need. This has been a really successful way of getting Artefact into the hands of those who otherwise wouldn't be able to play it, especially during these volatile times, and I'm keen to replicate that model for ORBITAL.\nSo, with that in mind, here are the rewards you can choose from: \nDigital Edition\nThe digital edition contains a PDF copy of ORBITAL & the sheets you\u2019ll need to run the game, delivered through itch.io. To ensure the best reading experience, three formats of the book will be provided;\nOne formatted for home printing, with economical ink & paper usage in mind.\nOne formatted for screens, with a layout designed for phones & tablets. This version will be screen reader compatible.\nOne formatted for accessibility, with a design optimised for those with dyslexia / low vision / visual processing needs. This version will also be screen reader compatible.\nPhysical Edition\nThe physical edition includes everything from the Digital Edition tier, plus a printed copy of ORBITAL. The printed book will contain all the rules for the game, and an overview of each of the character & setting playbooks. You'll need to print the playkit sheets yourself if you're playing in-person \u2014 these contain the full playbooks that you can circle, write & sketch all over to create your setting.\nThe physical book will be produced with a similar specification to my previous project, Artefact. While the spec is subject to change based on proofs, I expect it to be:\n32 pages, plus cover.\nReduced A5 size (194x135mm)\n GF Smith Colorplan paper cover stock, Imperial Blue\n Paperback Context recycled paper interior stock, Birch.\nRisograph printed inks; metallic gold & white on the cover, risofederal blue & flat gold on the interior.\nSinger-stitched binding, using white thread.\nMy goal with the print specification, as it was for Artefact, is to evoke a \u2019DIY\u2019 zine feel, with uncoated stock and a print process reminiscent of screen-printing. However, unlike most homemade zines, I'm using luxurious papers and rich inks that make the thing feel like a premium object. I was really satisfied with the way the Artefact books turned out, and from the feedback it seems my backers were too. Here\u2019s hoping we can capture that magic a second time!\nFacilitated Session\nIn what might turn out to be the very height of hubris, I'm tentatively offering a few designer-facilitated online sessions of ORBITAL. These would be conducted over video chat with you and your friends, and over 3-4 hours we'd go through character & setting creation and then move into actual play. I'd act as the facilitator, tasked with knowing the rules inside-out (ha!) & helping the group get the most out of the game. I could also, alternatively, take the role of a more traditional GM if that's preferable.\n(I can't promise we won't be interrupted by my toddler, cats, chickens etc, but otherwise I'll do my best to keep things mostly professional...)\nThis tier also includes everything from the Physical Edition tier, with free shipping as a little thank you for indulging me.\n\nShipping\nI'm coordinating with both UK and US-based distributors this time around, as I've got no desire to try and ship out zines with a toddler and a newborn in the house! I talk a little in 'Risks & Challenges' about the challenges of shipping, especially within the US at the moment, but at the moment I expect the cost of shipping to be between \u00a33 and \u00a35 within the UK, and between $9 and $12 internationally. This is a little more than last time, because I don't feel confident sending untracked mail at this time. Hopefully it means you'll get your rewards reliably & swiftly!\nA sneak peek of some of the game's interior art, by turbo.torbo\nDeluxe Editions?\nUnlike Artefact, I won't be offering Deluxe Editions for this project. \nI really wanted to! I had all the stationery picked out & everything. But we're expecting a second baby in just a couple of months, and I know that it's not sensible to commit to such a time-consuming, perfectionist-inducing offering when I\u2019m gonna be trapped underneath a demanding newborn for the forseeable. \nI can\u2019t wait to put together another boxed edition in the future, but I didn\u2019t want to wait for things to settle (an interminable, unknowable concept for any parent!) to launch this project. \nTeam\nEven as a relatively small-scale project, ORBITAL is very much a group effort. Here's who's involved:\n Jack Harrison \u2014 part-time game designer, exhausted parent.\n Torben B\u00f6kemeyer \u2014 a freelance Game Artist, Graphic Designer and Game Dev Generalist from Berlin, Torben is our principal illustrator on the project. He's doing the illustrations for the cover and the interior chapter pages.\n Dizzy Ink \u2014 a print, design and creative workshop studio based in the heart of Nottingham, UK. They specialise in using stencil-based printing processes such as Risograph, mimeograph and screen printing. I worked with their team for the printing of Artefact, and have nothing but good things to say!\n Fiona Maeve Geist & Jarrett Crader \u2014 our diligent, eagle-eyed editors, here to stop me overusing commas, misusing dashes and creating monstrous run-on sentences that should really have stopped quite a long time ago.\n Yubi \u2014 Yubi is a nonbinary TTRPG creator and accessibility consultant who believes in an accessible future for all in tabletop gaming. They will be ensuring the Digital Edition is fully screen reader optimised, as well as creating a second version of designed with a variety of visual needs in mind.\nI'm hopeful this team will grow even bigger if the project goes beyond its initial funding goal!\nSo there we have it \u2014 a fairly simple project for these very complicated times.\nThanks for reading!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe major risks to this project I\u2019ve identified are the resurgence of COVID-19 within the UK (a second wave), and the deteriorating US postage situation (USPS).\n\nThe first, while horrifying, will hopefully not be anything too surprising. Provided my family avoids contracting the illness, lockdown will not be a new experience anymore. The closure of facilities (such as the printer or binding) and delays to domestic post might mean that the project suffers some delays, but it shouldn\u2019t prevent delivery. I\u2019ve included quite a bit of extra time in the delivery estimates to account for this.\n\nThe second is a bit more complicated, as it relies somewhat on predicting the actions of a maniacal autocrat. Royal Mail, who partner with the USPS to deliver mail within the United States, are the only cost-effective option for shipping rewards out to backers. But, as I\u2019m sure many of you are acutely aware of, the USPS are under political attack and are experiencing significant delays processing mail. I don\u2019t know how this situation will wash out, but the worst case scenario is that I won\u2019t be able to use USPS. The main way I\u2019m hoping to mitigate this risk is by working with a US fulfilment provider, rather than shipping individual zines internationally from here. This gives us a lot more flexibility in getting rewards delivered as we can choose the most appropriate services / providers when the time comes. It also, hopefully, means that shipping won\u2019t be too expensive even if we have to go with a private company.\n\nThe other challenge worth mentioning is that we\u2019re expecting a second baby in late October. The plan is to have all the work done before baby arrives, and most of that work is already well underway. However, things don\u2019t always go to plan with new arrivals, so I\u2019d ask for your patience if required. Provided all goes relatively smoothly, though, we\u2019ll have no problems \u2014 most of my games have been written at odd times in the night, or with a napping baby strapped to my front, so this will be nothing new!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is my second project, having successfully delivered my first project - Artefact - over the first half of this year. While I had hoped to beat my estimates, I\u2019m quite proud that despite a global pandemic I managed to deliver almost all of the rewards within my original June estimate. We suffered delays throughout the project due to closures and pressure on international shipping, but my backers were always supportive so long as I kept them informed. Regular updates & a live project tracker on Trello were essential communication tools, and I intend to repeat them this time around. I\u2019ve also made changes (fulfilment partner, no deluxe editions) to ensure I\u2019m not overstretched.

If a lot of people back physical and then switch to digital in the backerkit, how does the cumulative loss of that $4 shipping credit affect the overall net shipping cost for the author?

Use one of the hidden pockets on the back to secure important items such as passports and travel documents.\nAnd it still fits a little extra if you need it!\nDid we mention there\u2019s also a trolley bag?!\nHello dear backers,\nThis is Elizabeth again, back with a new project. I was shocked after my initial launch of the Magellan Vacuum Bags Project here on Kickstarter that amassed over 2000 backers and raised over $70000!\nI just want to tell you all again how thankful I am!\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign was ready, I had a lot of short travels with just my backpack, and I started to wonder if there was a more effective way to travel with just a backpack \u2013 a way to easily organize everything I needed, quickly and conveniently.\nAfter some research on what people often take with them during small flights, I started to experiment with different forms of the backpack that would allow me to pack everything fast enough and organize properly. I wanted to go further than just Vacuum Bags - I wanted to give a solution that would use the backpack space to its\u2019 maximum.\nThat\u2019s what led me to my latest invention in partnership with BrandCharger Ltd. A better solution for short-trip travelers - The Magellan Archiver Backpack.\nI think you\u2019ll find it a huge help on your short trip travels, and I would really appreciate your support to launch my second project and make it a success once again.\nWith your support, you\u2019ll be getting the Magellan's Archiver Backpack fresh off its first batch of mass production. Thank you so much!  \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy team and I have come a long way, and have done a thorough research on every step of production and material quality.

It features simple, freeform mechanics which are easy to internalize, allowing a greater focus on the story, world and experience and less fiddling with complex rules or remembering intricate systems. It also requires no materials to play: no dice, no character sheets, no cards, nothing! This allows a game of Runt to be portable and be played whenever you're in the mood for a game. \nIt's designed for one shots and short campaigns, but there's no reason it can't be used to host long term experiences with either. Additionally it's a genre and setting agnostic system, so you can play whatever experience you want to explore wherever you want it to happen!\n1) Genre Agnostic!\nRunt is designed to enable the Host (the player running the game) to run a game in any setting or genre. Science fiction, fantasy, true crime, romance and anything else you can think of!It aims not to lock the player to a certain style, tone or theme, but rather lay out simple mechanics and mindset which you can utilize to play whatever style of story you want to experience.\n2) Simple Mechanics!\nRunt's conflict resolution mechanics are designed to be simple and intuitive. They can be internalized and executed on quickly, even for new players. It achieves this with a resolution mechanic called \"Challenges\" which allow conflict to occur but doesn't require players to overthink the situation - just resolve the Challenge quickly and flavourfully and move on!\nThis helps everyone not only get into the game quicker, but to avoid the barriers which may come with learning new systems for new worlds to play in. No need to remember rules around firearm ranges, learning the conditions of a spell, figure out who makes a move and when, or other intimidating mechanics required by some roleplaying games.\n3) Material Free Experience!\nThe basic Runt rules requires no additional peripherals to play the game. This means no writing utensils, no character sheets, and no dice. So long as you have one person Hosting a game and a least one other person to to play it, you can play a game of Runt. \nWhile some sort of tracking tool (paper, notes app, etc.) is usually a good idea for keeping track of details over longer campaigns, in many cases it isn't even required!\nThe Runt Guidebook is a 10 page black and white, printable .pdf that contains all the rules players need to know for running a game in the Runt system, such as:\n Consent Systems - an introduction on how to keep Runt fun for everyone\n Character Creation - including rules for equipment and Unique Abilities your character may have\n Rules on \"Challenges\" - a step-by-step walkthrough of Runt's simple resolution mechanic\n \"How To Host\" - a quick primer on how to get in the mindset of Hosting a game in the Runt system\nRunt is already design-complete and tested! It only requires art and a bit of final proofing before it can be sent to you. \nTo that end, I'm partnering with Toronto-based artist Brennan McNamara who is already creating the art to make Runt's pages even more beautiful!\nThe funding from this campaign will primarily be going towards paying for him to create art for the guidebook, as well as reimbursing me for the labour involved in creating Runt!\n NOTE: ALL STRETCH GOALS WILL BE INCLUDED WITH EVERY TIER OF RUNT!\n$400 [GOAL REACHED]- Printable One-Page .pdf with all the rules on one handy sheet!\n$600 [GOAL REACHED]- Character Sheets templates; templates to track your character details and keep tabs on your wonderful companions!\nWe've hit all the stretch goals and won't be adding any more to keep the project simple.

The book includes 10 technological levels and 20 thematic modules that can be combined in many unique ways, with each combination creating a different ruleset. This allows the rules to be tailored to the world in which the players want to immerse themselves.\nFrom cowboys to spies, Roman gladiators to mecha pilots, elven knights to vampires, private investigators to galactic rulers, the book provides everything needed for your game. It allows you to play in any historical era or the worlds of your favorite books, movies, series, or video games. It can also easily be customized for use with any \"system-agnostic\" settings you own.\nPLAY\n\nThe BYTE Roleplaying Game is a passion project that has been in the making for the past 8 years, with many tweaks and revisions during that time. It is a wide-ranging book that takes inspiration from all sorts of entertainment media to offer a comprehensive resource to players. It has been playtested extensively by veteran players with over 25 years in the hobby.\nYeraksys: Dying World\u2014one of the original BYTE RPG settings\nBesides the ruleset itself, the BYTE Roleplaying Game also involves the development of 7 original settings. One of these\u2014No Coin for Charon, an open world, \"hex crawl\", sandbox style, modern zombie apocalypse mini-setting\u2014will be included as an appendix in the rulebook. The other 6 settings are planned for release in the coming years.\nNo Coin for Charon\u2014a mini-setting included with the BYTE RPG Rulebook\nEach rule and item within the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook was designed and written in such a way to allow players to assess instantly which technological level, and which of the 7 original settings, it is applicable to. Each section of the book will be color-coded, and icons will be assigned to each chapter and element which link them to the pertinent worlds and eras.\nAs all the necessary rules will be compiled in the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook, the setting books will focus solely on the lore (history, geography, cultures, factions, people, artifacts, etc.) and practical tables to generate thematic events and elements on the fly, assisting players to tell unique and evolving stories customized to each world.\nAshes of the Heavens\u2014one of the two settings that may be unlocked as Stretch Goal rewards\nTo tie it all together, the BYTE Roleplaying Game uses an easy to grasp action resolution mechanism. Each character has attributes (such as Dexterity or Presence, with values ranging from 1 to 5) and skills (such as Piloting or Leadership, with values from 0 to 5). When a test is required, the player rolls a number of eight-sided dice equal to the relevant attribute and compares the number on each die to the pertinent skill, aiming to roll lower than or equal to that skill's value. Rolled eights count as zeros and thus are always considered successes, but each seven cancels out a success. If at least one roll remains successful, the character achieves a favorable outcome for the attempted action. \nNo other kind of dice besides eight-sided ones are used in the game and there are many design decisions in place to make the game fast and exciting, from trying to pilot a starfighter to ruling a kingdom.\nDo you want to know a bit more about the campaign settings with the BYTE Roleplaying Game?

Any unlocked Stretch Goals which are available after the campaign will be sold separately and not included in this price.\nMoreover, once the funds are made available to the creators, backers will gain exclusive access to the full \"Beta Version\" rules document immediately\u2014four months before the book's launch\u2014allowing them to start playing right away.

They will host the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook PDF, as well as printing and shipping the Hardcover and Limited Edition versions.\nPlease note that the vouchers represent a 100% discount on the publisher's margin only, and backers that use them will have to pay for DriveThruRPG's base printing and shipping costs. As of June 14th, 2020, printing costs for the Hardcover version are estimated around US$ 30 (450 pages, standard color, 8.5 by 11 inches, hardcover, case bound) and, for the Limited Edition version, around US$ 48 (450 pages, premium color, 8.5 by 11 inches, hardcover, case bound).

Note that printing costs can fluctuate depending on the book's exact final page count or price adjustments by DriveThruRPG.\n Terms and Conditions for the Special Rewards \n Design a non-player character for No Coin for Charon: \nYou will get to name the character, assign all of their stats according to the normal rules and give a short description of their personal history, appearance and personality (100 words at most). The text should not be discriminatory or offensive in any way, contain unsuitable mature references, or violate copyright. The author will assist you in the process if required, but will have final word relating to anything regarded as unsuitable. The created non-player character will be included in the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook if it is completed and received by the backer no later than August 31st, 2020.\n Design a faction for No Coin for Charon: \nYou will get to name the faction, assign all of their stats according to the normal rules and give a short description of its history, location, ideology, goals, leader, members, assets and weaknesses (500 words at most). The text should not be discriminatory or offensive in any way, contain unsuitable mature references, or violate copyright. The author will assist you in the process if required, but will have final word relating to anything regarded as unsuitable.

The concept for the portrait should not be offensive in any way, contain unsuitable mature references, or violate copyright.

The portrait will be done by one of the book's artists. The author will assist you in the process, but will have final word relating to anything regarded as unsuitable. When the illustration is close to its final form, it will be sent to you so that you may suggest adjustments. Once it is finished, it will be sent to you in a JPG format. If the whole process is concluded no later than August 31st, 2020, you may ask for it to be included in the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook.\n Design a mini-setting for the BYTE Roleplaying Game: \nYou will create a mini-setting by writing about its history, cultures, locations and important people (4000 words at most). It may be a book of mostly lore about the setting or one with a more open world, sandbox style, with tables for randomly generating events, items, characters etc. You are free to do it as you want to, as long as the text and any images provided are not discriminatory or offensive in any way, contain unsuitable mature references, or violate copyright. The author will assist you in the process if required, especially regarding mapping out the rules pertinent to the setting, but he will have final word relating to anything regarded as unsuitable. The author and his team will provide a suitable licensed illustration to be used as the cover art for the mini-setting, as well as do its graphic layout following the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook's templates. The final draft of the mini-setting should be submitted by you no later than December 31st, 2020. The estimated delivery date for the final document is March 31st, 2021. You will be credited as the setting's designer in the document and it will be delivered for free to all backers in PDF format. Both you and the author are allowed to distribute the PDF to anyone, anytime, as long as it is done free of charge and without any modifications to its contents.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook has been in development for more than 8 years. Nevertheless, as first-time creators, we took great care in choosing to launch the campaign only when we were absolutely sure we could deliver it. We are very close to the finishing line. The text is already in place, fully written and edited. Layout is already paid for, and most of the art is already done. Funds are needed only for a final proofreading pass and additional art. Physical copies of the book will be printed and delivered directly to backers by DriveThruRPG, a leading company in the market with more than 15 years of experience. As we, the creators, won't have to deal with printers, warehouses and shipping partners, and considering that the book is practically done, risks of this project are minimal. The main challenge is having the remaining art, layout and proofreading done in time. For that, we are giving ourselves plenty of time to have the required printing test so that vouchers for the physical copies may be delivered to backers in time with the PDF version in December.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac19 or more", "title": "Digital Copy", "descp": "You get the full-color PDF of

DELIVERED AUGUST 2020.\nAdventure Presents is a new RPG series from 2000 AD and Judge Dredd publishers Rebellion. Each issue is a stand-alone magazine with a unique story and characters, from some of the most exciting RPG designers and artists in the industry. For our grand opener Adventure is proud to present Tartarus Gate, a game of sci-fi horror written by Grant Howitt & Chris Taylor, and illustrated by Pye Parr.\nIt\u2019s the year 2130. You are an unpaid intern aboard the transport ship Charon, entrusted with shepherding cargo from Earth to the Tartarus Gate Waystation. You spend most of your time in suspended animation and are occasionally awoken by Assisti, the ship\u2019s AI, to solve problems \u2013 replacing fuses, mopping up spills, unplugging things and plugging them in again, the usual. Things could be worse. Things could be much worse.\nSet on an isolated ship in deep space, Tartarus Gate is The Office meets cosmic horror, from the designers of Spire and Honey Heist. Visual feeds with the lower decks have gone down. Something is moving. You\u2019re six months\u2019 travel from the nearest help. And you really need to impress your employer if you want to be made permanent.\nWe don\u2019t want to spoil the story, but those who want to take a closer look will find sample pages in our first project update.\nWHAT YOU'LL GET\nAdventure Presents is a complete RPG in a single magazine. Just add three six-sided dice and some pens. The story is designed to last three to four sessions, with the possibility to extend beyond into the world you\u2019ve created. You\u2019ll get a fifty-six page saddle-stitched book containing everything you\u2019ll need to play:\nA twenty-four page adventure booklet, fully illustrated in colour.\nA separate pull-out section of supporting characters and antagonists for the GM.\nSix pull-out character sheets with pre-generated characters and relevant handouts.\nA four-page pull-out rules sheet containing the complete rules to the game.\nPlus a digital asset pack with everything you need to play remotely.\nHOW TO PLAY\nThe rules and format are designed around accessibility and ease of play for beginner and established players alike. First time role players can read the four-page rule sheet, choose the most fun sounding character, and get straight to playing. \nOne player is the Games Master, while the others control up to six Protagonists who will lead the story. The magazine has been carefully laid out for ease of GMing, keeping all of the important information at a glance. The rules are designed to keep the action flowing, while giving the GM clear structure to work with.\nEvery roll is contested, so attacks and damage are decided in a single moment. All rolls are on three six-sided dice, so even with the odds against you, you\u2019ll always have a fighting chance. Each Protagonist has three core elements \u2013 their Abilities, their Drives, and their Gear.\nAbilities: an indication of what you\u2019re capable of. There are four Abilities, each with a level from 1 to 4. With every action you\u2019ll roll three dice, and remove one result according to your level, then add the others. Spend Resolve to increase your level for a roll, pushing yourself harder when you need it most. But be careful - run out of Health or Resolve and you\u2019ll collapse. Run out of both, and you\u2019re dead.\nDrives: three unique goals, needs or habits that drive your decisions and restore your Resolve.\nGear: each character starts with unique Gear which they can add to or replace during the adventure. Whatever it takes to get the job done.\nBack now for instant access to the draft rulebook.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIn order to meet our narrow fulfilment window we need to keep the complexity of production as low as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have some fun though!\n\u00a37,000: Fancy Character Sheets. Form-fillable PDF versions of the character sheets for all backers.\n\u00a310,000: Upgraded Paper. Thicker paper stock to give the magazine a nicer feel.\n\u00a315,000: GM Screen. A card GM screen will be included with all physical copies, printed with a copy of the rules for ease of reference.\nHOW IT WORKS\nJust pull! At the centre of the magazine is a pull-out booklet with reference material for the GM \u2013 from important characters to maps and monsters. Next you pull out the four page rule sheet, then the character sheets one at a time. You\u2019re left with character sheets to hand to the other players, a rule sheet to pass around, and two booklets to run your adventure.\nWe\u2019ve been developing Adventure Presents behind closed doors for over a year. Since the UK came under lockdown, we\u2019ve been looking at it as the perfect game to support remote play. \nWhichever level you back at, we\u2019ll supply digital character sheets, and copies of all the handouts and illustrations you need to play via the platform of choice, be it Zoom, Discord or your kitchen table.\nFULFILMENT\nDuring lockdown Rebellion have continued publishing 2000 AD delivering it directly to subscribers every single week. We plan to use the same printing processes to ship the RPG directly to worldwide backers from our base in the UK.\nOnce we\u2019ve got feedback and backer numbers we can make final edits, then get the issue shipped directly to backers from the printers in the UK.\nTHE TEAM\nGrant Howitt & Chris Taylor are the creative minds behind Spire, Heart, One Last Job and Honey Heist as well as entirely too many other roleplaying games.

Designed as an engine for creating new and interesting stories, every game included in Storybox! puts the narrative in the spotlight. All of the games are specifically tailored to be low-prep one-shots, and the rules are presented in an easy to read format that even someone who has never played a TTRPG before can understand.\nThe games included with Storybox! each tell a different kind of story in a different way - they're focused on being as playable as possible for anyone and the rules reflect that. As such you won't find arm-long skill lists with three different checks for 'look around' in any of these games. They're exactly as long as they need to be to help you and your friends create exciting new stories together.\nThe Games\nA Beginning: This is character creation - the game. Discover your character's strengths, weaknesses and mysterious past through play.\nAgents: A high stakes, high speed game of randomly generated skill lists and chaotic encounters. Minimum preparation, maximum carnage.\nQuest: Play as Arthurian knights of legend, stranded in the 21st century. Try and complete your final and most important mission whilst struggling to understand what all this \u2018electric\u2019 and \u2018disturbing the peace\u2019 talk is about.\nIn the Town in the Valley in the Day and the Night: A two person GM-less game about the exploration of cause and effect. One player is the day, the other is the night, and together they discover the stories that take place over 72 hours in the town in the valley.\nChromatix: What if having pretty dice actually meant something? Play as impossibly powerful wizards, each with command of a different and specific group of arcane abilities determined not by your rolls but by your physical dice themselves.\nRamble: A thinly veiled excuse to talk about cute animals doing cute things for two hours, in Ramble players take on the role of helpful local critters doing their best to make someone\u2019s day with a remarkable lack of efficiency.\nGoblins?: A game of cultural exchange. Play as a squad of goblins in deep cover as they go on a trip to learn about the elves, humans, gnomes and dwarves around them - all without getting caught.\nAn Ending: Play through the finale of a campaign that never existed, and learn along the way how it all came to be. An Ending is a sad game, and it is a game which you cannot win - only try to lose well.\nThe Art\nIn the Town in the Valley in the Day and the Night - Megan Dobbyn\nI\u2019m so excited to finally be showing Storybox! to the world. The final package will feature art by the incredibly talented Megan Dobbyn with full rules documents, GM and player notes, and examples of play. You can check out Megan's art at  www.MeganDobbyn.co.uk or on her Instagram megdobbyn_illustration.\nStretch goal\nIf we reach 400% funded (\u00a32000) each backer at the physical tier or higher will also receive 3 badges based on the art from Storybox! - a small bonus as our thanks to you.\nBacker tiers and rewards\nI believe in keeping my games simple and easy to read, and so I'm doing the same thing with backer tiers. Everyone who backs this project for at least \u00a31 has the option of having their name appear in the final book.\nDepending on your preferred way to play and how much you're looking to spend to support Storybox!, you can choose to back at the Digital, Physical, or Digital + Physical tier. As simple as it sounds, these tiers will get you either a digital copy of Storybox!, a physical copy, or both.\n'Agents' Gameplay Session: Backers at this tier will receive a digital and physical copy of Storybox!. In addition, at a mutually agreeable time within 2 months of funding closing, I will run a game of Agents for you and up to 4 of your friends online. Anyone can learn to play Agents in minutes and the random skills generation makes for a consistently chaotic and funny session.\nCustom TTRPG: As well as receiving a physical and digital copy of Storybox!, backers at this tier can get a custom made one-shot style short TTRPG based on a topic of their choice. Obvious restrictions on appropriate topics apply and I do reserve the right to veto any topic, but if that is the case I'll be happy to work with you to find something suitable. Games created as rewards for this tier will be digital only, and not included in Storybox!.\nIf you have questions about any of these tiers or rewards you can reach me at JFFreeney@gmail.com\nWhere your money goes\nEvery game in Storybox! has been written, rewritten, and tested - most of the remaining work is layout and formatting. The funds being raised here are to pay for the rest of the art and the costs of printing. \nPlaytesting these games has been some of the most fun I\u2019ve had in the world of tabletop gaming, and I can\u2019t wait to hear what adventures you create with Storybox!.\nThanks for your time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to current global issues shipping is frequently being disrupted across the world.

Whether you\u2019re an avid tabletop RPG player, creator, streamer, or curious newcomer \u2013 we want to share in your passion and help it grow.\nWe believe in the power of authentic narrative play. With Role, we're bringing that power to a new generation of online creators & communities. With all the world\u2019s advances in technology & entertainment, there is still nothing quite like a great RPG. So we set out to build the ultimate collection of high-quality social, marketplace, and online play tools for veteran players and newcomers alike.\nCheck out our live gameplay demos!\nPLAY\n\nCharacter Sheets, Dice, Assets, & Video!\nPLAY\n\nTokens & Whiteboarding!\nToday\u2019s role playing community is larger and more vibrant than ever. Diverse voices from around the globe are creating new games every day. We want to be the place where everyone can play, meet new people, and get their games into more players\u2019 hands. In simplest terms, we really just want to answer one question for every person in our community: What\u2019s missing from your table today?\nWe try to answer that question in 3 major ways: intuitive & seamless online video play, a creator-driven marketplace, and robust player matching services.\nOur online play interface is called \"The Table\", and is meant to recreate that intimate feeling of playing face-to-face with a tight group of players. \nCrisp high quality video chat puts the best part of the game front-and-center: the people. Show critical information through screen sharing. Upload visual aids to enhance your game via your Asset Tray. Text chat as a group or privately, allowing you to communicate however is most effective for your game.\nRoll any combination of dice by selecting them quickly from your Dice Tray. Add stat modifiers from your character sheet, track critical successes & failures, and add up your totals automatically. Draw cards from any deck of your choosing, including standard 52 card decks, tarot, and custom decks from your favorite games. Show your results live to the entire Table, or set them to Private for discreet gameplay.\nFully modular character sheet tools ensure you have what you need to play any game, even homebrew content or custom systems. We've designed our character sheet system from a standardized set of form fields, stat trackers, pools, tokens, note sections, and more - everything you need to play any RPG system. Character sheets are automatically indexed, with a Table of Contents generated for easy navigation. Everything is drag-and-drop - no code required! \nMatch with players who share your interests, based on information listed in your Profile. Use advanced filters to find exactly who you need based on desired complexity level, specific game experience, and location. You can even use Role to find experienced Game Masters to run your Table! \nRole is a people-first role playing community, and that means you\u2019ll always have tools to meet new players that align with your interests. Browse until you find someone you want to match with. If they match back, you\u2019ll be able to chat and set up your next game together!\nReal names & location data are always optional \u2013 you only have to share what you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nWe\u2019re designing a premium marketplace that puts creators first, making it easier for players to discover, learn, and purchase new games from diverse voices in the role playing community. Basic game info such as complexity, player count, and time commitment is always easy to find & search by. Creators can upload a free teaser of their game to help players quickly understand the basics, sample the world, and get excited to play more.\nSay goodbye to review bombs & trolling. Instead of a traditional review score system, Role uses a recommendation engine. Players recommend what they love, not trash what they hate.\nPlayers never have to worry about buying new games without people to enjoy them with. Every game is directly linked to our Player Matching tools, ensuring that every new player can find people and play together.\nBackers of this campaign will be the first to join the Role private Early Access program, where they can play with each other and help shape our tools before we launch to the rest of the world! In addition, we're offering a slate of rewards that include premium features, game supplements, and exclusive items only available via this campaign.\nAll of our backers will be able to play in our Early Access program, and will receive a shout-out on our \"Thank You\" page! Additional rewards are available as follows:\nWe're FUNDED! Every dollar raised from here goes towards unlocking our STRETCH GOALS:\nOur first Stretch Goal has been unlocked! \nRole will launch as a free platform for everyone, with an open marketplace & play tools to support any game. For those that want to take their adventures further, we're offering a subscription tier called Role Master Edition. This subscription includes everything from the basic tier, plus extras that ensure players, creators, and game masters alike have all the tools they need to run the very best game sessions.\nBeyond our default look & feel, the Table interface will support a growing library of custom skins inspired by various popular fiction genres. Maximize your group's immersion in the story by wrapping your experience in a skin that's right for you. \nBackers of this campaign will receive 3 Kickstarter-exclusive skins that will never be available again: our first Fantasy skin, a retro Arcade skin, and our Cyberpunk skin. \nOf course, the heart of the Role platform is great games. Backers of this campaign will be able to receive one or more of our 6 Creators Program supplements as they release over the course of our first year.\nPLAY\n\nWe believe in supporting the RPG creator community on Day 1, and that's why we've launched the Role Creators Program - a funding initiative to help independent designers and publishers get more of their work out into the world. As part of this Kickstarter campaign, we're funding a fresh batch of RPG game supplements from 6 different creators. These digital supplements will be exclusive to the Role platform, and available first to backers of this campaign!\nFirst, we're extremely excited to reveal Lancer: Battlegroup, the official expansion from Massif Press!\nLancer: Battlegroup is a new, standalone rules system for the Lancer setting, designed for use at your tabletop and in digital, grid-free play. Blending Lancer\u2019s deep unit customization and imbued story with tactical-narrative action, Battlegroup casts the players as pilots and officers in a battlegroup deployed to the front line; as the first tremors of interstellar war test Union\u2019s integrity, you and your party members will face the enemy with new weapons and old tactics, thrown into combat with only one goal: survive, and return home.\nAs big OSR fans, we're very pleased to bring everyone Isle of Ixx from Swedish designer, Skullfungus!\nThe Isle of Ixx is both a light OSR-style ruleset and a sandbox adventure in one. The rules are based on \"Into the Odd\" by Chris McDowall, and have been chosen for their simplicity and ease of use, so that the focus can lie on adventuring and discovering the island. The system itself is also easy to adapt to any style of OSR-ruleset you might have in mind, should you prefer that instead!\nThe setting text will be written in an open-ended way, often asking the players questions about their characters and surroundings. This way, they'll be a big part of the setting and will get to influence much of what goes on in the story!\nThere will be roughly 16 key locations on the map for players to explore, ranging from cities, villages, lairs, and dungeons. There will also be tools for the game master to create their own content, in the form of generators and sample maps they can use for their own dungeon adventures!\n We're also proud to be partnering with Swordsfall to launch The Fifth Ebon Expedition, the newest expansion to this massive Afropunk universe!\nThe Fifth Ebon Expedition is a 4+ player campaign set in a unique Mission style. Your group will be part of the larger expedition, fighting to establish forward camps, and with it a railway for a future supply line. If your expedition is successful, then the question is... can you defend it?\nFrom popular Filipino creator, Sword Queen Games, we're bringing Voidwalkers - a tarot-powered game that combines mysticism with deep space exploration for an experience unlike any other!\nVoidwalkers will be a complete stand-alone science fiction TTRPG where mysticism and space-magic guide creative and intuitive stories. In this Powered by the Apocalypse game, characters must learn how to harness and balance the wild space-magic, the VOID, within themselves, while navigating and staying clear of its wild manifestations in the physical world. You must rely on creativity, luck, and relationships in order to succeed and thrive out in the Void. Players will use a tarot deck as a way to generate intuitive stories and resolve challenges. A unique tarot deck will be created for this game, but any tarot deck may be used!\nIndie designer Steven Medeiros, in collaboration with the Role team, is developing Astra - a unique blend of classic OSR and cooperative action where players pool their dice rolls and act together as a group.\nAstra is a rules light 3-6 player OSR-style tabletop role playing game with a focus on cooperative group dice pool mechanics that allow players to work together and overcome obstacles. It explores heavy themes of interpersonal connections, self exploration, and building community. Suitable for one-shot or campaign-style play, it features quick & easy character creation and narrative driven gameplay.\nLast - but certainly not least - we're working with Magpie Games to bring players a brand-new supplement for Masks! Cataclysm at the Metajunction will bring new levels of superhero action to this popular superhero RPG.\nCataclysm at the Metajunction is a playset for Masks: A New Generation, a Powered by the Apocalypse game of teen superheroics. This playset will give you everything you need to play through superheroic tales in the endangered Metajunction, along with two new costumes, or playbook variants, for you to use with existing Masks characters. Ever wanted to play a version of your character from another reality? Cataclysm at the Metajunction provides the support for doing just that!\nThis playset includes: a 32 page full-color, illustrated playset, including custom moves and villains. And 2 new playbook supplements (costumes) that expand existing Masks playbooks.\nAll 6 of these awesome supplements will release exclusively on Role, as part of Year 1 of our platform launch!\n From all of us here at Role, thank you so much for joining us on this adventure.
