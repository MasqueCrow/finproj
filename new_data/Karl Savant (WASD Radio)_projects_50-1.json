[{"backer": "Karl Savant (WASD Radio)", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Anitons is an open world monster-collecting RPG. It\u2019s also our dream game and would be more than pleased to deliver it to you! We, as monster taming genre fans, want to make something unique and never seen before. Take a look at Anitons early gameplay footage:\nAnitons is an open world monster-collecting RPG where you start your adventure in the wilderness, fight wild Anitons, and collect your own unique Anitons. Every Aniton you obtain can help you fight and farm. Expand your base to fit all monsters in your collection - decorate walls and place bamboo sticks to make Pangeros feel at home. Happy and well-fed Aniton will fight better and help you gather resources. Catch every known Aniton, battle other players, build the biggest farm or just get lost in a world full of life!\nFeatures:\nExplore a vast open-world where you can find wild Anitons and useful resources. At first, getting by in the wilderness will not be an easy task, but as you collect and evolve more powerful Anitons, you will find a way to be invincible.\nControl your Anitons in real-time combat and use the various skills you've taught them. During a fight, it is not only the strategy that plays a role but also agility and accuracy.  Fighting with wild Anitons won\u2019t always be a fair fight, prepare to face dozens of enemies at once!\n\nEvolve various Anitons, acquire new moves, or breed a completely new one. To do this you will need DNA points. You can obtain these by either farming this specific type of Aniton, or by fighting them in the wild. Forge your own path!\nInvite multiple friends and play together. You can team up to fight Aniton Hordes on Raids, or build a new base with your friends. Use PvP duels to fight other players and test new tactics. Offline mode will of course still be an option for those who want to play solo.  Note: this feature is linked to the \u201cMultiplayer\u201d stretch goal.\nFound your own base using resources you obtain from the wild. There, you can keep all of your Anitons and make them feel at home. You can not only place buildings but also customize the environment around you! Create a cozy place for you and your Anitons to rest after a tough fight.\n\nFarm various monsters and resources that you will find useful throughout your journey. Each type of Aniton prefers a different kind of food. Well-fed Aniton will use his unique ability that will aid you in this aspect! Electric types can charge machines that will automate your work, fire types can heat your house, and water types can help grow your crops.\nCustomize your character to perfectly fit your playstyle and Aniton squad. Unlock new outfits as you progress by completing various challenges. You can also build your mansion, paint walls, and hang pictures of your friends and favorite Anitons!\nSince the beginning of the development, we\u2019ve been transparent with our goals and development process and we\u2019ll keep on doing this until the full release. We organized a couple of contests where fans could create their own Anitons or name existing ones. If you want to shape the final look of the Anitons, join our discord here:  >>>CLICK<<<\nSTORY\nThe world of Anitons is divided into smaller areas that are habited by different kinds of monsters. On the volcanic grounds, you can find various fire type Anitons, and if you are looking for crystal types, you should visit the underground, monster-infested caves. As the player, you can freely explore this open-world continent and return to your base at any time.\n\nThere are 9 different types of Anitons. Each type has its own unique playstyle and skillset. You can choose Nature for its ability to heal or stick with Rock for its defensive skills. If on the other hand, you\u2019re going to fight a whole bunch of enemies at once, Fire, with its area effect skills might just be perfect for you. If you\u2019re playing with a friend, choose a combination that will increase your damage output like Water and Electric. The dual-typed Anitons only multiply already almost endless possibilities. Find your playstyle!\nYou start out by visiting your Uncle that lives overseas, in search of a job. You decide to help him finish his project of a lifetime - gather information about every existing Aniton. Little you know how this goal will change your life. Not only you have to build your own base, but also collect every Aniton out there. Even with the help of your friends... This might take a while.\nEnough about the task, which one of these little fellas would you choose?\nAnitons are the creatures living in the wild or with humans. You can create your own Anitons that will happily help you with fighting, or farming. All of your monster friends have to live somewhere, a cozy farm is perfect for them. Every Aniton loves to play, and have his favorite food that the owner must provide. With time your monsters will get experienced and will evolve into more powerful forms. During your adventure, you will meet and collect tons of them.\nWhile going into the wild you can take up to 6 Anitons with you. They will help you travel, gather resources, and fight. If any of your monsters faint during the battle, you will have to take care of him after returning to your farm. Each Anioton can learn skills as they evolve, and the last stage can master up to 3 different abilities. While fighting the player takes control of the monster, to win he will have to use both accuracy and a tactic.\nThe Stegra line is the most popular three-stage evolution. You can evolve your Aniton to more powerful forms and with each evolution, it can learn new skills. Since this specific line is a mix of Rock and Nature type, while choosing a new ability for your monster you can either pick supportive Nature abilities or go with defensive Rock skills.\nThe Tadapas line is composed of toxic type Anitons. In the first stage Tadapas has an additional water typing that the next stage evolution is missing. This means that your Tadapas can have a water ability, but since first form ability is known from the beginning, you'll have to create a Tapadas with the exact skill that you are looking for. Using more DNA you can boost your chances to get better Anitons in creation process.\nThe Ottim line is different from most of the other Aniton lines. After getting enough experience to evolve, you can choose its new stage. Since Ottim's passive ability is to find random crystals, the evolution you choose will additionally influence its skill. Fishtter is a more defense-oriented evolution that will find blue crystals for you, whilst Sharker is a more offensive form that will find mostly red crystals.\n\nTo gather funding for the Anitons project we've prepared unique rewards for you to choose from. Hope you will find something just perfect for you. All gathered funds will be used for the development of the game.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the development of our previous game, we decided that we want to become independent in terms of the production of our next title. This will provide a way to make Anitons with our community and by this, make Anitons a game of your dreams too. Success in Kickstarter will help us stay indie and provide a way to keep on developing this game. At this point in time, we cannot say if we\u2019ll be able to develop Anitons if we won\u2019t hit our initial $75k stretch goal, but with fans as you, this shouldn\u2019t be our concern.\nWe\u2019ve been working for almost one year to create a sharp vision of Anitons that you can see today, and we reach a point when we have to start full production. If you become a backer and trust us, this game will become yours and we\u2019ll be excited to develop it for you. Your feedback along the way will ensure that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. Let\u2019s set out on this adventure together!\nMeet the team behind Anitons! Our core team has been working together for the past 3 years on our previous game, Lumberhill, and since the beginning, in January we welcomed a couple of new team members. All of us are thrilled to work on this game, and right now we can\u2019t wait to start full production. If Kickstarter will be successful, we have a plan to extend our team with talented artists to bring your game to an even higher level.\nBelow you can find our sketch of the Anitons project roadmap. The plan below includes working on all of the stretch goals we've prepared, so the final release date won't surprise us if we do hit those later stretch goals.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter campaign, but it\u2019s not our first project. We\u2019ve been working in a team for over three years now. Even considering Anitons is our biggest production to date, we\u2019re prepared in terms of the technology and skills required to finish this project. At this point in time, we have been developing Anitons for almost a year.\n\nWe have used all of our experience in planning development and the budget for Anitons. Quality and deadlines are the most fundamental aspects of our work since our team is working in Agile. Quality is not only graphic that can be measured, but also gameplay and player experience. Having this in mind, we\u2019re prepared to sacrifice minor graphical content if this can help shape Anitons into a game you will enjoy for many hours.\n\nSince the beginning of the development, we\u2019ve been transparent with our goals and development process and we\u2019ll keep on doing this until the full release. As a backer, you've helped us a lot already, but there\u2019ll be many more occasions where you can shape the final look of the Anitons. At this point in time we cannot say if we\u2019ll be able to develop Anitons if we won\u2019t hit our initial $75k stretch goal, but with fans as you this shouldn\u2019t be our concern.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nIn our project we don't use papper and plastic.

The game is set within the same universe as their hit Flash games, with an all-new standalone story and gameplay. It isn\u2019t if you\u2019re going to die\u2026 it\u2019s what you do with the time you have left. \n As the game opens, you\u2019re one of a group of people struggling to survive 15 years after the end of the world. When you\u2019re infected with the incurable zombie virus, you know the rules; you\u2019re given some supplies and sent out from the compound to try and make a difference with the time you have left. But why is the virus suddenly becoming so deadly again after all this time? You\u2019ll have to go far, and push past death, to find out.\nSurvivors await their run.\nChoosing from a pool of randomly generated survivors, players set out beyond the safety of the gates to the ruins of the world beyond. They\u2019ll select a destination to travel to and then explore it for supplies to either take for themselves or tag for retrieval by the enclave. The locations you can visit will vary from one playthrough to the next, and will contain randomised elements to make each run unique.\n The game plays in an isometric perspective in real time. If you\u2019re spotted by the creatures roaming the streets, they\u2019ll give chase - some faster than others - and with limited ammo and stamina, sometimes standing your ground isn\u2019t always the best choice. There\u2019s also the virus that\u2019s slowly growing and mutating inside you. It\u2019ll eventually consume you (if the zombies don\u2019t first), but before it does, you may find that it grants you strange and dangerous benefits \u2014 at the cost of your humanity.\nA survivor succumbs to a new level of infection.\nIn The Last Stand: Aftermath, it\u2019s not if you\u2019re going to die, but when. The game\u2019s roguelite loop means that each time your character dies, you start up again as another. \u201cVolunteers\u201d, as they\u2019re called in the game, begin back at the enclave. However, they\u2019ll benefit from the progress and supplies found by their predecessors, and no journey will be the same as the last with the game's randomized maps. The journey will be long, and it won\u2019t be easy. But with perseverance, grit, and a little bit of luck, they can overcome the odds, and learn the truth behind the renewed zombie threat. No matter what, they\u2019ll make a difference.\nThe Last Stand as a series first began in 2007 with the release of the original titular web game. With each game since then, we have tried to evolve and change the series in ways that are interesting to us. Breaking out of the defense genre, The Last Stand has been an action RPG in the form of Union City and even a browser based MMO in Dead Zone. With The Last Stand: Aftermath, we\u2019re making a roguelite that feels like a Last Stand game.\nWe\u2019ve been working on The Last Stand: Aftermath for a few years now. Our goal is to provide a high-quality, single player action adventure that fans of the series will appreciate, with nods to the series\u2019 history and existing story, but also a standalone experience that newcomers could jump right into.\nWith the newest entry in the series, we wanted to tell a post-post-apocalyptic zombie story, that focuses more on the people, rather than being gritty or overly violent. While Aftermath isn\u2019t necessarily a narrative-focused game, its roguelite loop is supported by a story about making an impact no matter how hopeless things seem\u2026 and of course, a secret conspiracy.\nFor the music in The Last Stand: Aftermath, we're working with the amazing people at The Otherworld Agency along with multi-award winning composers Matt Mclean and Sean Tinnion. Together they're already creating an amazing soundscape that captures the  foreign nature of a world lost to nature and the infected. With your help, we are hoping to be able to expand the soundtrack even further.\nCon Artist Games is currently two people from Australia; Stephen Woolcock and Chris Condon. Together, we\u2019ve been making games for more than a decade. The Last Stand: Aftermath is our first big commercial project and our largest game to date. Chris has been working in games for 21 years, starting as a level designer, then producer and game director. Steve has been programming professionally for 16 years and has worked as a game developer for nearly a decade.\n\n We plan to initiate a beta within six weeks after the funding period ends. Players who choose a tier with beta access will be given access to a private Discord channel to interact with one another and the developers and will receive Steam keys to redeem and play the game for the purpose of providing feedback. We will provide several forms for players to provide direct feedback and bug reports in a simple fashion.\nPlease note that you will not be permitted to stream or share screenshots, footage, or other material from the game. Because the game is still in active development, it is important for us to be able to control how the game is shared and presented until it approaches its final form.\nThe Last Stand: Aftermath already contains a significant amount of playable content, roughly 50-60% of the overall final game. We plan to release the full game sometime next year. Between now and then, we will release regular large content updates to our beta backers. This will include additional weapons and enemies, entire new areas to explore and will culminate in the complete story and final release.\n\nWhile we had initially thought to release the game in Early Access on Steam, our main goal in doing so was always to have a way to interact with our community and gather valuable feedback on their experiences with the game to better balance the gameplay.\nPivoting to a Kickstarter allows us to do that in a more controlled way, continue to develop and finish the game at a healthy and sustainable pace for our team, and have the opportunity to polish and expand the game beyond the initial funding provided by our publisher, Armor Games Studios.\nWe know Kickstarter gives us the opportunity to grow our community, and to work with their feedback to make our game the best it can be. 100% of investment from Kickstarter after fees and taxes will go straight to the development of The Last Stand: Aftermath!\n\nA rare moment of peace amongst the chaos.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery game project is unique, and carries its own set of risks. While this is our largest project ever as a developer, we, along with our publisher, Armor Games Studios, have years of experience in creating and releasing games across multiple platforms. Additionally, The Last Stand: Aftermath is already playable and more than halfway done, with a planned roadmap for release. While there is always a chance that the exact release period of the game may change, we have carefully budgeted and planned out our development, and will always be sure to communicate regularly and honestly with our backers about any changes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Your Name in the Credits", "descp": "Your name will appear in the credits for The Last Stand: Aftermath.\nINCLUDES:\nName in the Credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["53 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Game Pledge", "descp": "Want to support The Last Stand: Aftermath and get a PC (Steam) copy on release?

Sail the seas, look for trouble, be the last pirate standing to retrieve all the treasures the archipelago can give! Although you may not survive every single raid, your achievements, fame and glory will!\n'Out of Reach: Treasure Royale' is a spin off to the survival, base-building 'Out of Reach', but this time dozens of pirate crews face each other on the open sea, jungle islands and dark caves in a fast-paced, battle-royale style gameplay, focused on sailing, looting, bombarding and hunting treasures.\nClick to add Out of Reach: Treasure Royale to your Steam Wishlist already today!\nWe've started to create Treasure Royale with a simple idea to blend together all the best features known from its forerunner with the emerging battle-royale style mods. After hundreds of hours spent in such games, we've already knew that the genre needs a face-lifting and we need to come up with new concepts to keep it fresh and addictive. After 2 years of full-time development, we feel ready to present you with our take on a modern first person shooter! \nCore features in a nutshell\nInvite up to 3 friends, go alone or join a random team on one of the official, always-online servers\nWin a battle-royale style round against 25 to 99 other pirates\nFind loot, treasures and enemies on a 7sq mi (20km\u00b2) ocean with more than a dozen of islands (and more to come!)\nUse fully interactive ship to sail, ram, bombard and outstrip your opponents\nWhen eliminated - fight as a skeleton pirate against the others or wait for your crew to perform a revive ritual\nWhen left on a wrecked ship - sacrifice a part of your HP to summon a friendly Kraken to fetch you another one!\nComplete objectives and protect your treasure against other crews in the center of the Archipelago to win a round!\nCollect experience, unlock unique pirate clothes, customize ships, set up your crew's banner! \n\nIn deeper details\nPlayers find themselves locked up in cages presumably after robbing one too many treasures. They are given one last chance to redeem by bringing back an equivalent in gold of what they've stolen to the extraction point (which is the Altar in our case). From the technical point of view, this is where we do the matchmaking and put together crews of 4 players (if they checked that option in the main menu).\nWhen there are enough players on a server, every crew chooses a spawn point on the edge of the map where they want their ship to spawn. The hunt begins. There are 3 objectives that involve looking for treasures marked on the map. They are chosen by the server taking into account many variables to make crews sail not only similar distances, but what's most important, cross each other's way as much as possible. \nAlthough every pirate starts their journey with a sword and 10 cannon balls, it certainly won't be enough in close encounters. Players need to divide the round between treasure hunting, dealing with other crews and loot gathering. \nPLAY\n\nThere are currently 3 big regions consisting of several islands each with various bioms, towns, castles, wreckyards and caves. It is already enough to get lost and visit different places every round after several hours of playtime (what you could experience during the recently concluded Steam Festival), but with the help of Kickstarter community, we will be eager to add twice as many islands and 2 new bioms!\n...is not the end of the world, if your crew got your back. When your HP reaches 0 for any reason, you're being moved back to the Island of the Damned, but this time the cage is open and you have a couple of revolver cartridges to fire. What you care about in such situation is to find another walking dead and eliminate it in order to get respawned somewhere near your crew.\nPLAY\n\nAll that creates a whole new 'free for all' deathmatch inside a classic battle-royale gameplay and rewards players with another life regardless of teammates' effort to revive dead crew members. Speaking of reviving, while you're dead, your crew can resurrect the whole team by putting a special Idol found in treasures on the Revive Altar. It may take a while, but it's always better to have every teammate around.\nWhen the first crew gathers all the treasures, it triggers the last objective which makes the Altar island emerge from the sea bottom and the cursed ring to shrink. Any team that puts the treasures on the altar and protects them for 5 minutes wins the round. Obviously all the other teams need to stop that in any possible way (the fatal way would work the best probably). The round also ends when there's only one crew alive for those who like to play it standard. \nEvery crew starts their journey on a pirate ship equipped to destroy other ships and, in the meantime, cross oceans as fast as possible. But first things first - the crew captain is given at the very beginning an opportunity to choose a ship skin, sails colors and one of the unlocked banners. Future updates are supposed to bring also additional sail stamps just to let everyone know how experienced the crew that operates this particular ship is.\nSteering wheel comes along with a hovering camera for better sailing technique through narrow passes. Sailor also needs to take into account variation of the wind, angle of turning and the number of undamaged sails when engaging a pursuit of enemy or treasures. There's also a short boost bar under Shift key available which can come in handy in certain situations.\nPLAY\n\nThere are several things to do onboard to stay in game and win against other pirates. Checking horizon through windows and doors or using repairing bench to fix holes are some of them. And the most important:  \nWhen your ship gets destroyed or your crew just leaves you behind, the old pirate ritual will be there to put you back in action. By the cost of permanent loss of 25% HP, everyone can ask a friendly kraken to fetch them a new vessel.  \nCurrently there are several groups of weapons ready to be found on the islands, all of them are listed below. We also stay eager to add other types of pistols and rifles to spice up the game and we hope to get feedback from players on what is most needed. \nAs you may have noticed, we plan to keep it old-school with a full-screen inventory and possibility to put up to 3 add-ons on each weapon to change its stats such as sway, spread, smoke and sound, recoil, reload times. \nWhen it comes to protection, right now there are 3 levels of Chest armors, Vambraces and Helmets. The first ones provide an additional health bar, braces reduce overall damage before being deducted from Hp and helmets lower a headshot multiplier. \n Another group of gear is medkits. As far as we know, a long pipe and deep bottle were always the best cure for pirates and it won't be different in Out of Reach. There's in fact another bar to represent the total alcohol gulped down that reaches 3 stages and can increase aim, run speed and HP regen.\nPLAY\n\nIn Treasure Royale, every team is free to choose the most tempting ocean area to spawn on, whether it's close to islands and loot, has clear passage across the archipelago or tends to be the most pirate-crowded place on the known map. Regardless of that, everyone will have to get off the deck at some point and visit at least a few of these islands:\nSkull Island with an abandoned town and dungeons hidden in caves. There you'll find a rocky shore and tons of buildings hiding their secrets. It might be explored both at the surface and underneath.\nMake sure to check out pirate hideouts, some of them are accessible only by sea and may not provide any rear exit but the loot inside is exceptionally worth a glimpse.\n If you like to river cruise and try your luck with recently abandoned settlements, Canyon Islands is your way to go. You might explore variety of villages and overgrown meadows in your search for precious loot.\nTropical part of the archipelago on the other hand, feels like an exotic paradise, where you could enjoy a bottle or two like a classic pirate would do, but as much as it is a great hideout, you never know who awaits in a bush. \nOnce that used to be a real melting pot of cultures, now it's known for ancient ruins of the Lost City hidden in the jungle. Maybe from the top of a steep mountain you would spot some pyramids, temples of lost civilizations...or at least some bamboo houses all of which might be worth checking out. This biom is one of the biggest on the current map and still in development.\n Desert climate might not be extremely welcoming nowadays, but in the past the old mines were really prosperous, maybe some gold was forgotten there? You might try your luck in the Kraken hunter villages, dark caves or open pit mine of the Gold Rush Islands as soon as it's ready. By the time we write it, the biom is still under balance testing and further development. \n And what if you're not that lucky, get a headshot and end up on the Island of the Damned? Better still try to escape such a limbo full of corpses of those that did not avoid the torture tools and machines.\nCurrent state of development\nAlthough Out of Reach: Treasure Royale is playable and under heavy tests that could be already seen on YouTube, we want to spend a couple months more locked with it in our studio. Besides polishing that's to be made, we would like to add another big pack of features that are still not common in Battle Royale genre.

The small mining town of Ashridge is at the center of the disturbances. The main bridge to town is destroyed and the villagers are now trapped in the town being overrun by monsters. Leaders calls for any who can help. Adventurers step up as they now must all fight to survive. \n Ankhoron is a new original world full of magic and heroes of immense power.\nThe northern city of Ashridge was once prosperous because of its thriving farms and rich mines.  But all things golden eventually tarnish. A curse unleashed by necromantic cultists from the North shook the land with a series of violent earthquakes.The poisonous ash released by the tremors killed off the once abundant crops in the surrounding valley, and crumbled the tunnels within the mines. The once-great crumbled to dust as the townspeople fled the dying city and were replaced by mutant monsters and undead victims of wars foughtlong ago. But hope remains that Ashridge may one day be restored to its former glory by a remedy that scholars say may be found in the ancient shrines buried deep below the city.\n\"I spent many an hour enjoying the pleasures that Ashridge once had to offer. But the dark magics its insubordinate mages unleashed shattered what was once a jewel of our homeland, leaving behind a treacherous den of despair in its place. I pity those who must set foot into its lifeless corridors and reside within its decrepit hovels, forever existing in a state of fear and unrest.\" From the notes of an unknown explorer.\nAshridge is a map built vertically deep into dungeons and up into mines above. But exploration is not always easy as there are many shortcuts, hidden keys, hidden passages, and monsters that block your way. \nAnkhoron - an expansive world of many cultures with a geography covering 20+ cities and 2 continents.\nBlack Keep\nThe world of Ankhoron is the cradle of humanity. It is home to the cities of the Seven Empires that were formed around the sacred magics of the dragons who once ruled the world. The texture of Ankhoron\u2019s great continents is as varied as the people who live upon its land, from its towering mountain ranges to its vast and violent seas.\n\"I have walked this land of Ankhoron from coast to coast, and I have experienced many of its highest highs and lowest lows. Yet for all of this ancient continent\u2019s vibrant beauty and diverse life, there is much pernicious evil hidden within its depths. Ensure your eyes stay as open as your heart when you traverse its terrain.\"  Telvir of the Drakien Monks\nThe world of Ankhoron with many undiscovered lands\n- Deep customizable Fighting Game combat in an ARPG - We plan to add the depth of  top Fighting-Game Combat to ARPGs by building combat to allow customizeable combos, counters, parries, and magic effects all built on existing Fighting Game fundamentals. \n- Original AAA Art and Artists - Our studio and game idea has been able to attract AAA talent both full time and part-time to create AAA quality art for our game. This include concept artists, 3d modelers, 3d animators, and 3d environmental artists. \n- Original Gameplay with unique players - Play through the game as a Knight or one of the Demon monsters in the game. Demon monsters have unique access to monster skillset and a scalable AI with personality and aggressiveness that scales up at later difficulties!\n- Looting systems inspired by the best ARPG\u2019s- Loot is a big part of ARPGs and yet most good ARPG looting mechanics such as:  \u2013Random drops, Crafting/customization, and set items bonuses.\n- Building Difficult-but-Fair Game- Enemies, bosses, and challenges will be built to always give players a chance. Those with high skill can attempt the game without completing the loot quests to improve gear and lower skill players can still expect to complete the game with just basic attacks by collecting lots of loot to improve equipment. \n- ESports and Replayability - Player vs Player will be balanced by scaling all damage to   base levels (normalizing to 100%) which means you will always fighting heroes on a balanced playing field suitable for Esports or Co-op gameplay. Our late game will also give all enemies improved AI (Artificial Intelligence) access to full range of combos, abilities, randomized enhancements, and strategies that will challenge the best players.\n- Combat and Skill Trees - Choose your iconic hero, your weapon preference, and school of magics. Together you can access the deep and customizeable skill-trees for different types of combat including: quick melee, slow melee, ranged projectile, ranged AOE, Healing support-skill, charging/dashing, complex setup/mix-ups, and many others to come later. We expect to add additional hero types, weapon types, and magic schools each year and each season after launch. Feedback from the community will help us decide which skills and abilities are most desired and need to most help.\n- Lore and living cities - Our cities are designed to evolve as your character grows, with the stories and capabilities of NPCs evolving as you help them and the empty houses filling in as NPCs are saved and rejoin the city. Each NPC is already created with a backstory and relationships that will be exposed as the game and story evolves.\n- Expansion Locations - Our world is built with 20+ cities and many vertical hidden dungeons, hideouts, secrets, bosses, enemies, and NPCs in each city. Eventually we plan to allow players to visit each town where the Heroes/NPCs came from to learn their story and develop their skills. We believe planning for the depth of a large evolving world helps bring the world of Ankhoron and its people to life.\n- Multiplayer and Networking  - Our games is built from the ground up to incorporate 16+ player networking. Initially we are optimizing for 2 person co-op or 2 person PVP but we have planned to expand this into larger 5 person group and 16+ people group PVP in the future. Our Networking is already working now.\nPlease also visit our poll here to let us know which system you prefer us to launch Demon Knights of Ankhoron first! (Steam/PC, Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo)\nhttps://archonforge.com/poll-about-system/\nArchon Forge Team 20191030\nOur Team Story: \n Our team is a assembled from a mix of proven AAA industry artists, professionals, and managers around the world. Our passion has allowed us to attract talent to join us that has worked on games such as Dark Souls, Street Fighter, Tekken, and also attact professionals that have worked for companies including Disney, Relic, Bandai Namco, Capcom, and Electronic Arts\nAlthough our core team is located in Vancouver (3 full-time) we have a large number of full-time and part-time international staff located around the world in cities including Hong Kong(2), Tokyo, Malaysia, Thailand, Germany, Columbia, and USA. All of our full-time and part-time staff are very professional and able to work online and hand off projects to other staff located in other cities. We have also been lucky to be able to find many experienced consultants and contractors that are willing to take time out of their full-time jobs to help us with various technical and artistic projects. \n\n\n\u2020Our Lead Character designed Gus was an original artist for Dark Souls and Demon Souls for From Software\n\u2020Our Lead Programmer Laurie has >15 years launching AAA complex games and has worked for companies including Relic Entertainment (Warhammer 40k), Rare (Goldeneye, Perfect Dark Zero), and many others\n\u2020Our Environmental and Materials artist Smiljan has developed environments and characters for 10+ years for AAA games such as Heavy Gear.\n\u2020Our Senior Animator David has recently joined us full time after spending 9+ years working on many companies and different Games being the main gameplay and combat Animator.\n\u2020Our 3D Artists include an international mix of full-time and part-time artists that have previously worked for AAA companies and games such as Capcom (Street Fighter), Electronic Arts, and art exhibits.\n\u2020The CEO Kevin Chuang each has 15+ years experience in setting up new teams and projects globally. Kevin has an MBA from Boston University and has experience working for audit firms, project management, bank derivatives, and setting up new teams as an entrepreneur. \nTogether as a team we have launched >120 different games or projects internationally with a success rate of >90% with only 3 projects that failed to make budget. With our committed AAA team we feel that this will be one project we can all be proud of when it succeeds.\nOur initial idea started over 4 years ago with the testing of systems in Unreal and discussion with friends and experienced industry veterans (>10 years at Electronic Arts) who have advised us along our development. Our current team and partners committed to building the game late in 2018 and since we have built a AAA team capable of building the game we dreamed of. We feel the 3 years spent planning this game and building the world will give us a head start in developing this into a beautiful fun game that is able to stay within budget .\nSelection of the Knights of Ankhoron\nWe are fortunate to have Gus Chan as our Lead Character Artist who is based in Hong Kong and was one of the original artist that worked on Demon Souls and Dark Souls. \nWith his help we have a large library of characters and monsters to build our world. Players will be able to choose from 5 unique heroes to start or build their own customizeable character with the ability to swap armor, weapons, magic, and customize their own characters.\nDark champions and corrupted soldiers\n\u00b7 Heavy Knights are the last in a long line of honorable guardians known for their enchanted armors and unrelenting ferocity on the battlefield\n\u00b7 Deadly Hunter are known for their quickness and stealth as they rain death from afar with magic projectiles\n\u00b7 Arcane Blademaster learned long ago that magic alone is weak, mastering the blade brings strength to the transient nature of the magic\n\u00b7 Elemental Barbarian are not burdened by the weight of armor but wield the elements to protect themselves and wreck destruction on their enemies\n\u00b7 Dark Druids can expect to have access powerful monstrous abilities to defeat the game in an entirely new approach to ARPG and Fighting Game PVP.\nA wide selection of NPCs and Items are also currently being designed to fill out the world and backstory.\nEarly NPC sketches by artist Charis Loke\nEnvironmental Concepts\nItem Concepts\nAncient Sewers of Ashridge\nOnce known as the Great Sewers of Ashridge, they were once viewed as an engineering marvel by the people that it served. They were originally built to carry life-giving water to every corner of the city and the mountain mines. But the massive tunnels fell into disarray when the city was abandoned, and only a select fewew remaining now know how to navigate their byzantine layout. To most, the sewers only continue to exist as a home for the vicious rat\u2010men and other murderous creatures who plague Ashridge\u2019s remaining citizenry. Even so, brave adventurers who choose to explore the perilous labyrinth might still find great treasure within its nooks and crannies.\n\"I recall the joyful cheers of the Ashridge townsfolk when the construction of the aptly named Great Sewers was finally complete. I also recall their pitiful cries as the dark magics shook the very earth itself and crumbled the tunnels to rubble. Now, those foolish enough to seek the water of life within its bowels are likely to only discover lurking creatures of death.\" Telvir of the Drekian Monks\nEntrance to Mines at the burning of Ashridge city\nDeep Mines of Ashridge\nThe Deep Mines rivalled the Great Sewers of Ashridge as one of the engineering marvels of its day. Its maze of tunnels burrows deep into the heart of the mountain range that surrounds the Ashridge Valley and contains within it a wealth of precious jewels and ores that would make kings blush. But a series of powerful earthquakes that erupted when the rogue mages cast their dark spells collapsed many of the subterranean tunnels. Adventurers who wish to brave what remains of the Mountain Mines to search for lost treasures would do best to avoid the horrible creatures lurking in its depths. \n\"Deep within the belly of the Ashridge mountains lies a wealth of unimaginable riches. But whilst the reward may be great, the risk is even greater. Those who have escaped what remains of the Mountain Mines speak of a great evil that awaits the unsuspecting treasure hunters who venture into their collapsing tunnels to satiate their greed.\" Lost notes of a miners map\nMimic Demon\nThe first of the demons to come from the deep were dark horrid creatures. Viscious spider-like crabs that hide in holes and ambush their prey with blade-like claws and a poison tail. They are a plague on humanity. Their numbers are growing and some have seen them grow to gargantuan sizes with claws that pierce steel. A silent nightmare that invades as we sleep. Watch for them the ceilings, be careful when walking past holes, and listen for the clacking sounds when they come... Burn them all before it is too late!\nRat-men\nDark magic mutated the sewer rats that roam the remnants of the Great Sewers into wily and viciously territorial rat-men who will fight to the death to defend their underground home from intruders. The dexterity that allows them to wield any number of weapons, and the durability of their toughened hides that makes them extremely resistant to physical damage, means that brave adventurers must summon all their cunning to defeat their rat-men foes in battle.\n\"I trembled at the sight of the terrible rat-men who lurk in the dark shadows of the tunnels once known as the \u201cGreat Sewers.\u201d These inglorious rodents were red in tooth and claw, and wielded murderous weapons constructed from the sharpened bones of their victims. I caution all who seek wealth and fame to do so as far from these deviously evil monsters as lies within their power.\" From the diary of a lost Miner\nNightmarish Ratman of the Great Sewers\nAnthropophagi (Living Trees)\nThe forests surrounding the Ashridge Valley were traditionally a lush and welcoming place. But the rogue mages turned the trees that once provided shelter for all manner of woodland creatures into the violent, man-eating sentinels who now guard their stolen kingdom. The Anthropophagi now walk the northern perimeter, using the unholy strength within their possessed branches to tear apart the wayward adventurers who stumble into their path.\n\"Those who venture forth into the forests of the Ashridge Valley to find their souls stand a fair chance of losing their lives by way of the swinging branches of the Anthropophagi. I once unsuspectingly encountered these coniferous guardians during a simple sojourn through the woods, and only escaped a splintered demise by the grace of the gods.\" Feltir of the Drekian Monks \nLiving Tree - forest sentinel\nWe are looking to Kickstarter to fund this project as the project is currently funded by our partners with >$100,000 USD spent to date to assemble our team and bring the game to this current stage. We understand the scope is large and at a AAA studio this will likely cost well over $1m USD to create a similar game. Although we try to minimize costs by working remotely and bringing in international talent, the cost to develop AAA art and pay for AAA artists is real and committing to do more requires more funds.\nWe want to get in touch with our community and Kickstarter is a great way to reach out to the gamers who will buy the game. We need to know that gamers appreciate our art and are willing to put down money for our game. By reaching out to the community for funding we hope to be able to publish independently without needing to cut deals with publishers for exclusives or make deals that will compromise our games vision and quality. \nWith our Kickstarter target of $50,000 USD we expect to have enough to finish this game with a skeleton team. But we hope that this game is able to appeal to both the dark Action-RPG fans and the Fighting Game enthusiasts to achieve our stretch goals of up to $1m USD. With true AAA funding, we can invest into building our team, hire additional designers, that will truly be able to build all the hidden cities, underworld, lost shrines, and innovative monsters/bosses that will bring the world to live.\n\nwww.archonforge.com  www.ankhoron.com  www.demonknightsgame.com\nOfficial Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/ArchonForge \nOfficial Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Archon-Forge-Games-Co-Ltd-101687497940910\nOfficial Discord\nhttps://discord.gg/DQcjERa\nWe are a small studio that try to limit our costs where possible and focus on creating the best game possible. However there are always some risks to our business model.\nStaffing - We have been lucky in attracting AAA talent but we are competing with AAA studios for staff and some staff may get a offer at a larger studio which we cannot match.\nTechnical - As a small studio we are limited in our resources and depend on our staff and our network of friends to help us past any technical issues. So far this has not been a large problem but most of our delays come from discovery of bugs that need to be solved.\nMarketing and Competition - As a small studio we have limited reach in promoting our game globally and depend highly on our community of fans and influencers to help promote our game. Competition from established studios in ARPGs and Fighting Games will have a far larger budget to do marketing and copy our concept if we do not deliver quickly enough.\nFinancing - We have spent over $100,000 USD so far and should have enough funds from partners to deliver a minimum skeleton game to our backers. Stretch goals are to confirm upfront whether demand is sufficient to hire more resources and commit to a bigger project where we try to accomplish everything this game was designed to become. \nWe also plan to apply to get additional funding from the Hong Kong government, Unreal Developers Grants, and Canadian government for additional grants and financing. We are grateful to have had the support of the HK Cyberport Microfinance Programwhich has helped develop our team and has paid a seed funding of $100,000 HKD (~USD $12,500) to help us cover costs of developing our new company and new game world.\nFirst independent article on Demon Knights of Ankhoron\n\"This is definitely one to keep an eye on...\" - fextralife.com\nhttps://fextralife.com/demon-knights-ankhoron-an-open-world-action-rpg-launches-kickstarter-campaign/\nNew independent video of Demon Knights @5:18 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1LcHOgCLYQ&feature=youtu.be\nAnother new article written on Demon Knights from an independent website  who say:  \"The NPCs and environment look great...\" and \"there will be plenty to explore in the game.\" - theplaystationbrahs.com Check them out!\nhttps://theplaystationbrahs.com/2019/11/08/demon-knights-by-archin-forge-games-on-kickstarter/\nhttp://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/revolutionary-action-rpg-bringing-traditional-2d-fighting-game-mechanics-to-a-3d-open-world-in-demon-knights-of-ankhoron-kickstarter-1263751.htm\nItalian News site - https://www.gamesark.it/notizia.php?n=611201910002247653\nhttps://yeeeah.fr/jeux-video/demon-knight-of-ankhoron-%E2%80%A2-action-rpg-kickstarter-trailer?fbclid=IwAR01qSQ0-U8_MgUBs0ZCZFAkUVR1oKqE6LhNmjz6TtYw5tHvcgpt_x73sbw\nhttp://www.rpgjeuxvideo.com/news-demon-knights-of-ankhoron-en-campagne-a175543714?fbclid=IwAR1iI1PtTxvfteis2kBMIZ1XIrcBr_68Rxsf8LfK7trlh2dbhptTv5WVJqc\nRussian news site- https://gameinonline.com/news/18933.html?fbclid=IwAR2rkVtJ-S611xatKb1yDTRZYAONbAYfQ6wcC_8AHs97j-8wCeqGVrOmgz4", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- Develop of complicated game may take more time than expected with buggy performance \n- Althought networking is working already, we expect full international online networked play will not be perfect to start and is not the first priority for us when launching the game.

I\u2019m Alex, I have a deep passion for making games. For the past 2 years, I have been creating a game that will captivate the shooter game community. Havoc\u2019s development is a big part of my life and I enjoy spending several hours a day working on it. Although, developing Havoc has had its ups and downs, it has been very fulfilling undertaking. I believe that gamers will find Havoc a  step above the average shooter game. I strove to design Havoc to offer players an alternative to the stagnant gameplay that plagues shooter games. My goal as a game designer is to develop games that are exciting to play and reward players for mastering the mechanics.  \nNew weapons, abilities, equipment, and maps will be added during weekly scheduled patch updates. We are always looking to add in new game modes, weapons, and abilities. Be sure to follow our Steam page to participate in community-based polls and discussions.\n\n\nOver a decade of game design experience, we have designed a first-class game HAVOC that infuses high levels of creativity with vigorous innovation. \nNow that our indie title is  getting close to be marketed to the public, we would like to invite the Kickstarter community to join us. We would like our Kickstarter friends to help us introduce our world class game Havoc to enthusiastic gamers worldwide. \nWith great optimism, we are excited to know that our Kickstarter friends are here to support us in reaching our strategic goal.

Play as one of the Forsaken, the last frontier of humanity against the growing horrors of the Omnistructure. As you find yourself stranded in a faraway outpost, you must adapt in order to survive. The world won't wait for you though, you must venture into the unknown - your faith will decide your fate.\nOur estimated release date would be:\nQ4 2019 for Early Access\nQ1-Q2 2020 for Full Release\nSubsequent updates with content, quality of life improvements, and potential bugfixes. \nPlatforms: PC (PS4 and Xbox are on our urgent roadmap, but won't be at the same time as the PC release, when we can cover the financial and logistical expenses more comfortably.)\nWe were initially going to include a console release as a stretch goal, but we felt that was unfair towards console gamers who would love to play the game. So we're going to be clear here:\nBleak Faith: Forsaken is going to release on PS4 and Xbox the moment we have the resources to do so - it's at the top of our priorities with bug fixes - we cannot give an accurate estimate at this moment of when that would be but a few months after a PC release could possibly be the date! However, it's not in our hands and a lot of steps have to be made before we get there and before we get approved. Bare in mind it's a crucial part of the development of this game for us so until it happens we're not quitting :)\nWe'll keep you updated on this as we develop and as the console release develops. We are however already close to finalizing controller input support! \nFeel the burden of surviving in one of the last remaining outposts of the Forsaken, a legion of hunters condemned to protect the last vestige of humanity. The nature of your purpose however is shrouded in mystery, and as you delve deeper into the manifold halls of the Omnistructure, you will come to find the true meaning of alienation, isolation, and dread. A cross between cyberpunk, and dark fantasy - Bleak Faith will offer a story and experience that will be a breath of fresh air for all gamers looking for a something new. The world is full of lore, and every aspect of it is crafted with utmost passion and a dedication to art. As a baseline there is an estimated 30+ hours of content, a deep class system, and a procedural AI system that ensures that no playthrough is ever the same.\nThe architecture of the world, the Omnistructure, is a huge aspect of the game. Meticulously designed and crafted, Bleak Faith aims to provide an emergent narrative method coupled with more structured traditional moments. The world of Bleak Faith is  labyrinthine, tapping into an innate curious instinct we all have when faced with many defined branching choices - we focus on creating a strong sense of curiosity about the path not taken, by offering unique and compelling content in every area of the world - having said that the world employs both vast open areas, and more linear openness in Metroidvania fashion. The aim is to evoke that same feeling of wonder and excitement that you felt the first time you played a game, the first time you experienced 3D graphics, the first time you experienced something that felt formative and not habitual. Open world in Bleak Faith is a crucial aspect to showing you the reality of the Forsaken. In this world there are few havens for the Forsaken, and these are generally outposts which serve as bases (of various complexities and utility) to recover from journeys and prepare for more - however, nowhere is truly safe!\nExpect tight and meticulously crafted and expanded combat that brings tempo and action to this world in amazing quality and detail. We're not shying away from a challenge, and so we're going all in. Despite being a small team, we couldn't accept a simple mundane combat system; we are making it fleshed out, and very robust. The combat communicates the danger in adrenaline-pumping fashion. Fast, responsive, and unforgiving - you will earn and feel every victory, nothing comes easy. Approach combat in your own way however - choose stealth over face-to-face combat, choose ranged over melee, choose Technomancy over more traditional combat styles. The system allows you to express yourself through combat, or through avoiding it - and that's further supported through a class system as well. \nHow better to experience the unyielding uncertainty of the Omnistructure than through a simulated ecosystem of factions and AI groups. Inhabitants of the Omnistructure will compete among themselves, grow and expand, change and adapt - the food chain in the ecosystem will, as a result, mold to every playthrough (e.g. an apex predator from your last playthrough might have already died out in this playthrough and you never fight it again). It's a constant race against time as enemies will try and outgrow and outsmart not only you, but other competition. Hunt, scavenge, and grow to stay on top of the food chain. Never experience an area the same way as the procedural nature of the ecosystem will ensure that you can never let your guard down. Having said that, there are still linear areas of the game, especially those that cover main plot points - to ensure a direction and purpose for the player. The ecosystem makes every moment of gameplay interesting and engaging - even on multiple playthroughs.\nFight against the odds, and stay alive despite the Omnistructure's evergrowing threat. Craft, scavenge, hunt, and find ways to excel. Pick a class, upgrade stats, augment your character, create equipment and stay healthy. Resist the Puppet Plague, and the many afflictions present in the world which can change the outcome of your journey entirely. Use stealth and your environment to your advantage - fighting is not always the best course of action, and when it is, preparing the field to shift the odds in your favor is a necessary tactic.  \nHere's a few small examples of both my process and the kind of artistic direction and quality this game is going in.\nConcepts:\nIn-Game Renders:\n Concepts:\n In-Game Renders:\nWe are two developers with a passion for games -  we've lead our entire lives to get to this point  - and now that we're here, we're going to do it right. As a result, we prefer to show and share our work frequently and not hide behind a veil of concept art and promotional art. We are transparent and never shy away from meeting our fans' expectations. Our focus is quality, and not excuses. We already have a playable prototype in which we test features and polish things. We have a long way to go but we are already so far into the project that most of the difficult hurdles have already been scaled. \nHaving said all that be sure to join the Discord and witness for yourself our dedicated engagement to our fans:\nhttps://discord.gg/cBUBJQb\nDevelopers\nMiso Vukcevic: Lead Developer, Artist, Writer, Sound Designer\nMirko Stanic: Co-Lead Developer, Programmer\nComposers\nCal Freundlich: Lead Composer\nRade Vukcevic: Composer \nWe want to crowdfund the game because we're building a game for gamers - not for investors. For this reason, the scope of our kickstarter is very small - only enough for the absolute necessities - the rest, we are covering ourselves because this project is our everything.\nWe want to publish independently and don't want anyone to have say that isn't us - and through us, YOU. But we need time, and we need some resources. Everything you've seen so far has been built on a minimal budget (savings). A budget boost that we could get from kickstarter will allow us to make the process of publishing and developing more streamlined. We don't and won't deal in exclusives, as that's part of making a game for gamers. We want to remain indie and we can only do that through you.  \nWe want to be clear that our goal and project doesn't require too much money. Our goal is humble and reasonable, and it's partly because we have a responsibility towards you - to uphold your rewards and to build a game. We don't want to fall into a situation where we're spending more time thinking about rewards than actually developing the game. What we planned to develop is all doable with this budget because we're a small team that has so far worked with no budget whatsoever. Having said all that, we won't push stretch goals far and if it goes beyond that, we still won't expand the stretch goals as we want to have the same focus we have now. Every new extra feature can add months to development - and we want to avoid pushing the release back. There are some very exciting features we're on the fence about that could change development estimates, and we'll share those with you and let you decide if they make it in the game or not.  \n The great thing about our studio and project is that it's very small, and that means we don't need too many resources to keep up the work we've been doing so far. The challenge is to reach the quality level of the best in the industry, while maintaining a pace while we move forward. Having a financial resource from you guys will allow us to completely move into only developing this game, giving us a tremendous boost both logistically and in motivation. You can tell we have a lot to offer from what we've shown, but what's to come is especially going to be impressive - we've laid the foundations of systems and gameplay already, and as a result progressive is going to be much more rapid moving forward.\nThe risks with this project are close to none. Like we said, this is more than just a project, this is our life - and we care about bringing everything to a standard that would allow you to experience this world as it was meant to be explored. But with your help we can do even more, and we can work even faster.\nA two man team allows the project to remain focused and brimming with passion. \nWe plan to incorporate our backers into the final stages of the design process by giving you a chance to delve into the Omnistructure yourself, to help us narrow and focus the project in a collective direction after we set the core of the game up.\nPrivate Discord\n    Be included in a private Discord chat room where suggestions are welcome.\nDigital Wallpaper\n     A digital wallpaper of the first bleak faith \nDigital Game Copy\n      A digital copy of the game, valued around USD $45.\nDigital OST Album\nAn album containing the original soundtracks in the game by our incredibly talented Lead Composer  and on more by one more of our other Composers, hear some preview samples below:\n Cal Freundlich sample Broken Pieces\n\n Harry Critchley sample Broken World\nPLAY\n\nDigital Art Book\n(about 60-80 double-sided pages)\n    A book written and designed by me ( Mi\u0161o Vuk\u010devi\u0107 ). The book will contain a tremendous amount of art for Bleak Faith from pre-production (when the game was still just a graphic novel), and in production. It will also outline my process, and at times go very in-depth into the way I manage covering the entire front end alone - touching on topics such as motivation, creativity, inspiration, work ethic, and general themes that can be useful to everyone - not just gamers. \nMore Art Samples:\nEarly Access\n      Be included in the early projected access, and be one of the first people to play the game in Q4 of 2019. This is the stage where most of the content will be in, and the majority of bugs will be removed - however, the game will still not be fully optimized and running as smoothly as it will at full release.\nName in Credits\n     This is a special privilege, to be awarded a very limited space in the credits.

Having a financial resource from you guys will allow us to completely move into only developing this game, giving us a tremendous boost both logistically and in motivation.

To make that happen, they built a virtual private network (VPN) client directly into their product. That VPN functionality was the heart that beat in a platform that eventually grew to 4.5M registered members and hosted tens of millions of multiplayer game sessions before it merged with another platform in 2018. \nHowever, the new platform chose to leave the VPN functionality behind... Now, the founders of EvolveHQ want to bring VPN-enabled gaming back in a new, more powerful package all its own. A new product that delights in its power and simplicity \u2013 a product we call Bowstring.\nTL;DR\nSetting up virtual local area network (VLAN) parties over the web sucks. Bowstring makes it awesome.\nHow It Works\nBowstring is NOT a traditional VPN service. Its primary use is NOT to tunnel across the web to anonymize and/or obfuscate your internet traffic patterns. \nBowstring is designed from the ground up to create peer-to-peer virtual networks that look and function as though they exist on a common LAN, but in actuality are remote web connections.\nPeer-to-Peer = Power-to-the-People\nEssentially, anything you can do on a LAN you can do over the internet with Bowstring: \nPlay games. \nShare directories and files. \nAccess and stream media libraries.\nShare printers, and much much more.\nBowstring is optimized for multiplayer LAN-gaming. \nBowstring is built on the same world class VPN technology that supported EvolveHQ \u2013 the social network and collaboration toolset for gamers.\nYet we've designed Bowstring to be even more powerful and scaleable than its predecessor, thanks in part to an updated codebase, reduced application overhead, and true peer-to-peer connectivity and throughput. In the past, the EvolveHQ platform itself was a bottleneck to LAN play. With Bowstring, its sole purpose is stable, secure, localized connectivity. There's nothing to get in the way.\nMost virtual LAN products require users to know a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo network things like IP addresses, proxy settings, and \"NAT traversal\". Not Bowstring.\nBowstring makes it easy. Just host or join a virtual network via a simple link. The host automatically becomes a network controller and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, issuing addresses to connected clients, or guests, over a stable, encrypted connection. Virtual networks can be open or password-protected and stay connected as long as the host maintains the session.\nBowstring establishes efficient, secure peer-to-peer PC connections as part of an ad-hoc, shared network. Peer-to-peer can be particularly helpful in regions where international internet connectivity carries additional costs or where internet traffic is closely monitored. That's because Bowstring isn't dependent on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to route traffic. Instead, the host's location is the only network node that matters, and when guests connect to a node within the same region, they get the fastest, most efficient, and cheapest connectivity possible.\nRewards\nThis Kickstarter campaign will be the ONLY time we ask the universe whether or not this product should exist. If we reach our goal, we will bring it to market *as soon as possible*. If not, then we'll save everyone a lot of time and heartache.\n*ANY* amount is extremely appreciated. You are voting with your money, which is incredibly humbling. We want to thank you in advance for whatever level you choose to support Bowstring. If you're not old enough or don't have funds to support us at this time, now is a perfect time to put Bowstring on your Holiday wish list.\nThe $25 support tiers and higher offer discounted licensing for the eventual product, plus some very, very sexy incentives.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT TIERS (EXCEPT THE $125, $250, $500 and $1000 TIERS) ARE CUMULATIVE.

We are running this Kickstarter campaign in order to raise funds for cartridge, box and manual production.\nMicro Mages is a new platform game for the NES, play solo or with up to 4 players simultaneously. Fight to get the best score or cooperate to overcome challenging sections.\nNES version\nAll officially released console versions and regions are supported: NTSC NES, PAL NES, Famicom with a 72-to-60-pin cartridge adapter (not included).\nHigh-quality clones such as the retroUSB AVS and Analogue Nt mini are also supported. Furthermore, our testers confirmed the game works on the RetroN 5.\nDigital version\nAlternatively, we offer a ROM version. This allows you to play the game on your PC and many other platforms through the use of an emulator. \nAlongside the ROM download, we will provide easy-to-understand instructions on how to set up an emulator and play Micro Mages on a Windows PC.\nEnter the Demon Fortress. Built to torture pesky adventurers, this place is home to great treasure and ghastly creatures alike. But don't worry, you can count on allies like Fairies and Magical Seagulls to come to your help!\nMicro Mages is an homage to NES-era platformers. Being a homebrew NES game itself, it was made completely from scratch. We carefully distilled the spirit of the best games in the system's library, all the while drawing inspiration from the modern and putting our own spin on things, creating an experience like no other on the NES.\n\u00a9 Grzegorz Karkoszka. Pictures from Gamefest at gamesweekberlin 2018.\nWhile many homebrew games and later commercial NES releases can be upwards of 512 Kilobytes in size, we challenged ourselves to make the best game we could given the harsh limitations that the very first NES titles (e.g., Super Mario Bros.) had to deal with. That is, the whole game fits into 40 Kilobytes. Micro Mages could have been an NES launch title!\nAnd yet, fun was our number one priority, the classics were our benchmark. Half of the game's development time was spent on optimization and polish. Fluid gameplay, tight controls and a carefully balanced challenge were our dedication.\nMultiplayer mode\nThat's right, Micro Mages supports up to 4 simultaneous players. We made sure the game plays perfectly well in single player mode, but for that extra bit of fun, do invite friends and family!\nPlayers of all skill levels can take part in the action. Play carefully and cooperate to overcome difficult sections OR take risks, shove your friends into lava and snatch the high score!\nAs long as at least one player is alive, you won't lose a life. Dead players turn into ghosts and have the ability to help their comrades by freezing enemies. They can also destroy crates and treasure chests in the hope of finding a Fairy or Magic Seagull Feather that will bring them back to life.\nMicro Mages is full of surprises\nUp to 4 simultaneous players\n8 worlds spanning a total of 26 levels (normal + hard mode)\nDangerous traps, monsters and bosses\nSecrets!\nPassword function\n40 Kilobytes, fully optimized\nand more...\nWill you be able to beat it?\nTeam up with friends\nDiscover the different towers of the Demon Fortress\nCan you beat the dark forces?\nPictures from Gamefest at gamesweekberlin 2018. Picture on right by \u00a9 Grzegorz Karkoszka.\nDespite having only two controller ports, the NES can be extended with the FourScore multiplayer adapter that allows you to connect up to four controllers. Micro Mages is compatible with this adapter as well as the Hori 4-player adapter released for the Famicom.\nOn the left, the FourScore for the NES; on the right, the Hori adapter for the Famicom\n Update: the NES Satellite wireless 4-player adapter works, too!\nOur wish is to release Micro Mages in cartridge format and deliver it in a package worthy of the NES.\nWe have been working meticulously for the past two years to bring you an experience on-par with NES era commercial releases. The game and print data are finished, but it's a special financial challenge to produce cartridges, manuals and boxes in high quantities.\nThat's why we are seeking your help.\nExclusive to the NES version: cartridge, box and instruction booklet\nComprehensive instruction booklet: hero moves, enemies, worlds and more...\nWe are a two-man team from Berlin, dedicated to bringing new games to old hardware!\nJulius created Morphcat Games in 2011 when he released the NES demo Super Bat Puncher. He made other games during game jams and also composes music on his free time. On Micro Mages, he did the programming, created tools for data optimization as well as music and sound effects.\nNicolas joined Julius during the Ludum Dare 32 game jam and together they created a short NES game named Banana Nana. On Micro Mages, he made the graphics and levels as well as box and manual illustrations.\nThanks for your interest in our project and we would also like to send special thanks to:\nBroke Studio\nWeloveoldgames\nComputerspielemuseum Berlin\nBerlinGameScene.com\nSaftladen Indie Games Collective\nBooster Space\nBerlin Retro Game Slam\nNesdev community\nNintendoAge community\nFamiTracker", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing our first Kickstarter campaign, risk reduction is our highest priority.

Moglin Lore\nTwilly was the very first Moglin created. Artix drew him in bed in 2001 while watching DragonBall Z on the cartoon network. Twilly was originally bean shaped with hair like one of those troll pen thingies from the '80s. He also had tennis shoes. Supposedly because he was a time traveler and liked going to the mall. He was put into the original AdventureQuest game, but redrawn a few times... red, with a football shaped head and giant feet. It was not until the amazing artist Oishii came along that the version of Twilly that we all know and love was drawn. She has brought him to life across our games. She also drew the ebil Zorbak and the adorable Twig. Loved by players, Moglins have become the mascots of our games. They have special place in our hearts... now we will bring them into the real world for both us and the next generation.\nThank you\nSend us photos and stories of the amazing adventures you have with your moglins!\nFollow us on...\nArtix's Facebook\nArtix's Twitter\nArtix's Instagram\nCheck out all our games and creative stuff at www.Artix.com.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "A lil' Moglin Magic", "descp": "Thank you for supporting us!

In \"Life is Hard\u201c, the goal is to get money and reputation. You can achieve this by either being a regular citizen who starts his own small business or by becoming a well known criminal. It will be possible to rent apartments, basements for your crew and buy vehicles aswell.\n  You will have options to create your own, unique character who can wear different kind of clothes. You will start the game with your own little apartment but as you proceed and gain money and reputation, you will have the option to fully customize it. You can also buy houses where you can either live on your own or share with your friends. Housing plays a huge role in \"Life is Hard\". It is not only your spawn point, but it also your main storage. Here, you will find purchased clothes, your items and your car.\nexample for a player apartment\n  Everything you do will influence your reputation. By helping other players, you can gain reputation which allows you to take on new tasks and jobs. In contrast, robbing people damages your image, but opens new ways for you to pursue illegal activities such as creating drugs or robbing a bank.\n  an open world that gives you the option to visit various places.

I want to make sure everyone knows the core gameplay experience has been locked down. If you have any doubts about the game's quality, it's playable as of right now. Go to www.fatalvelocity.com and download the pre-alpha build right now. Message me and if I'm not at work, I'll be more than happy to show you the game! \n\nTeam Size & Development Speed: We were a 2 person team working part time on Fatal Velocity until July when we had an artist join the team. If the game is funded awesome! We can focus full time and pick up the pace getting more content out sooner. If the Kickstarter campaign exceeds expectations we can get more hands on deck really help push the developement speed and quality! \n\nContent Creep: A lot of teams suffer from not being able to axe their ideas if they don't work - closing the door for good on their babies. We approach game development with a chainsaw, if the idea works - AWESOME, if it doesn't, chop it down to see if it can fit and if it still doesn't, burn it. Not facing up to the limitations, hard deadlines can end up being very costly and will only bring more problems towards development.\n\nMultiplayer Server Browser: We've only dabbled into creating server browsers, so there's no denying this will definitely take time. We'll ask those who do know and move forward on this. Don't worry though, we have quick connect working so you can still play with friends and others right now! \n\nBeing Unknown: Anonymity is the sweet, bitter kiss of death for any new game developer/team. Nothing sucks more than working your dream project, only to end up flying under the radar and all the work and the potential going to waste. We've been reaching out to YouTubers, Twitch streamers, curators, journalists to get their feedback on the game and all throughout Fatal Velocity's existence we'll keep contacting others to help get as much attention on it as possible for as long as possible. \n\nNew Game Concept Means Experimentation: The design of Fatal Velocity is quite unique, especially when it comes to weapons, abilities and level designing. It's been a very meticulous design process, but ultimately answering the question when anything new is added, \"is this fun and does this have purpose?\" There's no path to follow for FV so a lot of time has been spent throwing ideas at the wall and seeing what stuck. For example, a new game mode like Spider-Man + Quidditch sounds like it would be a cool idea, but would it be fun? Time would be invested in finding out! \n\nKeeping the community up to date: If you have any doubts on the updates, we make a development vlog about Fatal Velocity's progress roughly every 2 weeks. Jaime also does what he calls a \"Fatal Velocity Rambles\" where he talks about FV as a whole, ideas and all! We're very proud of our work, so we post on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube often! \n\nFunding Amount: The more monies we get the more contracts can be sent out and to get high quality unique assets made! Not depending on Turbosquid, CGTrader or the Unreal Marketplace for assets would be incredible!

I believe that both crafting and building are only fun with reasons to engage in and improve them. They need purpose and sustainability.\n     That's exactly where the term \"Solace Crafting\" comes from. Solaces are a player crafted facility that act as a beacon for instant travel in a boundless multiverse. When a Solace is placed or upgraded, it must be defended for several minutes as evil spawns to try and stop it. As difficulty is based on our distance from the start, placing Solaces deeper into the wild becomes increasingly challenging, asking players to unlock and upgrade new traps, gather stronger resources, craft better equipment, befriend stronger allies, and increase their combat abilities.\n     I love building and crafting games like Minecraft, Terraria, and 7 Days to Die. Another part of me loves fantasy role-playing games like Everquest and Dungeon & Dragons Online. In 30 years of gaming I never found a game that bridged those two genres together in the way I always imagined. Building and crafting were always just tossed in like a mini-game, letting players dabble in it if they wanted to. I was done waiting for someone to design something better.\n     This is me, following my dream, taking development into my own hands. I spent five years making sure I knew what I wanted to do and how to do it. Now that my goal is in sight, this campaign will allow me to focus full-time long enough to finish the final stages of early access.\nSpecial Features\n(almost all features below are already in-game and working)\n     View the world around you over 48 kilometers(35 miles) in all six directions. Our distance engine renders not only the landscape but encounters like floating islands, pyramids in the desert, NPC towns, and more. This lets you choose what content to engage in, with global events like meteor showers now possible on a massive scale.\n       The further we travel from the start, in any direction, the higher the level of monster, encounter, and quests we will encounter. This lets us control when and where we move to the next level, with no strict limitations. Higher level also does not mean \"end-game\" grind, only difficulty increases, not time spent, or experience required to level. Resources, loot, quests, everything evolves as you push deeper.\n       Summon a new Solace almost anywhere in the multiverse for instant travel back and forth from your castle in the mountains to your forge deep underground removing the need to walk back and forth.\nBuild traps and hire defenders to help protect against several waves of monsters that will try to interrupt summoning and upgrading\nStore unlimited resources on an omniversal network, accessible within range of any Solace\nConnect to parallel dimensions and elemental planes\nUpgrade any Solace's range, power, visibility, aura, and more\nHelp strengthen and defend NPC Town Solaces for rewards\n     Our unique crafting system offers simple yet complete customization of all equipment and enchantment recipes. Swords, bows, gauntlets, any type of equipment can be easily customized to fit your level and class, never forced to use what's \"best,\" or only what's available.\nEasily customize equipment color, set enchants, rarity and more. No preset recipes.\nNo timers, no mini-games, no sub-components, and no cross dependency.\nImprove entire professions and sub-categories with unlocks and upgrades.\nAll recipes can be used by all levels.\n(Video update on crafting from July 2017)\n       Spend your skill points on as many skill trees as you like, mixing sword and sorcery, to create a truly unique character. We're aiming for variety and fun instead of strictly balanced presets.\nSkill trees branch and evolve unlocking rewards, recipes, passives, and new skills depending on where you spend your points.\nAdd support abilities to your skills granting fire damage, a chance to stun, and more, even across different class trees, making for thousands of possible combinations.\n       Shape and color your hero to match your idea of \"heroic\". Plump, skinny, tall, and short, we want players to play who they want. Mix ears, fangs, tails, and more with no \"racial\" restrictions.\n       Our adaptive building interface allows easy and precise building upwards and outwards without the need to crawl and jump. We want to have fun, rather than make players spend hours to get anything done.\nNeatly organized interface designed to grow with new content.\nBuild freely with no physics based limitations, no falling apart.\nBuildings do not decay or disappear over time.\nUse the keyboard to move and build massive structures in no time.\n(Video update on player building from June 2017)\n       Harvesting often takes up a fair amount of player time in crafting games. I'm working hard to make the experience more entertaining with harvesting specific skills and abilities to help extract, explode, and seek out resources. Leveling up your harvesting professions also gives you the opportunity to unlock harvesting specific enchants and recipes to personalize your tools with.\n      Encounters are the main source of experience, recipes, and rare resources. They can be as small as a pair of elementals guarding a rift tear, to an extended siege on an NPC town that you've helped construct and must now defend against evil.\n    Encounter quests are built to support crafting and building just as much as exploration and adventure. Imagine coming across a wizard at level 16 who says he needs a new staff, or a town ravaged by wolves that is in desperate need of a new fence. Repairing the fence can lead to setting up further defenses, which can then lead to a timed defense campaign, earning you a new enchant recipe, a permanent fast-travel location, and a new type of guardian for your own defenses.\nNPC towns are aware of and can direct players to encounters up to 4km(2.5mi) away.\nHelp towns evolve gaining access to vendors, fast-travel, defenders, recipes, and more.\n       My name is Kyle Postlewait. Seattle born geek and mountaineer, I found my ambition living in Japan over the past eight years. I love to create things both digital and physical, whether I'm cooking, woodworking, or landscaping.\n     Currently, I work at an aluminum and zinc foundry designing machines for the automobile industry. My work requires very strict data control and management skills. I have learned a lot working in an ISO certified environment, both as a team member and as a leader, and have brought many of these skills with me into game development.\n     On my journey thus far I've run into thousands of people just like me looking for a chance to create music, models, animations, and more. I work with some of them already, and hope to work with many more.\n     After feeling let down by several big titles, and down right swindled by several others, I decided to create my own studio and work hard to do and be better. Thus, Big Kitty Games was founded atop five major guidelines:\nTo be honest: No pay-to-win. No squandering funds (funds are not profit!). No paid DLC. No racism. No sexism. No bigotry. Additions pending.\nTo promote good sportsmanship wherever possible.\nTo seek the middle ground of rated content. No excessive gore, excessive violence, or unnecessary sexual content.\nTo prioritize problematic content. Bug fixes and anti-cheat countermeasures should always take top priority.\nTo be community driven. We will include our community in design decisions and promote content submission as much as possible.\n     As a husband and owner of four cats I need a minimal source of income to buy cat toys and kitty litter. With Kickstarter I'm reaching out for that minimal survival quotient, backed up by my savings, so that I can switch to full-time game development instead of a couple hours of free-time after work.\n     Kickstarter also brings with it a great platform to connect directly with backers, engage in open discussions, and form a lasting community.\nHow can one person achieve this?\n     Rest assured I am not doing this alone. I am the only active developer yes, but I work hand in hand with a variety of developers to help improve their tools for terrain, weather, animations and more. These in turn improve the visual quality and functionality of Solace Crafting.\n     I am not seeking to create AAA graphics, favoring instead replayability and growth potential. The pivotal role that Solaces play in player progression through the game world brings in tons of potential for growth. Building and upgrading Solaces in increasingly difficult areas rewards quick access to higher level resources, quests, and more, creating clear and immediate benefits to improving your building and crafting skills.\n     The next big step after our more immediate goals of quests, skills, and defenses are realized is the introduction of The Elemental Planes.\n     With crafting and building present as core features of the game, having dimensions rich in rare resources such as stone, wood, and metal, makes for wonderfully contrasting landscapes. The current world is very Earth-like with trees and grass, mountains and lakes, but with The Elemental Planes and beyond, I look forward to working with much more fantastic art themes to compliment our distant engine. \n       On a planet called Ace a group of common-folk began to travel the astral planes. These prodigies brought to Ace wisdom and magic far beyond their time. They visited lands that alien races had long ago abandoned, mines deep within planets too hostile for surface life, and frozen landscapes that floated above unseen forces. The stories and artifacts they brought back with them seemed to usher in the start of a golden age of wisdom and adventure.\n     One prodigy however was deceived by his own curiosity, as he traveled deeper and deeper into realms not meant for mankind. His name was Foridal of Garreath, the Northern most kingdom of Ace. Though he believed his actions of good nature, he brought nothing but sorrow and misery to his people. The snows of the North spread further with each passing year, as Foridal's following silently grew. Communication with Garreath was eventually abandoned to horror stories of sacrifice and ritual.\n     The Students, a group formed under the tutelage of the prodigies, was to stand against Foridal and his Blood Cult. Fearing for all life, you travel to the City of Time to join their cause. As is ritual for all newcomers you are brought before the Core Shard, a giant crystal said to reach to the very heart of the planet. When touched Students are bound to the Core Shard, allowing them to return from their astral studies no matter how far they may wander.\n     Reaching your hand forward you touch the Shard. A deep purple light surrounds your body as the instructor nearby gasps. You see his face, eyes spread wide in surprise, as the world around you folds onto itself. Seasons flash by, images of space, lands you have never visited, colors you have never seen. Then all is black.\n     And then, you smell grass. You feel warm. Your face rests on bare earth. Opening your eyes you stand up. Your clothes are missing, yet you are unharmed. The sun shines warm on your skin. A breeze sways the leaves of the trees nearby. There are no buildings nor people you can see, only lush green, a lake in the distance, snow peaked mountains on the horizon.\n     A crystal the same purple as the Core Shard of Ace pulses from several steps away, this one just taller than you, wide as a palm trunk. Without sound or movement it somehow beckons you. You hear only birds and the wind. As you approach the crystal slowly, words come into your mind.\n     \"This is not your planet. You are not what you were. You must grow. You must find yourself. You must save the Multiverse.\" The pulsing fades, though you can sense the crystal is somehow alive.\n     The expected alpha release delivery date is three months. After that, online sales should be enough to support the project. Game development is however not without unforeseen problems, and selling a broken version to the public is never a good idea. Thus, the below budget is calculated for six months of frugal spending.\n     With full-time development funded I can be online every day answering community questions, taking in player input, posting updates, and everything that a transparent developer should do. Any funding beyond the minimum goal will primarily be used to contract artists around the world for more original game content including equipment models, monsters, environments, music, and more.\n     The rewards are heavily targeted at letting backers become a permanent part of Solace Crafting. Want to get your voice in? Your favorite quote? Your cat's name? Don't see something you think should be in the rewards? Let me know!\n     Don't forget you can absolutely pledge a custom amount to buy multiple rewards. If you're confused on how to do that, just let me know and I'll be glad to help.\n     In general all content must be of a good and positive nature, and be more or less fit into a classic fantasy setting:\nNo sexually explicit content\nNo gore or blood\nNo swear words, or overly offensive language\nNo reference to any real-world groups or individuals, past or present\nNo guns, steampunk, or modern technology\nNothing too silly like a big halibut for a sword\nEnglish and Japanese only (for now)\nAll content must be entirely original work, and forfeit all intellectual property rights\nAnything of a 3D nature can be submitted as a sketch or even just a description\nAll content submitted in digital format is subject to alteration\n     Unless anonymity is requested, all backer and community content will include the artists name or nickname in-game (when possible) and on our website.\nPoem: around 10-50 words\nShort Story: less than 2000 characters\nChampion & Hero: name and saying\nTownsperson: name, saying, and appearance\nAstral Prodigy: name, saying, and appearance\n     -Steam Achievement for finding you in-game\nQuest NPC: name, saying, and appearance\n    -Quest line of up to four steps with reward\nBoss: Full customization (attacks, area, story, etc)\n     Any support for Solace Crafting is supporting not only my passion and dream of a better crafting and building heavy RPG, but also my vision of a gaming studio that promotes sportsmanship, community, and creative team PvE content. Whether the campaign fails or raises a million dollars I will continue to pour my heart and soul into building a like-minded online community.\n     I'm sure there are many unforeseen trials ahead, and I am certain that I will not have to face them alone thanks to the love and support I have received on my now five year journey into game development.\n     Please feel free to contact me via the comments, social media, or our website if you need any assurance that I am in this for the long run. Thank you for reading to the end, and I hope you've found an interest in what I'm working on.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is no risk of Solace Crafting not being delivered. The game already has a fully functional build, live and frequently updating on Steam for testers.\n Unforeseen delays are certainly possible, that's why the budget is calculated at six months instead of my goal of three. I am prioritizing a functional, optimized, and bug free game instead of AAA graphics and animations.\n Due to the nature of Solace Crafting, multiplayer is the largest challenge on the horizon.

The game features 2 factions and 4 different classes with unique Talents and weapons to make every fight an interesting battle of who uses his Talents and weapons the best.\nWhilst you have one account, you can create numerous different characters. Character creation is really simple: Select a faction, a class and customize the looks of your character. Complete the creation by giving your character a nice name and jump into battle!\nSince Renegade Line is a multiplayer game we strive to always keep it fresh by adding new game modes and having 100 Levels for you to reach.\nAdditionally you will be able to proof your skill in the Ranked Gamemode, where you can climb the ladder and become the best player in the world. This goes hand in hand with our big goal of creating a new eSports compatible game that requires good tactics as well as fine mechanical skills of the individual player.\nCompletely customize your character to make it truly yours by combining hundreds of different clothing items. You can buy complete outifts or create your own. To perfect the style, you will also be able to get cool looking weapon and vehicle skins, which differ in rarity.\n  It's quite simple: After you create your account, you will be able to create your first character. Each character is unique, with it's own name, outfits, weapons and weapon skins. Let's run through the creation process together.\n                                                                               Play casually until level 30 and unlock all your Talent points.\nOnce you hit level 30 you can seek more competitiveness by playing Ranked Games. These games will give you a permanent rating depending on your performance. The better your performance, the higher your rank will be.\nThe different ranks of the Ranked Mode\n    Renegade Line is a unique game\nIt offers your character to have up to 7 different Talents, which you can level up individually by using Talent Points. This makes each of the 4 classes more dimensional, since you can have different play styles depending on the way you select and skill your Talents. Let's take the Spotter class as an example: You can be the front line, making room for your team by dealing lots of damage and forcing the enemies to retreat  or you focus on supporting your team with utility, by healing allies and slowing down enemies.\nMany games use first person view, but we decided to go with third person. While this doesn't impact your overall shooter gameplay that much, it requires you to keep more track of your surroundings, since your field of view is way bigger than in a first person shooter.\n   The Company Behind the Game\nWe at Raw Vengeance are gamers as well, just like you. This means we know how frustrating it can be, when developers seem too distant or disconnected from their communities. This won't happen with RenegadeLine and RV Games. We are part of the community just like everyone else. We play the game, just like everyone else. We will compete in clan wars and post on the forums, just like everyone else.\nAll in all we try to break the common separation of developers and players by becoming part of the community, interacting and engaging with one another and building a strong bond between us, the players and the game.\nYou are Part of the Development\nThe mentioned bond between developers and players will be strengthened by inviting you to be part of the development.\nWe will make polls where you can choose what you want to see in Renegade Line. It's our goal to bring you the best game possible. You often decide what gets implemented, what we'll be working on next and what might need some changes or adjustments.\nGive us your ideas in the Suggestions Forum, which is our favourite forum section, because we can read all the great concepts of our community. We already implemented community made weapon skins and reworked our theme song after taking in feedback.\nIf voting in polls and posting feedback on the forums isn't enough for you, then we've got you covered. We will release a map editor that enables you to create you own unique maps by either using our resources or your own. Every few months a contest will be hosted featuring the best community made maps. The ones with the most votes from the community will then be implemented into the game for everyone to enjoy.\n  Competitive and Clan Scene\nAs mentioned above: We are passionate players ourselves and thus really like to watch games being played at the highest skill level. We try to push the competitive aspect of the game through the Ranked System, providing you with an incentive to play as best as you can, and a clan system. The clan scene will be supported by providing interesting tools, like a transfer market for players, but also prizes and tournaments. Clans will also be able to create their own page on our website where they can form clan groups, create a clan image, a clan tag and much more.\n   Clothing Customization\nIt would be quite stale and boring if every soldier on the battlefield looked the same. That's why you can equip your character with various different clothing items to make him look unique and truly like your character. You will be able to wear and purchase complete outfits or single items. We will also offer special and rare clothing items, which will make your character stand out even further from the rest. Let's be honest, who doesn't want to beat the enemy in style?\n   Weapon Skins\nApart from clothing items, you will be able to purchase weapon skins, which will change the visuals of your weapon. These skins won't affect the gameplay in any way, they will only change the appearance of the gun. Here we can go even crazier than with the clothing system: Different weapons can look different, have different animations and also different muzzle flashes.\n  Taunts\nWith an awesome outfit that you put together, and a nice weapon skin you already look great when showing the enemies who is boss. But to put enemies on tilt, you can also equip your character with a couple of taunts. These are special animations created to make you laugh while your enemies rage. Use them for your own delight or to tease an enemy after you killed them.\n      After the end of the World War II, brothers Edward and Roland returned to their home in Heimstadt. The city had been devastated by the war and underground gangs had taken over what remained. After rallying the people and taking back control of the city, they started reconstructing the city to how it used to be. A dispute broke out between the brothers as the people of Heimstadt wanted Roland to become the new mayor, while Edward felt that he deserved the title more. As such Edward teamed up with the gangs and overthrew Roland, taking Heimstadt by force. Roland fled to a neighbouring city called Granndorf where he is now assembling an army to retake Heimstadt before Edward does something radical with his political power.\nWho will you choose to support?\n    It's important for us that we are able to create a game meeting our own and especially your expectations. We didn't have any budget and invested our blood, sweat and tears into this project. Kickstarter allows us to develop the game without the need of a publisher or investor, which means we are free to follow our concepts and ideas of a great and fair game.\nRenegade Line has been in development for about two years now.  We were able to get a lot of stuff done, but some features still need some work:\nCompleting the two unfinished classes Sniper and Thief\nCreating an extended launcher and client system\nReworking the characters to make them look even more awesome\nMaking the animations smoother and more diverse\nA good base amount of game servers for everybody\nDeveloping needed features for the Renegade Line website\nImproving the overall performance of the game\nPie chart showing our investments by departments\n    Alright! Let's go through some selected features we are planning for the future.\nBring the maps to life   \nLater on, Renegade Line's maps will be inhabited by a number of different animals and more vegetation. The animals have their own animations and will interact with the world.\nWalkable main menu\nThe walkable main menu will be a large MMORPG-like map, in which you can dress your character, buy yourself a nice new weapon skin or just hang around with your friends. We will be hosting special events at certain occasions like Halloween, Christmas or Easter aswell.\nVehicles\nIn the future, Renegade Line will provide vehicles like cars, tanks, planes and even boats. Of course we will make sure, that there are maps for vehicles, aswell as maps just for infantry! Additionally, we will implement vehicle skins, so that the vehicles change their style if you enter them.\nGame modes\nAs it's our mission that you don't get bored, there will be a whole bunch of typical, but also really unusual, fun gamemodes. Just to name a few: Hide and Seek, Car Race, Accuracy Competitions, Kill/Death Competitions, One Versus One Duel, Jumping Puzzles, Surfing Mode and SO much more.\nVS Finder\nWorry about finding a fun match? Worry no more! No matter if you're a single player, a group of friends or even a clan, the VS Finder will help you find a fitting enemy. Just set your preferences, click on connect and jump in!\nExtended Trading System (Black market)\nAs we have a lot of player specific items in Renegade Line, we will implement a black market aswell. You can purchase or sell anything from a super rare weapon skin to a common pair of gloves for your new character.\nRenegade Line App\nBut wait! What if you're not at your PC and there is a black market deal to be made? Or if you want to organize a quick match against another clan tomorrow evening? Easy!

With stunning visuals, innovative camera mechanics and solid RPG crafting and story elements, Redlock Studios has struck a chord with this game.\"\nPhil Elliott, director of indie development, Square Enix.\n           Hi there. It looks like you're here to learn more about Shattered: Tale of the Forgotten King, and it seems like I am the perfect conduit for this. In case you are wondering, this is the astounding creature called the Whisperer, fellow citizen of Hypnos's kingdom, now talking to you.\nLet's get started. My creator, Maxime Ren\u00e9, has been working on stories around my universe for about ten years. He created lots of artwork, wrote many tales and even developed role-playing games based on that mythology. A year ago, he decided to take the ultimate step and gathered a team together - called Redlock Studio - to finally bring it all to life. And now is the time for you to help!\nI'm looking forward to meeting you all in the game, dear Wanderers...\n      Maybe he dreamt himself up, birthed from the first spark, within his own creative consciousness. Maybe something greater breathed him to life. The truth is without a doubt beyond our humble reach and stretches past all philosophical considerations. And it might be better this way. From a thought he conjured up the Void. From a glance, he made the world. And from a whisper, he created us.\nFor his kingdom, the first word came in a whisper. Before knowing what the sky, a mountain or a river was, this word echoed within our souls. From our birth to our last breath, we would serve and protect Hypnos.\nAmong countless wonders of his creation, we thought we would live and dream forever.\nThen the King left. Nobody, even among his closest subjects, happened to know where and why he was gone, nor if he was still alive. Hypnos lost its soul without a warning or an explanation. From this moment, the kingdom gradually fell into a misty limbo.\nFrom darkness and oblivion, unnatural entities entered this too-far-gone world and crushed everything that remained, shattering the realm in three separate pieces. Soon, it was nothing more than a dead land shaped in silence, ashes and shadows.\n\nThousands of years passed, or maybe just a moment. And no one remembers these lost times.\n  Without any memories of your past, now begins your quest for truth. As you march on those strange places, you'll face incredibly powerful and mythic creatures; learning about them, and your own destiny.\nWait a minute. Here are a few things you may like to know before you dive into Hypnos's fractured lands by yourself...\nEvery living thing in the world of Hypnos was born silent with a mask that defines their personality. Few came to life with a name, which could only be given by the King and defined the purpose of their existence.\nThe only ones who can talk are called Whisperers. They're nothing like other people: Whisperers wear no masks, but handle words for the silent ones.\nThe Pretorians were once part of the Royal Army. Unlike normal citizens, they abandoned their mask and name to wear the Pretorian armor and served the King until their last breath...Or, at least, until he wasn't there anymore. Now, they serve other masters...\nThe Demiurges, as they were named, are the ferocious entities that rose when Hypnos was falling. They are the last lords of the truth and mysteries of the world.\nThe story of Hypnos yet has to be discovered and the future is in your hands. Will you help the Wanderer on his journey?\n  2D PLATFORMER\nThe challenge for the player is to explore the whole, wide-ranging level, and then to solve it as a large-scale puzzle.\n Each zone is made of :\nOne major puzzle that the player has to solve to progress through the adventure.\nThree minor puzzles that will give you access to secret zones or different scenaristic nodes.\n    In this part, you must survive lethal traps, solve many enigmas and find your way through labyrinthic levels.\n3D DYNAMIC BOSS FIGHT\nThrough the game, the player will face 12 bosses, the Demiurges, and legions of the Fallen: dead creatures and citizens of the realm are now their servant and minions. There are different behaviour patterns for each one of them.\nThe fighting system is as pure as possible, relying on:\nPlayer's dexterity, reflexes and sense of timing. Light and heavy attacks, dodging, feinting and dashing are at the very heart of the gameplay and lead to special attack chains.\nSkills acquired and used during the platforming phases.\n      STORYTELLING\nThe story is narrated throughout in the following ways:\nThe Whisperer's narrative\nScrolls from the Geodesian Book, common objects in each level\nEibon fragments, hidden in some dark places.\n  Each one carries its own vision of the story. Indeed, Shattered encourages players to collect different lore elements that will tell portray differing perspectives (if not the precise opposites) about Hypnos. You'll then have to reconstruct the truth according to your interpretation of the varying stories you've uncovered.\nRPG COMPONENTS\nSKILL SYSTEM: Unlock different passive or active skills depending on how you want to play the game. Some hidden skill trees will give different skill sets, depending on the battles you fight and levels you complete.\n  CRAFTING SYSTEM: Every killed monster will drop Limbo Essences, which are the in-game currency. You can use them to heal yourself or throw them in the alchemical crucible. The crucible allows you to create several consumables, plus items to merge with your equipment in order to change your stats according to your preference. You can also improve your alchemy skills by collecting cardinal slivers.\nLANGUAGE : Every single Eibon's fragment is a letter of the alphabet. The more you have, the more you'll be able to translate the Demiurges' strange language. The player will need to understand and handle properly those elements to discover the most complete ending.\n    We had so many ideas for the rewards that it was hard to chose between all of them. Aside from the \u201cgoodies for fun and style\u201d as we like to call them, we truly wish to offer you rewards that are directly connected to the game to extend your experience: original role-playing notes, universe books, added lore fragments etc... The fact that you will to share this adventure makes us so proud and grateful that we really want to offer the best. Thanks again dear Wanderers, if it wasn't for you, this project wouldn't exist.\n        The Redlock is a mystic place, a path between the universes. It is born of a will to create an intricate and captivating world. Shattered is one of the first stones. We're a French studio based in Lyon (FR) that has attracted many artists and engineers, due to our game\u2019s special atmosphere, its graphic style and lore. Today, eight souls have joined Redlock Studio, supported by the work of a dozen other wanderers.\nOur goal with Shattered is to deliver an intense storytelling experience, with emotive scenery and epic boss fights. We work on creating an intimate world, through a complex tale. We want to tell a story in which the different endings are complementary, to bring a global vision and a message open to players' interpretation.\nAs the Redlock team grew up very fast and the feedback around the project were so encouraging, we decided to go to Kickstarter to make the exact game we were dreaming of for so long. As a matter of fact, our artistic director and scenarist have been working on the Hypnos' universe for the last seven years. It is a large, complex and fully thought-out world, which now needs your help to take foot in our reality... Our first goal of EUR 80 000 is enough to fund the game, but not to remain fully independent. That would be the necessary amount to rise external funds or find some publisher \u2013 which is already done if we finally need to. So, aside from allowing us to add ingame content, reaching higher funding levels would let us remain independent... Which would be amazing.\nWith Kickstarter, we want to buy some time to spend on Shattered, and be able to build a really huge game for you to enjoy.\nWe, as Redlock Studio, also wish to make other games in the future, with all their universes interconnected. Helping us here and now, means helping us tomorrow... And becoming a part of Hypnos' world means becoming a part of the others to come!\nHear the Whispers\nLet the journey begin.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe all worked for about a year on Shattered without any financial ressources, so we have a pretty good idea of how hard game development can be. \n\nBut we also have a pretty good idea of what we are capable of now : we've gained self confidence, mutual trust and composure to go on on this adventure. To say it quickly, we're confident about Shattered, because we're determined to bring it to the end whatever may happen. Plus, several professionals from the game dev industry are interested in our studio and ready to help and direct us if needed... \n\nSo, be sure we won't give up !\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Lost Soul", "descp": "Beside a huge thank you from the entire team, you'll have your name on our ingame Hall of Fame !", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["89 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Wanderer", "descp": "You get a copy of the game as soon as it's released, a bunch of great HD Wallpapers and your name on the Hall of Fame !\nINCLUDES:\nCopy of the game\nHD Wallpapers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,079 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac40 or more", "title": "Alchemist", "descp": "A copy of the game, full digital OST, HD wallpapers and an exclusive alternative skin for your character.

Visit ProjectGorgon.com For Latest News!\nThanks to everyone who pledged! We fell far short of our financial goal, but we hit record high server populations, and the new players' enthusiasm is infectious and wonderful and very much appreciated. We're looking into other funding options now. Check the blog on ProjectGorgon.Com for more info.\nProject: Gorgon is a 3D fantasy MMORPG (massively-multiplayer online role-playing game) for PC, Mac, and eventually Linux. It has an unusual, original feel, freely mixing ideas from older and newer MMOs with a whole bunch of ideas never before seen in any MMO.\nIt's designed for players who want to explore a deep world with complex game systems and a tight-knit community that is friendly enough to actually chat while they group.\nYou can play a very early version of the game right now, at projectgorgon.com/play-now, and see for yourself if this is something you want to be a part of.\n\"We already have plenty of MMOs,\" you may be thinking to yourself. \"This is just another generic fantasy game. I've already played this.\"\nNo, you haven't. And unless you've been playing MMOs for over a decade, you may not even know what you're missing!\nA decade ago, World of Warcraft came out and changed the MMO industry forever. It's an amazing game, and completely worthy of its success, but it had a nasty side effect on the MMO industry: other game companies saw the success this game had, and suddenly every business plan was to \"be the next World of Warcraft.\" (I was there, making MMOs. It was a weird time.)\nEach new MMO tried to copy as much of WoW as possible, assuming that was the secret to capturing the same audience. And now, a decade later, the term \"MMO\" is almost synonymous with this sort of directed MMO experience. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun experience! But it's only one possible kind of MMO.\nIf you've been playing MMOs for the better part of the last decade, you might be bored of them. You might naturally assume you'd seen everything there is to see in the genre. Fortunately for you, you couldn't be more wrong.\nOriginally, each new MMO found its own balance between the two extreme design ideas of \"tight, directed game\u201d, or \u201cimmersive, explorable world\". After World of Warcraft, MMOs all seem to use the same answer. But we answer this basic dichotomy in a totally different way.\nProject: Gorgon heavily rewards exploration. Go poke in corners and see what you find! Entire dungeons, hidden NPCs, all kinds of items, even entire skills and abilities... all waiting for you to discover.\nDon't worry if that sounds intimidating! There'll be a solid tutorial, of course (and you can see an early version in the game right now). And to help get you started, we'll have \"directed storylines\" that are akin to classic MMO quest lines, and help tell the overarching story. But once you're comfortable, we hope you'll go exploring \u2013 because most of Project: Gorgon doesn't have signposts.\nWhen you play Project: Gorgon, we want you to feel like you're immersed in a whole new virtual world. Rather than try to manage this with just some pretty graphics and excessive backstory, though, we\u2019ve designed the game with dozens of gameplay features that make you feel like you're really there, interacting with the world, such as:\nIf you're on fire, you can jump in a lake to put it out. That kind of real world touch can have a subtle effect on your strategies \u2013 especially when you\u2019re fighting a fire mage!\nYou can drop items on the ground, and other players can pick them up. What's so great about that? Imagine laying down a trail of literal (virtual) breadcrumbs to lure one of your friends into the woods.\nShopkeepers really keep inventory, so you can buy the items other players sold them. Want to help out the newbies? Sell your cast-off uber weapons to the shopkeep in the newbie zone and watch them go to town.\nEach non-player character (NPC) you meet has their own goals and interests, and rewards players that choose to be their friend.\nYou can inscribe messages on items, write books, even leave notes for other players. Make your name as an in-game poet, or just record your best kills on your sword.\nAnd lots more subtle but very immersive stuff like that. These aren't the big features that make an MMO, but all of them combined make for a very unique world feel.\nI've been making MMOs for a long time and I have a lot of crazy ideas I've always wanted to try out. A bunch of them are in this game:\nYou can discover \"words of power\" and then say them in chat to activate their magic.\nSkills are all intertwined in interesting ways. Want to be the best swordsman ever? Practice your calligraphy to get better hand-eye coordination with the sword!\nA unique dual death-penalty system. Explore the world without fear of death, but when it comes time to fight boss monsters, you'd better take it seriously!\nWant a scarier game? Customize your death penalty. Why should a game only have one death penalty, anyway?!\n\"Behavior badges\" recognize what you do in game. Want to be a vegetarian? Okay, just don't eat meat! Pacifist? Fine. Refuse to wear helmets? Sure, okay. The game recognizes these things, and many others. Players can see it on your character sheet. You don't get anything special for it -- just recognition of your choices.\nPlus we have lots of weird crafting ideas, fun new ways to let players create content for one another, and a lot more in the works.\nA lot of the game is about killing monsters and taking their stuff, and you'll do often. So we\u2019ve designed Project: Gorgon to keep the experience fun and interesting. Our combat mechanics are fresh and we\u2019re still trying out new ideas every week in development. Loot is randomly generated; monsters each have unique abilities; and dungeons have puzzles, traps, and terrifying bosses!\nAnd the combat skills! These are entirely free-form. You can learn as many combat skills as you want, and use any two of them at the same time to create your own personal \"class\". There are many skills already in the game, plus many more to come. Some of the current ones are:\nBattle Chemistry: Create huge explosions! Inject yourself with mysterious mutagens! Program a pet golem!\nUnarmed Combat: Grapple and control enemies using a situational-aware combo system that varies based on where you are and even what day it is.\nAnimal Handling: Tame animals and train them to become ferocious fighters. Then breed your best and sell their offspring to other players!\nNecromancy: Seek out corpses and graveyards to raise your army. No graveyard around? Well... there's always the corpses of your friends...\nThat's just a sample. There's also Sword Fighting, Combat Psychology, Staff Fighting, Sigil Scripting, Mentalism, and more.\nYou can learn as many skills as you can get your hands on... but sometimes, power comes with down sides.\nYou can become infected with lycanthropy and gain access to very powerful skill sets. Roam the world in a pack and wreak havoc! But come the three days surrounding the full moon (the real-world full moon!) you'll be stuck in your beast form. New opportunities come open, but others close. There is no cure for lycanthropy.\nBecoming a druid gives you great power, but you have to vow to drop everything when there's a natural emergency, be it a forest fire, a monster invasion, even just an insect pest. And nature doesn't let you shirk your duties. Ever.\nSummoning arch-demons also has a down side... well, you get the idea. Characters slowly become defined by the choices you make and responsibilities you accept.\nTaking this idea to another level, you can unlock special playable races, each with their own pros and cons.\nWe want to attract the friendliest community around, and we're planning features to help make that happen, like:\nLive events with story focus\nMechanisms for player-created quest content\nPlayer housing (some landscape, some instanced)\nPlayer-managed shops and stalls\nIn-game communication tools like bulletin boards\nBookshelves where you can submit your own stories (and players can up vote them)\nGuilds that can set role-play and gameplay rules like \"must use hardcore death penalty\", \"vegetarians only\", or \"only werewolves allowed\"\nWe'll also be working with the alpha and beta communities to prioritize and plan other features that they recommend.\nIt\u2019s a sad fact that lots of indie MMO projects crash and burn. They have great ideas but they can't bring them to fruition. This is very frustrating for developers and gamers alike, but it\u2019s completely understandable ... because making an MMO is insanely hard. It's the hardest kind of game possible! And if you don't have lots of development experience, the costs and delays can spiral out of control very quickly.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we've already spent nearly four years on Project: Gorgon. We\u2019ve done the hard, boring, critically important part: developing the tech, creating the art pipeline, and prototyping game mechanics. We're not quite in \"production mode\" yet, but we're close. Yes, there will be hiccups and hangups and bugs along the way -- there always are. But I'm completely confident that we have the foundation that will get us to the goal. That's because I've literally done this all before. I've coded the networking. I've optimized the AI. I've refactored the game mechanics based on feedback and metrics. As the lead developer, I'm quite confident that we are on the right track, and I have the experience to back that confidence up.\nAnd more importantly, you can try it right now and see what you're getting yourself into. Go try the alpha version at projectgorgon.com!\n(Soapbox mode. For the record, I really encourage you to never back any indie MMO project unless you can see actual gameplay firsthand. It's just too risky! Making an indie MMO is beyond hard... I've been a game developer for well over a decade, and a programmer for a lot longer, and this indie MMO is the hardest project I've ever worked on. And it took me years just to get this far. So it breaks my heart to see a bunch of excited gamers spending money on games that will supposedly be made from scratch in 12 months, by a team who's never even made games before. That's a recipe for vaporware, and players will become jaded and distrustful of crowd funding. Don't let this happen. Please insist on seeing some solid progress before you invest! Soapbox off.)\nI'm Eric Heimburg, the lead developer, and I started working on MMOs way back in 2001, including Asheron's Call 1 & 2 and Perpetual's Star Trek Online. I've also worked as a network engineer and as an indie game developer and pro-indie proponent. I have production experience, design experience, and coding experience. Unfortunately I am the worst artist in the world, and I know nothing about sound.\nFor about a year, I've teamed up with SHOGN's artists, mainly Aaron Victoria, Vincent Beaudet, and Will Barry. They've removed almost all of the \"programmer art\" now, and are continuously refining the game's look and feel. They really care about making this the best-looking game it can be, and they've already vastly exceeded my highest expectations of \"what an indie MMO can look like.\" With another 18 months of work, I seriously can't imagine how good this game will look!\nMusic is provided by the immensely talented Conor Brace, who understands the thematic elements of the game well and will continue to create the soundtrack. He also provides much of the game's sound effects and ambiance.\nMy wife Sandra Powers also plays a role in the game's production and planning, as well as some of the game coding. She was a producer for Asheron's Call 1 and EverQuest 2, so she knows the realities of MMO development like few others.\nThis Kickstarter will allow three of us -- myself and two artists -- to work full time on the game, and the others to work part time. If the Kickstarter goes beyond the minimum goal, we're excited to be able to hire on additional help! But first things first.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter almost four years of internal development, we have a really good grasp on what the game engine can and can't do. We aren't worried. But there are a few areas that are a little risky:\n\nLinux Support:\nWe use the Unity game engine as our client middleware. Unity now supports certain flavors of Linux, but that support is still kind of buggy. It's been getting better and better with each update of the engine, so we expect it to be very solid by the time we launch in 18 months... but this is something out of our control, so it's a risk.\n\nMin Specs:\nWe don't yet know exactly what the minimum specs will be for the game, because we haven't optimized it much yet. If your machine can run the outdoor parts of the game well right now, then you'll be fine. But if right now you get crappy framerate, we can't 100% guarantee you'll get a good framerate when we're done. We are aiming for a nice low min spec, but we just don't know the exact details until we do the hard work of optimizing every scene and every asset.\n\nBusiness Model:\nIdeally we'd like to charge players a $5/month subscription fee. That would allow us to focus on making a fun game, rather than spending half our time making Item Shop stuff to entice you to give us money. But we don't yet know if a subscription will be tenable, because so many other games are free. If it isn't, we'll use a typical free-to-play (f2p) model.\n\nWe'd like to skip all the bullshit that comes along with a f2p model and just ask players for a very small monthly fee -- a fee that's cheaper than a single burrito per month. We think this is eminently reasonable, but our audience may disagree. So you'll help us figure out a business model that will work for you and for us. We'll be polling you, and experimenting during the development process.\n\nJust to clarify: if this Kickstarter is successful, we'll definitely have the funds to *complete* the game. But in order to keep the game running for years to come, we must have a business model that keeps players happy *and* keeps us in profit.\n\n(Because we aren't yet sure how the business model works, we're offering a generic \"Gold Level\" account privilege as one of the rewards. If we use subscriptions, it will be a subscription to the game. If not, Gold Level will be a premiere access level in whatever payment model we end up using.)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "EricHeimburg\n2 created \u00b7 15 backed\nEric has over a decade of experience as a Senior and Lead Engineer on such products as Asheron\u2019s Call 2 as well as being Producer for AC2.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Ends.

The story, the characters, and the many different, original and even hard mechanics will bring you infinite hours of social entertainment (not to mention there are dinosaurs and explosions in the same game!)\nWhat kind of minigames we can expect from this project?\nAnything fun enough we may think about :)\nFrom platformers, RPG, strategy, sports, puzzles... even graphic mini-adventures!\nWe also plan to create hard and fun minigames and game mechanics, including some really difficult minigames, like \"Robot combat\", in which you \"pre-program\" a robot dinosaur blindlessly to destroy your enemies, or \"Dinoknight Brawl\", which implies a chess table, the knight's movement and lots of strategy.\nWhy do you need so much money?\nWe want to create more than 40 minigames, all in one big game! We need to make an all-out effort to give our best and bring the project the highest quality that it needs. We really have a hard work to do.\nWe will use the money for:\nVideogame console development kits\nLicensing some assets\nImproving the open source game engine: BennuGD\nImproving other features: graphics, music, sound FX... we want our game to look and sound bombastic!\nWhy do you want to improve your game engine BennuGD instead of using another?\nBennuGD\u2019s is an open source engine using DIV Games Studio syntax. It\u2019s pretty easy and it supports many different platforms. Currently it just lacks support for OpenGL, but we will use part of the budget to solve that.\nWhy is your game in 2D?\nIt just fits a lot better for our cartoonish and fun art style. Also, 2D is the new 3D, didn't you know? :)\nWhen is it going to be released?\nWe are planning to release the game in Q1 2015, with at least 40 minigames. As this game is really modular, we will surely publish the game in time with as many minigames as we have ready, and then add the other minigames through free DLCs.\nDouble Our Fun(ds)!\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help us get there and make a great game for everyone!

It takes place in a world populated by deities and heroes called Terminus. Mortal and planar shards have collided, creating the dramatic and epic environment of Terminus. With some of those shards came deities and demigods that, over time, raised empires and forged a turbulent political landscape. Centuries later, new planar collisions have occurred that will pull the players into the world and its politics.\nThe player is a legendary Hero, stripped of his or her powerful relics and left to explore the distinct and epic regions of Terminus. You will be guided by the hopes of reclaiming long-lost relics and the power of the friendships they forge pushing them onward.\nPantheon\u2019s combat places a focus on preparation and awareness\u2013 providing players with challenging scenarios that require not only understanding, but skill to rise above their opposition. The player can actively dodge, block, or deflect attacks \u2013 but this goes beyond active reactions to encounter mechanics. Spell and ability pre-selection is also critical to defeat encounters, as are the alliances you will forge with other players.\nYou won't want to be caught in the wilds of Terminus alone, but the brave souls that explore the vast and divergent landscapes will discover a truly rich and rewarding experience. Through exploration the player can uncover anything from mysteries and hidden artifacts to unique adventures, and ultimately rare and exotic spells and abilities.Imagine an expansive, detailed world of swords and sorcery, of dragons and knights, of fiery swords and chests overflowing with treasure. A world in which a myriad of sentient races and creatures live and affect change.\n\"Strata!

(Read more about Pantheon's combat here)\nTrain and use a wide variety of skills as part of your character\u2019s growth as you level up.\nLimited and class based teleportation may get you close, but in order to reach many destinations you will have to traverse the planar scarred lands of Terminus through the use of your own two feet or on the back of your mighty steed.\nQuickly equip situational gear as you move from one climate to the next.\nAn economy that\u2019s largely player driven.\nVisible loot. If you see an NPC wielding a weapon it should be a part of its loot.\nMost items that are looted from NPCs will be tradable.\nDual targeting--attack your target while healing your allies.\nTerminus is a world where instancing is the exception not the rule.\nRespect your surroundings, succumbing to death has its consequences.\nSome spells can be modified to hit one or multiple targets. You decide on the fly.\nFactions matter. Ogres don\u2019t belong in an elven city (and so as not to offend the Ogre Rights Association, elves don\u2019t belong in an ogre city either.)\nHorizontal character growth, with fewer levels and more meaningful gains per level.\nCommunity feedback helps drive decisions made.

When there was nothing but darkness an astral storm ignited, ripping the walls between a thousand realities. The storm reached beyond the veils to snare fragments of life, ripping them from their origin and returning them to the darkness. Crashing upon a lifeless rock the many shards of many worlds came to unite and formed the world called Terminus. - First Words of the Astral Tome, Origins of Terminus 1:1\nAn awareness that content is king.\nA requirement that classes have identities. No single player should be able to do everything on their own.\nA belief that game economies should be predicated on delaying and minimizing item value deflation.\nA commitment to a style of play that focuses on immersive combat, and engaging group mechanics.\nAn understanding that a truly challenging game is truly rewarding.\nAn expectation that the path of least resistance should also be the most entertaining.\nAn understanding that player involvement is required for progression. All actions (or lack thereof) should have consequences. Positive actions should be rewarded. Apathy or lack of action should not be rewarded with bonuses. \nA mindset that designed downtime should be a part of a game, ensuring players have time to form important social bonds. \nA belief that an immersive world requires intelligent inhabitants.\nAn understanding that faction should be an integral part of interacting with the world and its citizens.\n A sincere commitment to creating a world where a focus on group play will attract those seeking a challenge.\nA belief that the greatest sense of accomplishment comes when it is shared.  And earned.\nAn agreement that player levels should be both meaningful and memorable.\n\"My past has taught me that fallen deities become vengeful god kings.\" -- Aradune Mithara, Ranger Lord, warning the people of Triundia about the exiled god, Oranthel.\nVisionary Realms, Inc. was founded by Brad McQuaid and an elite group of experienced MMO developers (veteran artists, programmers, and designers \u2013 plus a few friends we made along the way). We've worked on EverQuest (original game and just about every expansion), EverQuest 2 (original game and just about every expansion), Vanguard: Saga of Heroes, EverQuest Next, Free Realms, Star Wars: Galaxies, Star Trek: Hidden Evil, Myst 3: Exile, and more.

The money raised here on Kickstarter will be used to hire additional employees and bring this project to completion.  Our list of stretch goals, when achieved, will allow us to launch an even broader MMO with more features, a larger world, additional races, classes, and much more.\n\n\"There's only one God of Plunder and his name is A'Moka.

Now hand over the stash or you'll be the gash.\" -- Faylee the thief instructing a lonely traveler on how to stay alive. \nPantheon: Rise of the Fallen takes place on Terminus, a high fantasy world of deities and heroes.\nWhat makes Pantheon unique is that in addition to traditional fantasy races and classes, Terminus is built from the fragments of other worlds, civilizations and their gods.  You never know what you might run into \u2013 and we certainly aren\u2019t ready to give that all away here.  But think of all the potential, worlds long lost, explored anew.  Civilizations discovered that offer new and incredible adventures for you and your friends to experience.  When we say content is King, we mean it, and this is just one of the ways we go about supplying that.\nWork-in-Progress - Outside of Sunken Sanctum\n\"Rise and reclaim your glory, fallen one. Without your might, this world will crumble yet again.\" -- Nexus the Lost Goddess to a fallen hero.\nForged in the astronomical planar collisions of a dead universe, Terminus is a world of many worlds; each ripped from one of many realities and brought here to form a dramatically diverse landscape.\nIn the wake of their cataclysmic arrival, empires of Humans, Elves, Dwarves and others came to rise and build new civilizations within the new world.\nBut not only did mortals come to be abducted and trapped upon this new world, but so too did their deities and demigods, ripped from their planes and forced to create new pantheons on Terminus. Cutoff from their planes and starved for power, they came to vie for followers an act that has helped create the turbulent political landscape of Terminus.\nAfter centuries of war and alliances, the planar collisions have returned once again, bringing with them legendary figures, heroes of the existing pantheons that were once lost. With newfound abilities to harness arcane forces, these \u2018fallen heroes\u2019 have risen to reclaim lost powers and explore the many mysteries of Terminus.\n\"We are the same. Once we were lost and now we are risen. We are not alone in this.\" -- Nexus the Lost Goddess to a fallen hero.\nPantheon\u2019s combat places a focus on preparation and awareness of your enemy. The player can actively dodge, block, counter or deflect incoming attacks. You\u2019ll want to choose different spells and abilities before an important encounter, selecting from a mix of offensive and defensive abilities. You\u2019ll also see where the NPC\u2019s spells and abilities are going to land and have an opportunity to avoid the attack.\n\"Pray for rescue if you wish, but chances, if your god answers, then they're as trapped as you.\" -- Vhalen the bard speaking to a fallen hero who is praying to return to his homeworld. \nPantheon: Rise of the Fallen is a beautiful fantasy world\u2026 a world where traditional elements meet planar high fantasy. The planet is formed by the collisions of various worlds, thus creating an exotic mix of ecosystems and biomes.\n\nPortals to the distant origin worlds open up allowing you to see through and possibly travel to these enigmatic lands. Many mysteries lie in wait to be discovered and explored within.\nConcept of The Continent of Celestius\n\"Drundus... the Hero of Hollowdown, the Defender of Faith, the Benevolent Blade, that Drundus? I must be grogged!\" -- Sir Camdos after meeting the fallen hero, Drundus.\nPantheon emphasizes adventuring with others - the world is dangerous and full of unexpected challenges, making it unwise to travel alone. We feel that some of the strongest memories are often those shared with others. Thus, we are aiming to create a world where grouping is paramount.\nEarly dungeon work on Sunken Sanctum\nWith great risk comes great reward. While we feel that the content should be challenging, but we also feel that you deserve to be rewarded in your valiant triumphs. These rewards will vary from powerful gear to rare spells and abilities that will make you thirsty for more.\n\nPlease, take us at our word when we say that we are aiming to create experiences that are not going to be easy by any means. Fighting into the depths of a dungeon can be perilous and require strategy, preparation, and skill to overcome difficult encounters. However, when you and your party have finally conquered a dungeon or boss, you will be left with a great sense of accomplishment and reward.\n\nHello,\n\nI get a lot of emails every day from people I\u2019ve never met.  With few exceptions, they all share the same theme and message:  take today\u2019s tech, take what you\u2019ve learned (good and bad, from your successes and failures), and bring us a new MMO that gives us the same feeling and memories your earlier games did.  I try to answer them all, thanking the person for the email, and also letting them know that I agree with where they\u2019re coming from.\nFinally, however, I can announce that I\u2019m done just listening.  But I\u2019m going to need your help too. Yes, all of you who\u2019ve emailed, tweeted, posted, and more\u2026 the time has come to build this dream we\u2019ve shared.|\nIn the last several months I\u2019ve been able to build up a core team of MMO veterans.  They\u2019re also a solid group of devoted individuals, a blast to brainstorm with, and we all share the same vision.  And while we\u2019ve been able to accomplish quite a bit with our small but talented team, the reality is that we need you to help us see this project through to completion.\n\nIt\u2019s also time to let you all see what we\u2019ve been up to.\nWe know of course that, in addition to some killer concept art and gameplay details, you\u2019ll also want to see some of the actual game.  So we spent several focused months bringing this Kickstarter site to a point where we felt good about letting all of you see what we've been up to.  We\u2019ve included a few screenshots and some actual in-game video into the intro movie.  Of course, as development continues, we will keep you updated with current screenshots and video so you (and the NSA) can monitor our progress.\n\nWe could have taken the team, the prototype, the design docs, and the concept art to a publisher or an investor, but we decided it made more sense to first bring it directly to you.  Hopefully you\u2019ll like what you see and find the game\u2019s design and focus both compelling and refreshing.\nThat\u2019s really why Visionary Realms was formed, to re-empower both the developers and the players.  You as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we create this world and to what degree we implement our stretch goals. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a fantastic game.  Your comments, suggestions and the discussions that will take place on message boards across the Internet will make sure we\u2019re driven in the direction you want us to go.\n\nBy meeting and exceeding our Kickstarter goals we will show the gaming world that MMOs targeting specific audiences are the future, not the past. We\u2019ll also establish that \u2018niche\u2019 is not a bad word.  It simply means to have specific appeal.  Well, we think that\u2019s just what this genre needs.\nOf course, we're offering more than just the chance to back the game\u2019s development -- we\u2019re also offering a lot of in-game incentives with your pledges\u2026 incentives we\u2019re proud to make available to the players that believed in us from the beginning.\n\nOur hope is that these rewards and what we\u2019ve been able to reveal about the game are compelling enough for you to pledge your support for Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen.\n\nPlease back us financially and let your friends know about the game and the opportunities we\u2019re offering to take part in its creation.  We look forward to working with a growing community of players who\u2019ve wanted a game like this for a long time.  We\u2019ve certainly wanted a game like this for a long time, and building it with you, our future players, is going to be a lot of fun!\n-Brad \"Aradune Mithara\" McQuaid\nChief Creative Officer, Visionary Realms, Inc.\nJanuary, 2014\n----\nWallpapers & Ads", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are a highly experienced team of AAA developers and that's what we aim to deliver.
