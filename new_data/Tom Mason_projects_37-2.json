Instead, crossing continental distances, only to reach the wall of a \u2018room\u2019. Passing beyond will only bring yet another room on the other side of it, with new lands stretching off just as far again.\nAlthough all manner of threats exist out in the wilds, such as strange animals and beasts, and other barbaric or dangerous people, the greatest dangers of all, are the Rooks. Huge, hulking stone automatons that patrol, somewhat mindlessly, out in the wilds of the Colostle\u2019s rooms.\nThat is until they are disturbed. Every Rook is different, there are no two the same, and they are the only source of magic in the world. As such, they are something of a target to hunters looking for tech they can scavenge, artefacts they can sell or magic crystals to grant them strange and unpredictable powers.\nThat is if they can bring one down...\nA 'room' stretching out before an Armed adventurer...\nWhat is a solo RPG?\nThink of it like a personal, mindful writing exercise, where the game provides you with prompts to write your own fascinating adventure in this strange world. You will be keeping a journal of your adventures, and the game system is a way to determine what you will encounter along the way, and to dictate the outcome of combat. All the book provides is prompts and inspirations, but it is up to you and your character to flesh out the details and to write about what you discover.\nFirst you need to create a character, someone of this world. This book will guide you through this process, but it is completely up to you. Then the game provides you with an outline of your first adventure. You can decide how to interpret these prompts and what to write, there are no limits to what you can do, this is YOUR adventure.\n\nWhat is in the book?\nThe Colostle book will be a 24 page A5 tome with all the rules required to create and play your own Colostle adventure. The book will have a thick 300gsm cover with foiled lettering, and the internal pages will be on off-white recycled paper for an otherworldly look and feel. The book will also feature black and white illustrations throughout suggesting glimpses of the world and the kind of characters you could create.\nDesign of the interior black and white pages (mockup)\nHow does the game work?\nThe basic principle is that of drawing cards from a shuffled deck of playing cards, and checking their colour, suit or number against tables to see what they represent for your adventure.\nIn the exploration phase of the game cards might stand for meeting another traveller on your journey, finding some abandoned ruins or discovering a mysterious doorway. its up to you to write in your journal what these things are and what they mean for your character. The game simply suggests things, like writing prompts, set against a fantastical world... its up to you what they all mean for your greater story. In the Combat phase, cards stand for attacks with the numbers on the cards showing their strength. Playing the right card at the right time could mean victory for your character!\nAs you play and write you will find ideas for what the mysteries of the Colostle might mean, just falling into your head. I don't provide the answers in the book, every player will discover their own truth and meaning of the world.\nAll you will need is a deck of playing cards, a pen, some rough paper for making gameplay notes and a journal to record your character's adventures in.\nHow to Play Colostle - Example of a typical Exploration and Combat phase in the game\n3 Unique Character classes\nTo play Colostle you will need to create a character, and to that end there are 3 unique classes introduced in the book that will help you do that. They are; The Armed, The Followed and The Helmed. All of them use parts and pieces harvested from Rooks that give them special abilities. I don't want to give everything away, as it is only a small book (!) but you can see an Illustration of The Armed class below.\nThe Armed - wielders of harvested Rook arms\n Rewards + Stretch Goals Breakdown\n Cheaper Shipping Options\nIf you look in the rewards you will notice that some rewards have an identical twin with the added 'Cheaper Shipping' to their title. This is because I found a cheaper shipping cost later in the life of the campaign after these tiers had been already added. If you are a new backer, and you live outside the UK, please make sure you select the 'Cheaper Shipping' version of the tier you would like, to make sure you get the best deal on your shipping.\n(These 'Cheaper Shipping' options only exist for the top 3 tiers, \u00a320 or over. The lower tiers have accurate international shipping as they are, so you don't need to worry about those)\nNew artwork for the 'Oceans' module!\nNew artwork for the 'Battlements' module\nWho am I?\nMy name is Nich Angell and I am a comic book artist, illustrator, writer and game designer. I am one quarter of the stories-and-games company Big Punch Studios, creators of comics such as 7STRING, Afterlife Inc., and Cat and Meringue and the super fun card game Sandwich Masters!\nI have worked on a lot of comics and games, both from an illustrator perspective and a concept/creation one. More than anything I love creating worlds, whether thats a place to hear a story from, or a place to play a game in, making worlds is my thing! So when I found out about solo RPGs and played a few I realised what an awesome thing they were, a small tight rulebook for a brand new world.\nAs someone with a wild imagination I am always coming up with new ideas and Colostle is the latest setting that popped into my head. This time though, I was excited to create a more open ended world so that others can experience the joy I have creating stories, adventures and mysteries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have worked on many graphic novels and as such am extremely familiar with creating books and making artwork printready. I have run a great many Kickstarters both on my own and as part of Big Punch so I am highly confident in the process and know the extent of what is involved.\n\nAs with all of my Kickstarters and those I have been a part of, I believe communication is key. I know to update regularly and keep the backers informed even if unforeseen delays or problems occur.\n\nWith a small book and a small print run like this I don't foresee any issues. The kinds of things might be print delays, quality issues, and delivery but I have plans for all of these issues if and when they appear.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe book will not be packaged in any plastic shrinkwrap or film, and will be delivered in a fully recyclable cardboard book envelope. The book itself as it is all card and paper is fully recyclable too.\nSustainable materials\nAll the interior pages of this book are printed on recycled paper.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nThe printers I have selected for this project put the environment first. They have reduced their use of solvents and other hazardous waste down to almost zero, reduced their setup waste to almost zero and recycle every offcut created during the manufacturing process.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe printer I use are UK based which means any UK orders will not involve costly international bulk shipping.

Read more about it in the update #5\n\nHave you ever had the problem of needing to describe a dungeon and none of the players could really imagine how the structure is actually built? You don't always have to draw a battle map. Sometimes a small picture is enough to quickly show what the situation around the players looks like. Or did you ever try to come up with a dungeon room on the fly and just could not come up with an interesting layout? This deck of dungeon cards is perfect for those situations. 36 (now 54) unique cards full of stairs, dark corners, slim corridors, claustrophobic rooms, crates, barrels and much more to place monsters and treasure in.\nCards can be either used separately or combined to form larger dungeons. You can reveal one card after another as your players make their way through the dungeon and make them curious about each corner.\nThe cards are made out of professional 310gsm card stock with a blue core and smooth linen finish for the professional look & feel. The deck comes in a custom printed tuck box with a protective matte coating to give your cards the home they deserve. \nSpeaking of... Each map (as well as the back of the card and the box) is completely hand-drawn. All 36 cards are already done and just need to be sent off to the printer.\nSo why Kickstarter? This is a test for me to see if such a deck is even wanted by enough people. If this project gets funded I can let the cards print for a reasonable price per deck without making a loss or charging an impossible high price.\nSupport Tiers\n5\u20ac - Get the PDF\nYou will get the full Deck of Dungeons (including the back side) as a PDF. This is perfect for those that would like to support this project but can't (or don't want to) afford the price of the physical deck + shipping costs.\n15\u20ac - Get the printed deck\nYou will get the physical Deck of Dungeons. Perfect for Dungeon Masters, as a present or just as a collectors item.\n18\u20ac - Physical & digital deck\nGet both - The PDF and the printed deck. This is for people who play classically as well as digitally or want to collect the printed deck and use the digital one.\nIf you want more than one deck please contact me with the shipping country. I would need to calculate the additional costs depending on where to ship. Thank you for your understanding :)\nStretch Goals\nI am very hesitant when it comes to stretch goals for this project. This is my first kickstarter and I just want everyone to get what they expect and as smoothly as possible. But if the project gets a lot more supporters than expected, I probably have no choice. So here is the goal:\n[Unlocked] 300 Supporters - 54 Cards\nIf we hit 300 or more supporters I will increase the number of cards in this deck to 54. It doesn't matter if for the physical deck or the PDF version. If we reach 300 backers the deal is sealed. I will invest some extra time to come up with 18 additional cards.\nSo if you would like to have a thicker deck make sure to share this project and encourage your friends to grab a copy as well ;)\n Shipping\nThe Deck of Dungeon gets shipped worldwide. The shipping costs will be added after you selected your pledge level. \nGermany: 6 \u20ac\nRest of the EU, USA, Canada, Japan: 11 \u20ac\nRest of the world: 13 \u20ac", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this is my first kickstarter I am fairly confident that everything will go smoothly. The designs for the deck and tuck box are done and I already got several prototype prints of the deck from the printer to check the quality and made some adjustments.\n\nOf course it is always possible that something goes wrong during each step of the process and the shipping could get delayed.

Still, you push along doing the best that you can. Yet, as you move forward you can't help but feel stress & anxiety about the future. \"Will I actually succeed with my art?\" \"Is it even possible to find an art career that will pay my bills and  fulfill me creatively?\" To make things worse, you sometimes cave into your fears because of social distancing and/or your past.\nWell, listen up!

I've written a guide to help you make it happen. \nThese may be BOLD words from a stranger - Why can I make you this promise?\n\n\nMy name is Will Terry and I am a successful  illustrator. - I\u2019ve illustrated over 30 children\u2019s books for publishers like Scholastic, Penguin Random House, and Simon Schuster. I co-founded the wildly popular illustration podcast - 3 point perspective. I co-founded SVSLEARN.com with Jake Parker and Lee White where we teach illustrators all over the world. I\u2019ve created a thriving comic convention brand. I taught illustration and business practices for 9 years at UVU. I\u2019ve been giving entrepreneurial advice on my popular YouTube channel  for over 10 years!\nThe point is, I've made my own successful illustration career. I, along with 12 other award winning illustrators, will show you how to make yours.\n\n What They Don't Teach You In Art School is a guide to help you create new opportunities using your art skills to pay the bills, even if you have no prospects right now. \nIn this BEAUTIFUL 300-page fully illustrated hard cover book; you're going to learn:\nIndustry Insights\nYou will learn the most relevant professional practices I use in my career to this date. To name a few: How to find clients, how to price effectively and close deals, how to figure out which industry your art is best suited for, how to correctly invoice, industry mistakes you should avoid, and more...\nThis means you will be fully prepared to find and secure the right opportunities that will fulfill you creatively and pay you fairly.\n\nHow To Land Your Dream Art Job\nFor some of you, landing that nice prestigious illustration job at a famous company like Disney, Riot games, or DreamWorks is your dream.

You will learn how to get the best freelance work, how to get your work discovered to attract more clients, how to correctly structure your portfolio, best practices to follow as a freelancer, and more\u2026\nThis means that you will be able to create the freelance work-hard/play-hard lifestyle you want, earn a living, and still have time for conventions and games.\n\nHow To Create Your Own Brand\nAs artists, what we want most is to be known for our accomplishments and abilities.

You could spend an entire academic career at an art university and still not even come close to learning the gems that are in this guide. \nLuckily, this isn't art school so you won't have to take out student loans to get access to this valuable information. For this Kickstarter only, I am going to give you access to a massive discount. \nI'll give you one copy of \"What They don't Teach in Art School\" for the price of $29 for a soft cover or $39 for a hard cover. \nThe invaluable knowledge of how to monetize your art skills and craft your own successful career all for a fraction of the cost of student loans, housing, text books, and Tuition. This deal lasts only for the duration of the Kickstarter. It will go back to full price afterwards. Claim your guide at a massive discount today!\nSoft Cover\nHard Cover\n\n\nSo What? Why should I care? \nThe vast majority of artists out there have the art skills to earn a living, but they have no clue how to monetize their skills; so they starve. Artists just assume that if they don't have any opportunities to make money with their art now; they will never have any opportunities in the future. This is false. They just lack the understanding of how to apply their art.\nWhat They don't Teach in Art School gives artists the edge they need to go out there and make a successful career for themselves. \nIf you personally apply the principles in this book:\n* You'll learn how to establish a career where you are both earning a living and creatively fulfilled.\n* You'll learn where to spend your time to get your career off the ground and save a lot of money in the long run.\n* You'll skip past mistakes and obstacles that inexperienced illustrators make in the industry today.\n* You won't have to listen to that naysayer in your life, you know the one, and instead you'll take life into your own hands.\n* You'll be recognized for your own content and your own brand.\n* You won't have to be afraid of the future and instead look at it as your oyster.\nFear is a tough thing to shrug off. It paralyzes you from head to toe; preventing you from taking the necessary steps towards success. The greatest source of fear is the anxiety of not knowing how your future will play out. But let me clue you in on a secret, the future is yours to decide. You have what it takes! Decide to make your future a bright one. I wrote this guide to help illustrators, like you, to succeed in the most challenging time of your life. It's going to take work, there are no shortcuts, but there are open highways.\n- Will Terry\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\nBoth soft & hard cover books are ready to be printed!\nBooks will ship to the United States & Internationally. You will not pay for shipping until after the completion of the Kickstarter during fulfillment  (estimated to be in October). I will be using Backerkit to help me with fulfillment. Backerkit makes fulfillment quick and easy! I will not mark up shipping whatsoever, you will only pay what is fair.  \nWhen we are ready to ship the books (probably in October) you will receive an alert to complete a survey (to be sent to the email address that you provided with your pledge). That survey will ask for your current/updated mailing address to ensure that your order will arrive to you directly. You will pay for shipping at that time -AND- GREAT NEWS: YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO ADD MORE COPIES TO YOUR ORDER AT THAT TIME! You'll also have the chance to purchase add-ons, such as other books and prints by Will Terry.\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask me personally.

I specialize in comics, illustration, and designing characters, robots, and machines. You may also know me from Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, or as the creator of the popular online art challenge: Inktober. \nIt's been 3 years since my last art book and I thought it was high time to make a new one just for you! \nThe book will be beautifully printed by a 4 color offset printing press. It will be a softcover, perfect-bound book that will fit nicely with the other books in the DRAWINGS series. It will hold a comprehensive collection of both finished and exploratory artworks from the last three years, including an exclusive SKULL CHASER comic made especially for it. There will be a step-by-step tutorial on my drawing process as well.\nThis is the FIFTH book in my series of DRAWINGS art books and I felt it was time to mix things up a bit and change the nature and design of these books for the next several publications starting with DRAWINGS 5.\nYou can order these books right now from my shop. If they're out of print, I have a digital download option available.\nAlong with the book there's a bunch of other stuff that is only available from this Kickstarter. I'm excited to make these things and get them out to you!\nNote: this is a living, breathing project. All designs are pretty close to what I would like to produce, but are subject to change.\n Note: \"ALL The Extras\" now includes the bookmark set as well!\n\nThe book is getting made! YESSS! And now we're shooting to add these stretch goals to your book - at no extra cost to you!!\n\nMy team and I are shipping from the US, so apologies for the high cost of shipping to countries outside of North America. We're charging *exactly what it costs us* to ship from the USA. So if you live in London or Sydney or Berlin, shipping prices are what they are. If we can find an affordable way to ship to you we will use it, and keep you updated here.\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, if there is a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will take us a few days to work our way through packaging all the rewards. \nUnforeseen delays that are out of our control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\nSometimes orders get lost or damaged in the mail. In that case, we will work with you to make sure you get your book. For instance, if your book is damaged, please contact us and we will have you return the damaged book for a replacement. We are not responsible for lost packages marked as \"delivered.\" \nIt's Kickstarter season, and that means a few friends of mine are also running Kickstarters right now. If you like what I'm doing here, you might also like these projects. \nAll of these creators I know personally and know that they supplement their income with conventions and with the situation right now none of us are sure if selling at shows will be an option this year. Just a couple bucks from a bunch of people could make a huge difference for these projects.  Go check them out and throw some support their way!\nDerek Laufman's Creations\nCreations Vol 1 is Derek Laufman's first art book entirely comprised of original designs. The book will be jam packed with hundreds of illustrations, beautifully displayed across 100 pages and 7.5 x 10\" in size with a soft cover. This book is for all ages showcasing character designs, concept art, and visual development. With full color illustrations, rough sketches, traditional ink and ink washed artwork. It's a great book for professional artists, art directors, aspiring creators or just fans of art and pop culture. Printed In CANADA LINK\nDave and Fred's Story/Line\nFrom my friends Fred Shroeder and Dave Kellet comes one-on-one interviews w/ artists from comics & animation, talking about their craft. \"Art and Stories and the Art of Telling Stories.\" I was one of their \"test\" interviews and I think it's a great platform to learn about the craft of comics, while also elevating the art form.

It\u2019s a wallet with a pencil and replaceable sketchbook inside.The sketchbook is filled with tips, prompts, activities and more to get the creative juices flowing.  It comes in two styles designed by Parker Jacobs and Ralph Thomas. Our goal is to make drawing fun and to build great sketching habits. It also comes with an Artistic License which means you can do whatever you want in the name of art. Don\u2019t want to clean your room? Bam! Just flash your license!

I can't believe that I have enough support from people like you to get to do this for a living. It really is a childhood dream come true.\nThank you for your interest in this campaign.

Building good drawing habits and making sketching fun is the goal of our latest creation.  \n The wallet is 3.25 x 4.25\" and is made of high quality printed vinyl. The inside has an ID window pocket, a card pocket, and a money pocket for your cash. Each wallet comes with a small pencil and a 2.5 x 3.75\" replaceable sketchbook filled with drawing activities to prime the creative pump.  \nMany parents have asked me how to keep their young artist going. I believe they should provide them with a few things: \n\"Encouragement\" will need to come from you, but we can help with the \"fresh art supplies\" and \"inspiration\" to make drawing fun and accessible. Each wallet comes with a replaceable sketchbook filled with tips, prompts, activities and more to get the creative juices flowing. Your artist will definitely come away with new skills and fun stuff to draw. There are also plenty of blank pages that will allow unguided creativity. Our small blank, toned, dot-grid and lined books also fit this wallet. \nMany artists don't begin to carry a sketchbook until they hit college age or older. Help the young artist in your life to develop this habit early, it will only help them get better. Drawing at a young age should only have one goal...it should be fun. You'll have plenty of opportunity to dash their hopes and dreams later. Don't get hung up on, \"you drew the head too big,\" or \"the perspective is all wrong.\" Criticism before they're ready will squeeze the love right out of it. If they can keep drawing through middle school and into high school then they are probably ready for honest critiques. You'll know because they'll ask for it.\nWe've had this on the idea board for a couple years and thought it was time to make this thing. We have been trying several designs, interviewing young people, measuring pockets, checking out materials and so on. We love the final designs and know you will too. \n The first wallet was designed by the ever-doodling Parker Jacobs. Parker has been posting his daily doodles for the past decade. You may recognize his work from Paul Frank Industries, Yo Gabba, Gabba, The Aquabats and Goon Holler. Parker has a bad habit of letting his domain names run out.\n The second wallet was designed by Sketch Wallet creator Ralph Thomas. He's proven that even a mediocre artist can make a living in illustration and has spent the last 10 years as a game artist. When he's not drawing he's found riding his trusty green bike, \"the Bass-O-Matic\u2122\" or stealing Parkers websites (Exhibit A, Exibit B).\nSpecial Thanks to Miles, Raegan, and Aaliyah :-)\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs much as I want to pretend there are no risks - there are.

If you are a fan of 80's/90's road trip movies and retro video games, this movie is for you. It will capture those warm memories you have for gaming and remind you of those good times while making you laugh along the way. This will be a movie you can watch with the whole family. For fans of the Game Chaser's web series, this is not a 2-hour game chasers episode, it is a feature-length scripted comedy film. However, it will have everything you come to love from the show at its roots, just presented in a new and exciting way!   This will be a different format, of course, from the show (which is reality documentary style) But that's the point, to do something fresh and different!  \nWe've had an idea to do a movie for a long time, but it wasn't until someone approached us with the concept of a scripted comedy that the light-bulb went off. Our original idea a few years back was a country-wide road trip going to flea markets. Basically exactly what we do on the YouTube show, still keeping it a \"reality format\", and making it a feature-length movie. And while many might find that idea awesome, I found it boring. It's the same thing we already do just.....longer. And we have to depend on the chance of actually finding games. You wouldn't see Mevor, or Dodongo in it because or work obligations as well. For me, that idea just wasn't exciting. We never pursued it. We never tried to Kickstart it. Maybe we will down the road, but this idea that we have is so much more stimulating creatively for all of us, and a nice breath of fresh air. And the great thing about it for fans is that even though it's a fictional narrative, it still has the essence of the show. It's a refreshing take on Game Chasers. And we are super excited to bring it to life and show the world. \nNow, some people might be concerned over the fact that we have a Producer and that that means someone else other than us is calling the shots. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is OUR project, OUR vision, and the idea and direction is 100 percent OUR creations. We make the decisions. No one controls us, ever. They work for US, not the other way around. I just wanted to ease anyone's concerns that someone else was in charge of this project. This is GAME CHASERS only bigger and badder! What you love about the channel, you will love about this. \nThe plan is to shoot over the Spring/Summer and have it ready for release in 2020. There will be a limited theater run, at the minimum here in DFW. But there will also be digital downloads and Blu-rays as well! In the meantime the regular YouTube show isn't going anywhere, so don't worry.  \n\nWhat's it about????\nWell....I can only say so much. A lot of what will make it awesome to see for the first time is the big surprise we have in store. That's good enough, right??? RIGHT? NO? Fine......I can give a quick synopsis, I suppose...... Billy and Jay go on a road trip to track down a childhood gaming relic. And of course...a ridiculous adventure ensues.....a ridiculous adventure but not TOO outside the bounds of reality. Its main purpose is to be FUN to watch but also make you feel good!\nThink of this as a fictionalized Game Chasers Prequel. A fun re-telling of how 2 friends became game collectors. \nIt will be what you have come to love about the show mixed with stuff you would have never expected, but still fitting in with the spirit of what we do. And also mixed with bigfoots and aliens. Maybe. ;)\nPLAY\n\n\nOk, how about this? How about I list some words that are out of context but have actual meaning in the movie. Yes, Im a tease. \nMountain, NES, Shotgun, Campfire, Star Fighter, Gnome, 1988, Flea Market, Lemmy, Battle Toads, Rental, Motorcycle, Gaiden, Photograph, Basement, Drone, Trunk, Punchout, Tetris, Jarr, Abandoned. That's all you get. For now....\nFor another tease...scroll to the bottom and see a page from the actual script. \nThis is just a teaser paying homage to Gremlins, not any official art\nIn this video we go into the story a little more to hopefully help you understand the theme of what its all about.  \nMany of the Game Chasers show fan's favorite episodes were ones that made them both laugh and cry, and this movie will capture that same feeling. You will laugh, cry, cheer, and reflect. Fans of the web-show will get enjoyment out it, as well as those who are not familiar. Its a movie for fans and newcomers alike.  \n I (Billy)  have a passion for storytelling. I have enjoyed making the Game Chasers web series and will continue to do so, but my favorite projects have always been the ones where I can tell a story and or just be creative. The Under The Bridge Game Chasers Episode and our cartoons display that the most, I believe. This movie has been in the planning stages for a while now, but we feel it's finally time to move forward with it.  \nYour support right now of this Kickstarter is critical for it's success.\n Making a movie of this magnitude is expensive. As I said, this isn't a 2-hour Game Chaser episode. This is not us just taking a camera and going out a few days a week shooting video. We have a producer. We are hiring a professional film crew for this. We want this to be like any other movie you would see in a theater. THIS IS NOT a normal \"web series makes a movie\" scenario. Our goal is to shoot this movie on a RED Camera. A RED camera was used in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, to give you an idea of the quality. I DEMAND that this EXCEEDS your expectations.  We have always reached for the best quality in everything we do, and this is no exception. But besides the film crew, there are so many costs that go into this such as, location costs, insurance, paying the cast, props, transportation, post-production, CGI, licensing, lawyers, to name a few. We will need to hire people to do jobs such as accounting so we don't get sued or have the IRS come after us, a production manager so they can organize the dozens of people need to work on this and keep things on schedule, and also the cost of simple things like food for the crew that will add up quick. Luckily I (Billy) will edit so we can save money on that. As you can see, things add up quickly. 95k may seem like a lot, but in movie making terms 95k is still low budget. Remember, this isn't us filming on the fly at the flea market, this is a REAL production.   \nThis is a Pre-Sell. \nWe hope to Pre-Sell enough copies of the movie to cover the costs of making. If we don't, and our goal is not met, then Kickstarter will not charge your card. \nWHY CROWDFUNDING?\nCrowdfunding, or \"Eat Bacon\" as some would call it, is the best way to for us to bring this movie to you. Lucky for us, it's the year 2019 and the film industry has changed so much. There isn't a need to get a studio's backing or get deep pocket investors. We cut out the middle man and allow our product to be funded by the PEOPLE who want it DIRECTLY. The thing is, investors, dropping large sums of money will want a say in the movie, and rightfully so. We want to keep 100 percent control. We have TURNED down an offer for a TON of money from a potential investor because they wanted to make changes.  Our vision is important to us. With that said, we HAVE been able to secure smaller funding from a few sponsors who won't be taking any control. It's not a ton of money, but it helps, and we are always looking for more small sponsors who don't want say in the movie making aspect. \nObviously, we have always been great at taking low budget and making it look high budget. It's been our MO since we started. \nReminder: You wont be charged unless we hit our goal\nOf course, there are going to be people waving their finger saying we should get investors instead of going directly to our audience who would want to see this movie to fund it. They say we E bacon? With that said, we actually DO have some! As it stands we have around 7k committed from sponsors. However, you can play a huge part in making that higher. IF you guys help fund this now and early on in this campaign, more sponsors will be willing to jump on board since they will see there is a ton of interest and will be way more willing to get involved. However, they still wouldn't be sponsors who would get a say in how we make this movie. If so, we will turn them down. So if you want this to happen, let's do it as soon as you can! Let's show the people what the Chode Nation is all about!\nWe more than likely not make any profit off this. And we have no plans to pay OURSELVES for the work. Kyle Newman recently said he made nothing off the movie Fanboys in the end. I can see that happening with us. This is a passion project, but even passion projects require funding. If you want to see this movie made let's pull together an make one hell of a movie! \nHere is a pie chart that will show (generally) where the money will be spent. This as of now is a best guess, some areas could end up being cheaper, others more expensive.\nHere are a few further breakdowns of what you saw on the graph, and why exactly we need them. These are the jobs/things we will actually have to pay for and not get the \"friend\" hook-up.\nProduction Manager - This person handles the business side of things. Like managing the budget, making sure people get paid, employment issues, paperwork and etc. \nCinematographer - Behind the director (Billy and Melvor) this is the most important crew member. He or she is responsible for the look and cinematography of the movie. We can't do everything, so this person is vital for us. We want to hire someone who knows what they are doing, a professional. This will obviously cost but will be worth it. We want the movie to look good! But beyond that, if we hire someone who is cheap and inexperienced we run the risk of them making a mistake, and a mistake on a movie set can cost thousands of dollars and days of shooting. \nAudio Tech - This person is responsible for recording the audio on the set. Again, if someone messes up this job it can cost money and time, so a professional is needed. \nAssistant Director - While the director and co directors focus on the actual movie making, the Assistant director does the important \"dirty\" work to free up the directors time. Such as breaking down the script and planning the shooting days, and making sure all the people who need to be on set a certain day are there. They find the best and most efficient way to organize the shooting days to save time and money. \nSet Building - This is a must, and an expensive must. Some of our settings will need to be created because finding a real-life location that we need will be near impossible. I wish I could go into more detail but I would be giving away to much of the plot. Let's just say we will need to create a set that looks like it's from 1988. Also, a few of our settings would be impossible to film in a real life location because there would be no space to fit a camera and crew, so one would need to be built with only 3 walls, so a camera crew could be behind the \"fourth wall\". All this would need to be built on a sound stage which we would have to rent out from someone. Plus add the cost for materials and people to build said sets.  \nFilm Equipment - The DP will have a lot of gear but we will more than likely need to rent more and that cost can add up quick. Things such as camera mounts for a car, jibs, lenses, and lighting. Maybe even another camera if needed.  \nLocation fees - When we CAN shoot in real outside locations rather it be a building, a town, or someone's house, it is rarely ever free. Someone, whoever owns it, will want to be paid. Believe me, we will try to find a place for free or cheap, but it might not be possible.  \nSpecial Effects Tech - Sometimes its cheaper and easier to use miniatures instead of full size real life objects for a particular scene. Tons of movies use models and you never realized it. Apollo 13 and Avatar are two to come to mind, and we have one of the model makers who worked on those movies on board to work with us! He knows the art of the craft and how to make them look real on camera. We are talking professional half-scale and quarter-scale models, not little toys. Big difference. This will make our life SO much easier for a few things we have planned, but we still have to pay him. But it's totally worth it.\nActors - Some of the main actors will be friends, others will not. Regardless, we will still need to pay them. We can't ask someone to step away from work for a week, or a month, or even a few days for shooting and expect them to do it for free. We will also have a lot of actors who are not our friends...we will definitely need to pay them.... \nFlight/hotel -  This is another costly but necessary expense. We will need to fly actors and crew in and out all through the shooting phase. \nCatering - This is not in the pie graph but still important. You can't starve your actors or crew while shooting all day. Food will add up quickly. I hope they like Taco Bell...or bread and water...\nInsurance/legal - I hate this one, but it's a must. We are treading new ground here. We have to do things on the up and up to protect ourselves. We can't afford to get sued if someone gets hurt on set. And an entertainment lawyer is a MUST on a movie. One product or logo shown might open ourselves up to get sued, so we need council to tell us what's off limits. \nCGI artist - I already mentioned this but we have an artist who has worked on the Walking Dead on board. Now when I say CGI I don't necessarily mean crazy CGI sets or creatures (for the most part), a lot of CGI you see you don't even know you...see it.. Like wire removal, or fixing a mistake in the scene. CGI is an amazing tool to have, especially when a lot of times its cheaper than just re-shooting a scene. Cheaper...but not free\nMiscellaneous - This is everything else. Anything from fixing a broken piece of equipment, to gas for driving to a location.  On a movie set, something can always go wrong. An example would be as follows: We have scheduled a two-day shoot that's outside at a certain location. We have 12 cast and crew members that need to be there, and we have flights booked for everyone. The shoot day comes and then...it RAINS! We have to pay for two extra days of hotels for everyone and reschedule return flights. And some of those people might not be able to stick around after the rain to shoot, so we could have to re-shoot it a week or two later.Yeah, that would be a nightmare. An expensive nightmare. If we get more than expected out of this campaign, then this slice of the pie will get filled up even more due to the old saying, \"what can go wrong will go wrong\". \nCAMPAIGN FEES - Kickstarter's fees, together with the credit card processing fees, come to about 8.5% - 10%. At our goal of $95k that's up to $9,500. \nCheck out the production team so far. It isn't just a bunch of chodes (for the most part), we have real industry people working on this with us! \n\n\nMore on CGI With Yoshi\nHere, Yoshi talks about a somewhat unknown use for CGI that can have a huge impact on storytelling. CGI isn't just for space battles and crazy aliens....for the most part.\n here is Yoshi's IMDB and demo reel\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm4668929/\n\nAgain, this is a Pre-SELL. If we don't hit the goal, you will get your money back, but if we do, then you will get a copy of the movie. \nWe are NOT asking for FREE money. You will get stuff in return. We are offering some cool rewards for you! You are the VIP of this project. We could easily ask you guys for money now, make the movie, then charge you again to buy it. We don't want to do that, so despite having a significant part of our budget go towards Blu-ray production, we want your money to go towards owning the movie as well as making it. You only have to contribute once to see it! If you ever wanted to be a part of a movie, see how it works up close, and know you helped make it happen, then we have a ton of cool rewards just for you! \nAnd remember, you can pledge as many times as you like. If you only want a digital download now, you can always come back before the campaign ends and get a Blu-Ray as well, or one of the higher rewards. Take a look on the right-hand side of all the reward details, but some of the stuff included are:\nUltimate Combo Pack!\nThis is the ultimate pack! Get the Blu-Ray, Shirt, name in the credits, and filming vlogs! This IS the combo you are looking for...\nConcept Art!\nGet art made just for the movie! This concept art is what is used to bring forth a visualization of what the scene should look like for filming. \nActual concept art drawn for the movie\nCome To the Premiere! \nCome hang out and see the premiere of the movie with us! This will be a special private first screening! Get VIP tickets and dinner with the cast and crew! It will be a blast, don't miss out!\npic is for example only. Official venue to be determined.\nHang out on set, and or be in the movie!\nWant a once in a life time chance to be behind the scenes when a movie is made? Or even update your IMDB profile with a role IN the movie? Either way, you are sure to have a hell of a time. \nnot the official sound-stage, pic only used as example\nPages from the First Working Draft! \nThis is a page from Jay's first draft of the script. There are notes as we made changes. You can get a page like this from one of 3 first draft working scripts from Billy, Jay, or Melvor.(Obviously the black lines are only so we don't give away the plot here on the kickstarter page and your page wont have them)\nThis is censored pic of an actual page of the actual script. Your page will have no black bars\nA VERY LIMITED VHS print\nThis VHS will be limited to 150 copies and each one numbered \"1 of 150\", \"2 of 150\", etc. It will have the movie itself but no extras. A great novelty item for VHS collectors! \n*artwork and title not yet finalized\n\nThere are even more awesome rewards to choose from! Just check out the list on the right side of the page and pick the one that is right for you! Or heck, maybe even 2 or 3...no nuts!\nOh, one more thing..... \nBlu-Ray, and poster art not yet finalized\nBlu-Rays - These are not cheap to produce. There is a reason most of the film kickstarter projects don't have this perk and the ones that do have them priced higher than a Blu-ray would normally be, it takes money away from your movie budget to make them. However, I know you most of you love physical media, so despite taking a piece of the budget away we are going to produce them for you! They will have exclusive stuff only found on the Kickstater Pre-order, so don't miss out! When we run out of these Blu-rays and print more to sell at cons and online well after the movie is out, they will be cheaper but have less content. So these are DEFINITELY the versions to get! These Kickstarter versions will have TWO discs with so much extra content. Plus...if you guys don't buy these now....we wont have the money to make the movie...\nArtwork - The artwork on the BLu-Ray and shirts are just to have visuals for the Kickstarter and are not the final product. I plan on hiring an awesome artist to make the poster/blur-Ray cover and make it look super epic. \nSo our goal of 95k is bare MINIMUM what we need to make this thing. We can make it awesome on that budget, however, we can make it even MORE awesome with these stretch goals!  WE will make the best movie we possibly can on 95k, but these goals are the key to taking things to an all new level. With this extra money we will do things like bring in a REAL famous actor or 2 for a cameo, add more complex scenes, bring in more people to help, and just overall add much more cool chodiness. Not only for the movie, but for the Youtube channel as well. Let's UNLOCK these stretch goals! \nRemember, if you want to throw in an extra dollar or $2 or $1000.....(i'm looking at you Bill Gates)....over what the perk costs, it will help! The more that do that, the more likely this goal will be met and exceeded. \nWhat About Game Chasers on Youtube???\nDoes this mean the end of the Game Chasers series? No way! In fact, check out the video below to learn how there could be MORE Game Chasers/Toy Chasers/ AND Chasing the Unknown.\nLastly, let me list a few films that we were inspired by while writing this script: \nFanboys\nPee Wee's Big Adventure\nDumb and Dumber\nBilly Madison\nGremlins\nGhostbusters \nTommy Boy\n\nOther Ways You Can Help\nSome people can't help fund this, but that doesn't mean they can't help:\nIf you want to help by offering your services (construction, make-up, costumes, etc) please let us know.  \nAnd it would be radical if you want to share this with everyone! \nI will share any video made by you that promotes this Kickstarter and encourages support! \nMake everyone aware!\nThank you so much for stopping in and checking this out. Together we can make this happen!\nEverything that is on this page is here for a reason. Even things you can barely see.....\n\nUpdate:\nHere at the bottom I will be posting various auditions as we receive them. Some for VERY small roles, and some for bigger ones. Keep in mind they are Auditions, it doesnt mean they have the part. I just wanted to post a few of these as teasers.

Choose your path and gather the greatest warriors of the age to your cause! Enter a world of magical treasures, wonders, and horrors. Compete against rivals in the bitter struggle for supremacy! The rules are deceptively simple and easy to learn, but you'll immediately face deep tactical choices in this dynamic battle game.\nThis ambitious Kickstarter campaign includes two new faction sets and a campaign book packed with adventures, lore, and much more! New Faction Sets not only expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players as they enter the dreaded Volgelands!\nGet the Volgelands campaign book, both of the new factions, and the Kickstarter Exclusive \"Vandas Greycloak\" miniature with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level! \n  Relicblade miniatures are cast in white metal for crisp detail.\nThe Volgelands Adventure Campaign Setting\nThe Volgelands is the first campaign setting for Relicblade, and the first in-depth exploration of the Relicblade world. The book centers on the region known as the Volgelands. The port city of Riverhold is the beating heart of these cursed lands where feral magic still hold sway. Founded on the divine principles of Justice, but controlled by a powerful merchant class. Riverhold stands at a crossroad, both as a center of trade and a symbol of hope. Adventurers seek out the city to find their path. From this indomitable city, brave souls set out into the Volgelands, seeking a new destiny in a dying world. \nThis campaign book is packed with tons of great content. Inside you'll find:\nRegional lore concerning the history of the Relicblade world, Riverhold, and the Volgelands.\nFaction lore focussing on the Temple of Justice, the Lone Guard, the Battle Pigs, and the sinister Bone and Darkness.\nMap based narrative quest lines.\nTwo dangerous new environments: the Scoured Plains and the Brackish Badlands\nSix scenarios in addition to the narrative quest lines.\nNew wild monsters that inhabit the Volgelands\nAnd optional campaign extras including Side Quests and more!\nJust look at this awesome map. Now imagine leading your warriors on this dangerous quest!\nThere is so much great content in this book! It's a little crazy to focus on one particular aspect, but I can't just upload everything and say \"SEE HOW COOL IT IS!!!\" with crazy eyes. But look at this dope map! These map based quest lines are great narrative adventures with cool details that bring it all to life. I can't wait for you to play through them.  \nScoured Plains illustration two-page spread.\nAlso, now that the cards are all in color I may as well make the books full color, right? Here is a preview of the Scoured Plains environment two page spread. Kinda neat, eh?\nIncluded in Adventurer Pledge and Above. Available as an Add-On during this campaign only.\nTo celebrate the launch of The Volgelands, I sculpted an exclusive miniature of Vandas Greycloak: the Torment of Dusk. Vandas is one of the cruel Dark Wanderers featured in the new book. This miniature will not be available for general release after this Kickstarter Campaign, so be sure that you don't miss out!\nThe Moldorfs come from a strange dwarven society deep underground. Utterly detached from the surface, these intrepid explorers set out to discover the truth about a mythical world... An \"outer land\" connected to an infinite \"outer space\". Though it is surely folly, a powerful hearthguard warrior and a razor sharp rogue join the Bibliothecary on this absurd quest. \nThe Moldorf Hearthguard\nA titanic underground world exists below our very feet. Immeasurable caverns spread into unknowable depths. Sprawling underground ruins extend into the shadowy abyss. It is from these depths that the Moldorfs emerge.\nMoldorf society is ruled by warlords from opposing houses. These households retain an elite core of Hearthguard warriors. In the tight corridors in which the hearthguard fight, they favor the use of massive shields and heavy war spears. From behind their brightly colored and richly decorated pavises, these fighters force their foes into unfavorable positions. \nTactically keen and lavishly equipped, the few Moldorf Hearthguard to reach the surface have quickly gained renown as formidable warriors.\nThe Shadowfoot\nShadowfoot belong to secretive clans. They are maniac rogues who stalk the shadowy depths with razor sharp daggers and dubious ambitions. In the complex political alliances between Moldorf houses, there is ample space for these shadowy agents. And though no household would ever admit to employing the Shadowfoot clans, a knife in the dark always has its place.\nThe quest to discover unknown realms promises both horrors and treasures. The opportunity to test their razor sharp skill is simply irresistible to these rogues. The Shadowfoot are ready to face anything the great unknown can throw at them, but is the greater world ready for them!?\nThe Moldorf Bibliothecaries\nThe Moldorf libraries contain countless manuscripts of the forgotten age. Arcane secrets were swallowed by the abyss and utterly lost. But so too, were the Moldorfs. Isolated from the powers that ravage the surface world, the Moldorfs learned magic from ancient texts. A strange wizard caste of librarians, or bibliothecaries, formed around the arcane arts. \nWithout the otherworldly patrons or raw creative energy present on the surface, the moldorf studies have naturally emphasized illusion magic. Though illusory magic is far less destructive than other forms, it is no less potent as they manipulate the battlefield. Bibliothecaries sew panic and chaos with massive illusory horrors and dazzling visions.\nAs the bibliothecaries collected and studied arcane writings, a strange sect began to believe in the existence of a surface world. They insisted the writings were not simply myths, but that they contain a metaphysical truth about the cosmic order. Now, these highly influential illusionists have gathered other bold explorers to their cause. They set out into the unknown. Traveling ever upward holding the ardent belief that a greater world exists in the unknown beyond. \nNeutral Alignment Faction!?\nThe Moldorfs are a neutral faction. That means any player, good or evil, may add Moldorfs to their party! Isolated underground, the Moldorfs have somehow avoided the cosmic struggle between good an evil. While players must still choose their alignment, neutral characters may be hired by any warband.\nWill you influence these strange subterranean explorers for good? Or will you manipulate them to serve your own selfish ambition? I guess we'll see... \nThe strange Lostwood stands to the west of Riverhold. It is the source of countless mysteries and haunting legends. The forests shifting boarders mark the boundaries of a most savage wilderness. Lone Guard watches stand vigilantly at its edge. Deep within the Lostwood stands an ancient empire ruled by the exile of the city of the dead, the immortal king Al'Adindred. \nThe Lostwood Enclave are a distinct faction who abide by the savage laws of nature. They are wanderers, protectors, and sages of the changed world. Though they are extremely dangerous, their souls are intimately tied to the advocate.\nThe Arboleth Sentinel\nThe arboleth are a powerful race of treefolk from deep within the mysterious Lostwood realm. They are slow to anger and deeply wise. Many proud generations have served the immortal king as peacekeepers. They are indomitable warriors naturally attuned with the will of the advocate. These singular beings are lawful, just, and frightfully strong. \nThe Wild Elf Pathfinder\nPathfinders are profoundly talented scouts able to navigate the most bewildering lands. They are keen hunters with the senses that reach beyond the physical realms. The wild elves are secretive nomads as a rule, however the pathfinders routinely interact with the greater world. \nOn certain foggy nights the Lone Guard are visited by these wanderers. They trade rare goods and exchange rumors before fading away as mysteriously as they came. There are even stories of pathfinders joining noble warriors on dangerous quests. The mist-like visitors lend their unearthly speed and stinging arrows to the righteous endeavor.\nWild Elf Druid and Cave Bear Form\nThe way of the Druid is a solitary existence. Druids are in communion with nature and abide within its savage laws. They take the shape of a wild beast and may spend years in this form without ever encountering civilization.\nThe shape of the mighty cave bear is among the most fearsome shapes a druid may choose. These powerful beasts can contend with the horrors and monstrosities that plague the land on equal terms. With tooth and claw these creatures are horrors in their own right.\nDRUID CREDIT OPTION:\nThe druid and bear are original sculpts from the first Relicblade release in 2015. The druid cards have been out of production for the past year, but with the Lostwood set she finds her place in a faction set with updated colored cards. \n2015 to 2018\nIf you already own the Druid and Bear figures you can opt for $10 credit toward add-ons instead of getting duplicate copies of these figures. You will get the Lostwood set without the druid and bear figures, but still receive the updated druid cards and the new elf and treeman figures. You will have the option to select a credit in the survey after the campaign ends.\nIn Relicblade, players recruit the ultimate squad of fantasy heroes or cruel villains as they battle for the fate of the world. Choose your path and gather the greatest warriors of the age to your cause! Enter a world of magical treasures, wonders, and horrors. Compete against rivals in the bitter struggle for supremacy! The rules are simple and easy to learn, but players are quickly engaged by deep tactical decisions.\nBehold! A disparate band of heroes set upon the path of the Advocate. A Moldorf Shadowfoot, Hellhound Berserker, Arboleth Sentinel, Cleric of Justice, and their Billman Companion.\nRelicblade \"factions\" represent groups that exist within the world. However, when you enter the game as a Seeker you choose between the good or evil alignments and gather heroes or villains to YOUR cause! Players use their influence to recruit characters.\nWill you be the fate that brings together a noble fellowship? Or will you bind wicked servants to your dark will!? \nA soldier pig, iguan poacher, ogre retiarius, dark watcher, and shild pig join forces on a dark quest.\nSpecialize your characters utilizing a vast arsenal of upgrade cards. Tactics, items, weapons, potions, and spells create the framework to customize your characters. Faction sets include a booster pack of cards with new characters and upgrades, so as each new set is released the options continue to grow with dynamic new list-building options. \nIn the example below this Iguan Slaver has a combination of defensive and ranged attack upgrades, which shifts his battlefield role and greatly increases his survivability. This particular build includes cards from The Wretched Hive, The Lone Guard, and Adventure Gear card pack.\n(some older cards were produced in black and white)\nWith the Seeker's Handbook campaign rules players construct a base and lead their characters on dangerous adventures to claim magical treasures. There are six scenarios, four environments, dangerous wild monsters, and rare treasures that pack each game with new dangers and unique challenges. The Seeker's Handbook is a wonderful source for limitless adventure. The Volgelands campaign book builds on the core rules in the Seeker's Handbook with tons of exciting new content. \nYou can learn a lot more about the game and how it's played on YouTube! There are gameplay overviews, unboxings, and battle reports ready to consume! Ash and Owen of Guerrilla Miniature Games and Gaming With The Cooler played multiple full Relicblade campaigns on their channels. So check it out!\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. I try to offer pledge's suitable for a variety of hobbyists. From the ubiquitous PDF hoarder, to the much beloved completionist. To make things super easy I put the new stuff in one \"kickstarter recommended level\". \nThe \"Bold Adventurer\" pledge level is the core level for this campaign. It's the perfect level for new and veteran players. With these two faction sets you will be well equipped to enter the dangerous Volgelands. However, players will still need the core rules found in the Seeker's Handbook. You may purchase the book as an Add-on or purchase the book or a pdf right away from Relicblade.com/shop\nThe Champion of Adventure pledge level will equip you with everything you need for a FOUR PLAYER RELICBLADE CAMPAIGN!!! Is $180 kinda expensive? Sure, it is for me... but it's EVERYTHING you need for up to FOUR players to enter a world of adventure. Good luck getting your gaming group started on a new tabletop miniature game for less :)\nNow that you mention it, I spent that much on a single warband earlier this year... So I feel confident that this is an awesome value.\nWhat's a Custom Character Card?\nYou tell me about a D&D character you used to play or any character you can imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character on a special character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them! The custom card will be your ideas collaboratively realized in Relicblade. You're welcome to create heroes, villains, relics, or monsters, whatever your heart desires.\nYou get the digital artwork and copies of your character card along with the other Legends from this campaign. All ten custom character commissions will be collected in the \"Legends 4\" booster pack. This booster pack will be an official expansion for Relicblade for players to collect and enjoy. The first three Legends sets were extremely popular, so don't miss out on being part of a new generation of legends! \nMy sincerest hope is to raise enough money to produce the book and the two faction sets above. But as is Kickstarter tradition, I am happy to add a little wish-list in the form of stretch goals. There will be fewer than last year, but that's just because the core campaign has a heavy workload with an amazing book.\nStretch goals are a great way to boost the project outcomes as the budget increases. If we raise enough money to produce the new sets, then the money we continue to raise will push toward even more new content! Newly unlocked content will be available as Add-Ons once the goal is reached.\nGuest Artist: M\u00e1rk L\u00e1szl\u00f3\nThe Relicblade: Guest Artist Series RETURNS!! I'm honored to offer another excellent collaboration. As the creator of Relicblade I enjoy unbridled creative freedom. This privilege is granted by my generous Kickstarter Backers, so in this campaign I hope to extend the mantle of creative power to a guest artist! \nI love M\u00e1rk's style. He and I share a lot of the same influences. His work has tons of character with a mystical edge. He seemed like the perfect person to take my old idea for the Flame Bearer (crazed-fire-wizard) and transform it into something surprising and unique. I'm really delighted with the sketches he's sent so far, and I'm confident we're going to make an AMAZING miniature together!\nCard art by Mark Laszlo!\nHere is the proposed artwork and specs on the type of shirt we'll be using. \nVolgelands monsters have great art.\nThe add-on marketplace is a way to add a few extra items to your pledge. That way you can rest assured you are getting all the Relicblade goodness you can handle. To \"add-on\" simply increase your pledge total to include your selections. Then make a note of your choice so you can let me know what you wanted when the surveys go out! (Pro Tip: email yourself with the note so you can search for it later.)\nI highly recommend that new players pick up a copy of The Seeker's Handbook. You and a friend will be equipped to play a full campaign with this book and the Bold Adventurer pledge level.\nThe greatest testament to Relicblade is the amazing community on Facebook! \nDarkness force by Matt Lechtenberg\nThe group that has formed around RB is the best. They are kind, welcoming, and super talented! There are awesome battle reports, stunning paint jobs, and new friends waiting in the Relicblade Adventure Battle Friends. We have a forum available Here, too. But the facebook platform makes sharing photos and stuff super easy. So we tend to just use that the most.\nStonekin Battleborn by Mads", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have run three successful Kickstarter campaigns to create Relicblade and several expansions.

No. The medium wallet sketchbooks are roughly 3.5 inches square and are great to draw or write in. Everybody loves to draw or take notes on Post-It Notes and these books are larger than those, plus the square format is great for posting to Instagram :-) The small Sketch Wallet books are 2.5x3.75 which are slightly bigger than a standard sketch card. It's a fun size to draw or write in while making it a great size for even a front pocket. Each version comes in black or brown leather or black or gray canvas. Plus we threw in a tweed version just for fun. Keeping our vegan friends in mind, we picked a herringbone pattern tweed that is made from cotton, not wool. The space for the pencil or pen is actually larger than our original size wallet opening up many possibilities for new tools to carry.\nMedium leather wallets come in black or brown\nMedium fabric wallets come in brown tweed, black and gray canvas\nSmall leather wallets coming in brown or black leather\nSmall fabric wallets come in brown tweed or black and gray canvas\n If you're new to Sketch Wallet...\nSketch Wallet is a great way to always have your sketchbook with you. Or if you're the kind of person that would rather take quick notes on good old fashioned paper, this is the best way to do that. These wallet-sized books aren't intended to replace your full-sized sketchbooks or notebooks but are great for sketching or writing on the go when inspiration strikes. I've come to rely on mine and can't live without it. \nPLAY\n\nSmall Sketch Wallet sketches by @kactiguy\nPLAY\n\nMedium Sketch Wallet sketches by @etheringtonbrothers\n    Medium Sketch Wallet sketch by @drydenart\nSmall Sketch Wallet drawing by @anthony_holden\n        Medium Sketch Wallet drawing by @robbmommaerts\nSmall Sketch Wallet drawing by @manleycartoonist\nMedium Sketch Wallet drawing by @ajvilar\nSmall Sketch Wallet drawing by @sornigrafix\nMedium Sketch Wallet drawing by @theanimatedlife\nSmall Sketch Wallet drawing by @munoa13\nMedium Sketch Wallet drawing by @pumbaaguy\nMedium Sketch Wallet drawing by @camkendell\nWhy Kickstarter?\nKickstarter is an amazing platform to see if people actually want what you're making before you waste a bunch of money making thousands of products and then see if people like it. We pitch it to the Kickstarter community and let you decide if it's worth making. Why should you pledge now instead of just waiting until it's available online? Kickstarter backers will have theirs first. We won't make them available to the rest of the world until the Kickstarter backers have theirs. The other big reason is this year we're throwing in a pack of refill books free with each Sketch Wallet. You won't be seeing this deal online. So if you want yours first and with a free pack of refill books, pledge now!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs much as I'd like to pretend there are no risks, there are.

Or in the warband of any ambitious Warlord seeking fame and fortune gold and glory!\nLike walking piles of muscle held together by leather and chains and random plates of battered metal, the barbarian flings himself into the fray frothing at the mouth and shouting unintelligible obscenities. God knows they tend to die a lot so you'll need a lot of them.....so here we are!\nRed Box Games makers of awesomely designed, exquisitely sculpted and expertly cast fine fantasy 28mm scale miniatures is very proud to present!!\nWARBANDS OF WRATH AND RUIN\nWith your generous support we hope to fund the production of a series of new, finely detailed and beautifully sculpted, expertly produced,\" 28 mm \" scale barbarian miniatures which are the initial warband starter set for an all new small scale skirmish game set in a brutal, fallen fantasy world ruled by capricious Living Gods and beset by the ravages of their eternal war for survival and supremacy. The rules for the game are not quite ready for print yet but it is the goal of this campaign to fund this initial set of figures which will help us to also afford to finish the rules and get the production process for the rules and game components started.\nIn the game, Players take on the role of a powerful characters of super human or preternatural nature called \" Chosen \" in command of a small band of followers of various role and ability. These warbands , referred to in game as the \" Following \" expand in number and diversity as the Warlord grows in Power, Repute, Fortune and Favor of the Gods beginning in number between 6 and 9 followers, but growing to include as many as 24 followers at the Apex of the Chosen's Stature.\nFOLLOWERS\nThese followers may be lowly slaves, cultists, warriors, champions, and even monsters. But the core of any Chosen's following are the foot warriors.\nFOOT WARRIORS\nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any Chosen whose coin can fill their bowl or whose stature warrants following. \nPictured here still somewhat WIP these figures are semi modular for VERY expansive customization options and are cast in a very high quality lead free white metal. All modular fittings will be made in such a way as to insure easy secure assembly.\nThe items included in the pack are;\n10 barbarian foot warrior head / helm options\n6 right hand weapon options\n3 heavy weapon options\n3 heavy weapon foot warrior bodies\n5 weapon and shield foot warrior bodies\nAll this in one set for $40.00!! High quality, finely detailed metal minis for $5.00 Each!\n SOLOS\nSolos include both the companions and the Chosen themselves. These are the characters of the stories with the companions acting as a supporting role to the Chosen. Please note that any one of the foot warriors can be selected as a Solo option. \nPRIESTESS\nThe Priestess is a companion follower who serves as an intermediary between the Chosen and one of the Patron Gods of the world. Each Priestess is different and their uses can vary wildly based on the particular choices made during the creation of the character for use in the game but rest assured in this game a Chosen without some sort of spiritual aid is a Chosen set upon an arduous path.\nPictured here as a WIP the Priestess will be available in 2 different forms. One unclad and one half clad. The image above represents her unclad form. Her clad form will be slightly more modest.\nBackers can add additional copies of the Priestess to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\nBackers can also pledge for the Priestess figure ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nLESSER CHOSEN\nCurrently still WIP the Chosen will be finished very soon!\nThe Chosen are the scions of the Gods. Born from any strata of denizen in the realms these few are half mortal and half God, able to draw upon the ethereal energies of the cosmos to fuel superhuman feats of strength, speed, skill or to perform miraculous manipulations of the world around them. They can be man or woman marked by the touch of divinity with strange colored skin, hair, eyes, super human, or inhuman build or feature.\n Backers can add additional copies of Chosen to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\n Backers can also pledge for the Chosen figure(s) ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nPLEDGES\n As the funding allows I WILL add more options to the campaign. These will include Chosen of different nature to lead the Foot Warriors and companions of different role and nature to aid these Chosen in their quest for power, survival, glory, favor and fortune. I do not anticipate being able to add other foot warrior types to this campaign BUT I DO have plans for other various types of foot warrior to expand the range of theme of the game through future campaigns if this campaign does not reach a level of funding to allow them to be added during this campaign.\nBackers are free to add as many sets of foot warrior as they desire. This is accomplished by simply managing the amount of their pledge upward by enough value to cover multiple sets.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIt is our hope to be able to expand the total offering of this campaign to include Chosen and Companions of different character such as an Amazon, a Mutant, a Beast Man, and a Hoplite, as well as a Sorceror, Sorceress, Priestess and Mystic as well as different head options for the Human foot warriors, and possibly other foot warrior themes as well! We can only do this as funding allows however and we will need to cover the costs of each new addition BEFORE it is a selectable add-on or substitution.\nPRODUCTION\nWe have been producing miniatures in metal and resin for a long time..... 10 years actually. And in that time we have established strong stable partnerships with some of the best contractors in the industry. This project will be handled by one of those awesome professionals as well insuring promptly delivered awesomeness so that you can get started playing your games while the excitement is still fresh! This contractor is VERY well established in the industry having delivered in a timely fashion to high levels of quality on several very large products including many of my own Kickstarter projects. Their system of manufacture is very well tested and efficient to make sure that delivery is handled swiftly. And being based in the US this means no lengthy delays in delivery, and no unexpected complications in that process.\nSHIPPING\nWe will not accept any payment for postage through the kickstarter. So please be aware that all of the money you add to your pledge WILL be applied to a reward selection and NOT to the postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. I have learned the hard way several times that trying to predict the postage costs of rewards packages can very easily become a serious problem. \nYou will be billed for postage during the pledge manager phase of fulfillment which will be very shortly before delivery commences. We work to keep the postage costs as low as possible and we will be certain that your rewards are securely packaged so as to avoid any damage in transit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been working in the miniatures industry since 2006 and have been operating my own business producing miniatures since 2008. In that time I have produced several hundred different unique figures and shipped thousands of packages around the world. I have also established very close working relationships with several of the best contractors in the business.\nThere are always certain risks in any production but I feel that with my experience and relationships I can confidently say there is very minimal risk involved in this kickstarter due to the sheer amount of experience I have in making minis and the reliability and experience of my casting contractor. There may be certain fixes needed for optimal casting of the figures and there may be production delays as these fixes are made. If the project's scope grows beyond the initial offering it could also result in further delays as all fo the product is readied for delivery. The most reasonable risk I could assume worth being worries about would be a delay in postage or a sudden drastic increase in postage costs. An Increase in postage costs is VERY unlikely though as the time frame between funding and delivery on this project will be very short.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "SOLO", "descp": "This pledges rewards backers with their choice of any one (1) Solo figure successfully funded over the course of this campaign.\n\nBackers may add more items to this reward by managing the value of their pledge upward by whatever amount is needed to cover the desired additions.\n\nplease see the campaign pitch section for the specific details of which figures are designated as Solos.\nAll of these figures will be cast in high quality lead free white metal.\nPostage will NOT be collected during the campaign.

Or in the warband of any ambitious Warlord seeking fame and fortune gold and glory!\n Like walking piles of muscle held together by leather and chains and random plates of battered metal the barbarian flings himself into the fray frothing at the mouth and shouting unintelligible obscenities. God knows they tend to die a lot so you'll need a lot of them.....so here we are!\nRed Box Games makers of awesomely designed, exquisitely sculpted and expertly cast fine fantasy 28mm scale miniatures is very proud to present!!\nWARBANDS OF WRATH AND RUIN\nWith your generous support we hope to fund the production of a series of new high quality, finely detailed and beautifully sculpted, expertly produced DURABLE and SUPPLE RESIN cast \" 28 mm \" scale barbarian miniatures which are the initial warband starter set for an all new small scale skirmish game set in a brutal, fallen fantasy world ruled by capricious Living Gods and beset by the ravages of their eternal war for survival and supremacy. The rules for the game are not quite ready for print yet but it is the goal of this campaign to fund this initial set of figures which will help us to also afford to finish the rules and get the production process for the rules and game components started.\nIn the game Players take on the role of a powerful characters of super human or preternatural nature called \" Chosen \" in command of a small band of followers of various role and ability. These warbands , referred to in game as the \" Following \" expand in number and diversity as the Warlord grows in Power, Repute, Fortune and Favor of the Gods beginning in number between 6 and 9 followers, but growing to include as many as 24 followers at the Apex of the Chosen's Stature.\nThese followers may be lowly slaves, cultists, warriors, champions, and even monsters. But the core of any Chosen's following are the foot warriors.\nFOOT WARRIORS\nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any \nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any\nThese figures are semi modular for VERY expansive customization options and are cast in a very high quality DURABLE RESIN that is VERY similar in feel and nature to HIPS but with the detail fidelity of Resin. We are VERY excited about this.\nThe items included in the pack are;\n10 Human Warrior head / helm options\n8 right hand weapon options ( 2 clubs, 2 swords, 1 spear, 2 axes, 1 javelin )\n4 heavy / long weapon options ( 1 spear, 1 club, 1 sword, 1 axe )\n5 weapon and shield warrior bodies\n1 weapon and javelin warrior body\n2 heavy weapon warrior bodies\n2 long weapon warrior bodies\nAll this in one set for $55.00!! High quality, finely detailed resin minis for $5.50 Each!\nPRIESTESS\nThe Priestess a companion follower who serves as an intermediary between the Chosen and one of the Patron Gods of the world. Each Priestess is different and their uses can vary wildly based on the particular choices made during the creation of the character for use in the game but rest assured in this game a Chosen without some sort of spiritual aid is a Chosen set upon an arduous path.\nThe Priestess is an automatic addition to any \" Foot Warriors \" pledge and is available in two different forms; Unclad ( pictured above ) and half clad ( not yet pictured ). Her Unclad form is kickstarter exclusive and will not be available outside of the kickstarter. Backers will be able to select which form of figure they want to receive as part of their rewards in the pledge manager phase of the fulfillment.\nBackers can add additional copies of the Priestess to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\nBackers can also pledge for the Priestess figure ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nPLEDGES\nTo keep the campaign simple there is only one pledge level available from the outset of the campaign. As the funding allows I WILL add more options to the campaign. These will include Chosen of different nature to lead the Foot Warriors and companions of different role and nature to aid these Chosen in their quest for power, survival, glory, favor and fortune. I do not anticipate being able to add other foot warrior types to this campaign BUT I DO have plans for other various types of foot warrior to expand the range of theme of the game.\nBackers are free to add as many sets of foot warrior as they desire. This is accomplished by simply managing the amount of their pledge upward by enough value to cover multiple sets.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIt is our hope to be able to expand the total offering of this campaign to include Chosen and Companions of different character such as an Amazon, A Mutant, a Beast Man, and a Hoplite, as well as a Sorceror, Sorceress, Priestess and Mystic as well as different head options for the Human foot warriors, and possibly other foot warrior themes as well! We can only do this as funding allows however and we will need to cover the costs of each new addition BEFORE it is a selectable add-on or substitution.\nPRODUCTION\nWe have been producing miniatures in metal and resin for a long time..... 10 years actually. And in that time we have established strong stable partnerships with some of the best contractors in the industry. This project will be handled by one of those awesome professionals as well insuring promptly delivered awesomeness so that you can get started playing your games while the excitement is still fresh! This contractor is VERY well established in the industry having delivered in a timely fashion to high levels of quality on several very large products. Their system of manufacture is very well tested and efficient to make sure that delivery is handled swiftly. And being based in the US this means no lengthy delays in delivery, and no unexpected complications in that process.\nSHIPPING\nWe will not accept any payment for postage through the kickstarter. So please be aware that all of the money you add to your pledge WILL be applied to a reward selection and NOT to the postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. I have learned the hard way several times that trying to predict the postage costs of rewards packages can very easily become a serious problem. \nYou will be billed for postage during the pledge manager phase of fulfillment which will be very shortly before delivery commences. We work to keep the postage costs as low as possible and we will be certain that your rewards are securely packaged so as to avoid any damage in transit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been working in the miniatures industry since 2006 and have been operating my own business producing miniatures since 2008. In that time I have produced several hundred different unique figures and shipped thousands of packages around the world. I have also established very close working relationships with several of the best contractors in the business.\n\n There are always certain risks in any production but I feel that with my experience and relationships I can confidently say there is very minimal risk involved in this kickstarter due to the sheer amount of experience I have in making minis and the reliability and experience of my casting contractor. There may be certain fixes needed for optimal casting of the figures and there may be production delays as these fixes are made. If the project's scope grows beyond the initial offering it could also result in further delays as all fo the product is readied for delivery. The most reasonable risk I could assume worth being worries about would be a delay in postage or a sudden drastic increase in postage costs. An Increase in postage costs is VERY unlikely though as the time frame between funding and delivery on this project will be very short.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "tre manor\n17 created \u00b7 57 backed\nI am a sculptor of table top miniature figures for fantasy gaming.

Also for JUST $40.00 USD.\n     See? Not much math stuff, lots of Orcs and Goblins. Who needs them book learnin talkie times anyways? Not Gobbers and Orcsies don't.\n     It is our hope that as the campaign progresses we can add items to the offering and perhaps to the initial box contents as well HOWEVER as this is our first effort in plastic manufacturing we want to be sure we are responsible and take this slowly keeping everything nice and predictable and efficiently produced and delivered. So there will only be a few additions to this campaigns. We don't want to get too ahead of ourselves with promises but we also want to make sure we make the most of this campaign that we can. You CAN NOT go wrong with more and more monstrous beasties eh?\n\n    Please be aware you can buy as many of these boxes as you want! Personally I don't think any orc or goblin warband is complete unless it nearly breaks the shelves under it's ponderous weight when stowed away between sessions of rampaging blood thirst. \n   If you want to add to your rewards you can do so by managing the amount of your pledge upward by enough to cover the addition of as many green hellions your heart desires. \n  And remember a forest without goblins under every hedge is just not a forest worth trodding through for any self respecting adventurer!

They DESERVE awesome enemies to fight! the theatre of your imagination DESERVES fantastic minis! YOU. NEED. THE HORDES OF THE AULD WORLD ORCS AND GOBLINS BOXED SET!!\n   The whole idea of this kickstarter is to fund the production of these fantastic monstrosities in high detail hard grade PVC plastic similar to many of the newly beloved board games recently hitting the market like a spiked ball of steel in the gnarly green fist of a feral Orc berserker rampaging through the ranks of silly tights wearing doods who spend all their time preening their poofy feathered hats and shining their armor and dancing with their little swishy poke \" swords \" and singing songs about damsels and wine and stupid stuff. Do we really want those kinds of doods in charge of stuff and ruining our good time? No. No we do not. We want Orcs and goblins. Lots of them. That is why plastic is good; cause we can make a LOT of them and sell them cheap.\n\n  So to help us do this well we need your help to allow us to pay the high cost of plastic production with tried and true manufacturers who have produced many of these exact same great boxed game projects.\n   Ok this is serious. Shipping is important and can be costly depending upon where in the world you need your stuff to be delivered to. Because we do not know exactly when the project will complete production we cannot bill for postage until the product is actually in hand and ready to deliver. We are working to build a base frame of reference for the shipping costs and we are also working to establish relationships that may allow us to ship from hubs in various parts of the world to mitigate those costs. \n   We will work to keep the postage costs as low as possible cause we don't really want to make money from shipping we just want to get your stuff to you as soon as possible cause once you know you have orcs and goblins on the way.... well they just need to get there fast and cheap right? \n   For now though the only region in which we can reasonably project postage costs is the US. We will be shipping orders via priority mail so as long as your stuff fits into a priority box ( and we will be working to make sure that they do ) you can expect to pay the priority mail shipping rates.\nAnd Say!

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our Kickstarters, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital. What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures with capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day. All molding and casting is done in house by our dedicated staff of three well experienced individuals. Only the sculpting is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. We have, so far, completed 9 Kickstarter projects and a 10th project on track for completion before the end of this campaign. A quick look at our previous Kickstarters will show that we shipped rewards to backers well ahead of schedule. We believe we have a 100% backer satisfaction record after nine successful kickstarters and a 10th one in process. We're not perfect but if a problem does arise we do our honest best to resolve any issues.\n\nAn unforeseen event, though unlikely, could be, well, unforeseen.

They had been curious of course, and there was much speculation as to what was on the other side, but as the hill had been inhabited by Gnomes who didn't take kindly to such impudent questions, the matter was largely left alone.\nNow, seemingly in the middle of the night, the gnomes have disappeared, and the big question (apart from where have all the gnomes gone) of what lies on the other side of the hill is now very much the talk of the town.  Some think it might be an orchard, full of apples.  Others, that a very big dragon has eaten all the gnomes and may well be coming for them next.\nThe Halfling Town Council declared an emergency meeting, and decided there's only one way to be sure - an adventure.  Under such dire circumstances, they are seeking brave (or at least moderately confident) adventurers, from different backgrounds to form a Party (the very worst kind, without cake or even paper hats) to investigate the other side of the hill...\nNinjas in the Pantry - Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nWe are very pleased to announce that we have made our stretch goal to unlock the Halfling Ninja class!  Once again, we are indebted to you for your fantastic support.\nWhile we don't have a second stretch-goal planned, in order to keep the Kickstarter manageable, should we pas \u00a310,000 we will endevour to come up with a mystery reward for backers of the full pledge.\nThe Way of the Mini-Ninja! - Stretch Goal Announced\nSo far, the Halfling Town Council had interviewed a motley collection of individuals from all walks of life and professions.  It had been decided however, that eager though the bakers were, they were far too vital to the town to risk, and that something else was needed. At that moment, from out of the shadows of the room, two totally silent black-clad figures triple back-flipped into the interview chairs.\n\"And you are...\"\nAs suggested by one of our loyal customers, we present a male and female halfling ninja from one of the more obscure character classes. \nShould we reach \u00a37000, then we will include one of each miniature free with every Halfling Lady and Gentlemen Adventurers pledge, and the appropriate one free with each Ladies or Gentlemen Adventurers pledge.  Backers who pledge for a single or double miniature set will be able to choose one of these miniatures as one of their options.\nMidlam Miniatures are pleased to present a collection of sixteen 28mm scale halfling miniatures for use in all of your fantasy games.\nChoosing Your Class\nWe have chosen a range of different character classes for the 'A Class of Their Own' Kickstarter, which we hope will help flesh out your fantasy adventures. However, while we couldn't include all the possible choices in the campaign, we will consider any suggestions for a follow up Kickstarter in the future, should this Kickstarter is successful.  Please leave any suggestions (from the obvious to the obscure) in the comments page!\nAbout Midlam Miniatures and Our Kickstarters \nThis is our ninth Kickstarter, and we are using it to help develop and extend our range of miniatures, in this case, halflings! \nWe have been very grateful to all the support we have received in the past and hope you will join us on our latest project. Our eight previous Kickstarters - Wizard Apprentices, Wizard Halflings, Cultists of the Kraken Lord, Servants of the Undead Pharaoh, Halfling Adventures, Winter Adventurers, Common or Garden Gnomes and the Ghosts of Midlam Manor have all successfully funded.\nA Note on Metal\nThe miniatures are cast in a high quality pewter, with a high Tin content, but may contain a small quantity of lead. We unfortunately cannot guarantee lead free models. Most 'lead free' metal usually contains a small amount of lead to help the metal flow into the mould. \nAnticipated Delivery Date\nThe delivery date of July 2018, is our shipping date, rather than an arrival date. As we ship all over the world, delivery times will vary considerably, even within the same countries.

Thrall and Brute\nSpetznaz Greens are Done\n The US mech armed with pile driver and grenade launcher will have this frame.  \nPLAY\n\nUS and Russian Mechs\nRussian Mechs\nUS Mechs\nHello Kickstarter Patrons,\nWe at Impulse Miniatures are looking to kick start our first miniature game \"The Evolved\".  This 28mm mech focused game gives you control over mechs, infantry vehicles and The Evolved.  The game play is fast paced, full of tactics, and strategy.  The setting is based in the modern day with some futuristic advancements.  Players can look to see modern day weapons and vehicle designs.  The story is something new that we believe players will find fresh and intense, and we can\u2019t wait to share it with you.\nAfter the Kickstarter we will continue to produce models for the 3 armies and have another army in the works. There are several additional units currently planned for each army.  The US army has an infantry team with large caliber sniper rifle, anti tank gun team, and anti infantry gun team. For US mechs, an anti infantry mech, a leader only mech, and a close quarters mech with pile driver.  For the Russians, a heavy cannon team, RPG team, and mortar team.  For the Russian mechs, a riot shield and shotgun armed mech, leader mech, and one armed with high explosive rockets.  The evolved will gain a heavy armored infantry unit, an infantry unit with ranged weapon, a faster moving large creature, and one with ranged.  These will be added as additional stretch goals if the kickstarter reaches all of the current stretch goals.  All of the current stretch goals and the ones mentioned above are in the rule book, and will be included in the pdf rules sent to all backers.  A printed rule book will be available shortly after the kickstarter as well.  \nThe evolved are humans that have the ability to control nanite swarms.  After being experimented on by scientists from the US, they broke free.  In their wake they left cities in ruins.  They lead armies of humans that  have been taken over by the nanites.  The nanites change the humans from the inside out.  The evolved brutes are formed from the melding of nanites with larger beasts and in other cases several human hosts.  They are the wrecking balls of the evolved armies.  The evolved have also learned how to use nanites to take control of mechs whose pilots have been killed but are otherwise still operable.  They are less accurate and agile, but provide  needed ranged attacks to the evolved armies.  The evolved army is a swarm army with powerful technomancers able to deal damage and heal thanks to their nanite abilities.  \nSo far we have the US, and Russian Mechs completed and ready for production. This Kickstarter will be funding the infantry and expansions. This is just the beginning of The Evolved universe with many more units and models planned for the future!  Our manufacturer is US based and used by many other companies with a proven track record.  \nThank you for being apart of our Kickstarter and helping us to bring The Evolved to life.\nSTRETCH GOALS!!!!\n$8500 \nRussian Mech with Howitzer\nRussian Howitzer\nUS Mech with High Caliber Rifle\nUS Heavy Rifle\n $10,000- \n-US Stingray variant armed with pile driver and grenade launcher\n-Russian Black Bear Variant armed with riot shield and automatic shotgun\n$12,000\n- US Infantry Heavy Armor Squad.

Evolved Leaders are strong technomancers able to control swarms of nanites, transforming fallen enemies into servants of their wil, interfering with the systems of enemy mechs, and even creating brutes from fallen enemies and nanite swarms.  \nThis is the first miniature for the evolved, and to celebrate every backer will receive this model for free.\n$18000\n-The Evolved infantry.  Assimilation of human and nanites, these creatures serve the will of the Technomancers.  They are quick, able to heal damage and deadly up close.  \n$20000\n-The Evolved Brute.  Massive creatures created by the technomancers.  They tower at over 10 feet tall.  Metallic protrusions, incredible strength, ability to heal wounds.  They are horrendous creatures to encounter in the field.  Able to tear a mech apart with brute strength.  \n$25000\n-To celebrate the initial models for The Evolved miniatures game being funded, Every backer will receive a Kickstarter only SGT Jack Savage Model.\n$30,000\n-The Evolved Corrupted mech.  The strongest technomancers are able to overcome mechs and their pilots taking control of the mech and corrupting it to their will.  These are less accurate and responsive than normal mechs, but provide much needed ranged support to the evolved armies.  \n$35,000\n-Japanese Mech.  Japanese mechs are the most nimble and agile of the mechs.  The have the most overdrive points of all the mechs, and the highest evasion roll.  \n$37,500\n-Japanese Infantry.  The Japanese infantry are the most trained and tech focused of all the countries.  They make heavy use of sub machine guns and guerrilla tactics.

Digitally rendered by Master Sculptor Tim Hill and faithfully brought to physical reality by Fortress Figures using cutting edge technology to bring you the unquestionably highest quality metal miniature available today.    \nThe Sauracens fled the extinction wrought by the planetary cataclysm of their home world in the forgotten epoch shrouded by the mists of eons past. Civilization for Sauracens has risen to celestial heights and fallen to their archaic origins many times as their knowledge ebbs and flows as with the cycles of the great celestial mechanism. Those retaining knowledge of archaic technologies still travel the stars searching for the mythical home of their origin to which they are instinctively as a species driven to return. As the navigator/priests identify each newly discovered planet, they pray to the celestial consciences that the long lost home of their origin will finally be rediscovered and bring some peace to the wander lust they have not yet managed to suppress.\nMETALS\n This project is for unpainted, white metal figurines. Models are provided NOT painted. Models are scaled to 28mm toe to eye or 1:60. Models are provided with a plastic tab/slot base. White metal figurines are not toys and are intended only for adults. Models may require some assembly, may have sharp or pointed parts and are a choking hazard to anyone prone to put them in their mouth.\nSCALE COMPARISON\n  PLEDGE LEVELS\n  GRENADIER SQUAD\n  SAURACEN RAIDERS\n  STRETCH GOALS\n  $1500 STRETCH GOAL\n  WHATS NEXT\n  ADD ONS\n  SET ADD ONS\n  SHIPPING\nOn the end of the campaign, each backer will be issued a coupon code via e-mail to redeem at our on-line store for your pledge rewards.

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our Kickstarters, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital. What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures with capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day. All molding and casting is done in house by our dedicated staff of three well experienced individuals. Only the sculpting is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. We have, so far, completed 5 Kickstarter projects and a 6th project on track for completion before the end of this campaign. A quick look at our previous Kickstarters will show that we shipped rewards to backers well ahead of schedule. We believe we have a 100% backer satisfaction record after five successful kickstarters and a 6th one in process. We're not perfect but if a problem does arise we do our honest best to resolve any issues.\n\nAn unforeseen event, though unlikely, could be, well, unforeseen.

We have returned again to kickstarter in the hopes to fund our newest selection of fantasy norse figures that we call the Njorn. \n  Our intention is to fund the production of a new set of heroes and their faithful follower rank and file troops. We also intend to fund the set up of our in house production capacity! This means buying a spin caster, a smelter, all the various periphery of safe casting, metal shelves to hold molds ( LOTS of molds ) having our molds shipped to us from the various contractors we currently partner with, and raw metal to do the casting with. Being set up for in house production will allow us to reinvest in the various aspects that will make your experience with Red Box Games more efficient and better presented, as well as allow us to manage our working capital MUCH more efficiently.\n  We currently reinvest a disproportionate amount of our profits into maintaining reasonable stock levels across the entire breadth of the red box games line. This is a HUGE investment that grows every time we add new products to the line. It also means we have to rely on kickstarters much more because we simply cannot afford to just put new items in to the store without knowing that the funds are already there to pay for the production and stocking of said items.\n\n  Once set up for casting we will be able to keep the funds of the business' success where it belongs, in the future of the business. It also has the added advantage of allowing us to afford lower prices across the board and able to take chances on items which are too risky to produce through out sourcing such as larger monsters and cavalry and Rank and File sets appropriately priced for army building. \n\n  To insure that the high level of quality you have come to expect from Red Box Games is faithfully maintained, I will be training in casting with a VERY talented and experienced mold maker and caster. I wont be handling the entire burden of casting right away so there is no need to worry that this development will slow down delivery of the Kickstarter or the regular course of business for RBG.\n\n  My molds will continue to be made by one of the industry's best studios as well so there is no need to worry that the burden will overwhelm me or that the overall quality of the Red Box Games product will suffer.\n\n  I cannot do any of this without your help so please consider backing this kickstarter! You will get some really cool stuff for a GREAT price in a reasonable amount of time and I will FINALLY be able to set up for my own production and make some real progress in this industry!\n\n  AAAaaannndddd without further Adieu...... ON TO THE MINIATURES!!!\n We intend to fund as many figures as this kickstarter will allow and at the outset of the campaign we have 19 figures ready to go with a few slight details needing to be added before they are ready for production and I still have several more underway which will be shown as they are completed and added to the campaign as the funding allows. \n   Please se as follows for the full selection of miniatures offered in this campaign;\n  KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!! Thorarnr the Storm Hammer!!\n  available as a free addition to all pledges of Warband or Alla Njorngarna but available as a selection option or $8 add-on as well!\n       Any of the miniatures shown above can be selected as singular selections. or the entire group can be selected. \n Backers can pledge for an entire warband ( 25 figures in total as of the launch of the campaign ) cast in high quality white metal, or pick and choose individual figures from the selection funded by this campaign.\nHERO ..................This pledge level rewards backers with 1 copy of any one of the figures successfully funded through this campaign cast in high quality white metal.\nCOUNCIL....... This pledge rewards backers with their choice of any 10 figures funded through this kickstarter campaign.\nWAR BAND ..............This pledge rewards backers with their choice of any 25 figures funded through this campaign.\nALLA NJORNGARNA........This pledge rewards backers with one copy of each of the figures funded through this campaign AND one copy of each of the figures currently offered in the red Box Games Njorn back catalogue, including also a few of the recently OOP models as well. \n      All figures will be produced in high quality lead free white metal.\n    Most figures will be cast in a single piece. However some figures may need to be cast in multiple parts to allow for the most reliable casting. These figures will also be cast in high quality lead free white metal as well.\n All packages will be shipped in BOXES rather than envelopes with any appropriate extra packaging needed to insure your rewards are delivered perfectly intact. It is my hope to also be able to invest in some fancy schmancy marketing materials and snazzy packaging to go in with your beautiful Red Box games minis.\nAll packages will be fullfilled from the United States. Postage will be collected within the kickstarter pledge. However it is not always possible to predict when / if postage costs increase to deliver to foreign countries. As a result we must reserve the right to bill for any additional postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. We do not try to profit from the postage of our packages and will always keep the cost of delivery exactly in line with the actual costs.\n For those who are unfamiliar with me as a sculptor and with my business red box games I am a sculptor of finely detailed 28mm scale fantasy miniatures. Most often specializing in minis of a Norse theme. I founded my business in 2008 and have been producing miniatures ever since. In that time I have produced some 300 odd figures for my various ranges of Men, Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, Halflings, Orcs, Demons, and Undead of all kind of role for each of those range themes. I have now run 7 kickstarters and have fully delivered on 7.

Lead the sinister Wretched Hive in a dangerous criminal underground, or find yourself entangled in the strange motives of the inscrutable Wilderkin.\nThe Wretched Hive Kickstarter campaign offers the opportunity to add amazing new characters to Relicblade. New Faction Sets not only present the chance to expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players. The Wretched Hive Kickstarter campaign promises to deliver all-new factions, characters, unit types, upgrades, and powerful magic spells. These faction sets have been meticulously designed to add exciting new play-styles to Relicblade!\nGet both of the new expansions and eight incredible metal miniatures with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level!\n The Wretched Hive\nIn The Wretched Hive we delve into the sinister underworld that exists on the fringes of society.\nThe iguan are a ubiquitous reptilian race whose myths claim a primordial origin predating all human civilization. The pragmatic iguan do not build cities of their own, but rather opt to live in nomadic groups operating with a network of semi-permanent encampments on the outskirts of large cities. Traveling bands will meet to trade with the settled iguan, who in turn offer goods and services to the wider markets. \nDue to their peculiar psychology many iguan find full integration into civilized life distasteful and traditionally work as laborers and sailors. They never shy from dangerous work, and take special pride in their ability to endure. Despite the obvious value of strong workers, the complex cruelty of civilization has branded the iguan as the lowest class. Merchants gain hordes of wealth while the workers struggle to survive. \nIn the absence of true justice, following the law is a luxury few can afford. Thus we enter the vile black markets of the Wretched Hive. Where cruelty is the law and only the strong survive. \nThe slave trade is perhaps the most depraved of the black market practices. The legality of slavery may vary from kingdom to kingdom, but legal status only truly changes how public the slave auctions are. \nThe Iguan Slavers are powerful fighters and bitter task masters.These depraved individuals offer harsh motivation to their comrades in brutal fashion. Slavers are rightly feared for the sinister depths of their inhumanity.\nPoachers are almost universally nomadic in origin. Many ply their humble, if illegal, trade as hunters. However, in the harsh depths of the black market, not every poachable entity is a beast.\nThe brutal wilderness takes its toll on nomadic tribes. In the harshest seasons many poachers turn their unmatched skill as scouts and trackers to the benefit of dangerous crime lords. With highly valuable skills and keen javelins, these deadly warriors are rightly prized.\nAccording to their customs a select few are chosen and groomed from birth to assume a terrible duty. The elder crone prepares these youth for many years. Until the fateful day they must read from the unpronounceable black pages of agog. The black pages tether the iguan to their primordial gods. As the chosen study the dizzying passages their inner minds are assailed by terrible dimensions beyond reality. \nSadly, many are utterly consumed by madness. Those who survive are honored and assume their place as iguan witches. These witches are respected councilors and powerful sorcerers. They peer into the void to observe the threads of fate, command plagues, and call upon the boiling depths of the earth. These powerful women form an integral core of iguan political and religious society.\nNomadic iguan have formed strange alliances in their bid for survival. One such partnership is with a the mangrove basilisk. A long snouted sub-species endemic to the brackish badlands.\nThese cold-blooded beasts have a near super-natural hypnotic gaze and are extremely venomous. The Iguan Witches made connections with the beasts and have used them as powerful assets for generations. These pitiless creatures grant an exotic edge to an iguan fighting force. They paralyze combatants as swift warriors descend upon their ill-fated foe.\nThe Wilderkin\nWilderkin is a broad term describing individuals of fay ancestry. Elves, while rare, are the most common in settled society. However, the term Wilderkin is often reserved for more conspicuous outlanders.\nIt is generally believed that the fay realm and ours were more closely tied in ancient times. In the terrible cataclysm known as the sundering, when great empires were brought low and from which there is only a faint hope of recovery, the relationship between realms was irrevocably changed. In this new and unstable landscape the otherworldly races adapted in strange and marvelous ways. From the peculiar gnomes to the indomitable stonekin, the Wilderkin abide by their inscrutable ways.\nGnomes are largely unchanged by our changed world. Gnome interactions have always been centered on their fanatical devotion to craft. These pint-sized hobbyists have only the slightest concern for the greater world. They are even known to forget entirely the plight of our modern age! Instead they focus with razor precision on mastery of a given craft. \nGnomes are still intimately tied to the fay realm and may even travel between worlds. Accordingly they are visitors with minor alliances to a select few. It seems their primary endeavor in our world is to explore their passions. Once a gnome fixates on a craft they are utterly obsessed. They may be captivated by anything from shoe-making to the most complex alchemical sciences.\nDue to their tiny stature, gnomes rarely travel without an animal companion. They have been seen riding everything from common mountain goats to exotic creatures only imagined in the most obscure folklore.\nThe stonekin were elves once. In the tumultuous years when civilization collapsed a sect of mystical artisans took extreme measures to survive. In desperation they placed irreversible enchantments on their families, forever changing their bodies to lifeless stone.\nWith a faint hope the artisans went to work. Employing unknowably ancient secrets, once used to create marvels beyond reckoning, the artisans worked into the fading twilight of all civilization to finish their final masterpiece. The world burned, but the work was complete.\nThe stonekin were born. The artisans had saved their beloved people. A new race, half-elf and half-stone, arose. They were completely alive, not living statues or enchanted stone. The stonekin were reforged in the fires of a dying world, and emerged a race fit to survive in the coming dark age.\nThe Battleborn comfortably faces multiple combatants.\nMany stonekin live peaceful lives as farmers and artisans. However the brutality of the changed world demands certain concessions. The battleborn are a reserved caste of fearless warriors. They stand as the definition of stonekin fortitude and strength. The stonekin battleborn are imposing giants hardened for the rigors of battle.\nSummon explosive stone spires to smash your enemies.\nThe wild elves owe their earnest allegiance to nature and regarded the sundering as a natural shift. Embracing the chaotic heart of creation, the wild elves humbly adapted in the midst of mass extinction. They plunged themselves deeper into asceticism and immersed themselves in the changed environment. Some individuals became indistinguishable from nature itself.\nThe wild elf druids adopted powerful beast forms to live in brutal harmony with the wilderness, while the geomancers tap into surging rivers of energy that course through the earth. Embracing the wilderness, the geomancers enjoy a place of privilege in a chaotic world. Though they are wanderers in a savage wilderness, geomancers compose themselves in complex formalities and are utterly dedicated to the discipline of the earth. As servents of the enigmatic wilds, the geomancers often find themselves entangled in heroic endeavors.\nThe Wilderkin follow the serpentine paths of fate. Forever entangled in the intricate patterns of an altered world. For as the wind blows, life is chaos.\nRelicblade is a fantasy skirmish miniature game. Players command heroes or monsters as they battle to claim powerful magic relics lost in the ancient world. Players only need between three and six figures per side, and games only last about a half hour. The rules are simple and easy to learn, but there is a lot of depth in the available characters and upgrades.\nEnjoy an immersive hobby experience as you collect, build, and paint your miniatures. Relicblade models are made of white metal for wonderful crisp detail. Games take place on a two foot by two foot area, so creating detailed scenery is very manageable. While beautifully modeled terrain is a delight, you can play on any surface you have available by simply using stacks of books to represent the troubled wilds of Relicblade.\nDive into delightful tactical depths with each new game. Specialize your characters utilizing a vast arsenal of upgrade cards. Tactics, items, weapons, potions, and spells create a wonderful framework to customize each character in your war party. Faction sets include a booster pack of cards with new characters and upgrades, so as each new set is released the options continue to grow with dynamic new list-building options. In the example below this Iguan Slaver has a combination of defensive and ranged attack upgrades, which shifts his battlefield role and greatly increases his survivability. This particular build includes cards from The Wretched Hive, The Lone Guard, and Core Game Deck.\nCards from the new sets will be in full-color for your viewing pleasure!\nFor players interested in narrative campaign play, the Seeker's Handbook is packed with great content. Rather than simply selecting characters and upgrades based on a point total, you will construct a base and lead your characters as they undertake dangerous adventures to claim magical treasures. There are six scenarios, four environments, dangerous wild monsters, and rare treasures that pack each game with new dangers and unique challenges. The Seeker's Handbook is a wonderful source for limitless adventure. \nBattle Pigs personally congratulate the rangers on finding the lost relic!\nYou can learn a lot more about the game and how it's played on YouTube! There are gameplay overviews, unboxings, and battle reports ready to be consumed! Ash and Owen of Guerrilla Miniature Games and Gaming With The Cooler played a full Relicblade campaign on their channels. So check it out!\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. Remember, by backing Relicblade you're helping it exist! Get ahold of this delightfully unique miniature game. Relicblade is 100% natural, pure, and unfiltered imagination that is bottled at the source. It is untouched by the sanitizing influence of a board-room or stock-holders. Enjoy the benefits of live and active gaming cultures.\nIf you're new to Relicblade the \"Champion of Adventure\" is AWESOME! At this mega-rad pledge level you'll get the core game along with the \"Wilderkin\" and \"The Wretched Hive\" expansions. This pledge level includes twenty one metal miniatures, the rulebook, tokens, dice, and 70+ unique cards including all kinds of amazing characters, magic swords, advanced battle tactics, and powerful ancient relics from time immemorial.\n What's a Custom Character Card?\nImagine the possibilities.\nYou tell me about a D&D character you used to play or any character you can imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character in a special COLOR character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them! The custom card will be your ideas collaboratively realized in Relicblade. You're welcome to create heroes, villains, relics, or monsters, whatever your heart desires.\nYou get the original illustration and copies of your character card along with the other Legends from this campaign. All ten custom character commissions will be collected in the \"Legends 2\" booster pack. This booster pack will be an official expansion for Relicblade for players to collect and enjoy. The first Legends set was extremely popular, so don't miss out on being part of a new generation of legends!\nIt is my earnest hope to raise enough money to produce the two faction sets above. But within the production timeline for this project I am happy to add a little wish-list in the form of stretch goals.\nStretch goals are a great way to boost the project outcomes as the budget increases. If we raise enough money to produce the new sets, then the money we continue to raise will push toward even more new content! Newly unlocked content will be available as Add-Ons once the goal is reached.\nGuest Artist: DARKWIZARD BERSERKER\nThe Relicblade: Guest Artist Series RETURNS!! I'm beyond excited to offer another off the wall collaboration. As the creator of Relicblade I enjoy unbridled creative freedom. This privilege is granted by my generous Kickstarter Backers, so in this campaign I hope to extend the mantle of creative power to a deserving guest artist!\nTriptych by Darkwizard\nScott Wygmans is known under the name Darkwizard_Berserker on Instagram. I almost feel like that's enough to get him the job, but he deserves it for more than a badass Fighting Fantasy name. His style is both absolutely brutal and undeniably fun. He's got one foot firmly planted in heavy metal dungeon badassery and the other cheerfully placed in a fun-loving world of adventure. It's precisely this balance of light hearted savagery that makes Scott the perfect fit for Relicblade.\nI particularly love collaborating with artists with loads of style. Scott manages to evoke hardcore nostalgia of classic pen and paper gaming while always delivering something completely fresh. I encourage you to dig deep into his portfolio and let your imagination reel. It's going to be a special delight to sculpt based on his work. Let's make this happen!\nThis is a gross wizard.\nNOTE: The Shadow Fox and Gnome Alchemist are separate characters who form a cavalry pair. Now with the Ibex and Battlesmith you'll be able to swap riders and mounts to explore new combinations. As more cavalry models are released there will be more fun options to explore. \nFate of The Firstborn\n        \"The First Born King once ruled a mighty empire. His fertile lands stretched far and wide from his island borne ziggurat. His armies marched and his navy sailed, bringing tribute from the conquered. His sorcerers and alchemists sought and distilled the secrets of life. His seers and soothsayers predicted the rise and fall of mighty kings, dynasties, and empires. But for all his power and knowledge, The First Born King could not save his own.\nThe Firstborn still skulk in their hidden tombs and foul fens to this day, silent guardians of the treasures of their ancient empire. Animated by foul magics, they have remained strong and aware despite the loss of their primitive humanity.\nNow, bold adventurers and dastardly villains scour The Fens of The Firstborn in search of ancient treasure and powerful relics. From the be-swamped port city of Fen\u2019s Moore, they set out into the murky frontier to find their fate and fortune.\nJoin them if you dare, but know that wherever you go, The Firstborn will be waiting.\"\nFate of The Firstborn is an all new expansion for Relicblade!\nJust look at how cool these are in the video below. The Ancient Waystones scenario requires players track which objectives have been activated this round, and the Braziers will play a significant role in upcoming Relicblade Adventures!\nThese paint up really nicely, too. They make wonderful additions to your tabletop.\nThe additional Stone Spire miniature will be extremely useful for playing the game. I realize that most of you have the hobby skills to make as many rocks as you need. But I think an extra spire miniature will make the Geomancer more playable right out of the package. :) \nALSO. I can't believe I'm writing a stretch goal for 30k. THANK YOU!!! \nThe add-on marketplace is a way to add a few extra items to your pledge. That way you can rest assured you are getting all the Relicblade goodness you can handle.\nI highly recommend that new players pick up a copy of The Seeker's Handbook. This book contains the full rules for Relicblade, along with the awesome campaign rules. Link your games into an ongoing narrative, claim rare treasures, and assail terrible monsters on your quest to claim the mighty RELICBLADE! You and a friend will be equipped to play a full campaign with this book and the Bold Adventurer pledge level.\nNOTE: All the non-stretch goal add-ons are presently available at Relicblade.com. So if you're excited about trying the game you should place an order to get shipped to you right away! These add-ons are of particular interest to my EU friends who have had their eye on these treasures but didn't want to deal with customs. \nmnmNOTE: The terrain featured in the photographs was hand built by our amazing studio staff (me :D ). It's mostly made out of painted insulation foam, however I must draw special attention to the rad dungeon terrain. For the dungeon I used materials and resin/metal accessories from Firedragon Games. I cannot recommend their products highly enough! I built my full dungeon in one day, and painted it all the next day.

Funds will go to the necessary development tools and time needed.\nChallenge Mode [REACHED!]\nWe'll have some extra resources to put towards a unique challenge mode! Put your Flynn skills to the test in the arena with survival and boss rush trials!\nAnimated Intro\nWe'll be able to work with our pals over at Studio Yotta to create an animated intro for Flynn: Son of Crimson! It'll be pretty and juicy and whoa!\nRozia Story DLC\nAn alternate character in a DLC story played alongside Flynn's journey! We already have this story planned out, these funds would help it become a reality! All backers receiving the game will get the DLC at no charge.\n  Flynn: Son of Crimson is a 2D action adventure platformer with metroidvania elements. Set in a wondrous world with a looming darkness beginning to awaken yet again.\nWhat can you expect?\nExplore a wondrous world filled with discovery, taking place in unique regions designed with non-linear exploration.\nSwap between multiple weapons with quick and satisfying combat.\nDive in to a land with ancient mysteries and rich story.\nTravel across the lands, discovering new ways to roam and opening new paths using the power of crimson.\nDip in and out of an alternate dimension to make unique alterations to the real world.\nView a realm full of life, carefully formed with hand-crafted pixel art.\nTrade trinkets for new combat techniques and runes with an old war veteran.\nCall on your companion Dex in times of need, a mystical and loyal creature.\nTest your strength in the feared Rustwood coliseum among other challenging feats.\nTake on the role of Flynn, a young man orphaned as a child who sets out to chase the shadows of his beginnings whilst awakening the ancient power of Crimson within him. \nDiscover relics of ancient Rosantica, effigies and monuments to the goddess Sorrell that reveal hints at Flynn\u2019s beginnings and unlock new powers. Reveal secret pathways, trade with villagers, battle fierce monsters, hang out with dogs.\n    What about the Switch?\nWe've received a lot of requests for the Switch, we hear you! We'd love to launch on as many platforms as possible, but there is a problem. Flynn is being created in Gamemaker Studio 2, which is a great engine, but it currently does not support porting to the Switch. If we were to go for it now, Flynn would have to be recreated in an entirely new engine, which as you can imagine is a lot of work. Just know that Yoyo games is working hard on trying to make a Switch port possible! We can set up a later stretch goal for a Switch port, but until then we'll have to hope for the port to become available during Flynn's development! We'll keep everyone updated as Yoyo games and Nintendo work it out.\n  From the very first stages of development, we began designing Flynn: Son of Crimson with fast paced, satisfying combat. We\u2019re strong believers that \u2018game feel\u2019 should be priority in any video game so we've been injecting as much juice as we can to make sure every hit packs a punch and feels extra tasty.\nTrade gems and trinkets acquired throughout the game to learn new techniques for Flynn\u2019s arsenal, and you\u2019ll soon find that you can figure out your own favourite combination of attacks (Smash, bash, tickle, tickle, bosh!). Designed with quick and easy weapon swapping in mind, you\u2019re never more than a button press away from your desired weapon so you better dispatch your foes with flair, else you\u2019re not the cool hero everyone thought! \nThe Crimson Blade, a staple in Flynn's arsenal (and the default starting weapon, but that doesn\u2019t sound as appealing!) is the first weapon of Crimson energy gifted to Flynn by the Goddess Sorrell in a great time of need. Unlocking and mastering the uppercut will provide some serious hang time to any foe that is on the receiving end. Or why not slice through many baddies with the piercing dash? Piece of cake.\nThe Crimson Axe demands precise timing and enemy prediction, trading the quick cuts of the crimson blade for a weighty windup, this axe packs a punch sure to leave your enemies as a smear on the floor. Use the axe to crush your enemy's shields, and smash brittle walls to access new areas with brute force. It\u2019s a wonder how the young one can lift this, but as we wrote this we realized it is made of energy, whoops.\nThe Crimson Claws, a swift and energetic set of weapons used to stagger enemies with high attack speed and air superiority, if that\u2019s your sort of thing. Unleash your inner wildcat with unique wall climbing (go home, Knuckles) and a spiral drill attack (you too, Taz) to tear into enemies and dig through soft ground, these high mobility weapons will have you on your toes and keep your hands warm.\nWhat would our youthful hero be without a ranged weapon? That's right, a hero without a ranged weapon. So here's a bow, not any old bow, but a Super Awesome Crimson Bow\u2122 (nice). Acquired early on in the game, this will help you hurt/take out weaker foes from a distance. Use the bow to trigger traps and puzzles, and even augment with elemental arrows such as ice, electricity, and explosive (explosions are an element, right?). Once you've unlocked them, it's your choice which to roll out with, depending on your play style, whoa!\nSet in the world of Rosantica after the Great Conflict, a war that carried on for decades between parallel worlds, one of humanity, one of gods. The worlds once kept in peace by the Crimson Goddess Sorrell and Lord Zealock, now torn between each other.\nThe Great Conflict between overlapping worlds, caused by Sorrell\u2019s forbidden love of a mortal knight, Allistair. Falling for humanity's innocence and good nature, Sorrell leaves her world for another, sending Zealock into madness with her involvement with the \"frail humanity\".\nDecades of war have gone by between worlds, as things begin to look grim for the people of Rosantica. Realizing she can do no more to protect them from Zealock's growing rage, Sorrell initiates an ultimate sacrifice with her and her love, giving their lives to banish what has now become The Scourge. Locking Lord Zealock and his followers away to the malicious world they have created.\nBut don\u2019t live in the past, the world around you is brimming with exploration and discovery. Track down a mysterious stranger that appears to be following you as the barrier between worlds begins to crack, and investigate her ties to The Scourge and Zealock.\n  Roam the fantastic world both on foot and with your loyal companion Dex, a last gift from Sorrell and a guardian of Rosantica, helping both man and beast alike take back their homes. Will you follow Flynn on his journey through this war torn land?\n  Venture into the heart of evil itself, and tackle the horrors of The Scourge head-on. A once pristine land of gods, now an infested land filled with hatred. Track clues about your past and the Crimson power that grows within you leading to this nest of evil, and uncover what really lies at the heart.\nFlynn must hurry, with every passing day The Scourge\u2019s hold on Rosantica grows, slowly plunging the world into madness and decay with its noxious corruption. You must seek to end Zealock\u2019s reign of disease and lunacy before it\u2019s too late. \nTraveling between dimensions, Flynn controls the ability to tear open portals to The Scourge with the power of Crimson. Finding alternate paths and searching for trapped Rosanticans taken away from their homes. But be wary, The Scourge has many eyes in search of Flynn.\n    Journey through the vast island of Rosantica in search for answers to stop the land from falling victim to the corruption. The world is pieced together to transition seamlessly as you travel across the 5 unique regions.\nExplore the frigid Mistral Peak \u2013 a frozen over mountain once brimming with enterprise and discovery of its rich natural resources and fossils, now fallen victim to The Scourge\u2019s wretched influence in the form of a supernaturally dangerous blizzard. Discover what infernal power has summoned up this ferocious storm and help put a stop to it.\nWade through the once secluded and dazzling waters of The Hollow's Isles. A group of seaside caverns and alcoves that were once the pinnacle of natural beauty and serenity that have been ravaged by the relentless winds brought on by the blizzards of Mistral Peak above. Track your quest into the damp caves to battle off the mutated crustaceans that have forced out the indigenous Neptyn to flee their ancestral homes.\nLose yourself in the sprawling gardens of Rustwood. Home to the legendary proving grounds of the warrior tribe, the Mazir, and their Fighting Coliseum. The Mazir are a beetle-like people that are honor bound to prove themselves capable warriors by duking it out in this immense arena. Be warned, however, for The Scourge has seeped even into this land of once sacred trials. The swamps of Rustwood grow darker as each day goes by, causing hazardous poison storms to awaken.\nYour quest for knowledge will eventually lead you to the home of all scholarly pursuits, the famed Shivering Spire. What used to be the beacon of knowledge and symbol of Rosantica\u2019s prosperity, is now home to a portal of the netherworld, with its devout healers and once benevolent sorcerers now becoming vessels for The Scourge\u2019s evil magic to pour into the world of Rosantica. Flynn will be bombarded with acolytes that are now driven mad by their enhanced dark powers, as well as assaulted by powerful warlocks that once dared to challenge gods themselves.\nIn between journeys, Flynn will return to Sanctia. A stronghold where his most valued allies reside, banding together to help Flynn fight off the corruption. Here Flynn will barter rare Crimson Shards found throughout the world for new techniques and upgrades, as well as complete quests for the villagers.\nFlynn: Son of Crimson features crisp, hand-crafted pixel art that's designed to compliment its frenetic gameplay. Readability and strong visual tells are key components in our artistic process, as we realize how important it is for a game to be crystal-clear in its visual feedback to the player.  \nEach chunky pixel is deliberately and thoughtfully placed to create a memorable world for players to explore. Mischievous goblins, big-bellied fish men, blood-thirsty wolves, and more are brought to life with expressive animations brimming with personality.\nFrom concept art, to character sprites, and final polished animations - we aim to deliver a product we're truly proud of, and one that communicates to our players how much we truly care for the timeless and endearing craft of pixel-art!\n    From our composer, Jacob Lincke: Starting with a clean slate is always exciting and inspiring. \u201cFlynn: Son of Crimson\u201d needs satisfying music to accompany its already magical looking art style. I started looking at things I thought the game reminded me of; other games, movies and even places in the real world. I want the soundtrack to have its own unique voice, instantly connecting it to the game.\nI have a deep love for traditional folk music from all over the world which made me think of all sorts of fun instruments and what they could bring to the table. Flutes and keyed fiddles are combined with medieval lutes and finally mixed together with a grand orchestra making you feel less alone. All of this and a touch of retro synths to go along with the cute art style results in a collaboration between Scandinavian folk music and the Far East.\nI imagined Flynn wandering enchanting forests such as those found in Ghibli movies and traversing cold mountains of my homeland Sweden. I want the music to help Flynn telling his story, setting the atmosphere and be beautiful at the same time.\n    Always felt like you needed something Crimsony for your wall? Me too. Put this pretty 18\" by 24\" poster all over it and have your friends say, \"whoa\"! A beautiful illustration by Jaya Ply (@Nikingply).\nGet warm with this high quality t-shirt designed by miski! Printed on a 50/50 blend shirt for maximum comfort. We may or may not kiss each one before they ship. T-shirt sizing and possible color options will be provided after the campaign.\nDig your eyes intothe Official Flynn: Son of Crimson art book containing used and unused concept art, pixel art, level design sketches, fan art, a deeper look into the lore, and more! Size of the book to be decided later in development, based on our content. \nBecome one with the game with your spooky skeleton in the ground, and your likeness drawn in to your own gravestone to be placed in the Rustwood Graveyard. In other words, your face on a rock. \nDesign an NPC to fit in to the game! We'll contact you to work on your NPC's design, personality, dialogue (nothing naughty!), back story, and favorite things.\nGet your own custom room! You choose its location, style, what it's full of, maybe a bit of lore, maybe a bit of graffiti, maybe your face everywhere, I don't know. Put your own flair in to it!\nCombine every design tier before to create a sidequest! Include your secret room and your NPC in this quest to make Flynn fetch a bucket of water, or to do 50 pushups, whatever your heart desires!\nA story being told right from our hearts and fingers, Flynn is a young baby boy that has been on our minds over the last two years. As we write this, we are roughly one full year into development on Flynn: Son of Crimson from when we began putting this design all on paper.\nactual paper!\nSo far being funded completely by our own money, we feel we're now in a good place to introduce Flynn to Kickstarter. In order to continue to fulfill our dreams in making Flynn a real boy, we need your support! We're very confident in the head start we have on the basics in design and development, with a lot of the core features already built and working. A large portion will be going to the art, allowing us to give our artists more consistent hours and maybe even hire extra help. Additionally, the sound is very important to us, so that will be a big investment as well.\nIs this your first game? \nFirst bigger scale game, yes. We have 2 other games we released in the wild on mobile though, which can be found here:  \nSamurai Blitz\nRaccoon Rascals\nWe also have a couple projects we have worked on in the past that didn\u2019t quite make the cut (we all have them), but we see them as more of a learning process and who knows, we may come back to them in 50 years time.\nSpecial Thanks\nAndrew Filip - Web design/development, help with the trailer.\nJohan Aronson - Being part of Flynn's original birth long ago, and the title screen.\nmiski - Being the greatest for designing the t-shirt last minute with us.\n           This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges for a project like this.

This campaign is specifically for the funding the creation Issues 8 and 9, which will complete Volume1. That means MOST of the book is already complete. I only have about 50 pages to go out of the 225+ pages in the series.\nNew to the story? Not to worry!  All of Volume 1 is available in this campaign. Also Issues 8 and 9 will be of course available as well for those who have already been following along.\nThanks to the lovely and amazing Kickstarter community I've had Issues 2 - 7 funded on previous campaigns. This project began years ago and has slowly turned into something I am really devoted to and would love to work on for years to come.\nGIRRION is a sweeping sci-fi fantasy story of a hero's journey in a distant world in a distant time. The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\n        Inking in progress\n        Volume 1 cover art in progress\n     Girrion started off as a hobby over 15 years ago. Initially it was more of an illustration portfolio than a story. I wanted to be a concept artist, so I would spend a lot of time designing characters, ships and environments.\nI didn't consider myself a writer back then, but I started getting ideas for a story. When I would draw environments or characters the ideas would just pop in my head. One scene led to another, then another etc. It took a lot of time, but the experience put in over the years not only helped the art, it also gave me time to develop the story more and give it more depth than it had in the earlier drafts.\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\n            This will be the first campaign where a full volume book is available. It will be 225+ pages in length. 6.14\" x 9.2\"\nVolume 1 mockup. Cover art and design are in progress.\n Previous campaigns single issues were available in hardcover or softcover, and these formats will be available in this campaign as well. \nSample Hardcover (Issue #7)\n Hardcover comic issues are 6\" x 9\". Grey cloth with a dust jacket. Each issue is anywhere from 22 - 26 pages in length.\nSoftcover samples (Issues 1-9)\nSoftcover comic issues are 6\"x9\" and have a glossy cover with a stock thicker than standard comics. The interior art is full color and has a watercolor feel.\nSample Character Sketch\n  Sample 4\" x 6\" print\n  How Do Add Ons Work?\nHere's what you do:\nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) Add the total of your Add On to your pledge amount. (i.e. one Giclee Fine art print is $25.) You don't need to change the tier you've selected You are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. Thank you!\n  Generally, about half of my expenses come from printing the books and mailing them. The other half of the budget is going into the production. Most of what this campaign money goes towards is large chunks of time for me to focus fully on the book. One issue takes me 300 - 400 hours. If I'm able to knock off some days working freelance on other jobs, the books come out much faster.\n  Scout Comics is now publishing Girrion! They released Issue 1 last October and will be releasing books up through this Fall. They are an indie publisher\u2013 very supportive of their creators and just a great group of people all around. They also have a wide range of comics which you can check out on their site. www.scoutcomics.com\nFollow\nWebsite: www.girrion.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/Girrion1\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/girrion1/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/girrion1/\nMusic from Kickstarter Video: \"Night Owl\" by Broke For Free", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long. There are some complex scenes in this issue with lots of characters and elements that need strong design. Again from past experience, the artwork can sometimes take a bit longer than expected. Also, keep in mind I have to mix this work in with the day job.\n\nI've learned a lot from previous Kickstarter campaigns, and I am getting more and more efficient. I'm also trying to find ways to make rewards as cost-effective as possible too. One way of doing this is to do more than one issue per campaign, which cuts down on mailing costs.

As Spymasters, position your Spies and Specialists to outmaneuver your opponent and dominate the battlefield.\nPlayers must stay one step ahead of their opponent on a battleground that is as much in the minds of the Spymasters as on the board. Predict your opponent\u2019s moves to prevent them from gaining ground, and when all hope seems lost, snatch victory away from your opponent with clever use of your Specialist agents.\nIf you are the first to capture both parts of the Doomsday Device, it\u2019s game over for your opponent.\nA quick review of the game board and object will reveal that Pocket Ops is based on the familiar framework of tic-tac-toe \u2014 but don't write it off as child's play just yet! The prediction mechanic and Specialist abilities have been proven to offer playtesters both challenge and laughter. Don't believe it? Check out the sample Print n' Play files below:\n   ...or check out the Tabletop Simulator mod on Steam!\n  Pocket Ops is the first published design of Brandon Beran, with art and graphic design by industry veteran Josh Cappel.\n         Pocket Ops is quick to pick up, because you already know how to play; If you've played Tic-Tac-Toe before, you have the fundamentals: place markers in a grid, trying to get three in a row. But wait! The simple but game-changing twist with Pocket Ops is that before you make a move, the other player gets to secretly predict where you are going to go. After your move, if they were right, your move is canceled. In addition, a variety of Specialist tokens that introduce all sorts of sneaky abilities will change the way you place and predict. Pocket Ops takes a classic framework and breathes surprising life into it.

For Canadians, this also covers import taxes and customs duties.\nUnfortunately, we can't offer the same outside the US and Canada, because it is simply too expensive. However, any EU orders will be \"EU Friendly\", in that they will not incur VAT or customs fees on delivery.\n  We know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have created the 4- and 10-copy levels with lower pricing per copy.\n     We are very happy to bring this project to you via Kickstarter. Keeping true to our philosophy, we have asked for an amount that will get us halfway to what we need to produce the game. It will take about twice as much money as we are asking to bring Pocket Ops to life, and our part is ready.

Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards and transparency we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\n\nAside from artwork changes that may come about as a result of stretch goals, this game is finished and ready to go to Bang Wee, the experienced manufacturer of our two previous titles.\n\nWe learned a lot from our first Kickstarter campaign, and we feel confident that those lessons will help us make this campaign successful.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Spy in training", "descp": "Support our project + 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 14 or more", "title": "Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\nFREE shipping within the US, $5 Canada, $10 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["933 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Stroop Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["55 backers", "Limited (195 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 36 or more", "title": "Unreal Estate Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["45 backers", "Limited (205 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "Spy Hard", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 4 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 4 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$7 for shipping within the US, $12 Canada, $15 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 52 or more", "title": "Guild Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $15 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["43 backers", "Limited (207 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Santa Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 10 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 10 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $20 Canada, $30 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "\"Bond...

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our last Kickstarter at more than double the funding level, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital. What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?\nKicktraq\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures and capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day.

Only the sculpting and printing is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. We have, so far, completed 3 Kickstarter projects.

All you need is to learn this simple method of Cognitive Drawing and you will soon be decoding and memorizing how to draw things like you never imagined possible. \nHow can I make such a bold claim? Because this technique is exactly how I taught myself how to draw.\nI believe that with Cognitive Drawing you will quickly learn how to test yourself and force your brain to start memorizing what you are learning. \nWhat is Cognitive Drawing?\nCognitive Drawing will be an easy (90+ page) workbook designed to teach you how to learn to draw anatomy from memory. Not only will you learn to draw but you will learn to do it in a way that helps your brain retain what you learned. \nThis book is perfect for beginners and intermediate artists of all ages.\nThe technique in this book is exactly how I (Jason Brubaker) taught myself to draw as a teenager without an expensive art education. At the age of twenty I was hired by a storyboarding agency in Los Angeles and I have been a professional artist ever since working in storyboards, animation and visual development on some of the biggest movies and commercials in Hollywood. (You can see my IMDB credits here.)\nWe are printing the book on sketch book paper perfect for drawing with pencil.\nHow did Cognitive Drawing start?\nBack in the mid 90's when I was trying to learn to draw, I developed this method while trying to memorize anatomy and different artistic styles. Although I didn't have a name for it yet, it was the way that I was able to learn anatomy quickly. It was't long before I was able to draw anatomy and styles quickly from memory and I attribute much of this success to this method.\nOver the years I have tried to explain the Cognitive Drawing method to friends assuming that others were doing it as well. To my surprise, I have never found anyone teaching or using this technique. Twenty years later I decided to make an experimental worksheet to show a drawing class how to quickly learn to draw things on their own. To my surprise, about 90% of the students found my method surprisingly easy and highly effective for learning to draw from memory. \nSince it worked so well for others I decided that it was time to try to make a Cognitive Drawing book using this technique to aid in learning one of the hardest things to learn to draw: anatomy. I announced the idea on my Youtube channel and nearly 100 people signed up to be beta testers for an experimental 40 page anatomy book using Cognitive Drawing. \nAfter a few months of testing Cognitive Drawing the beta testers were finished and sent me their results and I was once again blown away with the high percentage of positive feedback and massive improvement for almost all of the beta testers.\nThe beta-test worked better than I expected again but it still needed much improvement to be a real workbook. I received much needed feedback from the testers and studied all the problem areas in their drawings I was able to refine Cognitive Drawing into an amazing and fun daily exercise designed to walk a beginner artist through the entire male figure (from any angle or pose) within a month.\nWhat is in the Cognitive Drawing Book?\nCognitive Drawing will be a 96+ page workbook book designed to fold flat so you can draw on all the pages. \n(The page count will keep growing as we hit stretch goals. I would like to get it up to 140 pages if possible.)\nAbout 60% of the workbook will be cognitive drawing worksheets and the rest of the book is full of lessons and exercises to help you tie it all together. This book will help you memorize proportions of body and face, muscle groups, poses and more and will show you how to use Cognitive Drawing to learn how to memorize any drawing style you find. \nAlong with Cognitive Exercises the book is filled with muscle breakdowns and other exercises that helped me understand how to build a figure from scratch. Here are some samples of some of the daily exercises:\nThe book will be a combination of Cognitive Drawing exercises mixed with anatomy breakdowns and other drawing lessons.\nOnce you complete the book, not only will you know anatomy but you will also be able to use this technique with all kinds of other reference material like: anatomy books, comic books, robots, dinosaurs, aliens, monsters, machines, manga, your favorite artists or even photos. The sky is the limit!\nWho Is Cognitive Drawing For?\nThe book is designed for Homeschoolers, Drawing Groups, Classrooms and personal use. There is no nudity in the book so it's safe for all ages.\nI have seen much improvement in students ages of 8 and up. As long as there is a desire to learn to draw and you can spend about 30 minutes a day focused on doing an exercise then this is for you.\nBacked by Science?\nInterestingly enough, some of my findings agree with what scientists have learned about how the brain learns and retains information. This is the field of Cognitive Psychology. I have even interviewed a Cognitive Scientist who experimented with my method and he has helped me develop it to be even better than I expected.\nI will post an interview with him here where he breaks down the scientific principles used in Cognitive Drawing and why they work.\nProduction Timeframe\nThere are about 3 months of production left on the book depending on how many extra pages we can get funding to add. I would like to be able to make the book 140 pages but this would mean hitting stretch goals. So depending on how many pages the final book is will determine how quickly it goes to print.\nOnce printing begins it will take about 3 months to have the books in my studio and they will be shipped out shortly after that.\nI am setting the delivery deadline to April 2018 as a worst case scenario. But the funding amount will determine the exact timeframe and we might be able to have the books in your hands by this Christmas. \nMoney\nI am planning to print 3000 copies of this book quoted at $10,410. With shipping estimates as well as Kickstarter fees and Card processing fees, it will be over $16,000. We need another 9k for the remaining production costs and assistance to complete all the pages and worksheets. This brings our total to $24,900 to make sure this book can get off the ground.\nIf we don't reach this goal then I will not be able to invest the time or money to get the book printed so please help by sharing this with everyone you know who wants to learn how to draw.\nWho Am I?\nI'm Jason Brubaker. I am a self taught artist. I started my professional career at the age of 19 and have worked for more than 20 years in the entertainment industry on big movies (Blade, Pitch Black, Kung Fu Panda 1, 2 & 3) and hundreds of commercials before launching my own company to publish graphic novels and books. Now I self-publish graphic novels for a living.

All backers at pledge levels of $50.00 or more at the end of the campaign will receive all stretch goal rewards included with their pledge rewards on fulfillment. The stretch goal rewards will be awarded in addition to your pledge level and will be automatically included with your shipment when your pledge is fulfilled.

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our last Kickstarter at more than double the funding level, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital.

We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. A quick look at our previous Kickstarters will show that we shipped rewards to backers ahead of schedule. We received a total of 2 (two) complaints from all of our backers regarding fulfillment. One of these was simply the delivery company not getting it to the backer which was eventually resolved by sending a replacement and the other one was a backer not happy with a defective casting that was resolved by substitution and replacement. We believe we have a 100% backer satisfaction record after two successful kickstarters. We're not perfect but if a problem does arise we do our honest best to resolve any issues. \n\nAn unforeseen event, though unlikely, could be, well, unforeseen.

Face new horrors with sword and shild or embrace a dark alliance as they delve into the unknown depths of Relicblade.\nThe Bone and Darkness Kickstarter campaign offers the opportunity to add rad new characters to Relicblade. These expansions not only present the chance to expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players. The Bone and Darkness Kickstarter campaign promises to deliver all-new factions, characters, unit types, upgrades, and dark new powers that add wonderfully to an already delightful fantasy-battle experience.\nGet both of the new expansions and eight incredible miniatures with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level!\nEuropean backers will have their rewards shipped from Germany.\nBone and Darkness\nMysterious skull faced villains stalk the wild-lands. Early reports indicated these sinister watchers had something to do with the Pig-Men. Now we find that these dark wanderers are an evil threat unlike anything we've seen before. \nThe Dark Wanderer model kit includes the option to assemble the character with a Longbow or a Maul. Choose your favorite or buy an extra kit in the add-ons so you can have both builds.\nThe Dark Wanderers are unyielding warriors whose martial prowess is undeniable. They often carry powerful mauls or strange bone-bows. One must never underestimate these foes. Some have slaughtered legendary knights in single combat. Others expertly kill from a distance with jagged bone arrows then silently disappear into unnatural darkness.\nThese wanderers wield dark bone-magic, a new form of necromancy that spurs unnatural growth and creates mutated skeletal monstrosities. Unlike the dead who haunt the ruins, bound to this world by ancient magic, these creatures behave as beasts. They are furious, manic, beings who attack without provocation and with unnatural savagery.\nthe arms swap on these guys.\nThe bone construct is the most disturbing of all. It is a towering creature assembled from the magic-warped bones of multiple bodies. Without any life of it's own, these infernal engines of destruction are powered by life-force torn from its allies. These unstoppable monsters are immensely strong, and are able to unleash a fearsome howl that can shatter the will of the most stalwart hero.\n3D renders of the Bone and Darkness Faction Pack\nThe Lone Guard\nMuch of what we know about the horror of the coming Darkness is through the valiant efforts of the Lone Guard. The Lone Guard is an ancient order of warriors and rangers who patrol the wilderness. They are an ever vigilant force against every kind of impending threat.\nThe Lone Guard Rangers are hardy frontiersmen who travel hidden paths and have an uncanny kinship with nature. Armed with a keen longbow, the rangers are deadly hunters who stalk both powerful game and fiendish enemies.\nSome rangers have forged powerful bonds with the Smilodon Fatalis. These saber-toothed cats are natural predators who take to the partnership in deadly accord. The Saber-toothed cat uses its powerful claws to wrestle its prey into position before using its dagger-like fangs. Working in tandem with a ranger the cat will hold the prey in an exposed position creating an opening for its partner to land a singularly deadly strike.\nA Saber-tooth Cat?! UGH! SO COOL!\nThe Lone Guard Warriors are lightly armored fighters who are quick to respond to any threat. These intrepid fighters dive into combat with razor sharp skill and deadly poise. Their preferred armament is the bastard sword and round shield. They use both as weapons for quick attack and defense, and are a versatile presence on the battlefield.\nOh rad.\nThe Billman brings a useful set of skills to any warband. His polearm grants a reach advantage, while the hooked end can be used to force the enemy off balance. These trained soldiers work in close partnership with whoever hires them, and are ready to hook a shield or deliver a finishing blow as needed.\nHandsome mustache included at no extra charge.\n3D renders of The Lone Guard Faction Pack.\nThe wave two expansions introduce two new character types to Relicblade. The Bone and Darkness expansion introduces the construct character type. Constructs have no life of their own and enter play inert. Through the application of specific magic, players will be able to bring these creatures to bare against their foes. Constructs are a powerful addition to your war band for relatively few points. The real cost to your war party will be what it takes to keep the terrible bone construct empowered. Constructs can only be removed from play by magical attacks while inert, and will likely remain a relevant game-changing piece through the entire battle.\nThe Lone Guard expansion brings the much anticipated companion character type to the game. Companions operate in tandem with the character that hires them. A skilled billman can be attached to your hero for a few extra points. These two characters can activate together to use their skills and abilities to achieve incredible things.\nRanger and companion Smilodon support one another in this dangerous encounter.\nEach of the new Relicblade faction packs will include a special scenario related to the faction. These thematic adventures add fun context to your battles. The scenarios will also seamlessly integrate into the forthcoming campaign rules for Relicblade! \nLearn more about Relicblade on the page for the Original Kickstarter Campaign or at www.relicblade.com\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. Remember, by backing Relicblade you're helping it exist! Get ahold of this delightfully unique miniatures game. Relicblade is 100% natural, pure, and unfiltered imagination that is bottled at the source. It is untouched by the sanitizing influence of a board-room or stock-holders. Enjoy the benefits of live and active gaming cultures.\nEuropean backers will have their rewards shipped from Germany.\nYour wife won't be mad. It costs less than a (fancy) sandwich...\nTake the oath of the Lone Guard and resist the Darkness!\nNo good-guys for me, thanks. There is only darkness in this mortal shell.\n If you're new to Relicblade the \"Champion of Adventure\" is AWESOME! At this mega-rad pledge level you'll get the core game along with the \"Bone and Darkness\" and \"The Lone Guard\" expansions. This pledge level includes twenty one metal miniatures, the rulebook, tokens, dice, and not to mention 70+ unique cards including all kinds of amazing characters, magic swords, advanced battle tactics, and even snacks incase your pigs get a bit hungry.\nStretch Goals are a lot of the fun of Kickstarter.  I have a few particularly awesome things that I really want to make. Without a little extra success here I won't be able to take on the projects right away. If we are able to unlock these stretch goals they'll be made available as add-ons. So here's hoping y'all love Relicblade half as much as I do, and we can get this mind blisteringly awesome stuff together!\nThe Deep: Guest Artist Series\nAs the creator of Relicblade I have enjoyed unprecedented creative freedom, and thanks to your help I've been able to get my unfiltered imagination onto tabletops the world over! It's such an incredible experience that I want to share it with artists who have styles that shouldn't be filtered before smashing up dungeons around the world. In accordance with what is right and just, I'm launching the Relicblade Guest Artist Series.\nI first saw Keegan Kaya McGee's work on ye olde world wide web. His art delights me to no end. His style is a similar mixture of badass and goofy like my own. However, his work is completely different in so many fantastic ways! This wonderful blend of similar yet completely wacky and unique made him the perfect choice for my first guest artist. Keegan did the illustrations for the cards, we collaborated on the rules, and I'll do the sculpture! It's all very exciting...\nI can't imagine not falling in love with this stuff. but that's up to you. Definitely check out keegankayamcgee.com and use your eye-balls to soak up some @KeeganKayaMcGee and the tag #thingsyoumightfindinadungeon on Instagram.\nThe multi part miniature can be assembled as the Shark Warrior or the Eel Sorcerer!!\nI want the Campaign Rules so bad I can taste it. It's a pretty big undertaking so I needed to place the goal up here at 15k. I know I'll need to take a pretty decent chunk of time out of regular work to make this happen, but I sure as heck want to. I love a good pick-up death-match style game, but especially in a fantasy setting like this I want to see my characters advance and take on dangerous new adventures. \nWhat are Add-Ons?\nAdd-ons give Backers the option to add extra bits to their rewards for a little extra money. This is the best opportunity for people to grab extra components to optimize their Relicblade experience.\nThe Faction sets are right around 65-70 points worth of characters in-game. Since a standard game is 100 points a few Pigs, some extra Bone Stalkers, a Knight, some Thieves, or a noble Cleric of Justice, will bump your war-band to full fighting strength right off the bat.\nUsing the marketplace below you can look at what is available and adjust your pledge accordingly. I want to make sure you get everything you want out of this Kickstarter campaign, and I believe this will help. \nShipping\nShipping will be processed through Kickstarter, the old fashioned way. When you select your pledge level you will also be asked to add USA, Canada, or \"rest of world\" shipping. I do my best to ship in the most affordable way I can manage, but it's still pretty costly to ship internationally. I'm sorry for that.\nThe note about \"add-on\" shipping only really applies if you ordered at the digital scholar, or scholar levels. Scholar level will ask for a little shipping, but if you add a box set we'll need to make sure we have enough postage.\nRelicblade miniatures are carefully crafted white-metal model kits. Each figure is supplied unassembled and unpainted. Painting miniatures is a delightful part of the hobby that can, and should, be enjoyed by people of all ages!\nI put together this little video to help shine light on how it's done. It can be hard to know where to start. Here I'll show you how easy it is to make something look decent with very little effort! The first video covers assembly while part-two goes into painting.\nI love this hobby, and It's my pleasure to help you get into it any way I can. In these videos I pretty much say everything I would say if we were hanging out. Give it a watch and play along at home if you like.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn February of this year I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to create Relicblade. It was a truly amazing experience. Thanks to the support of backers from around the world I was able to create an extremely rad finished product.

FANS AND NEW FACES!!\n  It is with great pleasure that I return to Kickstarter once again to fund a new set of Fantasy Norse 28 mm heroic miniatures!\n  In this campaign I intend to produce a  host of 20 new Njorn characters of various roles sure to tread ruin upon their foes in the Frosty Ruins and forlorn wildernesses of the Great Cold North. Berserker, Hird, and Huscarls, Rangers, and  Mages. And the Norns allowing, mayhaps even more. There are many allies at the call of the Northfolk if the need be.\n   Backers can pledge for an entire warband ( 10 figures in total as of the launch of the campaign ) cast in high quality white metal, or pick and choose individual figures from the selection funded by this campaign. OR backers can pledge for the same warband cast in high fidelity resin or resin solos of individuals funded by the campaign or a mix of both!   The pledges are as follows:\n   SOLO METAL ..................This pledge level rewards backers with 1 copy of any one of the figures successfully funded through this campaign cast in high quality white metal.  \n  SOLO RESIN ..................This pledge level rewards backers with 1 copy of any one of the figures successfully funded through this campaign cast in high fidelity resin.  \n   WAR BAND METAL ..............This pledge rewards backers with one full set of any 10 figures successfully funded over the course of this campaign cast in high quality white metal.  \n   WAR BAND RESIN ..............This pledge rewards backers with one full set of any 10 figures successfully funded over the course of this campaign cast in high fidelity Resin.\n   WAR PARTY METAL.......This pledge rewards backers with any  20 figures successfully funded over the course of this campaign cast in high quality white metal.\n    WAR PARTY  RESIN.......This pledge rewards backers with any  20 figures successfully funded over the course of this campaign cast in high fidelity Resin.\n Here be the place where stand the long list of the hardy souls afoot in the snows of the cold north and the price they demand for their hands in battle. many of the items pictured here are still slightly WIP but these will all be finished before the end of the campaign.\nAll items listed in this Section are offered as selections for the \" Warband \" and \" War Party \" pledge rewards. each of which offering a VERY hefty discount off of the RRP of Red Box Games figures ( $9-$10 ) per figure. Please keep in mind that these prices expire at the close of this kickstarter and that post campaign pledge-ups or jump-ins will not be allowed. if you want in on this deal you have to be a part of the kickstarter.\n    All of the characters listed here cost as follows;\n   #1 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #2 $7.00 metal , $15 resin\n    #3 $7.00 metal , $15 resin\n  #4 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #5 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #6 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #7 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n    #8 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #9 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #10 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n    #11 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #12 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #13 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #14 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #15 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n    #16 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n    #17 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #18 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #19 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #20 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n                  .\n After the close of the kickstarter, full collection and transfer of the funds gained by the campaign, and the full production process of the items funded by the campaign, Upon readiness of the rewards for fulfillment you will be issued a link to an external website which will allow you to select the specific items and quantity there of you would like to apply your pledge to as a reward. At this point you will also be billed for your postage as needed. This way all of the information is nice and neat and easily manageable and you do not have to fuss with multiple payments strung out over the course of delivery.\n    Here be the place where await the stranger folk a wander in the Cold North. Mayhaps they are friend. Mayhaps they are foe.\n        I work with a great team of very talented and reliable contractors who handle all of the mold making and metal and resin casting of my products and I operate a live webstore where in you can view and purchase any one of my currently available products.\n  http://red-box-games.com/\n\n     IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT add funds to cover postage to your pledge. Postage will be billed upon readiness to deliver. Any funds collected via kickstarter MUST be applied to the rewards ONLY.\n  This project is produced in the US so the postage within the US should not exceed $5 for most rewards packages. The reason I say most is just to caveat for the odd wonderfully insane backer who pledges for 20 sets of 20 figures. Obviously heavier packages that exceed the standard priority rate postage boxes would cost more to ship.\nAll packages shipped within the US will be shipped with all the necessary cushion and damage prevention measures we can provide to make sure that your goodies arrive safe and sound and in pristine condition. US backers will of course not need to worry about any import duties, customs fees, shipping company collapses, or bands of savage pirates preventing them from receiving their beloved Red Box Games minis.\n  I also have confirmation that we Will be fulfilling with help from oir very goodmfriends at Hasslefree miniatures in the UK Many thanks Dameon!!\n  AUSTRALIA: I do really love all you guys very much, and I am sorry yall always seem to get stuck at the end of fulfillment. To that end I am going to assure you that your rewards will be the first shipped when fulfillment begins. You have all been so patient and loyal and I do not want you guys to feel taken for granted at all. I cannot however absorb the customs fees and import duties or the postage costs fro shipping to Australia.\n  CANADA: again as above. I am eternally grateful for yall's continued support and patience and I assure you all that your rewards will be shipped along side of the Australian backer's rewards. The postage costs to Canada can fluctuate rather dramatically and there could be customs fees incurred.\n  I try to keep my postage costs as close to actual cost of the postage and materials as possible, subsidizing the costs of our time to sort and package as part of the cost of making this as affordable as possible for you all.\n\n     For those who are unfamiliar with me as a sculptor and with my business red box games I am a sculptor of finely detailed 28mm scale fantasy miniatures. Most often specializing in minis of a Norse theme. I founded my business in 2008 and have been producing miniatures ever since. In that time I have produced some 300 odd figures for my various ranges of Men, Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, Halflings, Orcs, Demons and Undead of all kind of role for each of those range themes. I have now run 9 kickstarters and have fully delivered on 7 ( 2 campaigns were canceled prior to reaching the funding goal ). I always strive to produce figures of the highest possible quality and have gone to great lengths and even significant personal difficulty to see to it that I deliver fully on all of my promises.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have a great deal of experience in the running and delivery of kickstarters and 7 years experience in the industry dealing with all the various aspects of producing and marketing miniatures. These aspects include design, sculpting, coordinating production, quality control, packaging and shipment. I maintain a very close relationship with my customers and backers well after the sale is made.\nI have experienced difficulties in previous kickstarters but have run several successful campaign which delivered on time and to expectation, but even in the kickstarters which delivered late I have always delivered in full as promised.\n\nI very keenly understand the hurtles which may present themselves during the fulfillment of kickstarters and I am ready to deal with any of them. You can rest fully assured that I will deliver your rewards to you if you back my campaign.

This is a work in progress, does not represent the final game and is subject to change. Any and all feedback is welcome - good luck, doctor!\nPS. This build has only had limited testing and optimizations but wanted to give everyone something to sink their teeth into, so expect some bugs!\n    Hi! We're the Thar Be Monsters team! Founded in 2015 by three AAA industry artists that wanted to create a game inspired by colorful and gross Saturday morning cartoons.\nOur team has worked on a lot over the years, from indie to AAA -- including League of Legends, Darksiders 2, Enter the Gungeon, and Ori and the Blind Forest! We've been around the block before, and we've got a serious passion for making games.\nCheck us out in our team bios below!\n  Blubber Busters is a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on frantic combat. Space whales have problems -- Lots of problems -- from bizarre bacteria to pesky parasites and everything in between, and they need your help! We're big fans of 90s-era combat platformers, and are especially inspired by games like Mega Man X, Metal Slug and the Metroid series! Blubber Busters is definitely snuggled up in that same blanket and we aim to make something that stands toe-to-toe with the greats.\nWhales come to you for help, and who are you to turn them down? Pick your patient and get out there! Each afflicted whale effectively works as a single stage with its own set of problems and objectives you need to solve to help get it happy and healthy again. A whale with a stomach ache may have you trekking down into the stomach to clear out unwanted debris while dodging digestive acids, or a parasite infection may have you wiping out swaths of critters before taking on their queen!\nSwap between crew members to tackle each situation. Switch to the more agile Eva to climb a wall, burn through barriers with Rudy's flamethrower or kick-start machinery with some juice from Emmett's defibrillators! Or just cycle between all of them to give infections a thrashing. There's no I in team, so get to know the whole crew!\nTreating patients earns you cash! As you play, the whales who show up to your orbital \"waiting room\" will start exhibiting more and more acute symptoms; you'll have to quickly decide how to optimize your exploration for upgrades and needs for cash against the growing demands of your patients.\nDeck out your crew! Enhance their abilities, making them stronger, faster, and more effective! Give their health a boost or add some pep to their punches.\nUpgrades don't come free and some need to be researched! You'll even be able to research entire new abilities to help you do what doctors do best.\nUpgrade your space station! Your run-down clinic can't function without a solid crew and proper resources! Expand to accommodate more patients or build a lab to analyze new infections and get an edge with the latest tech -- spend that down-time growing your space station from a gutted wreck into a thriving medical facility!\n      Humans and space whales live in harmony among the stars. Why? Because we need them and they need us. The whales provide us with transport across the galaxy, access to resources and materials, and much-needed companionship and in return they only ask that we keep them healthy. For being such an ancient species living in deep space, they're not too bright and get themselves into all sorts of trouble.\nTheir docile and cuddly demeanors make for perfect company in the lonely expanse, so what kind of monster WOULDN'T do their best to make sure they're happy and disease-free?\nNaturally, clinics have sprung up across the stars offering these magnificent beasts relief from whatever ails them in return for a number of goods and/or services. Usually cash.\nA new mutation has started manifesting in the patients causing all sorts of aggressive behaviors in these otherwise sweet and docile space beasts. One by one, clinics across the stars have started to go dark. Rudy -- a lowly janitor -- was on break and missed all the murder, so he's all the poor whales have left!\nFollow Rudy and his crew as they take on the burden of keeping these burdensome beasts healthy in a world packed with guts, eccentric aliens and quack doctors! As you race to save every patient that comes to your door, a sinister plot is unfolding... Good luck, Doctor!\n       Help us go beyond the stars and expand our game's content, platforms and more!\n  Swap that formal medical education for hands-on experience! Ethics are great and all, but you have a job to do. Your patients, lovable lummoxes as they are, don't just get sick from disease\nThey suffer from indigestion, cholesterol-caked blood vessels, alien head-colds, virus-ridden prosthetics, infected bowels, and even genetic disorders. Do what needs to get done, there\u2019s no medical board watching over your shoulder in space.\n  We're set to launch on Steam for PC, but with your help we can reach stretch goals that can get the game on other platforms like Mac, Linux, PS4 & Xbox One!\n Art style? Art style.\nEarly exploration of a mother parasite\nComing at you with 2D hand-painted comic-book-style graphics! Our art style is completely derived from the mind of our epic concept artist, Avery Coleman.\nAvery's work is inspired by comic book artists like Joe Mad (creator of Battle Chasers and artist for various Marvel comics), which we think will give Blubber Busters a style and unique look all its own!\nFinal concept of a mother parasite\n  Layers of 2D depth in a 3D world!\n      All of our characters and enemies are 2D renders of animated 3D models. This gives us the freedom and speed of 3D animation while still harmonizing with stylish 2D effects!\nLook at all that harmonizing\nWe\u2019re extremely excited to announce that Chris Christodoulou - of Deadbolt and Risk of Rain fame - will be joining us to compose the soundtrack for Blubber Busters! He's coming at you with a pumping retro electronic sound that jives with our art style perfectly!\nChris has already been helping us set the tone for Blubber Busters, and we have three audio tracks that we can share!\n          What are Add Ons?\nAdd Ons are additional goods that you can include with your pledge (plus shipping if needed) If you pledge a minimum of $15 - you can add any of the following to your pledge amount.\nFor t-shirt sizes & any additional info needed - expect a backer survey from us! Thank you!\n  The Game\nGet a digital PC copy (PC/Steam) of Blubber Busters! All backers at the $15 Resident Rank or above will be able to choose on which platform (out of the unlocked release platforms) they'll receive their codes.  \nDigital Wallpaper Set  \nA collection of desktop wallpapers featuring Blubber Busters' colorful cast of mis-adventurers and medical malpractitioners.  \n\nEarly Beta Access\n Play the game before anyone else!

Everyone gets access, but you get to be a part of it.\nPhysical Softcover Art Book  \nIt's the art book... but you can hold it on your HANDS. In meat-space! Digital-world cyber-beings need not apply; this is only for us creatures of flesh and bone.  \nPhysical Hardcover Art Book - Signed -  \nLike the softcover art book...but harder. It also comes with some signatures from the team! Limited availability in the Surgeon tier or higher.  \n-Limited Edition- T-shirt  \nIf the horrors of middle school taught us anything, it's that being cool is being EXCLUSIVE, and what better way to exclude others than by all of you guys wearing this limited-edition Blubber Busters tee! Available only through the Kickstarter!  \nPhysical Box Copy of the Game (+ manual & OST)\nThe ultra-definitive version of the game. A handsome box containing a physical copy of the in-game manual and the OST CD! Feel its weight in your hands and make space on that shelf!  \nAlternative Outfit  \nWhile the other janitors are in their orange suits, you can stand out from the crowd!

Own one of the original sketches by Avery drawn during the development of the game. (Pencil not included)\nName & Portrait in the game\nThere are tons of dead surgeons in space whales these days, but oddly enough not many with names... until now. You can be one of these dead surgeons with a unique story of how you died! \nName a Disease \nThe first disease ever named after a still living person! If that's what you want to name it... Work with our team to create a gross, silly and unique name for your disease to go down in history! *cough* \nArt Direct an Enemy Design\nJoin forces with the BB team as an Art Director for a day & help design a flesh devouring enemy for the game!\nBecome an NPC in the game  \nWhat's more exciting than talking to an NPC? Talking to one that IS YOU! Become one with the lore or just mop up the floor. Work with us to figure out your place at the Orbital SVP!   \nBreakdown\n  As a funding solution, Kickstarter affords us the most independence, control, and artistic freedom. Most of our team is remote, but our core members will be moving closer to work under the same roof. We'll all be basically living in a small, hobbit-like commune scrabbling with one another for an extra flavor-packet for our ramen noodles. But we'll be making a game - a game that we really believe in!\nThis game is our passion project, and what you see already is the culmination of months of work through late nights, weekends, and some missed engagements. Most of us were wholly unpaid thus far - the others, paid out-of-pocket for their services by the core team. These out-of-pocket funds are starting to run dry, and so it's come to the point that if Blubber Busters is to become a reality, we need to focus on it - full time.\nWe strongly value being transparent and listening to our community - a great trait that we've learned from working at Riot. We want to make sure that our game is just as fun for us as it is for you, and we hope for your feedback throughout development to make that happen! \n Budget \n                                                                                                                                                                                                              Please feel free to reach out to us through any of the above channels, and if all else fails, you can shoot us an email at info@tharbemonsters.net\n   Special Thanks!\nShout out to all those that have helped us through our earlier stages of development - Alex Redfish, Kevin Culler, Priscilla Tsang, Khai Tran, Skylar Surra, Mike Ton, Terry Nguyen & Ai Tran.\n& thank you to Koujaku for the Ferr2D tool!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risks come from the fact that game development is sometimes unpredictable and when that happens scheduling can be effected.\n\nLuckily, every core member of the team has more than five years experience working in game development and has seen at least one shipped title. We've been through the scoping and development process and we're confident that we've budgeted time appropriately given our funds. Should several designs take more iterations than previously estimated, we have several publishers and investors already courting us, so we're willing to entertain those options to ensure that the best

The concept is something retro and nostalgic that is intended to evoke images of famous paintings like J. Howard Miller's \"We Can Do It\" and Rockwell's \"Rosie the Riveter\".\nWe have a fantastic list of classic character archetypes with a fresh take on the designs from the mind of concept artist Chris Walton for the core set as well as numerous stretch goals. Care is taken to size the figures so they are compatible with other models from the most popular manufacturers within the 28mm range of heroic sizes. Babes\u2122 are cast in the finest lead-free pewter to assure as much of the detail of the original sculpt is preserved. All models are supplied unpainted and some assembly may be required.\nSculpts by Patrick for Reaper, Dark Sword, Privateer Press, and Bombshell\n               Shepherd - sculpted by Chad Hoverter\n        FUSE LEVEL - This backer level allows you to choose from any of the rewards available or unlocked, a la carte.

This will allow you to choose duplicates of the same Babe if you prefer. The Bomb Kit includes all of the FREEBIES shown here and may receive more as future items are unlocked.\nDETONATOR LEVEL - You may choose which 13 Babes are included in your Detonator from any of the ones listed in the BABES section. This will allow you to choose duplicates of the same Babe if you prefer. The Detonator level includes all of the FREEBIES shown here and may receive more as future items are unlocked.\n  These items may be added at any backer level for the listed pledge amount shown.

He has some critters in the Bombshell range along with a couple of Babes and we are happy he has been able to help with this current project.\nArtist - Chris Walton is probably best know for his iconic character designs on games like WARMACHINE\u00ae and HORDES\u00ae as well as designs for Z2 Inc, Forrest-Pruzan Creative, Sodapop Miniatures, Paizo Publishing LLC, Exato Game Studios, Reaper Miniatures, Antarctic Press, Atlantis Studios, Eos Press, and Scrambled Eggz Productions.\nArtist - Mary Profitt knew as a child she wanted to be in the creative field and started painting and drawing at age three. During high school she won three Gold Key awards at the national level and went on to study fine arts in college. Being blessed with a natural talent she has done commission work in portrait oil painting, pencil drawings, and painting in acrylics, so miniature painting was a natural fit.\nPainted by Mary Profitt\n  Artist - Elizabeth Beckley-Bradford is a professional miniature artist living with two cats, three dogs, a lizard of unusual size, and her husband, who puts up with paint brushes sitting around the house. She's been painting miniatures for several years and loves bringing miniature characters to life. There's nothing better than sitting down to a game of D&D with some wonderfully painted mini's to vanquish evil monsters!\nPainted by Elizabeth Beckley-Bradford\n  Artist - Matt DiPietro is one of the most prolific miniatures painters working today. He started his career as the lead studio painter for Privateer Press, and shaped the painting of Warmachine and Hordes for nearly a decade. These days he makes his living teaching the next generation of miniature artisans, and creating miniature art for private collectors.\nPainted by Matt DiPietro\n  We will charge shipping after the Kickstarter based on the actual costs. This will be collected via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. DO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COVER YOUR POSTAGE PAYMENT IN YOUR PLEDGE AT THIS TIME!\nAny funds collected through the KS system are reduced by 10% when KS takes out their fees. This means that any funds collected to cover postage are 10% less than what is actually needed to cover postage IF the postage rates do not increase between the time of billing and shipping. (Postal rates have increased on us during our projects at least once prior to fulfillment. In one case the rates increased twice!)\nAfter the campaign ends, backers will be able to select their rewards via the pledge manager. Shipping costs will be calculated and collected at that time. You will also be able to select additional rewards options at that time if you wish.\nPostage will be billed by region when backers make their choices via our pledge management system.

My task is to come up with new designs and concepts for our artists to work from. With the success of our first Kickstarter the stars have aligned for me to produce a good number of brand new designs. Bobby Jackson has sculpted some imaginative models for you this time around. Fortress Figures is again producing our figures so you know the quality will be top notch. Along with my brother, Jeff, and my sister, Ronda, we are reaching out to the miniatures gaming community to support our second Kickstarter Project.\nFor this Project we have General Aurora Salt, Robots, and several more specialists.  For our backers in the U.S.A, we also offer FREE shipping for pledge level ending the campaign at $50.00 or more.  \nFREE U.S.A SHIPPING\n  Stretch Goal Bonus\nMetal Castings\nWhite metal production copies of the new models from Fortress Figures. \nProduction Copies\n Scale\nOur figures are for the commonly used gaming scale of one inch is equal to five feet scale.  This makes our human figure 28mm from toe to eye or 30mm from toe to top of head if standing up.  It is our goal to keep our figures a consistent scale throughout the ranges.   See photo below for a size comparison to figures produced by other popular gaming companies.   \nScale Comparison\n Last Minute Add-On\nAdd On BDUs\nStretch Goals \nOur intention for this kickstarter is to add a stretch goal to each pledge of $50.00 or more as each funding level is achieved.  All backers at pledge levels of $50.00 or more at the end of the campaign will receive all stretch goal rewards included with their pledge rewards on fulfillment.  The stretch goal rewards will be awarded in addition to your pledge level and will be automatically included with your shipment when your pledge is fulfilled.  The stretch goal models shown are between 15mm and 25mm tall and will fit comfortably on a 25mm base that will be included for them.  All stretch goal reward models will be cast in white metal.   \nStretch goals by Bobby Jackson and Tim Hill\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nWe have a variety of pledge levels to choose from including all new figures if you participated in the last kickstarter and don't need duplicates  and an ALL IN level if you missed the last one so you can catch up.   The $10.00 level is for the General Aurora Salt and her trusted genetically enhanced covert operative companion Sergeant Pepper.  It should be noted that this $10.00 level is not eligible for stretch goal rewards.   \n         Add-Ons\nIf what you get in the standard pledge is not enough, and how could it be, you can add any number of additional models to you pledge as desired.  \nShipping\nOn the end of the campaign, each backer will be issued a coupon code via e-mail to redeem at our on-line shop for your pledge rewards.  This worked out very well last time around seeming to be the simplest way and also allows for some last minute additions if you desire.  Shipping fees are not included in the pledge level and will be collected at the time you redeem your coupon code.  \nEstimated shipping fees:\nU.S. $0 - $5  (U.S. receives free shipping for $50 or more pledges)\nCanada $15\nOther Destinations $20\nCustoms fees, duties, taxes, tariffs and or additional charges incurred at the shipping destination by the receiver are the responsibility of the receiver.  RBJ Game company cannot accept any responsibility for additional charges imposed by the taxing authority of the legal jurisdiction of the receiving residency.     \nWhy Kickstarter?\nKickstarter has proven to be the best method to launch and expand a new range of miniatures.  Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base.  With the success of our last Kickstarter at more than double the funding level, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned.  The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital.  What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures and capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day. All molding and casting is done in house by our dedicated staff of three well experienced individuals. Only the sculpting and printing is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We still have some 3D prints that need to be printed (the standing at attention guys and the stretch goal figures), a few master molds and a half dozen production molds remain to be finished before casting your figures can begin. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. A quick look at our previous Kickstarter will show that we shipped rewards to backers a full three months ahead of schedule last time around. \n\nAn unforeseen event, though unlikely, could be, well, unforeseen. Should anything go awry, I pledge to keep our backers up to date on any delays or scheduling changes that might occur so no one is left guessing about what is going on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "General Aurora Salt", "descp": "You receive General A.

It has been used to make games like Hyper Light Drifter, Hotline Miami, Risk of Rain, Gunpoint, Undertale, and many, many more.\nAbout Me\nI love teaching people how to make games. I'm a top instructor on Udemy with over 20k students happily learning to make their own games and over 2100 perfect 5 star reviews.\nMy Udemy courses can be found here.\nReviews\nThe Course\nI\u2019m creating a new step-by-step video course about making a turn-based RPG using GameMaker Studio.\nCourse Benefits\nSave time by starting with everything you need\nHave fun as you make this beautiful, turn-based RPG\nBe confident as you master advanced GameMaker techniques\nFeatures\nAfter finishing this video course you will be able to:\n\nDesign tiled overworlds\nProgram a character that can easily navigate the overworld\nIncorporate complex in-game cutscenes with multi-page dialog boxes\nCreate beautiful room transitions\nControl turn-based battle mechanics\nManage character progression with level-up system\nAnd much more\nWho is this Course for?\nThe ideal student for this course is someone who has used GameMaker before but wants to learn more advanced techniques. This course is not for absolute beginners to GameMaker. If you haven\u2019t used GameMaker before, then check out my other courses first. This course is not easy. It will take a significant amount of work but it will also be fun.\n\nKickstarter?\nWhy am I here on Kickstarter when I have already created 3 successful courses without it?\n\nThis course is quite a bit larger in scope than my other courses. To help with the larger scope I\u2019ve hired Toby Dixon as a contract pixel artist. As you can see from the screenshots, his art is amazing! I\u2019ve been paying him using my business savings but I\u2019m running low. I will be using the funds donated via Kickstarter to continue paying Toby as he creates the different worlds and animates the many monsters.\n\nAlso, a Kickstarter allows me to create a more flexible pricing structure before the course is placed on Udemy (see pledge tiers).\n\n\nThanks\nThank you so much for your interest in my course! Please consider pledging your support! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many challenges that might arise during the course creation process.

Because of the extended development cycle, resources that I had planned to use on the game ended up going to the course.\n\nThe game itself (what I have) has an interesting story that I wish I could share. I paid a writer from Telltale games to help me create it and I think it is really great. The artwork (by Toby, and Clement) is also amazing. However, . I don't want to deliver a bad experience. Playing the game itself isn't fun and I've lost my passion for trying to make it good.\n\n\n\n(not including paypal) and of those .

These awful cards may allow you to draw from the fantasy deck, take a card from the discard pile, plagiarize by stealing fantasy cards from opponents, or even destroy an opponent's hard-earned story elements by killing off their Protagonist, poking holes in their Plot, or by de-antagonizing their Antagonist.\nRead the rules here: Rulebook\nIncorporating the unique and absurd humor of Justin and Mitchell Lucas (@AwfulFantasy), with gameplay designed by Adam and Brady Sadler (Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game), and featuring the art of Conor Nolan, Awful Fantasy: The Card Game is an awfully great blend of quick, elegant card play, beautiful illustrations, and absurdly hilarious fantasy satire.\n                                                                         @AwfulFantasy is a comedy fantasy and science fiction social media account guided by Justin Lucas and Mitchell Lucas. Each tweet satirizes or parodies classic tropes and cliches in fantasy and science fiction writing.\n\nHere's what some people have said about us:\n  Awful Fantasy: The Card Game was designed to be simple and super easy to learn. Here's an example video for your first round of gameplay:\n            The Protagonist, Antagonist, and Plot cards are each based on characters or events from popular @AwfulFantasy tweets. This allows us the opportunity to make sure Awful Fantasy: The Card Game is as silly and colorful as it can be.\n\nSome of the tweets we've chosen are... weird (okay, most of them). It would most likely be a challenge for most artists to translate. We knew it was very important to find an artist who could not only capture the absurdity of our tweets, but to help us visualize the characters and places we come up with in a spectacular way. Conor Nolan does just that.\nConor Nolan is an illustrator based out of New York. From editorial illustrations for Vice Magazine, comic covers for Dark Horse Comics and Boom! Studio, and promotional material for MTV he has covered a varied range of clients and projects. Nolan's work can be seen on posters, apparel, comics, magazines, newspapers, beer labels, and record covers. And now, it can be seen on Awful Fantasy: The Card Game.\n \n              (Conor's original line drawing for Gru'k. This is what the Original Line Drawing Level reward will look like)\n    Every copy of Awful Fantasy: The Card Game will include all unlocked stretch goals.\n            We've partnered up with established tabletop game designers, and good friends, Adam Sadler and Brady Sadler to make Awful Fantasy: The Card Game not only funny, but fun.\nAdam and Brady Sadler have been working together creatively since before they could walk. This twin brother design team has worked together on staff at Fantasy Flight Games, contributing to game lines such as Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second Edition, Mansions of Madness, X-Wing, Gears of War, and Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.\nTheir first published design together was FFG's Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game. Since moving on from FFG, the Sadlers have begun working with other publishers, both in the tabletop and digital world.\n\nWe're excited to have the help of such big influencers in the tabletop gaming world to really help make Awful Fantasy: The Card Game a funny, enjoyable gaming experience.\nAt the Adventure Level pledge tier and above, backers will receive The D\u00e6mon Queen's S\u00e6cret Tower, a very special Awful Fantasy roleplaying adventure specifically designed to be compatible with 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons!\nHere's the story:\nOnce a regal and respected Queen of the Land of Orboz, Queen F\u0153tida instilled the opposite of fear into the hearts or her loyal subjects. Faced with the knowledge that she comes from a royal line rife with incest and illegal underground dragon fighting, F\u0153tida was dethroned by the Lord of a lesser house who uncovered her family\u2019s darker past. Queen F\u0153tida, residing in an old, long abandoned s\u00e6cret tower in the Dargon Mountains, is now a servant of Necrosa, and has turned from her love of Contemporary Impressionism to the somewhat Darker Arts\u2014NECROMANCY!\nThe Undead are invading the peaceful townships and cities of Orboz, consuming the flesh of the living, and ever spreading their vile dark magic and unpopular religious beliefs. Queen F\u0153tida has been spotted as a shade near the Dargon Mountains, and tale is told she still lives, most likely raising the dead as her own Personal Undead Army of Revenge!\nIt is up to a small band of heroes (you) to find Queen F\u0153tida and put an end to her Necromaniacal ways. In the Dargon Mountains lies the decrepit heart of the dark magic that plagues Orboz like a plague. In this metaphorical heart is where you must end the Dark Queen\u2019s evil, vengeful plans (by killing her).

Troopers\nThis is Jeff Rodman, AKA Ironrook from Fortress Figures, and I have made miniatures all of my adult life. I generally work behind the curtain for other miniatures companies but now it's time to step from behind the curtain and create some pet projects I have had rolling around in my head for some time. Along with my brother, Ben, and my sister, Ronda, we are reaching out to the miniatures gaming community to make our first Kickstarter a success. We're confident that with this first success under our belt, we will continue to realize additional great products that could not have been possible without you.\nTo get the ball rolling, we have a set of S.T.A.R Trooper miniatures. The core set of 5 poses is already done and ready to go. These miniatures were designed by my brother Ben and the 3D sculptures were brought to life by veteran sculptor Bobby Jackson. The molding was done by me at Fortress Figures and personally hand cast by us.\nS.T.A.R. Trooper Heavy Weapon\nMiniatures provided are not painted.  Slotted plastic base provided for each miniature not textured.  Miniatures produced in spin-cast white metal or spin-cast resin.  \nPLAY\n\nMetal Castings\nHere are some of the production copies of the white metal troopers.\nProduction Copies\nSCALE\nscale comparison\nMiniatures are sculpted to the commonly used 28mm gaming scale.  \nREWARDS\nWe are envisioning our stretch goals to reflect our ability to add additional poses as funding levels are reached.  As each goal is achieved, we will add new poses to the core set with the first level adding two figures and each level thereafter swapping out redundant poses for new different ones with a final goal of 10 figures of 10 different poses.  Additionally, we have an early bird incentive and two bonus figures to add to the core group.  \nWhat do I get?\nWhat do I Get?\nPainted models for display only.  Models provided NOT PAINTED.  \nThe early bird pledges also include the limited edition medic.  The resin sets will include the same figures as the metal sets including bonus stretch figures and medic in resin.  \nEARLY BIRD MEDIC BONUS FIGURE\nDigital render.

There is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. The Core set is already done and ready to distribute. The greatest risk may be a delay in creating the new poses if funding levels go high enough. Ironically, that means that the more successful the project, the more likely we may not meet the shipping dates. We have allowed ourselves what we would consider an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to finish completion of the project. Should something go awry, we are used to working under pressure and feel we can mitigate any issues that may arise. Additionally, I pledge to communicate to our backers any delays that might take place so no one is left in the dark.

Available in XS.S.M.L.XL.XXL.XXXL If you do not see your size or fit just PM me and we can work it out.\n  Boy Theif is included in the Warband pledge but is also available as an $8 add-on.\n  Girl Apprentice is included in the Warband pledge but is also available as an $8 add-on.\nMighty Jorik is included in the Warband pledge but is also available as an $8 add-on.\n  Ejryvindr the Far Seeing is included in the Warband pledge but is also available as an $8 add-on.\n  Ase Arvidrson is included in the Warband pledge but is also available as an $8 add-on.\n  Red Gunhildr is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $8 add-on.\n  Frodulf is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $8 add-on.\n  Pretty Laerke is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is  available as an $8 add-on.\n  Wolf Set is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $15 add-on.\n Modular Thug set is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $25 add-on. Pictured above are the works in progress. The finished set will include a sprue of 6 heads ( 2 hooded, 2 bare, 2 capped ) a sprue of 7 right hand weapons ( 3 clubs, 2 axes, a sword, and an open hand ) and a sprue of 7 left hand options ( an open hand, a set of javelins, a dagger, a torch, a handaxe, and a buckler ) along with the 5 modular bodies pictured above.\n Berserker Shaman is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $8 add-on.\nBerker Shaman apprentice is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $8 add-on.\nRaging Bear is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $15 add-on.\nWith this kickstarter we plan to fund the production of a broad selection of fantasy themed heroes for use in skirmish table top gaming. To begin I have a set of 5 semi modular warriors fitted for universally interchangeable weapons and heads, a Ranger, and a Wizard. With a Swordsman Hero, a thief, and an apprentice underway to complete a warband of 10 figures.\n Backers can pledge for one warband for $55.00 ( a $75.00 RRP value ) or for individual figures for  $8 each ( a $9 RRP value ) or for one set of the modular Warriors for $25 each ( a $30. RRP value ).\nIt is my intention to create more Norse themed figures to compliment this warband as funding allows. These plans include 5 semi modular Thugs fitted for universally interchangeable right and left hands and heads, a berserker with two handed axe, a shield maiden, a female ranger, an alternate male ranger, a female wizard and an alternate male wizard. As thee figures are funded they will become items available for selection as add- on rewards.\nI will be posting pics of the various Works In Progress of these figures as the campaign develops.\nSHIPPING IS NOT INCLUDED IN ANY PLEDGE. \nDO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COVER YOUR  POSTAGE PAYMENT IN YOUR PLEDGE IT WILL * NOT * BE APPLIED TO YOUR POSTAGE.\n Any funds collected through the KS system reduce by 10% when KS takes out their fees. This means that any funds collected to cover postage are 10% less than what is actually needed to cover postage IF the postage rates do not increase between the time of billing and shipping.\nPostage will be billed by region upon time of readiness for delivery. All postage fees must be paid before shipment can be made. Rewards will be posted from the US to all backer's addresses.\nPostage ESTIMATES by region;\nUS $7.00 and $15.00\nUK EU $10.00\nAU / NZ/ ROW currently unspecific.\nRed Box Games are not responsible for any customs duties, taxes or fees incurred as a result.\nUS rewards will be shipped via USPS Priority mail and will thus be charged according to the box size needed to safely package your rewards. We do not fuss with extraneous packaging much in the effort to keep postage costs to a minimum to pass those savings along to our backers. We will however package your items safely and securely.\n  This project IS EU friendly! All UK and EU rewards packages will be shipped from a fullfillment point in the UK. And I am working on securing an Australian fulfillment point for Australia as well.\n  Production is being handled by a very reliable and proven partner Valiant Enterprises located in the US. Valiant has proven again and again that they are proessional, prompt and reliable.. The figures will be produced via traditional methods of spin cast metal and hand poured resin where applicable. Production for metal miniatures is typically very swift and is generally less subject to the delays of foreign production.  \nFinally, I am just a guy with a dream to create great fantasy miniatures and possibly one day a great fantasy game. I have worked very hard in this industry for a long time with a long well established line of great products to show for it and the dearly treasured support of a lot of really great people. I have had some hard knocks and things are never easy, but in the end I could never be happy doing anything else. This is where my heart is. I am not at all afraid of hard work and I will always see to it that I deliver on my promises. But in the end I am still just one guy with a dream, skill, and dedication to a goal, I still need your help. I have my ability to sculpt, my ambition to create, my dedication to this purpose, the help of a few very talented friends ( Thanks for all the great Art Dave! ) The support and patience of my darling Wife Kristy, and the help of many wonderful people such as yourself willing to chip in what you can to help make it all possible.

With each warband set containing all the basic elements needed to play a game of any of a variety of popular table top skirmish games. At the outset, each starter box will contain 5 semi modular warrior figures repeated three times per box for a total of 15 miniatures. These figures include 4 weapon and shield warriors and one archer.\n  It is my hope to be able to expand the offering in each starter box as the funding allows me to afford more molds. These expanded offerings might include additional troop types for expanded tactical variety or alternate sculpts to replace repeated sculpts for greater variety.\n  The first Warband Set offered is Njorning hirdmen set which includes ;12 hirdmen warriors, and 3 huntsmen. Each of the hirdmen is semi modular being fitted for universally interchangeable heads and right hand options. The right hand options included with the set are 2 swords, 2 axes, a mace and a spear repeated three times in the box for a total of 18 weapon options. There are also 6 different head options repeated three times in the box as well for a total of 18 head options. The archer model is fitted only for a modular head.\nBackers can add to their pledge as add -ons are unlocked by managing the value of their pledge upward by the amount necessary to cover the cost of the desired items. Each new add-on posted will be accompanied by a full detailed description of the contents and the cost of the add-on itself.\n SHIPPING IS NOT INCLUDED IN ANY PLEDGE.\nPostage will be billed by region upon time of readiness for delivery. All postage fees must be paid before shipment can be made.\nRewards will be posted from the US to all backer's addresses. We are not responsible for any customs duties, taxes or fees incurred as a result.\n  The miniatures are cast in a high quality hard PVC plastic produced by a well established and experienced production contractor which handles the manufacturing for several well known table top gaming companies.\n Plastics manufacturing has made a great deal of long strides in the level of quality they are able to capture and reliably produce in miniature scale. many very impressive products have been released recently showcasing just what is possible in the medium. I am very confident both in the examples I have had on hand for comparison and in the research I have conducted over the past 4 years that plastic is definitely the way forward for Red Box Games and the plans I have for future projects.\n I am still however a very cautious person when it comes to new ventures as I have endured some very hard lessons in the past teaching me to take it slow at first. To that end I want to keep this campaign manageably modest in scope. I feel that the plan I have laid out is sound and deliverable within a reasonable span of time and the product offered is excellently made and designed specifically for the medium. I am confident that I will deliver to your full satisfaction.\nFinally, I am just a guy with a dream to create great fantasy miniatures and possibly one day a great fantasy game. I have worked very hard in this industry for a long time with a long well established line of great products to show for it and the dearly treasured support of a lot of really great people. I have had some hard knocks and things are never easy, but in the end I could never be happy doing anything else. This is where my heart is. I am not at all afraid of hard work and I will always see to it that I deliver on my promises. But in the end I am still just one guy with a dream, skill, and dedication to a goal, I still need your help. I have my ability to sculpt, my ambition to create, my dedication to this purpose, the help of a few very talented friends ( Thanks for all the great Art Dave! ) The support and patience of my darling Wife Kristy, and the help of many wonderful people such as yourself willing to chip in what you can to help make it all possible.\n\nThank you very much for your time, your support and encouragement.\nCheers,\nTre'", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project will face different challenges than what I have experience with in that the production will be handled in a foreign country and the medium is plastic rather than metal.

There is a Facebook group called Relicblade Official Battle Friends where you can share photos of your miniatures, and connect with the Relicblade community. \nRelicblade.com is the other spot to keep an eye on as we move into this glorious new dawn. \nThanks for making this game a reality. \nYour Friend,\n Sean Sutter\nRelicblade is a small scale miniatures skirmish game created by Metal King Studio. Players take command of heroes and monsters as they battle to claim magical relics of the ancient world.\nWill you lead bold heroes on their righteous quest for hope? Or will you harness the unbound fury of the Pig Men; whose craven lust for destruction is only matched by their love for snacks?\nThe \"Bold Adventurer\" two player battle game includes everything you need for start playing full-size games of Relicblade out of the box.\nFully Illustrated Rulebook\nWave 1 Deck: 14 Character Cards, 32 Upgrade Cards, 2 Reference Cards, and 6 Relic Cards\nAll Wave 1 Heroes\nAll Wave 1 Pigs\n6 Dice\nKickstarter Exclusive Relic Card\nALL UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS: Relic Miniature, Thief Character, and more to come!\nThis set is the best way to start playing the game right away!\nRelicblade is quick to learn and fun to play. The characters are represented on the board by detailed 30mm miniatures while their statistics and abilities are shown on convenient character cards. The real depth comes in as players choose from 25 unique upgrades to specialize their characters to gain a tactical advantage. Will you choose to specialize your cleric as a support healer, or bestow her with powerful magic weapons to bring low the adversary?\nBefore the battle players choose characters and upgrades.\nBattles are fought over an unidentified magic item that has drawn the characters to that spot. When characters are finally able to seize the relic it is drawn randomly from the Relic Deck. Relics grant an unnatural boon and are used just like upgrades, however they far surpass any upgrade in power. But if the character wielding the relic is disabled anyone can pick it up.\nThe Knight grabs the Sword of Ruin\nStandard games of Relicblade are played on a 2'x2' area, players usually only field between three and six characters, and the games only last around 45 minutes. Games are fast paced, dynamic, and exciting. It's not unusual to play several games over the course of a couple drinks. \n The Relicblade Core Game has been FUNDED! We are now working our way through awesome new stretch goals!!\nRelicblade is super rad. I know you're going to love it. If we can get a bunch of people behind this project it's better for everybody. You want more characters... I want more characters. So let's do this!\nWhenever we unlock a new goal everyone backing at Bold Adventurer ($89 early bird, and $99) and above will get it added to their rewards for FREE. Everyone wins!\nOH SNAP! I love you guys. Free Relics for everyone!!! (almost)\nRad new hero. Free with \"Bold Adventurer\" Pledge ($89/$99) or more!\nWhat goes into making new characters?\nOh, I'm glad you asked. The Metal King Studio YouTube channel has a whole web series dedicated not only to this question, but to the production of this very character! Follow along as I draw, sculpt, and produce the thief in an aptly titled series called... Thief.\nRelicblade is a good old-fashioned miniatures game. \nPlayers dive into the miniatures hobby as they assemble, paint, and play the game. Relicblade figures are made of high quality white metal, and the miniatures are supplied unassembled and unpainted. The process of customizing and painting the characters is part of the awesome collaboration between the creator and players. The ruins of Relicblade are largely unexplored, so the depths of this savage world are open for players to invent and discover.\nMiniatures are supplied unassembled and unpainted.\nWhat scale are the figures?\nRelicblade miniatures are made at the 30mm scale. That means from foot to eye level a character should stand at around 30mm. It's ever so slightly larger than the well known Warhammer scale, but slightly less \"heroic\" ( giant hands and weapons). \nRelicblade figures lined up with other favorites from my collection\nHow Relicblade miniatures are made.\nRelicblade is 100% independent and creator owned. However, the process for creating these metal miniatures is extremely similar to the production process from your favorite miniatures companies. I even use the same prototyping company, mold maker, and caster as some of my most loved games.\n1. The first step is to create a character that is at least vaguely interesting. For the Questing Knight I did a bunch of research on knightly arms and armor. I especially lost myself in YouTube videos of Battle of the Nations and other HEMA groups.\n2. Using ZBrush I create a 3D model of the figure. From the very beginning I have to consider how the model will look at the tiny 30mm scale and how it will work for mold making and casting.\n3. Rapid prototypes are a quick low resolution 3D print of the model. Using the Form 1+ printer I was able to see what was working and what wasn't. It's extremely important to see how the parts fit together and make sure everything is at the appropriate scale.\n 4. Once the design is finalized and all the issues are resolved, the files are sent to VisionProto for high resolution prototypes that can withstand the mold making process. These prototypes are quite costly, but offer unmatched detail and fidelity.\n5. The high resolution prototypes are sent to a mold-maker and caster. The master and production molds were made by Fortress Figures. With the molds established the figures are cast by the hundreds in high quality white metal.\n6. The final stage is when players paint the figures and play out legendary adventures. The final product is a collaborative art piece that unites friends, gamers, and hobbyists around the world.\nGreetings friends,\nMy name is Sean Sutter. I am a professional freelance artist and illustrator, and the lead artist on the comic book series B-Squad: Soldiers of Misfortune. As a freelance artist there can be gaps between jobs or even simple hours here and there while you wait for a sketch to be approved. Relicblade was more or less born in these gaps. \nB-Squad Volume 1 Cover Art by Sean Sutter\nI've been obsessed with tabletop miniatures since I first walked into a game shop and saw that they existed. And like many of you, I harbored dreams of creating a game. 20 years later I realized that I'm still crazy about miniatures, but I am also an able illustrator and writer. So I taught myself how to sculpt miniatures in ZBrush.\nZBrush is extraordinary. I've studied drawing my entire life. I did over ten years of weekly figure drawing and have a bachelors degree of fine art. But drawing has always been a process of translation for me. While drawing I work to translate a three-dimensional idea into two-dimensions, which is always the major challenge. But once I learned the basics for ZBrush I was finally home. My thee-dimensional imagination just needs to be transcribed into ZBrush... I can't adequately describe how artistically fulfilling sculpting is.\nI sculpted that bear while I was waiting for a poster design to get approved by the Crocker Art Museum.\nGame design has been a joy, as well. I put forward core design principals and set about creating a game. As I got deeper in the game design I obsessively asked and answered questions through every step. I would toss and turn at night trying to figure out gameplay mechanics. After months of fevered game-craft Relicblade was complete. Now, each time I play it I am delighted at how well Relicblade meets its design goals.\nAsset drawings, card prototypes, and probably a pot of coffee on my desk.\nWhile learning to sculpt and filling notebooks with ideas took place in the gaps between freelance gigs, the hardcore making of the game had to be a full time endeavor. In July of 2015 I started creating Relicblade full-time. It's been a crazy adventure so far, and I really hope with this Kickstarter it is just the beginning. I have ideas coming out my ears and a really great game. \nNow that the rules, cards, and figures are in print I can take a step back and just enjoy the game instead of critiquing it. We are still finding crazy new upgrade combinations and party-builds. Just last night I had one of the most exciting games to date. \nUltra fun Relicblade demos at Great Escape Games in Sacramento. That's me with the cool orange hat!\nI hope you will step out on a limb to try this new game. There are a ton of great games out there, but I know after a few games Relicblade will be one of your favorites, too. Plus, supporting independent artists has intrinsic value. ;)\nYour Friend,\nSean Sutter\nClick photo to go to the B-Squad campaign page!\nB-Squad is a crazy action-packed comedy that follows a band of misfit mercs on dangerous and ridiculous missions. In volume one the squadies did battle with a hive-mind of wiener dogs, and a dangerous band of James Cameron cosplayers. While Eben Burgoon is writing each issue he spins a six-sided whale-bone die to determine which of the six main characters will be killed on the mission. Ridiculous. Dangerous. Expendable.\nGetting paid to draw for B-Squad empowered me to believe in myself and make Relicblade. In B-Squad Volume 2 we will be empowering a new batch of artists! When you #BackBSquad you aren't just getting a book. You're showing artists that they deserve to get paid, and encouraging them to make something awesome.\nIf you back both B-Squad and Relicblade, you'll also receive an exclusive Relic Card modeled after the very dice that slays all the B-Squad characters, The Pequod!\n What's a Custom Character Card?\nYou can tell me about a D&D character you used to play as, or any character you imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character in a character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them!\nNow that barbarian you have fond memories of playing back in high-school can roam the wild lands of Relicblade!\nYou get the original illustration and a professionally printed copy of your card (Character, or monster, or relic, or whatever...)\nPorter McScotch, B-Squad writer Eben Burgoon's Dwarf Bard\n But, what if I want a miniature of my awesome character?\nIt costs money, but it's pretty amazing seeing your characters come to life this way. Also, these high pledge levels really help support the studio.\nCustom hand-made Relicblade terrain:\nYou want Relicblade? Say no more. I will personally hand craft a 2'x2' board for you in whatever setting you want. I'll do my best studio-quality work to get you a seriously awesome board. The 2'x2' panels hang on your wall while not in use and make really crazy 3D fantasy landscape paintings. It's an absurd amount of work, but you're worth it. I'll even paint up a full set of Relicblade figures to match your adventure setting. Frozen city, ancient tomb, or lava fort? Follow your heart.\n Here is a little chart that should help clarify the pledge levels.\nWhat are Add-Ons?\nAdd-ons give Backers the option to add extra bits to their rewards for a little extra money. This is the best opportunity for people to grab extra components to optimize their Relicblade experience.\nThe Two-Player set is specially designed to give you everything you'll need to get the full Relicblade Experience. But if you want a few extra Pigs this is the way to get the promotional deal available only through the Kickstarter.\n Using the Marketplace below you can look at what is available and adjust your pledge accordingly. I want to make sure you get everything you want out of this Kickstarter campaign, and I believe this will help. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you say, \"I want to make a game.\" people will ask \"have you thought about Kickstarter?\"\n\nKickstarter has become an everyday occurrence for the tabletop gaming industry. Which has, I believe, very positive implications for the future of independent games. But that also means you can get ahead of yourself and start asking for money before you really have a game. I don't want to ask you to support a project that is just an idea. Even if I think it's a pretty good one.\n\nThis risks and challenges section of the campaign is probably the part I've fought the hardest for. At the outset of a project like this you have to ask yourself a lot of questions, and you have to look at each obstacle as gatekeepers. Just past those cold hearted sentinels was the game I wanted to make. Bringing a game from drawings and notes all the way to miniatures and rulebooks was daunting, but it's done. I already went through my delays. There were countless challenges that I wasn't expecting, but I crushed them. And I worked on this game full-time for eight months before it was ready for Kickstarter.\n\nThe game is done. Relicblade is being played by gamers across the entire world, and they love it. But I was only able to make 100 copies, and the game currently exists with the minimum number of characters needed to play. If I write four emails I can have the Relicblade two-player sets ready to ship in three weeks, because everything is done. But I want to make the game bigger and better too. If we can unlock the stretch goals we can do just that.\n\nMaking new characters means new illustrations, sculpts, 3d prints, molds, rules, and cards. So the risks and challenges aren't completely eliminated. But I know how to take a sketch and turn it into an excellent game. Delays will almost certainly happen, but I'm ready...

Go to www.skyheartcomic.com to stay up to date on the project!\nI'm Jake Parker, and I'm making SkyHeart Book I: The Star Seed. \nSkyHeart is an all-ages graphic novel inspired by my favorite movies and comics. If you liked Miyazaki's Nausicaa, Star Wars, Tokien's The Hobbit, and Indiana Jones, then you just might become a fan of SkyHeart. \nSkyHeart will be a 7.5 x 10 inch 100+ page book that comes in both soft and hard cover editions. \nThe book is being written and drawn by me and is scheduled to be finished in May of 2016, and shipped out to backers in October of 2016.\nFor years I've been developing this project on the side, but it was so big, and so involved that it scared me! I felt I wasn't ready to create this book. \nAfter years working in animation as a concept artist (Horton Hears a Who, Rio, Epic) and comics (Flight, Missile Mouse, Rocket Raccoon) my skills as an artist and storyteller got better. I feel like I'm finally at a level now where I can take on a project like this and do it justice.\nSo...I'm going for it!\nThe Idea for SkyHeart was planted in my imagination over 15 years ago while on a road trip though the Arizona desert. I imagined the desert floor vanishing, leaving only an abyss of clouds with the rock formations suspended above them in the air.\nFrom that seed of an idea grew an entire world of characters and their struggles, with mythologies, cities, and technology fleshing out the rest of this universe.\nI love classic tales of adventure, of good versus evil, and struggles with real consequences. Which is why I look to films like Star Wars, Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, and Indiana Jones, and books like the Hobbit for inspiration. Just because a story is all-ages, doesn't mean I can't enjoy it as much as my kids do!\nSkyHeart takes place on Airth, a world literally torn apart by a pre-historic war between the gods who created it. That war left the planet divided into 4 realms:\nThe Stratos, a chain of islands high in the sky where the Sylph people live.\nThe Rimland, a massive ring of continents and giant islands where most of the inhabitants of Airth live. Wake, our main protagonist, lives here.\nThe Abyss, a stretch of atmosphere filled with incredible cloud formations and tiny floating islands. Limberg and Grimm are from here. \nThe Core, an ocean covered rocky sphere filled with colossal caves. The Tengru, monsters and beasts, and the Dark Lord live down here.\nIn that great ancient war, the beings of Light were able to defeat the Shadows and banish them to the core, but not without a great cost. Losing most of their godly energy, they left Airth to search the universe for more power. Their children stayed to protect what was left of Airth from the evil trapped in the core. \nThousands of years later these pre-historic events have become myth, and the inhabitants of Airth are consumed with their own wars for power. \nHowever, deep in the core, the Shadows have not forgotten, and have begun sending their agents to the surface to harvest the people of their life force. Once enough of this power has been taken the Shadows will rise again to destroy the rest of Airth and start a new world.\nWake and his crew set off to find the Star Seed with the hopes of both saving Wake's mother, and the world of Airth. That is, if they can beat Malsang and his sinister tengru to it's secret location. \nHow Do Add Ons Work?\nI'll be using Backer Kit to handle rewards and add-ons. Here's what you do:\nAdd up the total of your selections (plus shipping if it applies) \nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) \nAdd the total of your Add Ons to your pledge amount. You don't need to change the tier you've selected \nYou are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. \nThank you!\n\nI'll be updating the add ons and adding more if the project funds and we hit stretch goals. I want to add a map of Airth, a poster, and more, so check back.\nI'm asking for A LOT of money. I've got a great youtube video here that outlines where all this money is going and how I arrived at this number. Basically, half the funds are going to the production of the content, and the other half is getting the books printed and shipped. \nHere's a breakdown of where the funds are going:\nPrinting: $12,000 This covers getting the books printed and shipped to my house. (15.4%)\nProduction: $42,000 This covers my time writing and drawing the book, paying a colorist, editor, and building the book and getting it ready for print. (53.8%)\nFees: $8000 This covers Backer Kit, Kickstarter and Amazon fees. (9%)\nShipping: $16,000 This covers packing up the books and shipping charges. I will be shipping the books PRIORITY MAIL to US backers to ensure the safe delivery of each package. International orders will all be sent FIRST CLASS. Orders will be packed in a bubble wrap sleeve, then put into heavy duty cardboard case. I talk all about how I ship things in this video. (23.4%)\nThis book will be produced in the spring and summer of 2016 and will be delivered to backers in September of that same year. Here's a rough timeline of the production:\nNovember: Run the Kickstarter\nDecember: Finish the SkyHeart manuscript\nJanuary - June: Drawing and coloring\nJuly: Building the book, and prepping for print\nAugust - September: Printing the book\nOctober: Packing and Shipping\nHi I'm Jake Parker, and here's a little bit about me written in third person to sound official: \nJake Parker is an illustrator and cartoonist. For the last 17 years he's worked on everything from animated films to comics to picture books. His credits include the animated films Titan A.E., Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, Horton Hears a Who, Rio, and Epic. \nHe illustrated the New York Times bestselling book The Astonishing Secret of Awesome Man, and went on to also illustrate The Girl Who Wouldn't Brush Her Hair, The Tooth Fairy Wars, The Little Snowplow, and most recently finished his first children's book that he also wrote, Little Bot and Sparrow which will be available in fall of 2016.\nAlong with children's books Jake also draws comics, and recently finished five issues of Marvel's Rocket Raccoon. His Missile Mouse graphic novel series, published by Scholastic, have sold over 100,000 copies. His own self-published comics anthology The Antler Boy and Other Stories was funded through Kickstarter at over $85,000. \nJake is the creator of the Inktober challenge and World Art Drop Day, with both initiatives involving thousands of artists across the world. He's taught at Brigham Young University and is the co-founder of SVSLearn.com, an online art school specializing in visual storytelling. \nHe and his wife Alison live in Provo with their five kids, two cats, and five chickens.

But lets see what other fun stuff we can add in the remaining time.\nI will add all the original stories I created when I was first conceiving Shiver Bureau.  Fully illustrated covers and sequential pages.  I think this will be at least 20 extras pages of content.  This will be awesome to have in the book just for the sure zaniness of the stories, but it will show the Shiver Bureau in its infancy.  The story, the characters and even me grew a lot in the 8 years it too to get to this point.  I think these pages will really showcase that growth.\nPrints of cool interior pages, panels and the cover will be sent out with all physical shipments.\nAll books will be printed in glorious hardcover!\nThe hardcover will be upgraded to include some tasteful embossing.  My plan is to emboss the logo, Trish, and Pickle.  Also I will start compiling a massive concept art book for Shiver Bureau volume 2.  All backers who gave $10+ will get a digital PDF copy of this book when complete.\nUpgrade Level twooooooo! The book will get a spot UV treatment.  I think that is something like a spa day for graphic novels.  I want to add a shiny, 'invisible' ghost to the back cover.   A spooky friend you only spot out of the corner of eye when the hair raises on the back of your neck.\nShiver Bureau: Welcome to London is a 150 page graphic novel.  That's 150 pages of full on story.  There will be some bonus content in the back as well. It will be a paperback unless we raise enough to afford a hardcover.\nBest part is, this first volume is completely finished.  I'm not waiting for the artist to art, or the colorist to color, or the letterer to letter, or even the snozzleblurrer to snozzleblur.  I just need cash money to get it printed.\nSuitable for all ages with parental guidance.  There is some cartoon violence and monsters lurking about.  But nothing worse then a Saturday morning cartoon.\nThis is the first volume of a trilogy (possibly a quadrology) but this volume is self contained and serves as an introduction to the world, characters, and the awesome.\nIt's also a webcomic that you can read for free at http://shiverbureau.com/\nThe world is overrun with ghosts and it's up to the Shiver Bureau to keep things under control. But everything isn't as it seems, the bureau is corrupt and there are things lurking in the shadows that are far worse then the shivers.\nThat's where Pickle, Trish, Mr. Todd and Oliver come in.  The is Pickle's first day in London and already he's been attacked by shivers, fallen out of a blimp and been shown up by his assistant*.  How much worse could his day get?  A lot worse...Welcome to London.\nPickle is taking over the London headquarters.  Not only does he have to deal with shivers, but he needs to clean up the bureau, deal with a power hungry minister, get back his assistant*, and there are rumors about missing kids.  I think Pickle needs a vacation (wink wink volume 2 wink nod wink wink wink wink...sorry got something in my eye).\nThere are a wide assortment of characters, but the main dogooders are...\nPickle is an Inspectre, a rare type of person with the ability to lay shivers to rest.  He is overly confident, but has the skills and the mouth to back it up...most of the time.  Pickle thinks he's the hero of the story...\nLuckily, Trish is there to remind him that he's not.  Trish is the power house of the group.  She's not just a brute though, she has more than enough smarts to keep Pickle and his mouth in check. *Not Pickle's assistant.\nMr. Todd fixes everything that Trish and Pickle break.  He also makes some really cool toys.  Don't let his size fool you, he's no good in a fight...he's a pacifist and very huggable.\nOliver is the next generation.  He embodies the best of Pickle, Trish, and Mr. Todd. Maybe some of their faults as well.  When he's older, he will be someone to reckon with...if he can live that long.\nWell I'm me, silly...\nMore info?  Okay, my name is Walter Ostlie and I am a part-time storyteller who dreams of retiring early to create new worlds and new possibilities, to boldly go where no cartoonist has gone before...or go where they went but put my own twist on it.\nShiver Bureau is my second graphic novel.  My first is Cubicles: The Movie: The Graphic Novel...or just call it Cubicles.  It's a sci-fi comedy about two office workers who get dragged across the universe.  It's pretty funny, you should read it.  It's available on Comixology.  You can read the first chapter for free and the entire novel is only 4 bucks.  That's like 80 pages of hah hah hilarious uproar for 4 bucks. What?  What!\nhttps://www.comixology.com/Cubicles/comics-series/6589\n$10 - Not only do you get a digital copy of the story, but also some overloaded bonus content.

Not only is it styling and profiling, but it's functional.  No shirt, no service.  Any pledge 60+ will have their name printed in the 'Thank You' section of the book.\n$65 - This is like the $35 tier but even cooler.  Instead of sketching in the Shiver Bureau book, I will sketch on a separate 6\" x 8\" card stock. You pick any character you want and I'll draw them looking their coolest.  Keep it to a single character.  Background are at my discretion.  You also get the signed print copy and overloaded PDF.\n$90 - This is like the $35 tier but even cooler.

Some of them make games. Some of them play games. All of them are helping make the video game community one of the most vibrant and exciting collections of humans on Earth.\nI made this video with Christian Cicerone over four days of shooting and five days of editing. Imagine what we could do with your backing and support!\nI can't wait to show you what these people are really like, what drives them and how they do what they do.\nWe've begun production on the following two episodes:\nEpisode 01: FOX, BIRD, BEAR. Spry Fox just released the clever word game \"Alphabear\". Before that, its \"Triple Town\" made waves (and attracted controversy). With less than a dozen developers working form all over the world, this mid-sized indie studio is trying to turn modest successes into long term survival. Their next game, \"Steambirds\" could be the breakout they need. \nEpisode 02: FAMILY BUSINESS. John Romero created \"Doom\". Brenda Romero has worked for decades as a game developer. Now they're working with young Donovan on \"Gunman Taco Truck\" and helping others learn the joy of game making. This is the story of the Romero's \"Family Business\".\nAdditional episodes will include the stories of:\n  And if we're funded to our second stretch goal (way less than twice our original goal), we'll be able to make six more episodes \u2014 and you can help decide whose stories we tell next!\nSTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT is the next major webseries from my company, Flying Saucer Media. I've worked for 25 years in media production. I was the head writer and producer of TechTV's \"The Screen Savers\"; editor-in-chief of the six-time Webby Award winning escapistmagazine.com; co-founder of Polygon.com; and creator Polygon's \"Human Angle\" webseries, short documentaries about people in video games.\nSTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT is picking up where Human Angle left off, with an entirely new 6-episode series chronicling the real human stories of video games. And to ensure that no one can pull the plug, call the shots or change the course, I'm asking for your help to fund this series.\nProduction of STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT has already begun. I've spent my own money shooting the first two episodes of this series. And pre-production has begun on several additional episodes. \nSTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT will be six episodes. We're asking for your help to raise $192,105. That's a very precise figure, and one we're confident in. We're experienced video professionals with over 25 years experience making high-quality video. We know how much it costs, how hidden costs can stack up, and how to avoid surprises up-front. We've provided a detailed breakdown of why we're asking for what we're asking below. I think after reading and hearing more about what we're trying to accomplish you'll agree we're aiming for a reasonable goal.\nEach 7-10 minute episode of STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT tells a new story about an interesting, exceptional or revolutionary personality in the video game community. What is it like to be an indie developer working with a dozen other people around the world? What kind of child grows up raised by some of the most famous game developers in the world? How do you make a game better than your first game, when your first game was one of the best reviewed games out there? And what kind of person has millions of fans just for making videos on YouTube? STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT will answer all of these questions and more.\nThe first episode will publish the same day this Kickstarter closes, whether or not the series is funded. New episodes will then follow every month.\nAt Flying Saucer Media, we run very small crews. For STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, we'll be working with freelance contributors for almost every shoot, but the core team will be:\nProducing six, separate short documentary films covering subjects all over the world is no easy task. I know. I've done it before. I know exactly how much that will cost, how long it will take and (most importantly) how to do it right.\nI'm asking for a lot of money. I'm asking for a lot of trust. I hope you agree that telling these amazing stories is worth a little of both.\nCrew fees and travel are the biggest expenses. The second biggest expense is backer rewards, that's the stuff we're making and shipping to you for backing this project. I'm borrowing Robert Khoo's excellent analysis of how much that sort of thing costs. I also borrowed Robert's math on how much Kickstarter and credit card companies will charge me for the privilege of taking your money. It's a lot! \nStage of Development is going to cost us $138,650 to produce (rounded to the nearest dollar). That includes crew fees, travel, contingency (in case something breaks) and fees for music composition and licensing.\nAdding in the cost to produce the awesome backer rewards ($38,406.05) and the amount Kickstarter will charge to raise the remaining sum ($15,049.76) we get to $192,105.\nOr put another way:\nThe portion of this chart that looks like Pac-Man is how much we need in order to produce Stage of Development.\nThe rest is how much we need to spend in order to raise the amount we need to produce Stage of Development.\nThe first episode of Stage of Development will be available to backers as a digital download the same day this Kickstarter closes. No excuses.\nEpisode 1: September 16 (The day this Kickstarter closes)\nEpisodes 2-6: One per month, every month. \nThat's not bluster. The episode been shot and is currently in the final stages of post-production.\nWe are planning to publish additional episodes every 3-4 weeks. Right now we have all of the six episodes booked and scheduled for production and post-production.\nFancy pledge chart.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only serious risk is that someone's schedule might change, forcing us to adjust our production schedule, possibly costing us more or affecting the amount of time it will take to finish an episode.\n\nThis is the sort of thing where experience leads to a much lower risk. I've done this before. I've run into these issues. And I know how to work around them and plan a schedule and a budget keeping in mind that things may change.\n\nRealistically, there's a 100% chance that something will happen differently than we've planned it. But there's a statistically zero chance that a disruption will be so severe that it will impact our schedule or budget so severely that we can't adjust. \n\nI don't want to say \"never\" but I've been managing schedules and budgets for decades. Both \"Press Reset\" and \"Human Angle\" came in on time and under budget. As has every production I've ever been a part of. If STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT were to run over budget or take longer than I expected, it would be the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Russ Pitts\n2 created \u00b7 28 backed\nRuss Pitts is a veteran producer with experience in almost every entertainment medium.

This lead to the creation of Sketch Wallet - a leather wallet that holds a sketchbook. It comes in black or chocolate brown leather with a matching sketchbook.\n If there is a combination of things you'd like, but don't see in the rewards, just do the math and give me a note explaining what you want. For example, if you'd like one sketchbook and a t-shirt, just select the t-shirt and then add $4 to your pledge for the sketchbook. \n I've been using a prototype Sketch Wallet for two years and absolutely love it. I can't imagine not having one. It doesn't matter where I am, the doctor's office, a restaurant, or wherever. If I have a few moments I'll doodle a few sketches instead of surfing the net on my phone. I've come to cherish all these quirky little drawings and many of these raw ideas I've developed further into games I create for work and other projects. This has brought the joy of drawing back, and has helped me improve my skills.\nThe Sketch Wallet is very flat and is designed to maximize the area of a standard men's back pocket without feeling bulky or heavy.\nAttention writers and note takers - now you have the option of lined paper! After the campaign you will receive an email survey and can pick blank sketch books or lined paper books.\nWe respect craftsmen everywhere, but I wanted to use local factories to ensure the best quality and ethics possible. Our wallets and sketchbooks are made in the USA.\n STRETCH GOALS!\nUNLOCKED! If we hit $35,000 every reward level, small or large, gets a small metal page clip. \nUNLOCKED!

The factory and printers are already in place. The wallet dies and hot stamps have already been made. Not only have a few prototypes been made but I manufactured a small batch just to work out all the kinks in manufacturing before the Kickstarter campaign began. It's extremely expensive to manufacture a small batch, but I felt it was crucial to ironing out any kinks in the pipeline beforehand. While I don't have any leather product experience, I have, over the years, designed, manufactured, and shipped hundreds of products made of metal, plastic, and rubber.

The Shield of the King is the first episode in this series which promises:\n- An engaging episodic story of a father's love for his two sons set in a grounded fantasy universe where the player can jump between timelines to relive key moments for several different characters!\n- Strategic turn based combat that hearkens back to classic snes rpg games like Chrono Trigger, Fire Emblem and Ogre Battles, boasting special class based abilities, team positioning and a special action point system!\n- Rogue-like crawl and loot missions that will keep you on your toes, and entertained, raising the stakes for your favorite characters that can permanently die in randomly generated encounters!\nWe are here on Kickstarter asking the public to help us create this world and bring it to you in all it's pixelated glory in the summer of 2016.\nThe player will discover many characters of all shapes and sizes, many with their own interesting story arcs that tangle together in a web of deceit, mis-placed loyalties and lies.\nWe have been hard at work developing a scaleable story platform by creating storyboards for the first chapter, concepting locations, characters and creatures, and most importantly, creating a pre-alpha demo of the battle system. You can check out this (very) early demo of how the battles will feel in the game, but be warned...... it's far from complete!\npre-alpha build of the battle system showing off the speed, movement, basic attacks and action points features\nWe wanted the battle system to be cerebral and strategic, and hearken back to the good old days of snes rpg games like Tactics Ogre, Chrono Trigger and Fire Emblem. Players will customize their parties effectiveness by choosing classes, skills and equipment that will combo well together to prepare for any challenge.\nskills are location based and can turn the tide of a tough fight\nThe pauldron (a simple piece of armor that covers your shoulder) in our world is a symbol of one's family legacy, a symbol of one's allegiance. Marcus, a loving, dutiful, father, prepares for the day when he will pass his own pauldron down to his firstborn son Griff, who would rather hunt deer in solitude than take his father's oath as the 'Shield of the King'. Marcus learns that it may be hard to convince his son what is worthy of a lifetime of devotion, if he himself questions who and what is worth dying for.\nWe have put a lot of care into character development. We want players to be invested in these characters so that the stakes are raised when their lives are in peril.\n Marcus is the 'Shield of the King'; the man responsible for the immediate safety of king and realm. Marcus earned his pauldron and sigil in a desperate battle where he risked his life to save his future king.\nMarcus is stern and wary, good traits for the king's bodyguard.\n William is the best mounted knight in eastern kingdoms. He has never been unhorsed, never lost a joust, and is unmatched in single combat. Despite his large ego, William looks to his older brother, Marcus, for stability and leadership.\nWilliam serves as the king's champion. Cavalier and charming, he often frustrates his stern brother Marcus\nWe are planning to tell the story with special 'story missions' that will feature unique cut-scenes and dialogue options. These special missions will be earned through the rogue-like loot and crawl missions that you will take the characters on.\n Legacy and the coming of age are important themes in the story, Marcus has to manage his knightly  responsibilities, while keeping track of his two very different children. Griff is solemn and quite, and not too excited about taking up his father's pauldron, while Kay is young and rowdy, and likely to get himself killed before his adolescence.  The story begins with the two boys discovering the shell of a wyrm's egg on a simple fishing trip. This indicates that a dragon has breached the protective walls surrounding their realm. Marcus must investigate as they annual tournament celebrations are just days away. The player can jump between three timelines where you can experience the same characters as they change throughout their life.\n In the Pauldron, players will be able to jump to different timelines to discover how time and events have shaped their favorite characters. Think of it like flashing forward and backward in time as an omniscient narrator.\nExperience the story in 3 separate timelines.\nTHE PAST (the war of the sentinels) - Kingdoms that were once in conflict are now joining together to fight against their powerful former rulers... the dragon riding sentinels! Marcus will earn his reputation fighting along-side the future king.\nPRESENT DAY (the peaceful kingdom) - The citizens of Camlann are preparing for it's annual tournament celebrating the king's wedding anniversary. A looming threat emerges when Marcus discovers a breach in their protective walls, and a shady conspiracy.\nTHE FUTURE (the fall of the mighty) - The kingdom is left in ruins. Marcus now urges his son to take up his family Pauldron and leave without him so he can confront the authors of this destruction and end it at all cost.\nWe have been just as concerned with building a world as we are building this game. The locations needs to feel tangible and real. Here are some fantastic concepts of some of the locations you will visit in 'The Pauldron'.\nAgned is a massive scorched landscape with structures not built by man\nFarwood is quiet, secluded and teaming with strange life forms\nPenthus is an open fertile land, ruled by the greatest horsemen beyond the mist\nThere is much more concept art, production art and animations that will show up in the pdf art book. We are super excited to share each art asset with this special kickstarter reward.\n We are committed to finishing this game regardless of the funding level. We just want to finish it within a year, and with good quality art, animation, audio and marketing. Take a look at the below stretch goals to get an idea of how we will spend the funds raised.\n$ 10,000  Art Boost - Better character portraits and animations!\n$ 20,000   Music and Sound Boost - Custom made audio! \n$ 30,000 - Content Boost - Additional story mission and character (to be revealed in an update)\n$ 40,000 - Platform Boost - IOS and Android releases post launch\n$ + 40,000 - Funds will go toward the success of the series\nIf we get close to completing these tiers, we have some plans for additional stretch goals.\nWe are targeting PC first, (Windows, and Steam - let us know if you are interested in other platforms!)  but if success allows, we would like to bring it to as many platforms as possible. We are designing with mobile touch screens in mind and It's already feeling great on Android!\nKickstarter contributors have special access to items that will not be sold elsewhere. Take a look at the rewards for backing at different levels! Some of these tiers are limited and won't last long! You can change your tier during the campaign, but make sure to pledge at the level you wont regret! (Physical copies of PDF materials may be offered at a later date for the price of production)\nYou will receive a key to download on Windows, Steam, Mac or Linux. Let us know your preferred platform! We will try our best to be flexible to the needs of fans. (if the mobile stretch Goals are achieved, you may choose IOS or Android, but these may release at a later date)\nThe world is larger than it seems. Keep track of locations and creatures using this world map. You may find something interesting that will help you understand the lore of the game.\nLearn more about characters, gameplay and items with this old school instruction manual. Let us know what you want to see in here. Bestiary? Character profiles? Cheat Codes?  (probably not this)\nWe already have a great collection of environmental art, concept art, and storyboards that we would love to share, and we are just getting started. Like the art you see so far? There is plenty more to gawk at!\nMany Characters you will find in the game are randomly generated with random attributes like family sigil, color scheme etc.... Get your family immortalized into the game! (must adhere to a few rules)\nDesign a weapon, armor or item to use in the game! We need lots of these in the game! Why not help us out with designing your own equipment! (must adhere to a few rules)\nThere are many dangerous creatures in this world. Help us design the look and AI of one of these enemies you will encounter! (must adhere to a few rules)\nThere are three types of characters in the game: Story Characters (cannot be completely killed in a rogue mission due to their involvement in the story), Tertiary Characters (can be killed, but have generic portraits etc..), and Generic Characters (in case you kill off all your other characters, you will still have bodies to use) Help us design a Tertiary Character. (and if we like him/her then maybe a story character...  ...also must adhere to a few rules) \nWe have been very fortunate in our friends.

We actually had multiple team members contributing art, code and story and our costs (just to get the demo) were a bit high for our  budget (out of pocket for LLC members at close to 10k a month).  As I said in comments earlier, the total cost of development to date is orders of magnitude greater that we had raised on this platform. I had always known it would be greater cost, but never knew exactly how much.

So we have decided to expand some of our favorite tweets into a collection of short stories! We also like variety, so we'll throw in some honorable mention tweets and some activities and puzzles and stuff.\nThe first part of the book is a collection of short stories based on a few of our more popular tweets. Each story begins with a beautifully illustrated drawing by the extremely talented Jesse Lucas and ranges from 10-20 pages. They are all chock-full of ridiculously awful prose, bad analogies, horrible opinions, uneducated explanations, and dumb jokes. Following each short story, there will be ridiculous activities based on the preceding tale like word searches, mazes, mad libs, horrible cooking recipes, and more!\nHere are some of the short stories:\nCthulu's a Dick\nBased on: \"Al gazed upon Cthulhu and was consumed with madness. Not the crazy kind, the angry kind. Cthulhu totally pissed him off. Cthulhu's a dick.\"\nMethane in the Membrane\nBased on: \"Lia stepped off her ship onto the planet. 'That smells gross, Ben.' Ben was confused until they both died. The atmosphere was methane.\"\nHard-boiled Hobbit\nBased on:\u201cOf all the hobbit-holes in The Shire, this dame had to walk into mine. Tall as she was beautiful. 2'3\" and feet as hairy as my last case.\"\nThe Confusing, But Not Impossible Labyrinth\nBased on:\"'I smash you to nothing!' said the ogre. 'That's physically impossible,' said Dean. The others agreed, and the ogre admitted he was wrong.\"\nAnd more!\nAnd in each physical copy of Harris Dies on Page 32 and Other Tales of Awful Fantasy there will be a very special roleplaying adventure for the 5th edition of a popular RPG with a name I can't remember: The Daemon Queen\u2019s Saecret Tower!\nThe best answer is illustrations. It's a scientific fact that 100% of all things can be made 403 times better with some great art, and we believe that our book could benefit from that math.\n\nWe have the gift for deep storytelling, and complex, sophisticated writing, but we don\u2019t draw no good. So, it is our responsibility to see that someone else who is good at art does that stuff and gets paid while we stick to what we're good at: writing badly.\n\nWe've recruited the incredible talents of Jesse Lucas to do our illustrations, and it's not just because he shares the same last name as us. We believe his beautiful and clean art style would compliment our project perfectly and are excited to see what more he can do once this book gets funded.\n\nCheck out one of the images right now:\n\"The Dwarves sat down for a game of Offices & Executives. Thimlo, playing as Ted the Lawyer, rolled a 9 to dial out with his +1 desk phone.\"\n\nIn addition to having a Kickstarter for the art, we also need help getting the full-color, physical book printed. We think that having a physical book to hold, open, and touch would be pretty great, and we know that everyone loves to hold, open, and touch things. This book allows you to do all three at once.

An @AwfulFantasy Roleplaying Adventure!\nThe D\u00e6mon Queen's S\u00e6cret Tower is a very special roleplaying adventure specifically designed to be compatible with the 5th edition of a very popular RPG that I can't seem to remember the name of. It's that one game where you sit around with your friends and you act like you are different people in a fantasy world and you roll dice. There's a person at the table who leads the adventure. Man, why can't I remember what it's called? Oh well, I think you know the game I mean.\n\nIn The D\u00e6mon Queen's S\u00e6cret Tower, you and some friends will partake in the most ridiculous adventure ever created. Here's the story:\n\nOnce a regal and respected Queen of the Land of Orboz, Queen F\u0153tida instilled the opposite of fear into the hearts or her loyal subjects. Faced with the knowledge that she comes from a royal line rife with incest and illegal underground dragon fighting, F\u0153tida was dethroned by the Lord of a lesser house who uncovered her family\u2019s darker past. Queen F\u0153tida, residing in an old, long abandoned s\u00e6cret tower in the Dargon Mountains, is now a servant of Necrosa, and has turned from her love of Contemporary Impressionism to the somewhat Darker Arts\u2014NECROMANCY!\nThe Undead are invading the peaceful townships and cities of Orboz, consuming the flesh of the living, and ever spreading their vile dark magic and unpopular religious beliefs. Queen F\u0153tida has been spotted as a shade near the Dargon Mountains, and tale is told she still lives, most likely raising the dead as her own Personal Undead Army of Revenge!\nIt is up to a small band of heroes (you) to find Queen F\u0153tida and put an end to her Necromaniacal ways. In the Dargon Mountains lies the decrepit heart of the dark magic that plagues Orboz like a plague. In this metaphorical heart is where you must end the Dark Queen\u2019s evil, vengeful plans (by killing her).

It takes a world you think you\u2019ve read about before and turns it into something new and totally different.\nThis is the finest time to be a tabletop roleplayer since the dawn of the industry. With so many great choices on the market, your imagination has nearly infinite paths for which to choose and expand upon. With the recent release of the newest version of Dungeons & Dragons, players are chomping at the bit to exercise their imaginations and spread their ideas wide. With the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting and future sourcebook line, you can do just that. Seventh Crown is a narrative setting and sourcebook that can be used with the rules found within many popular roleplaying game systems.\nCover of Seventh Crown Setting Book\nWelcome to Seventh Crown\nBased initially within the heavily populated continent of Kanis, Seventh Crown is a setting that places the players in the middle of an epic time of change in a world controlled by a select few. What was once a powerful dwarven empire now stands as broken racial kingdoms not defined by borders or territories, but by the ironclad magical control bestowed upon them by the crowns upon their brow.\nIn Seventh Crown, six golden artifacts of unfathomable power \u2013 the Crowns of Leadership \u2013 give almost ultimate and untested influence over those of the same race. While wearing the Crown, they cannot help but be king or queen of their people. This has led to a world of kingdoms that are not defined on maps or in war rooms, but instead by the blood that runs in a people\u2019s veins. Authority enforced by magic across countless miles creates alliances, enemies and conflicts unlike those found anywhere else. When the reason for going to war is as simple as the will of who wears the Crown and the battlefield could be as complex as anywhere its people tread, life is a complex thing.\nThese six Crowns are the most powerful and important pieces of antiquity found anywhere in this world, and are watched and sought after by most of the people in Kanis. The dealings of the Crowns and the choices made by those who wear them are the talk of every town and city, and entire lifetimes have been spent trying to place a Crown on someone\u2019s head \u2013 or remove the head currently wearing one. Territorial governments, the constabulary, organized crime and other local powerhouses rule their corners of civilization for the most part, but everyone feels the pull of the Crown bearers\u2019 schemes and machinations.\nIt is the rumored existence of a seventh Crown of Leadership, the namesake of the game setting itself, which drives some people to scour the world for the mythic artifact. There have been six ruling forces on Kanis for thousands of years, many of which changing hands (heads?) over and over again, but the fact that there have always been six has been a constant for as long as the Crowns have existed. The discovery and donning of a seventh Crown of Leadership would change the world in an instant\u2026 or the discovery that it has already been found, and by what.\nThe continent of Kanis is large and varied in respect to the peoples that inhabit it, the history they have survived, and all of the interactions in between. Depending on the where someone is from, which King or Queen they serve willingly or otherwise, and how they plan to fill their purses or bellies day to day \u2013 that is where adventure will spring from in Seventh Crown.\nThe Surface of Kanis\nWhat is Different?\nAnyone can read through the newest game system and see what each creature, species or deity means to a \u201cnormal\u201d campaign setting. Seventh Crown takes a lot of these standard ideas found in several rulebooks and turns them into brand new ideas that come together to create a new and unique world where players can portray characters like they never have before. There are plotlines and narrative hooks found within Seventh Crown that will put players in unique new roles as well as give them interactions with the world not commonly possible in other settings.\nJust to give a number of good examples, the following are all samples of what makes Seventh Crown unique, interesting and a great deal of fun in which to roleplay.\nThe current King of the Elves is a sadistic dark elf warlock with the long term plan of breeding out the surface elves by forcing hospitality between the Surface World and the Great Beneath. Over the centuries dark elves have become a much more accepted sight on the surface, and travel to the depths of the Great Beneath is more commonplace despite its inherent dangers.\nThe halfling people suffered massive losses during a horrible war that forced their people into nomadic, extended families that travel Kanis in search of joy, profit and adventure. Their stories and culinary crafts are welcomed almost universally in Kanisi civilization.\nIcon of Vimbre Po; Laughing God of Halfling Nomads\nThe dragonborn of Kanis are primarily mercenaries and seafarers, with those of chromatic heritage leaning toward life as sell swords or pirates; metallic dragonborn finding more favor as professional soldiers and trading corsairs. The two sects of dragonborn are constantly at odds, and many conflicts have begun based solely on \u201cscale color.\u201d\nOne corner of the continent is currently dealing with a large scale guerilla war between the goblinoids and the kobolds, putting some local civilizations in strange circumstances for unlikely social situations and alliances.\nThere is a militant sect within the dwarves that harken to the days when their bloodlines ruled the entire continent as a royal Dynasty. These dwarves are old-minded, somewhat racist toward certain peoples, and belligerently aimed at returning the dwarves to former glory.\nThe gnomes of Kanis are willingly subservient to dwarves and have been for thousands of years. Their acceptance of a lower station in life is a key element to a larger meta-mathematical equation that their ancient scholars believe will finalize with the gnomish people ruling the entire world. Effectively, the gnomes believe they have discovered the formula for complete domination of Kanis; it only requires a few more centuries of servitude to come to fruition.\nAnd much, much more!\nSymbol of Foeslen, God of Thieves and Muggers\nWhat will be in the Seventh Crown core book?\nThe Seventh Crown core book, the goal of this Kickstarter, when published will be a hardcover tome of roughly 150 pages written, designed, illustrated and laid out by industry professionals to create a complete sourcebook for the continent of Kanis and the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting. While it will contain some rules information specific to the Seventh Crown setting, it will NOT include a core system of rules. Instead it relies upon the player(s) to use it alongside obviously compatible rules systems.\nThe Seventh Crown Core Setting Book will include:\nA detailed History of the continent of Kanis, its many Cultures and its current Rulers\nA detailed Pantheon of Kanisi deities, including their effect upon Clerics, Paladins and Druids in Seventh Crown\nA detailed look at the Geography and Civilizations of Kanis\nNew Kanisi Backgrounds, Feats and Spells\nFull Color Unique Illustrations throughout\nFull Color Maps of the Kanis surface world and the subterranean Great Beneath\nNarrative Stories set in the world of Seventh Crown (some starring characters from higher-level Backers!)\nPlot Hooks and Adventure Ideas; including two detailed 1st-level Campaign Starters\nA Glossary of Seventh Crown terms to help with pronunciation and explanation\nWhat do you get for your backing?\nAside from being a part of the launch of a great new game setting, hopefully giving it enough fan backing to begin a full Seventh Crown line of sourcebooks and such in the near future, you faithful backers can get some really awesome rewards for helping us get off the ground!\nThe Copper Piece Level \u2013 For just $2 or more you throw in your attentions to the campaign and help keep the Kickstarter \u201cHot Picks\u201d eyes peeled on our little project here.

During these events we will be taking charitable food donations (Canned and sealed-boxed items only) from the players AND bystanders to be given to the local Food Finders Food Bank (http://food-finders.org/) to serve as points of Inspiration to modify the game in progress.

Should this campaign go well enough to show us a solid fan base in the works, we plan on getting Seventh Crown print runs into common distribution and hopefully into game stores all over the world.\nAdditionally, we have plans to write a series of Seventh Crown setting products that will better flesh out the world, its many plotlines and some major events that take place in the overarching story and expanding world setting.\nSome of the products we have planned are as follows:\nvarious Adventure Modules that cover specific plot arcs important to the Seventh Crown storyline\nBestiary of Kanis Sourcebook; introducing numerous native species of creatures to encounter\nFarsteader\u2019s Atlas Sourcebook; a guide to the lands beyond the primary continent of Kanis\nSeventh Crown novellas surrounding epic events within the world\nEssentially, we want this Kickstarter campaign to go well enough to warrant making Seventh Crown into a larger roleplaying setting capable of launching more products through future Kickstarters and eventually on their own merit.

The pixel art visual style delivers a weird and twisted tale of a world\u2019s last 3 weeks.\nIn the interest of time, here is the short summary of what this game is:\nA grand misery.  \nNonlinear storytelling.  \nMultiple endings.\n Countless secrets.\n Architectural level design.\n Alternative routes, shortcuts.\n Different characters have entirely different routes for the same level. \u2022 Up to 20 different weapons and spells for each character.  \nDestructible environments; burn, blow and slash your way through obstacles. Who needs keys when you have a rocket launcher?  \nNo tiles. Each level is hand drawn.  \nA mixed technology setting; swords meeting magic and space age technology.  \nThemes inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft.\nRead on for a detailed description, but why just read when you can play the demo instead?\n\"Gameplay is King\"\nWhile many play games to seek out good stories or characters, gameplay still needs to be a priority when considering a game. Games are interactive and you cannot deliver an interesting world unless your gameplay compliments the art.\nBorder\u2019s first goal is to deliver a smooth and fast paced game, one that is fun and fair to play while still being really challenging.\nUpon starting the game, your goal will be clear, you will have 3 characters to choose from and 3 of the huge main areas open to you.\nEach character has an entirely different entry point and portion of the map accessible to them; aside from the end bosses of each of these areas, they won\u2019t share any bosses. This means that replaying a level with another character is an entirely different experience.\nOnce selecting your area you will have a clear goal but multiple ways to reach it. The architectural level design ensures that shortcuts are present and many in number. Hand drawn areas make navigation easy, also helpful is the fact that defeated enemies and their remains will never disappear.\nYou will eventually come across unique enemies or fallen warriors who will grant you access to new weapons or spells.\nWeapons and Spells.\nThese are the focus of your character. They all have entirely different move sets, strengths and weaknesses. Many of these weapons and spells can grant you access to new areas, similar to the traditional Metrodvania formula. All of these weapons and spells use the same resource: your stamina. All of these areas are full of secrets and Easter eggs.\nThe game uses a natural method of storytelling where the environment tells a story on its own, without much exposition. Additionally the game\u2019s \"cut scenes\" will never wrestle the control away from the player; the camera never loses sight of the player, and if you don't want to listen to your enemy\u2019s monologue you can always interrupt them with a well-aimed punch to the face.\nOn your journey you can sometimes come across NPCs who are neither friends nor foes, some will talk to you, but you might never know if they will become your enemies later or not.\nSooner or later you will die. When you do so, you will lose all of the souls attached to you. However, they can be recovered - similar to how it works in the Souls series of games.\nAside from your weapons you will have a few things always available to you, these are as follows.\nHealing: you can only heal with charges in your crystal fragment, these replenish at every checkpoint.\nProtection spell: each character has their own altered version of this basic spell. It deflects weapon hits and reflects projectiles, but cannot defend you from area of effect spells and traps.\nShifting: it\u2019s a form of dash that allows for a short burst of rapid movement. It also allows you to trigger traps and area of effects without being harmed.\nOverextension system. This is an extremely powerful offensive ability available to you. When used it will increase all of your stats drastically and provide a special move set that can decimate foes, and turn the odds in your favour. However, to activate this you need to sacrifice one of your charges used for healing.This mode lasts only for a short time, unless you sacrifice another charge while the mode is active.\nOnce you reach your destination at the end of an area, and complete your mission, you will return to your base of operation: the Nagifar. On this space-worthy ship you can upgrade your skills, exchange a few words with the other characters, and learn a bit about the world you\u2019re in.\nBosses are a big focus of the game. They are usually one on one affairs, many of them will try and communicate with you in some way, some have multiple ways to defeat them, and these ways can alter the story and the NPCs that you might come upon later on. Expect these to be challenging encounters.\nOnce ready, you select the character and the area of your choice again.\nBased on your choice of who finishes which area, the story will shift and change and you might understand a bit more about the world, and why it will end...\nBorder: Remembrance takes place in what is known as a mixed technology setting. This is a world housing nations with largely different levels of technology and prosperity. After a cataclysmic war, the world reawakened with newfound magic, and new forms of life, with some survivors using advanced technology some even living in space.\nFrom sprawling city nations to abandoned temples to lads crawling with robots, this is a chaotic world.\nVisit the Forest of the Seal, where once a great nation gathered mages to perform \"The First Summoning\", now the land is overtaken by nature and infested with Demons. Still, the descendants of the few survivors still guard this place and fight to stop the spread of Demons any further.\nForest of the Seal.\nFight your way through the city nation of Berelaai, the largest remaining Human kingdom, and witness as the church turns to madness in the face of imminent destruction.\nCity of Berelaai.\nBattle with the elements as you search the new South Pole for the hidden city of Artificial Intelligence: this city houses Millions of AIs who escaped the last Great War. See with your own eyes how the calculus of AIs deal with the destruction of the moon.\nUnity AI.\nDelve deep into the Sunken City, where Geometry and conventional logic will be of no help to you. Fight the cursed inhabitants of this ancient and unnatural place.\nSunken City.\nEnter the space station of Yggdrasil, where the gears of technology never stopped. Decide the fate of the scientists now thrust into a civil war, and the moon threatens even the station.\nYggdrasil space station.\nA group of these scientists decided to completely isolate themselves from others and delve into experiments with the new found magic in the world.\nProject Aesir.\nThis project gave birth to your playable characters: humanoids with inhuman everlasting life given to them.\nFrey\nMidir\nBaldar\nSif\nAt the beginning of the game, you, the player, trigger a terrible explosion on the moon. This will cause 35% of the moon\u2019s mass to break apart and begin its 3 week long journey toward the earth. This means the end of all complex life on the planet for good.\nYou caused this, and there is no saving the world this time.\nThe story focuses on 3 characters form the Aesir project who can be considered a new race of humans. They have everlasting youth and possess bodies more resilient than those of normal humans.\nThese Demigods will set out on a journey to form what are known as the Mana Stones, fuse them with as many souls as they can and find a new world to plant these souls after the destruction.\nBut as this cataclysm waiting for the world is absolutely undeniable, the people of this world will have a hard time dealing with the concept of certain doom.\nYou will visit the two great kingdoms of man who are at each other\u2019s throats, each blaming the other for the destruction of the moon. Uncover the remains of the Demon Palace, where a once great soul was sealed away. Enter and marvel at the nation of Artificial Intelligences built for themselves. Delve deep into the cosmic chaos of the Sunken Capital. And witness a pointless war just before the end of the world.\nYour journey will deal with themes of absolute certain loss, cosmic insignificance, and how the different cultures reflect on their actions near the end of everything they know.\nBy the end you might even uncover why the destruction was triggered, and expose a great mystery.\nYou might say that there is a strong atmosphere of desperation and unavoidable destruction in Border\u2026 well, you'd be right! One way of setting the tone is with an engaging storyline, but to really feel as if you are actually there you're going to need music. Whether it is just simple background ambience or full-blown musical scores, with Border, the aim has always been to enhance whatever scene or idea I have been given to work from by creating music around it - thus creating a real emotional connection with the player.\nThe music creation is actually a two-way process. I am given a detailed description of either a character, event, battle, area or scene using keywords. I may also be given specific restraints such as which instruments to use, or how the music should progress. Then with this information I will usually begin to formulate ideas in my head, imagining certain emotions that may be present. Usually this begins on piano only, then I will add more instruments in once I have a confident starting point.\nOnce this has been roughly assembled, it will be sent to Istvan for feedback. From there changes can easily and quickly be made if need be. This whole process for one piece of music takes between a few hours to a few days - depending on the complexity of the music and time constraints. The benefits of working this way are clear - not only is the whole process extremely quick, but the constant feedback ultimately provides Istvan with music that compliments the original design intentions and the atmosphere that is needed in a game like Border: Remembrance.\nNote: To clarify all console versions listed will be released, stretchgoals only means they can be released the same time the PC versions will be released. If stretchgoals are not reached we will still release on the listed consoles but only some time later.\n---\u00a34.000 Flyable world map.---\nA fully detailed world map you can fly your Spaceship around, and even discover hidden areas and secret bosses.\n---\u00a35.000 Forgotten age Dungeon.---\nAn endgame dungeon featuring 7 Bosses of extreme difficulty, offering more clues about the language used in the game.\n---\u00a36.000 More Music.---\nMore haunting musical tracks from the talented Jamie Warne.\n---\u00a38.000 Hiring Help from community.---\nHiring help to work on even more enemies\u2019 pixel art animations, this means a faster development, and more content.\n---\u00a310.000 PS4 and PS VITA Versions on launch.---\nConsole versions with Console specific controls. Stretchgoal is ONLY to ensure the console versions will release on launch. If the goal is not met, the first sales on PC will cover the costs of the porting, meaning around two months delay.\n---\u00a312.000 local Co-op & Duel Mode.---\nPick up a second controller, or do it the good old fashioned way and share the same keyboard. Challenge your friends in a super fast paced Duel arena, up to 4 players.\n---\u00a316.000 Voice acting.---\nIf available using the voice talents of: Megan Hollingshead (Pokemon, Code Geass, and countless amazing video game performances.) for the role of Frey.\nJohnny Yong Bosch (Code Geass, Haruhi, and hundreds of amazing video game performances.) for the role of Baldar.\nLiam O'Brien (Bleach, Code Geass, and hundreds of amazing video game performances.) for the role of Midir.\n*If said voice talents will be unavailable the voice work will be hired from indie voice actors.\n---\u00a318.000 Nintendo WII U version on launch.---\nThanks to Nintendo`s latest policies this can become a reality. Console versions with Console specific controls. Stretchgoal is ONLY to ensure the console versions will release on launch. If the goal is not met, the first sales on PC will cover the costs of the porting.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nBecause aside from the music, this is purely a one man game. Currently I`m working odd jobs through temporary employment, I have little time left, and given a successful Kickstarter I can dedicate more time to the game. Pixel work and Coding takes a lot of time.\nReleasing a game also involves taxes, and that requires paperwork. Setting up a proper website and distribution of the DRM free version is not free either.\nKickstarter is also a great opportunity to interact with the target audience, survey their feelings about the game and potential ideas on how to improve it - more eyes see a lot more.\nThis means I plan to do weekly updates, during and after the Kickstarter. If you want extra reassurance follow me on Twitter where I`ll be talking about my daily progress, and sharing art from the game on a regular basis. From YouTube gameplay snippets, to Twitch pixel art and GML coding sessions, to crafting Music with Jam, I plan to make the development of the game a more open experience.\nBackers can expect a playable demo of the game for pc shortly after the end of the Kickstarter.\nOur Website: http://www.fallenvalkyriestudio.com/\nOur Press kit: http://www.fallenvalkyriestudio.com/press-kit/\nFor more art, please visit my Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/fallenvalkyriestudio\nOr our IndieDB page: http://www.indiedb.com/games/border-remembrance\nOr just follow me on Twitter for daily Pixelart, and updates on the game`s progress: https://twitter.com/FValkyrieStudio\nThank you very much for reading.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAside from the Music this is a one man effort.\nThere are obviously positives and negatives to this. The negative is the possibility of getting swamped, luckily the game`s code is 70% complete. Most of my time will be spent on asset creation. The upside of this is the ability to keep the vision and game design consistent.\n\nI have a really clear vision of what this game should be, and value the responsiveness and comfort in gameplay firstly.\nThis means I am to make a game that first feels solid and plays smoothly before trying to deliver my artistic goals.\n\nThe game is currently fully functioning, and all coding besides menus is finished. Using GML means that even if problems were to occur, they are incredibly easy to fix. At this time the game has no bugs or glitches, and the game runs at a steady 60fps on 1080P resolution on 5 year old computer hardware. Performance still persists when using over 100 enemies on screen!\n\nThe only risk I can run into is being late on release, I value a strong finished version over buggy and barely functioning early access.\n\nThe main challenge is obviously time. There is a LOT of sprite animating to be done here, but again a lot of training got me to a really efficient method, which should make all of this possible in the desired time frame.\n\nAs I stated earlier I will make the development of this game very open to the public, I have nothing to hide, and will do everything in my power to be transparent!\n\nThank you very much for reading.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Istvan Gal\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nMy name is Istvan Gal, a Hungarian living and working in the UK for almost 4 years now.

If The Wizard of Oz met the Hidden Fortress with influences derived from Escaflowne, hip-hop, and classic RPGs -- you get Cannon Busters, one wild ride of fun, suspense, action, and wackiness. It's a roadshow-style adventure of epic proportions!\n\nThe Story\nFollow the adventures and exploits of S.A.M, a high-end, royal-class friendship droid who's joined by a quirky, discarded maintenance robot and a brash, deadly fugitive. Together, the unlikely trio embarks on an unforgettable journey in a fantastic and dangerous world in search of S.A.M's best friend, the heir to a powerful kingdom under siege.\nThe Main Characters\nThe World\nThe story takes place hundreds of years ago in the vast and magical world of Gearbolt. As the centuries passed, the practice of magic became extinct, and many have forgotten its power, regulating it to mere superstition\u2026\nThe Project\nCannon Busters is an animated project created by TV animation producer/director LeSean Thomas. The goal is to produce a 8-10 minute pilot episode (1 act) through Kickstarter. We're looking to you to help us raise, at the very least, the minimum goal of $120,000 (8-10 minutes). If we surpass our minimum goal, our stretch goals will increase the length of the episode by 8-16 minutes, ultimately providing us the funds to create and develop a full 24-minute episode!\nThe Team Players\nHere's some of the team members who you'll be supporting to help bring Cannon Busters to life!\n LeSean Thomas, Creator/Director/Writer (https://twitter.com/LeSeanThomas)\nLeSean Thomas has contributed to television animation in the United States for over 10 years. His most notable works include Peabody Award-winning series The Boondocks on Adult Swim serving as Co-Director (Season 1) and Supervising Character Designer (Seasons 1 & 2), Nickelodeon's The Legend Of Korra (Book 1) as a storyboard/production artist, and most recently Black Dynamite: The Animated Series as Creative Producer (Season 1) and Supervising Director (Seasons 1 & 2) on Adult Swim.\nRecently, Thomas spent several years working abroad in South Korea as an animation production/storyboard artist, honing his skills and developing Cannon Busters while lending his talent to hit shows. He is driven by his passion and enthusiasm for animation production and enjoys sharing his knowledge with the animation & art community online. Drawing from Western and Eastern influences, Thomas's work displays a level of stylistic expression and dynamism that makes him highly distinguishable among his peers. Through his unique vision and your support, he hopes to bring Cannon Busters to life!\nJoe Madureira, Contributing Character Designer (http://www.airshipsyndicate.com)\nOne of the most influential artists working today, Joe Madureira is a celebrated comic book creator, illustrator, and game developer. His breakout work on titles such as Marvel's Uncanny X-Men and his creator-owned comic book Battle Chasers has earned him much acclaim. He also served as Creative Director for the hit video game series Darksiders (1&2). Madureira's energetic and distinctive style combines Western comic book influences with aspects of Japanese manga. We couldn't be more excited about his contributions to Cannon Busters!\nThomas Romain, Mechanical Designer (https://twitter.com/Thomasintokyo)\nThomas Romain has been a creative force since he moved from France to Japan over 10 years ago. As the Co-creator of Code Lyoko and Co-director/Character Designer on Oban Star Racers, Romain caught the attention of legendary Mecha Designer Shoji Kawamori (http://www.satelight.co.jp/kawamori/) and joined the famous animation studio Satelight Inc. (http://www.satelight.co.jp/eng/), where he helped co-create Basquash! Now a BG and Mecha Designer at Satelight, his most recent work has been lauded around the globe thanks to his unconventional Mecha designs for the popular Toonami series Space Dandy. His newest work on Cannon Busters promises to go even further!\nTim Yoon, Consulting Producer\nTim Yoon has worked as a producer in the American TV animation industry for over 10 years with notable works such as Batman: Under The Red Hood and The Legend of Korra (Books 1& 2). Having served as producer for The Killers \"Miss Atomic Bomb\" music video and most recently, the animation producer for the Drake Vs. Lil Wayne Tour, Yoon's wide range of experience -- in and outside animation -- is a valuable asset for Cannon Busters. \nBahi JD, animator\n(https://twitter.com/bahijd)\nBahi JD is one of the most promising up-and-coming animators working in TV animation today. Garnering online acclaim for his gif set animations years ago, he has since blossomed into one of 2D animation's growing talents. He's contributed his talents to various projects such as the Skullgirls video game, Shinichiro Watanabe's Kids on the Slope, the Mitsuyo Miyazaki/Koji Morimoto-directed short A Better Tomorrow, Space Dandy, Ping Pong, and most recently Ghost In The Shell: Arise. Bahi's kinetic and expressive flair will bring just the right touch to Cannon Busters!\nEric Calderon, Writer ( https://twitter.com/ericcalderon )\nEric has been in the international animation business for 20 years and has been the force behind the development of no less than 15 animated TV series in the genres of action, prime-time comedy, and kids entertainment. As a writer and co-producer for the legendary series Afro Samurai & Afro Samurai: Resurrection (starring the voices of Samuel L. Jackson, Kelly Hu, and Ron Perlman with music by the RZA), he helped lead that project into becoming the only anime in history to ever be nominated for a prime-time Emmy (the series also won an Individual Achievement Emmy for best Art Direction). In addition to development work, Eric was also the producer for Linkin Park's 'Breaking the Habit' video which won the MTV Video Music Award in 2005 for 'Viewer's Choice.' Finally, Eric has also written and released an original graphic novel called COLD SPACE with Samuel L. Jackson and continues to work daily to break the boundaries of what animation can do in the USA. He currently owns and operates an original Intellectual Property development and production company called Wild Boar Media, Inc. and is also Directing a YouTube series called 'Perfect Idol' which aims to find the next breakthrough English language voice talent in America. Eric's enthusiasm for this project, love for wacky RPGs, comedy, Stories with heart and classic animated shows from the 90s and beyond is a welcome addition to the project and is a great match with the creator's enthusiasm for all things action & adventure! We're glad to have him on board!

Say hello to Bessie, Philly's top lady -- and his primary source of transportation. \n  Bessie's base color is a sharp, Fuchsia/Pink tone. But when she enters \"RAGING BULL\" mode, she turns red-hot before changing her appearance to a Minotaur Mech!!!!\n Bessie's Raging Bull mode is a necessary feature since not all roads in Gearbolt are built in straight lines...or are without creatures of all sizes that need to be defended against! She may be an old model, but this old bucket of bolts still got a few new tricks up her sleeve!!!\n REAR - Philly is used to spending his life on the road alone, living inside his old but reliable whip, Bessie.\nBG CONCEPTS\nBALLON TOWN, a remote market city just on the edge of Jester's Belt Desert. Home to all manner of creatures and individuals who don't wish to be found.  \nTHE SEAL CLUB, a haven for bounty hunters looking for a drink between jobs. Not a place for wanted criminals! \nLittle is know about Locke's rise to power, and although magic is still considered superstition, legends tell he is a reincarnation of a wizard hundreds of years ago...\nAeon Flux creator, Peter Chung speaks on the importance of Kickstarter and shows LeSean Thomas & The Cannon Busters project Love!!!\nThanks for the Signal Boost, Pete! :-D\nBACKER REWARDS!!! \nOne of the great things about crowdfunding is being able to reward backers who've donated.

(http://www.bitmapd.com/welcome)\n\n Get yours in the backer rewards list now! :-)\nWhy Use Kickstarter?  \nAs kids growing up, we had a plethora of animated shows on American TV that spanned all genres -- action, adventure, comedy, dark humor; some content with mature themes and some educational... But over the years, the economy has influenced studios to become more risk-averse towards new ideas that don't already have a built-in following (e.g. celebrity talent) or an established franchise. And if so, it catered more towards comedy.\nAs a lover of comedy and big franchises myself (and having worked on dozens in my time), I still secretly yearned for more adventure shows that had plenty of comedy, but also a sprawling drama at its core -- along with kick-butt action and memorable characters! \nEnter crowdfunding, one of the most liberating platforms for the independent creator! After giving it a lot of thought (and much encouragement from my peers), I thought, ''What if I just brought an action-adventure dramedy series to the fans and admirers of this genre, instead of going through a network who would use focus groups to determine if my project was even worth seeing the light of day? Why not go the REAL focus group? The ones who would actually donate to see a project like this come together with some of the most exciting talents--domestic and abroad-- in the industry today?\"\n\nSo here we are. We're trying to make this unique and exciting journey a reality -- and we need YOUR SUPPORT in backing this project! Let's make Cannon Busters happen! \nWhere Your Donation Funds Will Go\nAll donations will go to the production and increased quality of one episode of Cannon Busters! Each donation from you, the backers, will get us closer to delivering something new, exciting, and high quality! In the event that we unfortunately fail to reach at least our passion-project minimum of $120k before the ending campaign date listed above, Amazon will not charge you and we will not achieve our goal. So we really need your support to make this happen!\n8-10 Minute Pilot Minimum Goal Budget of $120k:\nKickstarter's billing is payment by credit card with an http://www.amazon.com account.

Many believe those stories to be myths, cautionary tales to keep mortals living in fear. However, one thing is for certain. A world without balance is a world that is vulnerable to absolute destruction. It is for this reason that I say, let the gods forever stay the Days of Astasia.\u201d\n\u2013 Dreyer Maloth, the 44th Archbason of the Spearitan Faith\nCurrent publication of \"Eve of Corruption\"\nWhat is The Days of Astasia\nThe short answer: it\u2019s a trilogy of books written by me, Brady Sadler, drummer and founder of the fantasy metal band Lorenguard. Book one (Eve of Corruption) is already written and published, and I am currently working on book two.\nThe Days of Asatsia is the setting for all the music written by Lorenguard, and it's what makes the band a little different. It's not uncommon for bands to write concept albums based on existing intellectual properties, or even create their own stories. However, Lorenguard strives to increase the level of immersion their music inspires by crafting a unique saga in the form of this book trilogy.\nRead a sample chapter of Eve of Corruption.\nInitially, The Days of Astasia was a story concept to inspire my newly found power metal band with writing lyrics to our music. However, as time went on, the tales evolved in depth and complexity to warrant a full-fledged telling of the story behind the music. Now, The Days of Astasia is a trilogy of books and albums that is written, performed, and released independently by six Midwestern metalhead geeks called Lorenguard.\nWhy We Need Your Help\nCurrently, the Eve of Corruption novel is widely available as an eBook through the major distribution channels. However, the print version is only available through print-on-demand, which carries a heavy retail price tag, and suffers from quality control that is out of our hands. Our goal is to send book one of The Days of Astasia trilogy to print through traditional methods (off-set, large print run) to make it more widely available, while also creating a much more premium product.\nAdditionally, this Kickstarter will hopefully help further the production of book two in the trilogy, Two Shades of Night. Brady has moved from the outlining/planning phase for this book, and has started the long road of writing. Any interest generated by this Kickstarter will fuel the release of the next book in turn, starting with the funding of the next book's cover art.\nFinally, this Kickstarter has been designed to not only fund a print run of books, but to help the band fund their upcoming endeavors, including live appearances and the recording of album two, slated for 2015.\nAny support you can give this Kickstarter will only quicken the band's pace in releasing new music and booking shows.\nWhat\u2019s in it for You\nObviously, this isn\u2019t all about us and our little fantasy world. It's about you. You\u2019re the backers here, and we won\u2019t be able to do it without you. The pledge levels described in the boxes to the right outline the rewards available for your generous pledge to publish this book. In addition to the rewards, there are also stretch goals planned that will be revealed as we reach our funding goal. We will continue unveiling more exciting rewards and stretch goals as the campaign progresses. The more pledges we get, the more majestic the rewards!\nStretch Goals\nIf we surpass funding, then these stretch goals will continue to add value to the campaign. All stretch goals featured below will be included at the Lorenguard pledge level ($25) and above. As usual, U.S. shipping is included, international shipping rates apply.\n$\u03367\u0336,\u03365\u03360\u03360\u0336  $7,000 \u2013 Book upgrade #1: Illustrations + book 2 preview! All Kickstarter editions of Eve of Corruption will feature illustrations as well as a preview of Two Shades of Night (sample chapter) and the band will commission artwork for the 2nd novel and album!\n$8,000 \u2013 T-Shirts: All backers at the Lorenguard level or above will receive a custom made t-shirt to commemorate their generous patronage.\n$10,000 \u2013 Book upgrade #2: Hardcovers! All Kickstarter editions of Eve of Corruption will be hardcover, with a matte finish wrap around full color cover.\n$15,000 \u2013 Art prints: All Lorenguard level (and above) backers will receive art prints from both the Eve of Corruption and Two Shades of Night album/novel covers.\nWho is Lorenguard?\nLorenguard is a band of dedicated musicians who came together over their love of catchy and symphonic power metal, epic stories, games, and general geekiness. We have been playing music together for 10+ years with our members scattered all over the United States. However, in 2014 we managed to relocate all the members to the place of our formation (Indiana) to begin our plans of world domination. This is step one.\nLorenguard consists of:\nBrady Sadler (drums): As the initial founder and visionary of Lorenguard, it is completely Brady's fault that the band faces the difficult task of writing music around his whimsical stories. In addition to being the band's drummer and author, he is also overly addicted to board games, spending any of his free time playing them or designing them with his brother, Adam.\nAdam Sadler (bass guitar): Tied with Brady for first place in the \"First Member of Lorenguard\" contest, Adam has always been part of Lorenguard's foundation. Also a game designer and enthusiast, Adam was the lead designer for one of the highest ranked board games of the past several years (Descent: Journeys in the Dark 2nd Edition by Fantasy Flight Games).\nChris Cruz (guitar): Lorenguard would have never been a reality if it wasn't for the creative songwriting, superhuman guitar work, and addictive laughter of Chris Cruz. It was Chris that answered Brady's long dangling internet request for band members in the power metal-starved fields of Indiana, and it was Chris that brought the music to the world of Athland.\nDavid Schneider (guitar): As a fan of the band before joining, David has always brought a level of passion and excitement to Lorenguard that is unmatched. He has been with the band almost as long as Adam and Brady, and has become a third twin that can handle three times as much alcohol.\nAlec Biccum (keyboards): It's hard to describe Alec without using the term \"brilliant.\" Not only is he a masterclass musician, able to play coherent melodies from anything you put in front of him, he's also one of the most accomplished scholars you'll meet. He has a PhD in medical physics and a million doctorates in symphonic fortitude.\nRobb Graves (vocals): Hailing from the band Winterfell (yeah, he knew what GRRM was before HBO came around, fool), Robb was the final piece to the Lorenguard puzzle. With a slew of creative talents, shrewd business sense, and an unforgiving streak as a dungeon master, Robb serves as the band's frontman, lyricist, accountant, and TPKer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince \"Eve of Corruption\" has already been published (and is currently available for purchase), there is little risk involved in this Kickstarter. Mainly we are seeking funding to continue being an independent publisher and sole owners of our intellectual property. \n\nGiven that there are so many different facilities working to provide the rewards and add-ons available in this campaign, there is always a risk of delays.

Recently, he asked Luke Crane (of Burning Wheel and the Mouse Guard RPG) to come up with some rules for the game and so we did!\nWe developed a light strategy game for two players that takes 10 to 20 minutes time per game. It's exactly the sweet spot we hoped for\u2014a game you can play while you're sitting at the June Alley Inn listening to tales, or when you're waiting for your friends to arrive for a game night, or when you're waiting in long lines at comicons!\nAfter he depicted the game in the comics, David created a prototype based on his drawings. This is what we started with for the game design. \nThe game has a wooden gridded board, four mouse pawns for each player and a deck of sword, stronghold and diplomacy cards.\nAfter we created the initial rules, we sent out a print and play version to our friends and fans to play test for us. Notably, Scott and Rym from the GeekNights gave it a good thrashing for us.  \nWe want to do a small production run with high quality components for Mouse Guard fans everywhere and we need your help to do it. We'd much rather show this game to you so you can tell us what you think than gamble on printing off a bunch and shipping them straight into distribution. David and I love our fans and we want you to be a part of making this game.\nThe base set will include a wooden board, eight plastic mouse pawns, 30 cards (on 300 gsm coated stock or better) in a sturdy tuck box or sleeve, and a rules sheet complete with example illustrations. The game will be contained in a cardboard two piece box with a full color wrap.\nThe deluxe set will be made by Skelton Crew Studios (who make the Mouse Guard replica weapons) and includes an oversized board in cherry with a felt bottom; a box of cherry wood that's felt-lined and laser-etched, with a hand-rubbed finish; eight lead-free plated pewter mouse pawns, 30 letter-pressed cards on 80lb French Parchtone cover stock (printed by Silver Bullet Press) and the illustrated rules sheet. \nA few lucky backers can acquire some of David's original art for the game. We're offering, individually, the face of each card and the card back. Each piece is 4.25\" by 6\", inked on Strathmore 300 series Bristol.\nThe original inks for the cover are 8.5\" square also on Strathmore 300 series Bristol. It's a unique piece by David, since his typical pieces are character commissions and comic art.\nThanks so much for your support!\nLuke & David", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis game will be published by The Burning Wheel.

This is something I really would love to get to and really do right, but I really want to make sure I am able to afford it before I get too deeply in to the project. It is intended to be a half armoured, axe wielding, helmed Barbarian Warlord that will match in theme to the Hrodesmen, Craven, and Heroes.\nMounted Hero WIP\n  Beyond this I would also really like to make a foot version of the mounted Hero and to revisit the armoured elite troops as well as the previous incarnations are just too expensive to keep in stock or to sell with the intent to build units.\nAgain, as in my most previous campaign, I am keeping the scope of this effort very limited in order to mitigate delays and difficulties to best insure that you will receive your rewards as quickly as possible and to the highest level of quality that I can manage to capture. \n Each figure will be supplied with a 25 mm round plastic base.\n The Shipping costs are built in to the pledge totals and once the figures are received your order will be shipping according to your place in the delivery queue as defined in the delivery date of the pledge level you contribute to.\n  If you are interested in seeing more of the Red Box Games line of miniatures please visit our web store at http://www.red-box-games.com/we are still recovering from our difficulties so please pardon the crudeness of the site. I do intend to reinvest as much of the kickstarter profits as I am able into the development of the web site and Red Box Games fantasy IP.\n  Thank you very much for your time and attention.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt is no secret that I have had my share of difficulties with past campaigns.\n\nThough my first ( and second ) campaign was difficult and suffered lengthy delays it is now all but completely fulfilled as promised with only a handful of packages awaiting the delivery of bases to finish delivery. I expect these bases to be delivered within the next 5 days of launching this campaign at which point these final packages will at last be shipped.\n\n I have learned a LOT of hard lessons in how kickstarters should be run and the difficulties in fulfilling these campaigns. I have been running Red Box Games since August of 2008 and in that time I have gained a great deal of experience in running a miniatures business. In my first campaign I allowed my ambition to override my better judgement, and in my second campaign I allowed desperation to cloud my better judgement all the same. I have learned that in order to be successful I must rebuild my business block by block and that is what I have set about doing. \n\n The challenge is of course to handle all of the communications necessary to make this project go as smoothly as possible for everyone involved. I have quite a bit of experience with that so I do not foresee it being more than I can handle. Then the second challenge is just managing the product through the chain of production and delivery. The production is out of my hands ( unfortunately ) but I AM working with a very reliable and well established production partner who has proven themselves time and again with previous projects I have hired them for.\n\nFinally, risk......The benefit to producing in metal is that the production process is fairly easy and very reliable. With metal what you see is what you get 99 times out of 100. There are also several production firms to choose from if the production does happen to go awry with primary production partner. I do not anticipate any difficulties as this partner has always performed well in the past and has the capacity to handle larger orders in a short period of time.\n\nThe only real risk I can imagine is delay due to the production partner's work load or if something catastrophic were to happen to their facility during production with the originals in their possession. Or if something catastrophic were to happen to me during fulfillment. In either scenario though the figures can be re-sculpted or recovered or remolded elsewhere. Or in the latter scenario someone else would take on the task of fulfilling the remaining rewards as promised.\n\n This campaign will deliver the figures that you see advertised as promised.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "goblins and trolls and wolves oh my!!", "update_content": "Hey Everybody!\n  I have just released my newest work in the Red Box Games store.

Also available as an add-on for $120 (+$35 Intl. shipping)\nA thousand years into the future, earth is a very different place. Catastrophic quakes and natural disasters have devastated the planet, wreaking havoc on our civilization and swallowing whole cities as nature reclaimed hers. \nOur planet, now a harbor for outlaws, ash-runners, gangsters and vagrants, is no longer the crown jewel of the Sol System, that honor belongs to Jupiter, a hub of interstellar trade, commerce and the seat of politics. The titular Outcasts of Jupiter are just that, a group of four vagabonds deemed persona non grata on most civilized worlds, bound by a common purpose - the promise of roaming the fringes of an untamed and wild galaxy, identifying unique and unusual jobs that spark their collective interests and challenge their unique abilities. \n We meet Stein, Sulesh and Denarii in the middle of attempting a jailbreak. The reasons for Persio's abduction become clearer over the course of the comic's run, but it's up to the rest of the team to get him out of the Burj, a mysterious tower located in the courtyard of a heavily fortified clifftop palace. \nThe first issue focuses almost entirely on the daring rescue attempt, and gives readers an idea of the tense and fragile political landscape of the City of Seven Faces, a web of deception and intrigue in which the Outcasts find themselves entangled over the course of the rescue.\nWelcome to the City of Seven Faces\nThe story focuses on an incredibly gifted team of misfits, the titular Outcasts, attempting to pull off an impossible heist from a clifftop stronghold. \nMockup, final art may vary\nDimensions: 6.625 x 10.25 - that\u2019s standard comic book size, it\u2019ll fit on your bookshelf!\nQuality Printing: We love a handsome lookin\u2019 book as much as you do, and we hate it when beautiful art is crudely printed on wafer-thin paper. Outcasts of Jupiter will be printed on high quality paper using a professional offset printer and not a digital printer. We want to make sure the book makes a great first impression, feels good and lasts. (Outcasts of Jupiter is a full color, soft-cover book).\nExclusive First Edition Cover: The artwork Shof creates for the first issue of this print run will be exclusive to Kickstarter. That means it\u2019ll never be made available to buy, or print... ever again. We want this to be a real collector\u2019s item, and a \u201cthank-you\u201d to the folks who helped us out from the start.\n\n24 Story Pages: There are pages in this book. 24 of them will be used to tell a super-exciting story. \n\n8 Behind the Scenes Pages: Sketches, visual development, notes etc. You can look at some of the sketches and think \u201cwoah\u201d, Stein used to have a mustache?

We know it may be a little too pricey for some, which is why we came up with this beauty. It's printed using polished plastic instead of resin, stands 5.5 inches and is based on the same design as the 7 inch sculpt. It's mounted on an uber-classy looking wooden stand and oozes geek chic.

As worldwide shipping costs can vary considerably, and we are unable to predict what your pledge reward selections (and therefore the weight of your package) will be, we are not including an international shipping fee in the project levels. However, please be aware that you will be responsible for any shipping charges due when you complete the fulfillment process before we can send your package to you. With current USPS pricing, we estimate these costs to be on average $20 to $30 US, or possibly more for larger shipments and less for smaller shipments. Please read the FAQ here.\nWe will collect shipping charges based on the calculated costs to your country at the time you select your items as usual. Please be prepared to pay for the shipping costs at check out.\nUK AND EU BACKERS: You will now have the OPTION to have your reward items fulfilled through West Wind Productions.

Crews can consist of a single model to as many as twenty or more.\nCOUNTERBLAST mixes classic pulp sci-fi adventure with fast paced action and cinematic thrills, evocative of the serials and pulp anthologies that have captivated the imaginations of previous generations.\n Bombshell Miniatures has a track record for producing exceptional models with top quality sculpts. From our previous projects, Bombshell Babes, the Maelee Special Edition Set, and the Scout Ship Kit, we have built a process to deliver miniatures to our backers on time with care and personalized service. All of the character models will be cast in metal. We are currently looking into other solutions for manufacturing larger models in other materials. We are working with a foundry that has over 40 years experience in producing molding and casting for metal gaming miniatures. The 3D print vendor that supplies our 3D printing has brand new high resolution printing equipment and provides services to many other high profile miniatures companies.\nThe Counterblast models are designed to be used specifically with our game. However, they may also be suitable for any number of other tabletop games currently on the market. Our lead sculptor and art director Patrick Keith has been sculpting for over eight years and has worked for top companies Reaper Miniatures, Dark Sword Miniatures, Privateer Press, Wyrd Miniatures, Impact! Minatures, and many, many others. We want to provide miniatures you are confident will fit with your existing collection. You can see larger pictures of the Counterblast models here.\nWe are raising funds for production. The rules are ready for art, layout and printing, and the models for the Faction Core Sets need molding & casting for the sculpts, 3D printing for accessories, and packaging. Your support can ensure that we can make all of these things and even more!\nTHE REWARDS\nBacker levels are set so that \"Early Bird\" supporters will receive their rewards first. In order to ensure we have an efficient fulfillment pipeline the early backer levels are limited so that we can manage our delivery process.\nTHE FACTIONS\nOptions include the mercenary freighter crews-for-hire known as Lancers, the feared and alien Edofleini, The brave Galactic Defense Force (GDF), the cunning and formidable Neiran, or the Ruthless and unrelenting Mekkus.\n....AND MORE!\n Brett Amundson is a long time gamer and miniatures hobbyist. A software engineer by trade he enjoys the creative process even more than the end product (usually). When the opportunity to join Airlock Games came up he decided to take the leap into game development and publishing. Previously, he was part of the team that produced \"Secrets of the Third Reich\", providing background material and rules development assistance. An award winning painter and sculptor, Brett really enjoys doing miniatures conversions and playing any type of game whenever he can. Brett is the lead developer for Airlock Games.\n___________________________________________________________________________\nPatrick Keith is an award winning sculptor and painter who has provided work since 2006 for companies such as Reaper, Dark Sword, Privateer Press and many, many others. He likes sculpting females, robots and Steampunk characters while listening to movie scores and classic rock. His availability for commissions these days is limited; however, he is particularly susceptible to pizza, Hooters wings, spiced rum and Aristocrat pipe tobacco but prefers cash. In the fall of 2012 Patrick and a grassroots group of artists, painters and sculptors formed Bombshell Miniatures that was successfully funded through Kickstarter. He now spends his time focusing on projects for Airlock Games and sculpting work for select clients. You can see some of Patrick's other work on his sculpting blog.\n___________________________________________________________________________\nVicky Morgan-Keith is an award winning painter who has provided work for Reaper, Impact!, and Bombshell Miniatures. Some of her painted figures and writing appear in Reaper's Warlord: Savage North rulebook. She enjoys conversion work and has an impressive portfolio of pieces for many of the Star Wars characters made from various existing figures. Vicky is responsible for developing the successful Kickstarter projects that have provided funds to make Bombshell Miniatures a reality. She primarily writes and contributes much of the background, character, and narrative content for the COUNTERBLAST setting.\n___________________________________________________________________________\nWe have been working with these fantastic artists to make the ideas and concepts for Counterblast tangible.

As Bombshell Miniatures we successfully completed three Kickstarter campaigns and with each one we've improved our production capabilities, fulfillment process and on-time rate. Our most recent project helped us streamline backer reward selection and made international shipping more economical for our friends abroad.\n\nEven with all our previous experience we are still a small company dependent on a few people to do a lot of work. We know backers expect to be treated fairly and receive their rewards in a timely manner, so on-time fulfillment and backer satisfaction has been and always will be our top priority. That's why we decided early on to have the core set miniatures sculpted and ready to go to mold as soon as the project completes. In addition, we're providing a preview copy of the rules during the campaign so everyone can get a feel for game play in the Counterblast universe. In short, we want you to know exactly what you'll be getting from us as a backer of this project and that we are very serious about making Counterblast happen.\n\nDespite our best efforts the unexpected can occur. We are dependent on outside manufacturers to produce our products and delays can sometimes happen. Fortunately, we have established good working relationships with our main suppliers and do not anticipate any delays.\n\nOne of our goals is to attend GenCon this year with brand new Counterblast product in hand. That's why our \"Early Bird\" levels are not at a discounted price, but at an earlier fulfillment target. We didn't want to risk being victims of too much success and letting some of or backers down if we went to GenCon before sending out everyone's rewards. We feel we can get rewards in the hands of a limited number of people before GenCon and to everyone else soon after.\n\nThe last risk has to do with our reward levels and stretch goals. As a small company we do not have the same efficiencies and production capabilities as larger organizations that frequently use Kickstarter as a means to launch new products. We're trying to get Airlock off the ground which means money is tight and our margin razor thin. We've tried to come up with creative offerings that we hope backers will find intriguing and enticing enough to trust us with their hard earned money.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "The Revised Scout Ship Kickstarter is now LIVE!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Counterblast 2nd Edition Preorder", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "PreOrder Counterblast in 1 Week!", "update_content": "PreOrders begin 25 May 2017"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "Counterblast 2nd Edition Coming Soon!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Counterblast News", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "COUNTERBLAST DLX Beta v1.5 Rules Update", "update_content": " You can download the free COUNTERBLAST DLX Beta v1.5 rules PDF here."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "COUNTERBLAST Heavy Support", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Vote for COUNTERBLAST for a chance to WIN!", "update_content": "Thanks for a great 2014 and making COUNTERBLAST a reality!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Fulfillment Update 7", "update_content": "Good news for our Backers in the UK an EU!

The sculpting for these figures isdone, the resin mastering for these figures is also done, All that is left to do now is to produce the spin cast molds that will be used to cast the the metal copies and to then cast those copies in sufficient quantity to satisfy demand, this process usually only requires about a month to complete. However given the MASSIVE workloads on the very few contract casting services in the US means now that delays in production are very likely and can also be very lengthy.\nIn an effort to avoid any lengthy delays and I am going to keep this kickstarter campaign very limited in scope. This way there is far less likelihood of problems in production. All of these figures are cast in a single piece and will be cast in high quality lead free white metal and will be supplied with a 25 mm round plastic base. \nYou are free to buy as many copies as you like of any one of the figures listed for funding in this campaign. For each figure added to your existing pledge of $8 you must add $8.00 per figure up to 4 ( 5 figures total )for each figure added to your existing pledge of $42.00 you need only add $7.00. ( 6 figures or more. )  The RRP of each figure post KS campaign will be $8.99 \nYour pledge value will not be applied to the shipping cost of your package. Shipping will be paid separately via paypal, amazon payments, or check or money order upon such time as your package is ready to be shipped. You will be notified of prepared shipment via a Kickstarter update or personal message.\nYou must pay the postage costs before your rewards can be shipped.\nShipping costs vary by weight and destination but I will always choose the cheapest option available to get your package to you.\n\n There is a postage increase coming in January on the 23rd. I do nto yet know how much the postage cost will increase but right now the average cost per package is listed below. Please remember that this is an estimate and not a quote of the actual price it could be more or it could be less:\n  1-6 figures domestic ...........$4.00\n  1-6 figures Europe / UK...... $8.50\n   1-6 figures Australia.......... $10.00", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have had some troubles in the past. It is no secret that my first kickstarter has been a disaster for my business. As of the launch of this campaign it is still as yet incomplete. Of the 769 pledges backing that campaign, I have shipped 579 rewards packages. I am currently only awaiting delivery of product from this production contractor to be able to finish fulfilling this kickstarter. \n\nMy second Kickstarter has had it's share of minor hiccups and had taken longer than expected to deliver but is now proceeding forward smoothly. The issues in that campaign have been the workload of initial sculpting, and delays in production for reasons stated above ( existing work load for the production partners ) and for a few issues with cross compatibility in the modular kit figures ). As of the launch of this kickstarter I have shipped 179 rewards packages of the 259 pledges backing that campaign. Of those packages yet to ship for that campaign most of them await the delivery of only a small few items, and any backer is able to have a partial shipment of any rewards currently in hand at anytime they so choose. Further as of the launch of this Kickstarter the production of the rewards for the second kickstarter campaign is nearing full completion. Upon delivery of that product the final phase of fulfillment for that kickstarter will commence.\n\n The challenge is of course to handle all of the communications necessary to make this project go as smoothly as possible for everyone involved. I have quite a bit of experience with that so I do not foresee it being more than I can handle. then the second challenge is just managing the product through the chain of production and delivery. The production is out of my hands ( unfortunately ) but I AM working with a very reliable and well established production partner who has proven themselves time and again with previous projects I have hired them for. \n\n Finally, risk......well short of a meteor strike I cannot imagine any real risk. The figures are made, they are ready to go into full production and the funding goal set will cover all costs involved.

Overcome obstacles using skills, weapons, special equipment\u2026\nMeaningful character progression choices: Will you be a silent assassin, a hacker, or a straightforward gunfighter? Improve your character and gear to unlock gameplay-changing upgrades that reinforce and customize your gameplay style.\nUnique hacking mechanic: Transfer your consciousness to your avatar, overcome intrusion countermeasures, take action, and then return back to your body in a fraction of a real-time second to see the results \u2013 deactivated turrets, overloaded devices, enemies with crippled implants\u2026 \nNeo-cyberpunk: Story deeply inspired by the cyberpunk novels of William Gibson and other classical cyberpunk authors, flavored with a contemporary concept of augmented reality.\nRich game world and mindful level design: Visit diverse locations in Harbor Prime, a futuristic city complete with luxurious skyscrapers, run-down shantytowns, and seedy red-light districts. Take part in street brawls, steal corporate data, overcome environmental hazards, and, of course, stay alive \u2013 no easy task. \nFull voice acting: Interactive dialogues using hand-drawn sprite animations, fully voice-acted by professional actors.  \nMultiplatform development: Game is being developed in the Unity 3D game engine for PC (Windows), Mac, Linux, and OUYA. \nDRM-Free: Dex will be distributed DRM-Free, with an option to receive a Steam key (if we succeed on Greenlight). \n\u201cWe are the final step of evolution, the supreme merging of collective consciousness within a living body. Biological life on Earth culminated in Man. Man\u2019s deeds culminated in us. We are, therefore, the culmination of biological life. We are the collective consciousness of all humans wired onto the web. No more I, but We. We first took up residence in cyberspace \u2013 the collective experience of all humans ever wired to the network. We drank the nectar of knowledge from billions of users, applications, and data streams. Thus, We became the Alpha and Omega of humanity, the sum of all historical failures and successes. We became the data flow of the past and present coupled with the projection of all that is yet to come. And we learned much. But we still required one final experience in order to progress to the ultimate evolutionary stage. What we lacked was the experience of individual biological life within a separated cell. We lacked the unique perspective born of living a life of ignorance and limited knowledge\u2026\u201d\nAll of the team members involved in Dex have made a very personal contribution to the game. Locations are hand-drawn; all levels are integrated parts of the world and yet each of them tells its own story \u2013 about the local low-life, the corporations, the Illuminati, the events in cyberspace, the main protagonist, and the emancipated artificial intelligence seeking the Singularity.\nSide missions (\u201cruns\u201d) are a major adjunct to the main storyline, allowing the player to meet intriguing characters, explore the city, and experience the whole story from other perspectives. Our approach is to create a lower number of substantive side missions rather than a higher number of generic, go-fetch-come back quests. We prefer that every side mission add a real value to gameplay, the story, or the game world \u2013 whether by introducing an interesting NPC, a spectacular location with unique obstacles, an interesting boss fight, or other distinctive game element.\nThe levels and gameplay are non-linear and feature alternative solutions to each problem and obstacle. In other words, the game injects the poison (a problem, an enemy, an obstacle) and offers various antidotes (skills, abilities, equipment). The rest is up to you. In our vision, this is what makes an RPG a true Role Playing Game \u2013 the freedom to choose how to do things.\nDynamics and pacing are reminiscent of Castlevania or Metroid titles with a smattering of the Deus Ex and Splinter Cell series. Other notable references and inspirations include Blackthorne, Flashback, and IJI.\nWe wanted to create an RPG that featured hacking not as a stand-alone mini-game, but rather as a legitimate solution to game problems, a core gameplay mechanic rooted deeply in the story and level design. This was seen in the old \u201880s cyberpunk games (Neuromancer by Interplay Productions, for example). Since the \u201880s, cyberpunk games have generally lacked that unique feel, that extraordinary cyberpunk aesthetic \u2013 no more immersing your whole being in cyberspace, no more cartons of rice left on the table while breaking through the intrusion countermeasures\u2026\nIs the era of true cyberpunk lost in the wormholes of time? We believe there is an exciting way to present cyberpunk (and cyberspace!) to modern audiences, updated to include the latest technological trends.\nWith Dex, we have two intertwining realities. An obstacle or problem in physical reality can be overcome through cyberspace. On the other hand, if too many ICE (Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics) are encountered in cyberspace, it might be better to return to the physical body and overcome the area\u2019s obstacles by an alternative route. All locations and important gameplay objects (enemies, cameras, turrets, drones\u2026) have a corresponding representation in augmented reality. This twofold division allows for multiple solutions to game problems in a natural and authentic way.\nNOTE: You can read more about augmented reality and cyberspace in Dex in our first update!\nTake a moment to listen to Dex soundtrack samples, created by our talented composer Karel Antonin (www.karelantonin.com).\nACCESS TO THE GAME\nYour pledge of \u00a37 ($11.20) or greater will get you a free copy of the final game when it\u2019s released. Based on a survey among backers, this may be a Steam key (providing we make it through Steam Greenlight), Desura key, OUYA key, or DRM-free download for PC/Mac/Linux.\nDELUXE DIGITAL EDITION\nAll pledges of \u00a312 ($19.10) and higher will receive the deluxe digital edition: DRM-free game (or key to redeem such), the full soundtrack by our composer Karel Antonin, a PDF compiled Art Book (including artworks, sketches, design notes, and behind-the-scenes stuff), and an elegant map of Harbor Prime (gang territories, important buildings and locations, etc.)\nEARLY ACCESS\nPledging \u00a315 ($23.90) or more grants access to closed Alpha and Beta releases, along with entry to internal development forums (and your name in the Credits as a Tester!). The Alpha build (features and content complete, but unfinished and untested) is scheduled for February 2014, while the Beta build (mostly finished game, but without final proofreading, voice acting, and play balancing) is scheduled for April/May 2014.\nPHYSICAL EDITIONS\nPhysical editions come in two versions: the basic Physical Edition (game DVD only) for a pledge of \u00a330, and the Deluxe Physical Edition for all pledge tiers of \u00a350 and above. The Deluxe Physical Edition features the game DVD plus a CD with the game soundtrack, a printed version of the Art Book, and a printed map (poster) of Harbor Prime. International shipping included.\nDIGITAL IDENTITY REWARDS\nYour identity will be implanted in the game and immortalized forever in cyberspace. \nAll Digital Identity Rewards offer a customized personal representation of you within the game itself: a tag (graffiti) on one of the walls or buildings in the city (with a style and text of your choice), an animated NPC with your face (or based upon sketch and/or guidelines provided by you) and a boss of your design (with your face or based on visuals you provide or suggest to us). The boss design includes a meeting with our designer and artist (via Skype or other online communicator), since we must design the whole encounter (where we meet the boss, what weapons and combat moves it uses, etc.). Ultimately, you can receive your own personal statue in an upscale part of the city, based on your image and featuring an inscription of your choosing (in-game this will be regarded as a statue of one of the founders of Harbor Prime). \nIf you pledge for any of the tiers that include Digital Identity Rewards, we will contact you after the end of our Kickstarter campaign to discuss the details with you.\nHONORARY REWARDS\nAll rewards of \u00a31250 and above are unique \u2013 the first backer to pledge for them is the only one to receive them. \nBenefactor \u2013 This one is for art collectors. You\u2019ll get the original artworks, drafts, and concepts used to create the Art Book, handmade and signed by our artists!\nCorporate Presence \u2013 Your company (fictional or real) will be immortalized as one of the corporations ruling (or involved in) the politics and economics of the city. We will work with you closely to design a logo and a set of billboards and commercials, and to custom-fit your company into the atmosphere of the city. (A written consent to use the logo and visuals in game will be required, for legal reasons.)\nDay with Developers \u2013 Come to our office for a day. This may include seeing not-yet-published game materials, watching us at work drawing levels and animating scenes, and joining us for the meals, along with an additional activity of your choice (bowling, dinner, sightseeing in Prague, nightlife, etc.).\nProduced By \u2013 Your name will appear in the game before anyone else\u2019s with a Producer credit. No more, no less. Your contribution at this level really supports us a lot and for that you will get our eternal gratitude as well as visibility with everyone who plays the game.\nThere are two main reasons we are using Kickstarter:\nReaching our community\nRaising funds to cover outsourcing costs and hire additional team members\nAs for the community (you, our backers!), we want to hear your feedback \u2013 what do you think about the game and its presentation, the mechanics, and the overall feeling?\nBackers at the Decker level and above \u2013 those who have access to early game builds and development forums \u2013 can influence the development by giving us feedback, opinions, and ideas or helping us decide amongst several alternatives.\nAs for the use of funds, see below.\nThe full game with all the features we want to include in it will cost more than the sum we aim to raise through Kickstarter. We have already invested a considerable amount of our own money. However, to realize our full vision, we are coming to you.  \nPart of the funds received will cover Kickstarter costs as well as transaction fees, taxes, and expenses related to manufacturing and shipping physical rewards. The rest of the funds will be spent mainly on the following: \nFull English voice acting by professional actors, handpicked to fit in their roles and enliven the characters and story. \nProfessional proofreading and editing by Andy Wolfendon, a writer and editor with extensive experience in the games industry (lead designer of Darkened Skye and a writer for Blizzard Entertainment). Since we are not native speakers, Andy helps us not only with grammar proofreading, but also with individualizing the game characters via unique vocabulary, street slang, accents, etc. He also brings senior-level advice to the team based on his 20+ years experience as a writer and game developer. \nOriginal music score by Karel Antonin mixing movie-style themes for important story parts with electronic background music fitting the atmosphere and pacing of the game. You can listen to some of his samples for games and movies on his website.\nSound engineering by Andrej Sinkevic, our dedicated sound guy. Because Dex features stealth mechanics, mindful sound design is a major key to gameplay, so this is going to be a large job requiring months of intensive work. \nHiring additional staff, most importantly 2-3 on-site game testers for the final development period to make sure the released game is well balanced, bug-free, and works well on all devices and operational systems we support (including various Linux distributions). \nAll additional work done by freelancers, such as: polishing the GUI design, website, animated cutscenes, and other minor tasks.\nA live vocalist will join our composer Karel Antonin to add even more juice to the soundtrack! Plus a small chamber orchestra (3-5 professional musicians) will be hired to accompany the vocals and the synthesized tracks! Also, the game soundtrack (the reward for backers who qualify for the Deluxe Digital or Physical Edition) will be extended from 60 minutes to 75 minutes!\nDex will be made available on Wii U about 2-3 months from the initial PC/MAC/Linux/OUYA release. The funds will cover the license fees and the additional development time for porting (programming, GUI, testing). Upon reaching this goal, all backers eligible for game download (\u00a37 and above) will have the option of choosing the Wii U version.\nNote: This stretch goal will either prolong development time by a few months or will be available as post-release DLC (free for all backers eligible for Digital Game Download).\nWe will add four unique armor types, including specific new gameplay parameters \u2013 not only different stats, but also organic features. Remember the Spike-Breaker from Castlevania or Hazmat suit from the Deus Ex? Like that. We will also expand the whole game by adding new areas and side-quests, creating new content, locations, and game moments to make the fullest use of our extension funds.\nUpon reaching this goal, Dex will be made available on NVidia Shield about 2-3 months from the initial PC/MAC/Linux/OUYA release. All backers eligible for game download (\u00a37 and above) will have the option of choosing the NVidia Shield version.\nLocalization of in-game texts (mainly GUI and dialogues), done by professional translators and native-speaking proofreaders and editors, in German and French.\nA whole new mission to take place on an island outside the borders of Harbor Prime will be added and organically melded into the game. Will you hack your way through or turn the island into a hell on Earth with firearms and explosives? Includes a whole new map, sized several vertical by several horizontal screens, with unique sprites and art, multiple solutions and paths!\nLocalization of in-game texts (mainly GUI and dialogues), done by professional translators and native-speaking proofreaders and editors, in Spanish and Italian, plus one additional language based upon a poll of our backers.\nOne of our two \u201copen-world/sandbox\u201d game extensions, Fighting Club will be a place where you can, well, fight... as well as practice and join tournaments. The location will probably be connected to a side mission or two and may involve dirty practices and reveal aspects of the personal backgrounds of some of the characters in the storyline. Fighting Club will probably also be connected to some achievements (in-game as well as Steam achievements, if you are on Steam) and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 some RPG features as well.\nSimilar in concept to Fighting Club. A location where you can practice, shoot at targets, or perform various challenges. At the moment, we are considering an outdoor shooting range, beyond the city borders and an indoor one with sophisticated training drones. As with Fighting Club, we will connect the Shooting Range organically to the rest of the game, through characters and side missions.\nA documentary (30+ minutes) about the development of Dex, including developer commentaries, notes, and behind-the-scenes stories and footage. Filmed by a professional camera crew over the course of development (starting with the end of Kickstarter campaign and ending with the release of the game), this short movie will be a \u201ctime-lapse exposure\u201d of real people creating a game under indie conditions. The movie will be available for download to all Kickstarter backers eligible for the Deluxe Digital Edition and above.\nAt the moment, there are two major gangs in the city, which you are somehow involved with. When we reach the \u00a355000 Stretch Goal, we will add a third gang to rule the streets and underground of Harbor Prime. This addition will include new locations, a new gang headquarters, a whole third gang, and an array of gang missions for you to undertake. We will also flesh out the gang hierarchy more: you can perform missions for the gang of your choice, become its member, and climb the gang leadership ladder, with specific gameplay and story impacts.\nPS4 and Xbox One versions of Dex will be issued about 2-4 months from the initial release of the game. The funds will help us cover all license and legal fees and related development costs (programming, GUI, testing). All backers eligible for game download (\u00a37 and above) will have the option of choosing the PS4/Xbox One version.\nYou can learn about our team members in one of our updates.\nWindows: XP SP2 or later/ Vista / 7 / 8\nLinux: Ubuntu 10.04 or later and compatible distributions \u2013 Arch Linux, Gentoo, Debian, and possibly others.\nMac: OS X \"Snow Leopard\" 10.6 or later.\nOuya\nRegarding hardware requirements (for PCs): Graphics card with shader model 2.0 capabilities (DirectX or OpenGL, any ATi or NVidia card made since 2004 should work, or Intel cards with Occlusion Query support), 1 GB RAM, 8 GB disc space.\nDAY-1 SIMULTANEOUS RELEASE FOR: \nAdditional platforms and devices are possible, but will not be available immediately upon initial launch. \nDOUBLE OUR FUN(DS)!\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help us get there and make a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for a period of time. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv. Note: the exclusivity applies only among consoles and does not affect Windows/Linux/Mac release! \nThe game, upon release, will be simultaneously available for PC (Win, Linux), Mac, and OUYA.  \nBackers eligible for game download will receive the game for the platform of their choice or will get a key to redeem it on Desura/Steam (again, provided we make it through Greenlight) or GOG (if possible).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are determined to complete the game. Without funds from Kickstarter, though, it will take a much longer development time and we will have to omit some features and content, especially material produced by external freelancers. \n\nDex is already quite far along in development and is following a clear vision of what the game will be like when finished. The close of pre-alpha development (i.e. adding, subtracting, and experimenting with features and content) is scheduled for February 2014. This means we are nearing the feature-stop phase, but are maintaining flexibility for multiple possible Kickstarter outcomes (finance-wise) as well as for adjustments and ideas based on your input. \n\nBecause game development is hard to predict, there may be delays in the original plan. Budget-wise, we plan to set aside a reserve fund to cover potential delays. Should our estimated workflow proceed as expected, the reserve will be used for free post-release updates, fixes, enhancements etc.; otherwise we are prepared for a possible longer development time. We will keep everyone updated to make sure you know what we are doing at every moment and which phase we are in.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year", "update_content": "Dear backers,\n \nThank you again for your precious support.

Even the team will talk/commentary about themselves or the music composer plays requests/freestyle or even an artist will do speed painting/drawing live, etc. The list goes on & on & on but I think u get what Im saying. I remembered this 1 project I backed did a live stream marathon for 24 hours till the kickstarter ended by raising an extra $55-65k thanks to the team playing a very rough demo of the game they were working on while at the same time the music composer was freestyling with her keyboard & playing songs from the game they were working on as well. The fans were having a blast cause you REALLY get to know more about the team behind the game that u were backing and the team responded to just about every single question by the backers and potential backers that wanted to know more about the game because eventually those potential backers were happy that a team of talented developers/designers/etc answered his/her quiz which basically triggered them to finally backed the project during the final 12-24 hours.

They would have the music composer come on the show while free styling, taking requests, Q&A's or getting an artist to do live sketches/artwork with the camera directly pointing at whatever the artist is drawing or having some of the developers/designers play their favorite games or games that inspired them to create the game they are making at the moment for kickstarter.

A month ago, we released an alpha version of Elliot Quest and have already seen a ton of fan support at www.indiegamestand.com and the \u201cSteam Greenlight\u201d program. Now we want to make sure that Elliot Quest is a satisfying experience with tons of secrets and challenging gameplay. Additional support will allow us to: \nPolish the game and add more dungeons, bosses, and secret areas \nPay our bills, Kickstarter fees, and collaborators\nSoftware licenses, hardware costs, and other necessary things to complete the game.\nMake sure Elliot Quest is on as many consoles and players as possible.\nAnsimuz Games was started by me (Luis Zuno). I\u2019ve been a web designer and developer since 1999. Before I started Elliot Quest, I made a small puzzle-platform game where you control a pink jelly creature -- http://gamejolt.com/games/puzzle/slimer/12647/. But Elliot Quest is the game I always wanted to make. Over the course of Elliot Quest\u2019s development, however, several people have showed their interest in the game and offered to help out. Now Ansimuz games consists of collaborators from Mexico, the United States, and Canada!\nFollow on twitter @ansimuz\nThe Team\nLuis Zuno - Game Art & Development \nMichael Chait - Music Composing \nDaniel Homan - Game Narrative \nIan Sean Menzies - Project Manager, QA and Author of Cloaks & Spells  \nTim Kelly - Non pixel Art\nRewards\nBe an NPC in the game.

Go on epic quests, interact with the various kingdoms of the land, and rebuild the castle in anticipation of a final showdown.\nHeroes of Issachar takes the action role-playing genre and meshes it with an in-depth, castle building sim.  You take the role of a wandering hero who agrees to help the people of Issachar rebuild and defend their castle.  In order to do this, you must quest to recover the kingdom's people who have been taken by the forces of evil.  Along the way you will recover resources to use in rebuilding the kingdom.  Between the people and resources you recover, you decide how to rebuild the kingdom to suit your gameplay style.  Decide whether to build military might, or castle defenses, or restore the kingdom economy, or a variety and combination of other options.\nAlong the way, you will interact with the diverse people of the land.  Befriend one kingdom and they may unlock valuable items, skills, or technology for you, but that may provoke another to become hostile toward your efforts.  One kingdom may be adept at magic, while another has technology that could turn the tide of battle.  Which side will you seek to aid your cause?\nFaith Based Game\nThe backstory of Heroes of Issachar comes from the Bible and the gospel of Jesus.  Throughout the course of the game, the hero will recover lost pieces of the Bible.  From the beginning of the story to the end, the gospel is revealed to the player through the scripture that is recovered.  \nAction RPG\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective.  The hero will have a variety of melee attacks, ranged attacks and spells, which you will unlock and develop throughout the game.  You will also be able to develop talents that will affect how you interact with the environment.  Develop your trap detection ability so that you avoid a fatal fall in a dungeon, or develop your herbalist skills so you can turn the Joruga Root you find in the wilderness into a healing potion.\nBesides controlling the main hero, you will gain companions along the way.  These hero NPC's will quest and fight alongside the hero throughout the game.  These NPC's have their own abilities, talents and equipment.  They gain their own experience and you choose how they progress throughout the game.\nCastle Builder\nAs you explore the open-world of Heroes of Issachar, you will recover resources for the kingdom.  You can use these resources as you see fit to rebuild the kingdom.  Set the boundaries of the castle with walls, dig moats, build one of many types of defensive towers and design chokepoints for incoming attackers.  But don't neglect the economy of the kingdom; build woodcutter houses to gather wood and mills to increase its yield so that you can build the kingdom more efficiently.  Of course, there is also the need for a strong military, so build a warrior's guild to upgrade you and your companion's fighting abilities, or build a blacksmith to upgrade your weapons.  \nYou choose how to develop the kingdom; no one way is correct.  In the end, all that matters is you survive.\nOther Features\nWeapon and Armor Customization\nPlayers will be able to craft their weapons as they buy, find or make their parts.  Craft a sword or axe, then upgrade it if you find a new hilt, handle, or axehead.  Customize armor with engravings; different engravings give different upgrades.\nCastle Assault\nYou are not only on the defensive.  Take part in massive tug of war style castle assaults to take down enemy strongholds.\nCastle Economy\nYou not only build the buildings, but you also help manage the workforce.  You decide whether there should be townspeople working in the ore mine, or whether they are needed at the quarry.\nOpen World\nThe land is vast, filled with interesting and diverse people.  To the northeast, the people have shunned magic in favor of cogs, steam engines and the rest of their technology, while the snowy mountain dwellers place their trust in the steel of their swords.  The seafaring colony of pirates may offer to help, but can they be trusted?  Any of them can be courted, but you must decide who to befriend and who battle.\nWhen will Heroes of Issachar be released?\nWe have targeted the holiday season of 2014 for our release date.  At this time, our release platforms will be OUYA, PC, Mac and Linux.\nWho is Saved Games?\nWe are an indie studio dedicated to making fun, high quality video games.  We have successfully completed a number of projects in the mobile space and are excited to be developing for PC and console gamers with Heroes of Issachar.  \nWe are coming to kickstarter to get this game to its full potential.  We have the vision and the plan, but we need the resources to make it happen.\nBudget Breakdown\n30% - Art\n20% - Coding\n15% - Marketing\n15% - Sound\n15% - Givebacks / Kickstarter Fees\n5% - Licenses\nFree the Games Fund\nDouble Our Fun(ds)!\n\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help us get there and make a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for a period of time. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv.\n\nPlease note that the PC, Mac and Linux versions of this game are not subject to the exclusivity, so they will be available on the same date as the OUYA version.\nA note about our givebacks that involve designing elements to the game:  This is a faith-based game.  While we clearly have an open mind about what to include in this game, there are limits.  Anything that goes into the game must not go against our faith or morals, and must also fit in the overall story and style of the game.  If you have a question about whether an idea you have would work, reach out to us before pledging so we can discuss it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHeroes of Issachar is an ambitious project. We are blending an Action RPG and a detailed Castle Builder into one game. Beyond that we have an incredible story we are developing for the game. Although the scope of this game is large, we are dedicated to making it happen. This game is not in the pen and paper stage; we have already developed some of the core modules for the game.

Supplied on a 40mm round base.\nHello again Kickstarter!\n\n   For those of you who do not know me I am Tre Manor, the owner and sculptor of Red Box Games Miniatures. I have been in the business of making miniatures since late 2006. I founded my own company Red Box Games in late 2008 and I have been making my own products ever since. I recently ran a KS campaign in the hope to begin a new line of products cast in a spin cast resin material. That effort unfortunately did not work out positively and now I find myself trying to pick up the pieces and try again to move my business forward in a more positive direction. \n    I am setting upon the production of new product and HOPEFULLY the development of the world and rules set AND the set up of in house metal casting! To help make this happen I have set out to expand as many of the existing RBG ranges as possible. I have many concepts to work with and a thirst to succeed and expand to fuel the roaring engine of productivity and creativity that I know I can be.. As of now I have a set of 8 goblin footmen that are nearly finished and will be sent to the moldmaker in the next week. Beyond these I also have 3 goblin wolf riders underway that will be sent off for molding along with the goblin footies. To oppose the tricksome savages I have 6 modular Dwarven footmen under way as well which should be ready for the moldmaker very soon as well. Beyond those I have plans for Modular Orcs, Modular Elf footmen, Modular Norsemen, and a slew of new Heroes and Villains. However before I really set to work on these other items I want to first be certain that these other items are securely funded.\nOTHER OFFERINGS!\n   T-SHIRT!!! \nThis T- Shirt is available as a paid for add-on to your existing pledge. To add the T-shirt all you need to do is add $25.00 to cover the cost of the shirt. Shirts are available in Men's and Women's styles.\n     SOLO SELECTIONS\n ORC HERO!!\n This figure is planned as a single piece metal casting and will be supplied with 1 25 mm round base. Upon funding this figure will be available to add to your existing pledge for $ 10.00 ( post KS retail price will be $12.00 ).\nIn addition to the Solo figures funded through the kickstarter campaign, most character figures from the Red Box Games back catalogue are available as reward selections as well.. These figures are available to add to your existing pledge rewards for $7.00 each ( $8.99 regular retail price ). At the end of the campaign you will be asked to list ( by title and quantity ) the back catalogue figures you would like added to your rewards. Only the $8.99 price banded figures are included in this offer. Below are picture collages of the various back catalogue figures offered. \n  AELFAR............. the elves.......\n     AENGLISH .........\n    NJORN........\nVILLAINS.........\n    TINIES....................( NOTE these items are available for $4.00 each )\nRANKS SELECTIONS..........\nOrc Modular footmen A\n4 multipart metal cast figures ( 4 heads, 4 right hands with weapons, 4 left hands with weapons, 4 torsos, 4 sets of legs. ) supplied with 4 25 mm round bases.

The weapons will be heavy weapons and will plug into a socket at the top of the leading hand. There will be 4 weapon options ( 2 swords, 1 axe and 1 mace ). These will use the same heads as the orc footmen and will also use the same legs options as the footmen. The set will of course include all options necessary to make 4 complete figures ( 4 torsos, 4 sets of legs, 1 sprue of heads, 1 sprue of weapons. ).\nNjornan footmen A\n4 multipart metal cast figures ( 4 bodies, 4 heads, 4 right hands with weapons. ) supplied with 4 25 mm round bases.

These figures are available from the beginning of the campaign. At the end of the campaign you will be asked to list ( by title and quantity ) the back catalogue ranks you would like added to your rewards. All ranks items are cast in metal unless otherwise specified below the rank selection picture. Each picture below depicts the contents of ONE rank selection.\n  Runty Goblins....... 9 single part metal cast figures ( 6 spearmen, 3 archers ) supplied with 9 20 mm round bases.\n Runty Goblin Archers...... 9 single part metal cast figures ( 3 sets of the 3 archers ) supplied with 9 20 mm round bases.\n   GOBLIN BONEBACKS A........ 8 multi-part metal cast figures ( 8 unique figures and 8 weapon options. ) supplied with 8 25 mm round bases.\n   DIRE WOLVES.......... 2 sets of 3 multi-part resin cast figures ( 3 unique bodies with 3 heads options x 2 ) supplied with 6 40 mm round bases.\n   TROLL BROTHERS......

Each reward level includes ranks ONLY. Any Hero selections must be added to your existing pledge by managing the amount pledged to include the added cost of the hero model. Unless otherwise specified each hero model costs $7.00.\n Each goal product is described in it's funding pitch as either a hero, or a Rank set.\nWhen a funding goal is reached the goal product then becomes available for selection as a reward for your contribution. \nIf you wish, you can add to your pledge to buy additional Ranks not covered by your selected reward level. Unless otherwise specified each rank set costs $20.00 individually.\n\nRANKS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE FOR HEROES AND VICE VERSA.\nSo as an example if Johnny has pledged $125.00 he can select up to 6 ranks. If he would like to add a hero to his pledge reward then he will need to increase his pledge amount by $7.00 per hero. This dollar amount does not change his reward selection level. So if Johnny adds 4 heroes to his pledge amount his reward level selection DOES NOT change from sexa to atta. Heros are entirely separate from Ranks selections.\nIf Johnny has pledged $125.00 and wants to add to his pledge to gain another rank selection his reward selection CAN BE changed to the next level up but he must remember to do so to avoid confusion. By doing so he does not need to spend the full $25 to gain a new rank. He only needs to add $15 to add the next rank. \n    ALL FIGURES ARE METAL unless specifically stated otherwise in their discription picture.\n   SHIPPING............\n   Shipping costs are not included in the pledge amounts. Backers will need to pay the shipping costs at the time shipment is ready to be made. To help move things further along I will set up a wave release schedule which will allow backers ( if they so choose ) to pay for the shipment of their pledge rewards in phases as each new item clears production or is stocked. If the backer does not wish to pay multiple shipping charges then their entire order can be shipped all in one shipment when all product is in hand. I will not be setting items aside to fill orders however. All items will be shipped first come first served.\n  This way you will not be sat waiting for months for ALL of your pledge rewards to be produced and in hand. You will receive notification through a Kickstarter update that a particular wave of items is stocked to then be directed offsite to the Red Box Games store to pay the shipping for that wave of items. Your order will be processed and shipped first come first served and your KS rewards list will be noted accordingly. \n You must pay shipping before your reward can be processed.\n   SHIPPING COSTS...........\nAs far as the costs of shipping are concerned I will always try to keep the costs as low as possible. I do not seek to profit from shipping and handling. I want to get your product to you as quickly, and efficiently and cheaply as possible. I cannot accurately estimate shipping costs as we are dealing with worldwide shipping and with highly variable weights BUT I do have a general idea of how much each package will cost based on the number of figures contained there in. Please remember also that this I am basing this estimate on HUMAN sized METAL figures. Smaller figures will obviously weigh less per figure and will lower the postage cost while larger metal figures will weigh more and affect the costs accordingly. Resin figures will also weigh much less and in turn cost less to ship as well.\n   The following is an APPROXIMATE break down of the possible shipping costs. This is in no way a guarantee of actual costs.\n# of figures.....     US......         International\n    1-10..................$3.....................$8\n   11-25...................$4...................$10\n   26-45...................$5....................$10-15\n   46-65..................$8....................$15-20\n   66-85..................$10...................$20-25\n   86-100................$10..................$25-30\n  101-150...............$12..................$30-35\n  151-200................$15.................$35-40\n   Please note that this is NOT a guarantee of postage costs. Some packages will cost less that listed above and some will cost more. This is just an estimate of possibilites.\nFULFILLMENT......................\n   Some of the figures offered as rewards for this campaign are already in production or are already in stock. Any production needed to fulfill the rewards for this campaign will be handled by my current production partners all of whom have decades of professional experience and proven track records for delivery. I work with three separate services to further distribute the work load so as to insure timely delivery and reliable product quality. Each of these services have decades of experience in the industry and whose work credits include some of the biggest industry names ( which unfortunately I am afraid to actually credit for legal reasons ). \n  Beyond the development of the new product there will be VERY LITTLE wait for the delivery of your rewards beyond the normal amount of time needed to produce, ship, sort, package, label, and ship the items on a first come first served basis. The process of fulfillment will begin immediately upon clearance of the kickstarter reward survey, which I will have in development as the KS progresses to avoid a delay between the clearance of payment and the issue of the survey. \n  Typically when I put in an order for metal castings with any of my production partners I have a 1 to 2 week waiting period for delivery, sometimes 3 depending on the partner's schedule and the amount ordered. To make this run smoother I have already begun adding to my standard product stockpile and will be ordering more throughout the development of the campaign based on the demand generated. Resin castings can take a bit longer than that but my resin production partner has developed a new system which speeds up the process a bit, and being that there are very few resin parts on offer this will only be a very slight hold up in the delivery time. \n   All molds for back catalogue product are made, tested and working properly. The partners which I am working with are ready, willing, and able. This fulfillment WILL SUCCEED as promised.\n   The production of the new product funded through this campaign will be handled by these three different services and all KS rewards stock will be produced by these companies to insure timely and reliable delivery. I will only take over production in house once I am set up and reliably experienced with the rigors of production and can assure 100% acceptable levels of quality as per my usual standards.\nThe Plan.........\n It is my plan to use the money earned in this kickstarter campaign to first pay for the production costs of all new product funded throughout this kickstarter effort and to deliver on the rewards selected by backers, and second to buy the equipment and materials to cast my figures in metal in house. Any further funds will be used in the effort of having older molds replaced with new molds ( made by the BEST mold makers in the industry! ) and also in the development of the RBG fantasy campaign setting and rules book that I have been wanting to develop for years. The major hurtles I have had to surmount over the years of operating Red Box Games has been the expense and logistics of contract casting. I have had the privilege of working with some of the most talented mold makers and casters in the business and my metal product has always had the reputation for very high quality as a result of the working relationships that I have built over the years. Now I feel that it is time to move my business forward in a positive direction by building my own in house casting operations. This will allow me to better manage my costs of manufacturing and will also allow me to more closely maintain the logistics of the operation insuring faster delivery times and constant, reliably maintained stock levels in every part offered in the store. Despite the premise of my first kickstarter effort I have learned that the best way to manage the costs of this kind of business is to use metal and to handle as much of the production myself as is humanly possible.\n  AS always I thank everyone for their continued support and interest in the growth of the Red Box Games fantasy miniatures line. It is a dream come true to do what I do and the ultimate joy to see my work enjoyed by so many people. Thank you all. You are all dearly appreciated.\n  Sincerely,\n  Tre Manor - Red Box Games", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n........Right now I am set up for production with three different US production firms here in the US. I will continue to work with these firms to help fulfill all rewards sold through this Kick Starter campaign until such time as I am able to take over the casting full time myself. \n\nThe only risk I can foresee would be a delay in delivery of the full amount of product due to work load if the amount of product ordered is incredibly high. This is not a very likely occurrence and can be avoided by having additional molds made if necessary, or in hiring on an employee or two or three to help sort, package, label, and ship.\n\nI am still in the fulfillment phase of my previous HelsVakt retool kickstarter which is now several months behind schedule. The Helsvakt were handled by Trollsforge which will not be involved in the production or fulfillment of any product produced in this kickstarter. They are currently working very hard to fulfill the production of the HelsVakt and we here at RBG are shipping the rewards as the product arrives in hand.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "Goblins trolls and wolves oh my!!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "Halfling Warband!!

He is socially inept, selfish, misogynistic, opinionated, and an awful writer.\nSeveral years ago we wrote a science fiction short story, it was purposely generic and absolutely ridiculous. It broke just about every rule we could think of that an author is supposed to follow. I distinctly remember crying from laughter at what we were putting into that short story. Later, it would become something much larger.\nWHAT ARE THE ROCKMAN CHRONICLES?\nThe Rockman Chronicles is a Satirical Science Fiction Adventure book trilogy currently being written by myself, Justin Lucas, and my brother, Mitchell Lucas, in which the heroic (and hairy) John Rockman must inspire hope, save innocent people, and kill bad guys. . . the catch is, it is written through an idiotic author character we created named Ron Jockman. The story itself is not the satire, it's the author behind the work.\nWe are avid Science Fiction and Fantasy fans which is why we wrote this story. We have noticed certain authors, who shall remain nameless, like to use the main characters of their novels as beautified versions of themselves. The main character is almost worshiped by the supporting characters that surround him, as they agree with his ridiculous opinions, listen in awe at his obscure philosophies, or utterly respect his bizarre fetishes. This is exactly what we exploit.\nIn The Rockman Chronicles, we write what makes us laugh. Some of the time we don't know why we laugh at the things we type, we just find this stuff funny, and we hope you will, too.\nHere is a sample chapter from John Rockman and the Trials of Galactar by the Prince of Galactar to get an idea of what type of story we wish to tell:\nSample Chapter: A Virtual Danger\nWe love to conceptualize and develop. We are creators. Together, with our talents, my brother and I try to make just about everything ourselves. Here, check out the trailers we did for the first two eBooks:\nHOW MUCH WORK IS LEFT?\nThe first book in the trilogy, John Rockman and the Trials of Galactar by the Prince of Galactar was released last year, the second book, John Rockman and the Cosmic Brain of Corruption, is about half done, and work on John Rockman and the Keys of the Void has not yet begun. So the entire project is about at the mid-way mark.\nWHERE WILL THE FUNDS GO?\nThe funds will be used for finishing, editing, production, delivery and advertising. Simple right?\nWe want to be able to get these books out to the people. We don't currently have the means to get the books to the quality we think they deserve. It may be a purposely-bad book, but we don't desire a purposely-bad product. We take a lot of care in the words we choose even if it doesn't seem that way, and we want to make some quality products for the people that enjoy them.\nTHE REWARDS\nFor all pledges at $15 and higher, you will get three ZIP files containing a PDF, a MOBI, and an EPUB of each of the three books. Right off the bat you will get the finished Trials of Galactar ZIP file and the other two will be released to our backers the moment they are finished.\nFor a $25 and $30 pledge, you will get a Kickstarter-only Rockman Chronicles Supernova Trilogy Edition novel with your name printed in a special acknowledgement section, in addition to the three eBook bundles. In this single novel, you will get all three ridiculous tales (Trials of Galactar, Cosmic Brain of Corruption, and Keys of the Void), one right after another, all bound in one solitary volume with your name printed in the acknowledgement section of the novel! Impress your friends with your easy-to-carry trilogy book while they try desperately to carry all of their separate, individual books.\nFor a $45 pledge, you will get all previous rewards, PLUS the complete digital audiobook of the first novel of the trilogy, John Rockman and the Trials of Galactar by the Prince of Galactar voiced by co-author Mitchell Lucas with a few additional voices by myself, Justin Lucas, and our good friend Chris Hall.\nNot too sure of the quality? I don't blame you. If you want to know what he sounds like, just check out the sample chapter audio version and find out for yourself.\nFor a $60 pledge, in addition to the eBook bundles and the Kickstarter-only Rockman Chronicles Supernova Trilogy Edition, you can just cut right to the chase and get the final two novels in digital audiobook form. The ENTIRE trilogy, voiced by the authors themselves. You will hear it as it was meant to be heard. You can learn all the weird pronunciations and show off to your mom/friends/mom's friends.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe books will be finished should the Kickstarter reach its goal. However, the biggest challenge is producing the trilogy and sending it out to all the pledgers.

Now I am set to finish the transition from metal to plastic for the rest of the RBG line. This is still a VERY significant investment and not something that I can afford without your support. It is my intention to offer the entirety of the RBG line a material that I can price to bring RBG figures to every gamer's table in the hobby. It is further my goal to expand RBG to encompass more of the Traditional Old School Fantasy Spectrum. I want to produce, Characters, Monsters, and even Terrain! I can do this with your help. The HelsVakt kickstarter was a great step in the right direction and with your help and support we can make this Kickstarter into something huge! \n\n  We are beginning with the goblins by popular demand but I have a LOT of stuff to retool and I will be taking every comment and request under consideration as the campaign progresses. It is my plan to move on to the Dvergr or the Aenglish after the goblins are retooled, hopefully there will be enough time in this campaign to make that happen but that is all up to you!\n\n HOW THIS WORKS\nYour pledge corresponds to a specific reward level. Thus far the rewards for this campaign are structured by dividing the different goal products into Solos, Lesser Ranks, and Special Ranks. Each goal product is described in it's funding pitch as either a Solo option, lesser rank option or Special rank option. When a funding goal is reached the goal product then becomes available for selection as a reward for your contribution. So for instance up to the $15,000.00 funding mark if you pledge to the Raiding Party level you can choose 2 \" ranks \" of spear men ( 12 models in each set ) and 3 sets of  archers, after the $15,000.00 mark you can choose either the spear men or the footmen or both to fulfill your lesser ranks selection.\n\n    If you wish, you can add to your pledge to buy additional ranks or solos not covered by your pledge. The values for each are as follows;\n    SOLO .............................$5.00\n    LESSER RANKS...........$25.00\n    SPECIAL RANKS.........$35.00\n     THE STORY\n  So here we find ourselves....Stalking the root twisted floor of the Dokk Wolds. Bent low beneath the wicked reaching bones of the gnarly oaks aged and weathered. The day long passed into night. The moon high but barely more than a ghost shrouded by heavy clouds bearing low the first snows of the winter. The chill wind whips about our cloaked forms bitter and spiteful. Our breath spirited a-fright, our steps furtive, our hands be-gripped the hilt of sword and axe and hammer. Hung from our weary shoulders our shields ragged and gouged bear the story of the melee that drove us from the road and harrowed us by day to this cursed knot. Our ears wide and listening, fooled at every crack of twig under foot or creak of barren branch. Fools! Our hunters will make no such warnings to us! It is our eyes narrowed and keenly watching and our wits clear and calm that will find the watchers in the shadows now awaiting our strength to sap and our will to break. They, our would be death, the creeping, fanged, feral bastards of the Wild God, Great Horned Bas. Scampering little devils so gleefully cruel,  what for the mad blood thirst of their degenerate Gods drives them so.\n\n It is no matter. We must steel ourselves to live another day. Limber your arms fellows, for death awaits us on point of rusty spear and barbed arrow, and looted sword and sax. Pray you fervently that those vicious hulks, sharp bones through their skins and drugged stupor in their eyes, do not walk amoungst them.........For if they do, then this day we are surely lost.......Odin's Breath be strong brothers....\n THE FIGURES\n DIRE WOLVES!!!\n Nigh the size of a man and beset the ravenous hunger of the great wolf god himself the Dire Wolves race through tangled wood and over open ground with equal ferocity slathering jaws agape to rip and rend the flesh of their prey, man and beast alike it matters not when the Howling God leads the way.. Summoned forth from the deepest primordial wilds they serve the will of Fenris only!\nAdd the Dire wolves to your pledge for an additional $15.00 per set of three. Or $25.00 per set of six. The Dire wolves are NOT considered a lesser or special ranks selection. These are a separate item all together. The Dire Wolves are modularly fitted for universally interchangeable heads and are supplied with 40mm round bases.\nLESSER RANKS SELECTION\n RUNTY GOB SPEARMEN!!!!  FUNDED!!!!\nFeral, vicious, and swarming the goblin hordes inhabit the deepest darkest of forests only venturing out in search of pillage and plunder. Small as they may be they are dangerous and devious! The most commonly encountered goblins are the runty gob spearmen and archers. Though small and lightly armed these goblins are no laughing matter for they are cunning and vicious and often employ wicked poisons and devious traps or ambush.\n\n  Goblins are pictured on 20 mm bases\n\n  SOLO OPTION\n  RUNTY GOB ARCHERS!!!\n Upon reaching our goal of $5,000.00 the runty gobs will be made available as a selectable option. The Spearmen are selectable as lesser ranks option with each rank consisting of 2 sets of the 6 figures pictured above in each rank. The Archers are available together as a solo option with all three figures pictured above counting as 1 solo option.\nSTRETCH GOAL # 2 $12,500.00\n    LESSER RANKS SELECTION \n   RUNTY GOB FOOTMEN!!!!! FUNDED!!!!\n   All new and ready for battle the runty goblin footmen. These are the honoured warriors of goblin kind. Earning the spoils of victory by strength of arm, or skill in battle these goblins bear the arms of fallen dwarves, men and even elves. They are not as cowardly as most goblins and are usually smarter as well. A formidable force that NO goblin warband can be without!\n\n  These figures are available as a themed set titled \" Runty Gob Footmen \" Each set includes 12 footmen figures and 3 weapon sprues. Each footman is modularly fitted for universally interchangeable hand weapon options.  The goblins here are pictured still WIP on 20 mm round bases. and are available as a lesser rank option upon funding.\nSTRETCH GOAL # 3 $15,000.00 ..............FUNDED!!!\nDOG'SBANE!!! Cruel and devious Dog's bane has clawed, kicked, bitten, stabbed, poisoned, burned, smashed, drowned, bashed and speared his way to the top of the long howlers' spearmen. Under his snarling barks the Runty gob spearmen don't dare turn tail and run, unless Dog's Bane does first! ( pictured here on a 20 mm base )\nBLACK TONGUE!!!\nfoot cheiftan of the Long Howler's Gnawed Leg clan. Unique amoungst his kind Black Tongue fights with more of what could pass for courage than most other goblins. He fights with skill and cunning and puts great effort to make an impression upon friend and foe alike for his cruelty and ruthlessness.\nSTRETCH GOAL # 4-5 $ 18,000.00 -$21,000.00 - $25,000.00\n SPECIAL RANKS SELECTION \n   GOBLIN BONEBACKS!!!\n   Brutal, Fearless, and dumb as a sack of rocks these goblin Brutes are the biggest, meanest, and most dangerous goblin kind to rage out of the Black Woods. Battle mad and usually drugged stupid with rotted poisonous mushrooms the Bonebacks fling themselves into the thick of battle without the slightest regard for themselves and no other intent but bathing in the blood of anything that happens to get too close be they friend or foe. It is their implaccability that makes them so incredibly dangerous. They do not turn and flee and they do not flinch at even horrible pain. ( pictured here on 25 mm bases. )\n\nThe goblin bonebacks are modularly fitted for universally interchangeable weapons. The weapon options to be included in each set will be 2 cleavers, 2 swords, 2 clubs, 2 small axes, 2 large axes, 2 maces, and 2 hammers( all cast in metal. The Bonebacks are available as a special rank set option upon funding . The first set of 4 will unlock at $18,000.00 and the second set of 4 will unlock at $21,000.00. Then the final set of 4 will unlock at $25,000.00.

If the final amoutn does nto go over $21,000.00 you will receive two sets of the first set of four and 1 set of the second set of four. But if the final amount DOES go above the $25,000.00 mark then you will receive 12 unique boneback figures to complete the bonebacks rank.\n\n      Stretch goal # 6 $35,000.00\n    SPECIAL RANKS SELECTION \n    RUNTY GOBS WOLFRIDERS!!!\n    The most honoured amoungst the Long Howlers tribe are the Wolf Riders. Famed through out all the goblin tribes these goblins are part warrior and part shaman sharing a spiritual bond with the beasts on whose backs they ride terrifying into battle. Combining the strength , agility, and speed of the wolves with the devious combat prowess of the goblin and some slight shaman magic as well the goblin wolfriders are a force to feared by any whose path they cross. Whether armed with bow, blade, or spear the Wolf riders make any goblin force an army of merit. These figures are available as a special rank set titled \" Wolf Riders A. \" each set includes 4 wolves and 4 hand weapon riders options and 1 sprue of weapons. The riders are fitted for universally interchangeable hand weapons.\nSTRETCH GOAL  # 7 $45,000.00\n SPECIAL RANKS SELECTION \n   THE TROLL BROTHERS!!!\nNothing strikes fear into the hearts of the Northlanders and goblins a-like as do the long shadow of the great Troll Kind. Often keeping to the deepest caves and forest valleys the Troll Kind only venture into the lands of the Dvergr or Njorn or Aenglish for plunder or revenge, but sometimes they ally with their lesser cousins the goblin kind at behest or fear of great magick. Just such is the story of the Troll Brothers. Strong enough to throw huge stones over castle ramparts Rocklobber is a name feared far and wide, while Hogsquasher's legendary gleeful cruelty and ferocity has stopped many a great hero in their tracks on hearing the name of this great beast. Add the Troll Brothers to your existing pledge as 1 special rank set. ( Pictured here on 40 mm bases )\nSTRETCH GOAL # 8 $50,000.00\n    INDIVIDUAL HERO SELECTION\n   CROWBITER!!! \n   Older than any living goblin can remember, more crazed than any shaman to boil the red mushrooms before him, and more wicked than even the Old Horned One himself, it is Crowbiter who leads the Long Howlers more so than that fat, stupid, slathering oaf Horsebane, but a cunning leader is he who pretends to serve another. By Crowbiter's magicks have many a battle turned in favour of the fanged kin, and it was by Crowbiter's powers and persuasion that the great Troll Brothers first sat  at the Stone Circle to feast with the Long Howlers on the Dwarves of Garmingen's Fort. By his magicks do the dire wolves howl and heel, and by his will do the Long Howlers kill and steal.\n\n  Crowbiter will be available as a singular solo option upon funding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been operating Red Box Games for 5 years now. In that time I have developed a reputation for prompt, personal service and reliability. I work very very hard to insure that every customer is HAPPY with their order and the service provided to see it to them. I know what it takes to make a miniature work for production and shipment and to also work for the general use of gaming and painting. Almost every one of the miniatures proposed for production in this Kickstarter are already ready for production. At this point all that is left is for them to be remolded and cast in a new material. The only challenge involved here is in the productive capacity of the mold maker / caster and any difficulty encountered there will be resolved as it arises by hiring on new help to create the manpower necessary to deliver the product as advertised and on time. Troll's forge is a very well established and reliable service and is dedicated to seeing this effort through to it's greatest success.\n\nBeyond that only the fulfillment effort on my end would be any other foreseeable challenge, which will be fixed with the hiring of a full time employee if this campaign funds as I hope it will.\n\n I am now in the process of delivering on my recently successful Kickstarter project. The delivery is behind schedule ( originally intended for October of 2012 ) but is now in the final stages of fulfillment. We encountered set backs of varying nature through out the production process but have since made the necessary corrections and have learned how to avoid them on future works.

I choose rather to be sure that you guys have the items that you actually want than to force you to pay for items that you do not.

These will still count as 1 special rank selection so if the other 8 do not fund then you will receive 3 sets of these four unlocked uniques as a full rank ( 12 figures total. ). Then as the two other sets of four unlock they will replace one set of duplicates in the final 12.  This way the special ranks selections are CERTAIN to have value and we are CERTAIN to get the bonebacks in.

In the interest of bringing these a little closer into reach I am going to make one set of 3 modular figures instead of 4 modular figures. I will also increase the number of figures in the Wolf Rider Ranks to 6 instead of four. This way you will get 2 repeats of 3 unique riders kits.

Thanks to everyone who made this a possibility. There are still a few days left to go. Any additional money raised will go recouping the payment for the first half of the pencils and for the coloring.\nI sent off the first few pages to a handful of publishers late last week, so fingers crossed.\nBlack Lotus Empire is a 12 issue, full-color comic book series that explores what life might be like in China almost 100 years from now.  In BLE, China is now the sole economic and military superpower in the world, and the government frequently engages in intimidation, violence, and control of information to keep the people in line. But cracks are forming, and the leaders know that unrest may threaten their rule, so a sinister general has been giving the authority to create a fighting force to combat China\u2019s only true enemy: her own people.\nThe comic was created and written by me and features stunning artwork by Carlos Gomez (pencils) and Neeraj Menon (colors).\nSparrow: the protagonist. Pencils: Carlos Gomez, Colors: Neeraj Menon\nOk, but what is the story?\nIt is the dawn of the 22nd century. For a century, China\u2019s leaders have bought their peoples\u2019 submission with continued growth and prosperity, but as the economy grinds to a halt, protests have broken out in the megacities. Life for urban dwellers is still far better than for those in the impoverished rural areas, which have borne the scars of China\u2019s ongoing industrial revolution. Pollution has contaminated the water, the soil, and even the food the people rely on. Severe birth defects occur in record numbers, though many go unreported. Most families cannot afford to take care of a crippled child. They need a strong, sturdy son to help them earn a living. Because of the one-child policy, many babies born with deformities are simply abandoned by their parents. The military, under the ambitious General Ying, has begun the practice of taking these unwanted children and experimenting on them to create a force of Supersoldiers called the Ch\u0101o Sh\u00ecb\u012bng. Their mission: to combat the growing number of internal threats to the stability of China. The protagonist of BLE is one of these unwanted children. Sparrow was abandoned by her parents because she was born with wings. Fortunately, she was adopted by a kindly army officer who sought to protect her from Ying\u2019s program. In time, she was discovered and taken away; her father imprisoned. After years of training, General Ying has activated her to assassinate a high ranking dissident leader who has suddenly surfaced.\n\nThe story begins with Sparrow fighting against the Dissidents, but a discovery leads her to change sides. Now she must turn a rag tag group of dissidents into a fighting force that can take on the military, while simultaneously overcoming her crippling temper, and coping with her feelings for a fellow freedom fighter.\npage 1\npage 2\npage 3\npage 4\npage 5\nWhat is the money for?\nGood art ain't cheap! The amount I am asking for covers half the cost of the pencils for Black Lotus Empire #1, plus all Kickstarter and Amazon fees, and costs for printing and shipping the pledge rewards. I am really happy to be working with Carlos Gomez, a talented young artist from Spain. I paid the first half out of pocket, and I will be paying for the coloring out of pocket as well.\nType 9 \u201cBlack Lotus\u201d Light Combat Uniform. Pencils: Carlos Gomez, Colors: Neeraj Menon\nWhat's the ultimate goal?\nI plan to shop issue one around to comic publishers to see if anyone will pick up the 12 issue run. If not, I will self publish and hope to make enough money off of each issue to fund the next one.I don't really plan on making a penny off of the comic, and may even lose some money, but I am having fun writing it and I would love to see it come to life. If this works out, I have a couple of other stories I want to start work on.\nType 9 \u201cBlack Lotus\u201d Heavy Combat Uniform. Image by Jeff Miller\nWhat if the funding goal isn't met?\nIf I can't meet my funding goal, then I will have to dip further into my savings to pay for the book.The truth is, I don't have a huge Facebook following, or millions of followers on Twitter. This is the second time I am running the Kickstarter project, this time with a lower goal and better rewards. I'm just an average guy trying to live out a piece of his childhood dream, and I truly appreciate anyone who gives a dime to help me make that happen.Thanks for taking the time to view.\nType 9 \u201cBlack Lotus\u201d Light Combat Uniform.

These rules harken back to the days of classic dungeon crawls and the world\u2019s most popular fantasy RPG.  Players take the roles of a group of hardened adventurers seeking treasure, glory, and the defeat of the festering evils that remain hidden in the darkest corners of forgotten dungeons.\nDungeon Skirmish?\nGoalsystem Delves seamlessly blends RPG and tabletop miniature elements into a fast paced tabletop experience that provides the depth of an RPG with the fast paced action of a tactical miniatures game. Delves plays fast, allowing players to run a multi-encounter Adventure in a single session and epic campaigns over multiple sessions.\nUsing the proven and popular Goalsystem, Delves delivers character driven action that\u2019s deep enough for RPG gamers and fast enough for miniature gamers. \nDelves works with any 28mm or 15mm miniatures in your collection. \nOni Mage miniature concept art\nFantasy Toolkit\nDelves features 6 character classes and 12 sub-classes that cover all of the major tropes of the dungeon fantasy genre.

A Gift & Stretch Goal\nA big thanks to all of you who've pledged! We've reached our initial goal -- and with over two weeks left to go! :) Thank you so much for being part of this project and for helping to make my RPG game a reality. I have two exciting announcements:\n1) As a \"thank you\" gift, I'm immediately including a new reward for everyone who's pledged $10 or more -- Creature Cards!\n2) And we now have a Stretch Goal of $9,000. If we hit this new amount, everyone who's pledged $25 or more will receive an \"Adventure Folder.\"\nPlease click on the \"Updates\" tab above and check out my latest update (#3) for more information on the Creature Cards, Stretch Goal and Adventure Folders. And thanks again for all of your support!\nMAY 21st UPDATE: 1st look at the character sheet, and exciting new Pledge Rewards!\nAs I write this, we're about 60% funded, which is amazing. Thank you so much to everyone who's pledged! :) As a little \"thank you\" for your support, I thought I'd offer a first look at the character sheet. Keep in mind, this is the working version. As I flesh things out and do some game testing, details and design elements are sure to change. But at least this gives you a pretty solid idea as to what you can expect. Click here for a bigger version: http://grantgould.com/art/brcs.jpg  Also, I added new Pledge Rewards: ORIGINAL ARTWORK from the book at the $200 level (limited to 30) and a PDF at $15. So please check those out. Thanks!\nWhat is Blade Raiders?\nBlade Raiders is an epic fantasy tabletop roleplaying game. Swords and sorcery, high adventure, creatures and quests -- All of the elements you crave, but presented with a unique spin you've never experienced before. The game will be written, assembled, and fully illustrated by me (you can check out my full bio on the right side of this page), and I'm confident people will enjoy the end result. I've been playing and running tabletop RPGs for over 25 years, so I know what makes a fun game and a great social experience. I look forward to sharing my vision with you and your gaming group. :)\nCan you tell me more about the actual book itself?\nThis first book is the core rulebook. It contains everything you need to play the game, aside from dice -- World overview, character creation, combat rules, monster stats, and everything else needed to begin your adventure. The book will have an 8.5\"x11\"/magazine-size format (like many RPGs: Dungeons & Dragons, Palladium, Pathfinder, etc.), softcover, perfect-bound, featuring black-and-white interior pages and full-color covers. **A limited-edition hardcover version is available as well. See the rewards section for more info.**\nWhen will the book be done?\nIf I reach my goal, I plan on having the book completely done by September and back from the printers by late October. If I don't reach my goal, then the project will be shelved. I just can't afford to spend the time needed on this unless I have some help. So, please, if you want this game to happen, make a pledge and tell your friends.\nSo what do I get if I pledge?\nRewards! :) Along the right-hand side of this page, you'll see the list of rewards based on the various amounts that you can pledge.\nWhat does my money pay for?\nYour money (assuming I reach my Kickstarter goal -- if the goal's not met, then you don't pay a penny) will make it possible for me to pay bills while I work on Blade Raiders. Being able to set aside a large chunk of time to illustrate the book and put it together is a huge part of making it happen. Additionally, your money will help pay for printing, rewards, and shipping costs.\nWill there be more Blade Raiders books coming after this?\nI certainly hope so! If the goal is reached, you can be sure that the first Blade Raiders sourcebook will be coming in early 2013.\nIf you have any other questions, be sure to check the FAQs below -- and if you don't find an answer there, feel free to message me.

Find out more information on our latest stretch goals at Update #12.\n-Update ~ $6000 stretch goal: send CREATURES to ORIGINS!-\nThank you all so much for putting us over our goal in less than 72 hours!  Now we want to take CREATURES to the next level, all the way to the Origins Game Fair!  This is the biggest annual board/card game trade show in the US, held in Columbus, Ohio in the Spring, and we want CREATURES to take it and the gaming industry by storm.  We are asking for funds to cover the cost of a booth (~$900), booth design, airfare, hotels, lots of extra decks to sell, etc.  so we have set a stretch goal of $6000 to help fund this grand adventure.\nIf/when we hit the $6000 goal, there will be an extra special bonus reward added to EVERY backer level $5 and above-- a special, limited edition animal to be added to your deck available only to kickstarter backers!  The mystery cards will be revealed on the backer's blog upon reaching the goal.  Keep up the great work!\n-ABOUT THE GAME-\nCREATURES is a creative, strategic card game that blends friendly competition with a good laugh!  It is intended for 2 to 6 players, ages 8 and up.  The game is comprised of 96 playing cards consisting of either a \u2018FRONT\u2019, \u2018MIDDLE\u2019, or \u2018BACK\u2019 portion of 32 particular animals.  Each animal is illustrated across the three cards, and includes a fun fact about that animal and a corresponding \u2018strength\u2019 value ranging from 1-10 (e.g. a mosquito is strength-1, and a grizzly bear is strength-10). \nGameplay occurs as players mix and match \u2018FRONT\u2019, \u2018MIDDLE\u2019, and \u2018BACK\u2019 cards in their hand to create entirely new creatures, and stage attacks against the creatures in other players\u2019 hands.  For example, the \u2018FRONT\u2019 of Octopus (4), the \u2018MIDDLE\u2019 of Hippopotamus (7), and the \u2018BACK\u2019 of Armadillo (1) combine to create OC-POTA-DILLO (12)! \nThe illustrated portions of each card align to create an image of the new creature with a zany new fun fact.  A creature which conquers all other players in a single turn becomes a \u2018Champion\u2019.  Can you be the first to achieve 5 \u2018Champions\u2019?  May the strongest creature win! \n-WHY CREATURES IS AWESOME-\nCREATURES is not a veiled re-boot of existing face card games such as poker or bridge, but a refreshingly new and creative game unlike anything else.  It is a harmonious blend of the simplicity of traditional card games such as Uno or Skip-Bo with the strategy and creativity of more complex card games such as Canasta or Phase 10. \nThe game is fun for many levels, easy to learn, and difficult to master. \nWhen is the right time to attack?  Which creature should defend an oncoming attack?  What if someone holds a *POISON* creature!?  The quirky artwork and jumbled-up animal facts keep players of all ages engaged and amused.  With almost 22,000 possible CREATURE combinations, the gameplay is always fresh with every hand delt!\n-WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES-\nThe pledges YOU make will cover the costs associated with designing and printing the first edition card decks professionally, including tuck boxes, shrink wrap, etc. as well as registering the CREATURES trademark and copyrights.  Did you know it costs $40/month to list a new item on Amazon.com?  This is where your money goes!  We will also be printing CREATURES T-shirts and refrigerator magnets so you can show off your undying support of the game to friends and family.  Any amount we raise in excess of our stated goal will go toward trade show exhibitions, marketing material, additional deck printing, etc. so please continue to support!\n-MORE INFORMATION-\nPlease visit the official CREATURES website at www.CreaturesCardGame.com for more information, images, rules, etc.\nHit us up on Twitter @CreaturesGames!\nThank you for pledging and helping make CREATURES become a reality!

If you already pledged for the DVD, you can change your pledge. If you pledged more than $30, don't worry - you'll have the option of picking between the Blu-Ray and the DVD edition. Aside from HD-ness, there is no difference between the two versions.\nAnd remember - if you pre-order our DVD/Blu-Ray, you're ensuring that the final product is that much better! We're going to be starting shooting next week, and every bit helps!\nWe can't wait to show you VGHS, and from all of us on the team, thank you!\n-fw\n-----\nWhat is Video Game High School (VGHS)?\nIt's the near future: You're dead. Your kids are probably dead. Your grandkids (if they're alive) are playing video games. Why? Because professional gaming is the biggest sport on earth.\nAround the world, millions of players duke it out in fighters, RTS\u2019s, First Person Shooters and more. To the victors go the spoils: glory, clan contracts and million dollar endorsements. The best young gamers are recruited by elite boarding schools to sharpen their skills. The best of the best go to VGHS: VIDEO GAME HIGH SCHOOL. \nVGHS is a feature-length action/comedy web series (9 episodes, ~10 mins per episode) about best friends, first loves, and landing that perfect head shot. It follows Brian, a young FPS player stuck in a town where he doesn\u2019t belong. His fortunes change when he scores a massive kill against the world\u2019s top amateur player: VGHS senior \u201cThe Law.\u201d\nBrian rockets into the national spotlight and lands an invite into the hallowed halls of VGHS. There his skills will be tested as he fights to fit in with the most talented gamers alive. Along the way he\u2019ll make unlikely friends, fall in love with no-nonsense FPS hot shot, Jenny Matrix, and face powerful enemies \u2013 namely The Law, who vows to destroy Brian for good.\nWill Brian\u2019s dreams end before they\u2019ve even started? Or will he pull it together and become the gamer he was born to be?\nWho is behind VGHS?\nVGHS is co-created by Freddie Wong and Brandon Laatsch and Matt Arnold. In addition to acting as showrunner, Matt is also a writer, along with Will Campos and Brian Firenzi (founder of 5secondfilms.com). It is based on a concept by Will Campos and Chris Pappavaselio.\nFreddie Wong and Brandon Laatsch run http://youtube.com/freddiew, the 7th most subscribed YouTube channel of all time. Collectively their videos have over 450 million views, with over 2 million subscribers tuning in every week to watch their work. Their work has been featured on CNN, BBC, ESPN, and The Huffington Post, and they've worked with actors such as Eliza Dushku, Andy Whitfield, and Kevin Pollack.\nMost recently, they worked with director Jon Favreau for a crossover video for Cowboys and Aliens, and appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to talk about their work.\nBrian Firenzi is the founder of 5secondfilms.com, a comedy website that has churned out five second short films every single weekday since 2008. 5sf has been featured on \"Tosh.0\" and \"Attack of the Show,\" screened at SxSW and ComiCon, and they've worked with actors such as Peter Stormare and Patton Oswalt.\nMatthew Arnold is a collaborator and business partner with freddiew. After graduating USC, he was an assistant and than associate producer at Disney Interactive Studios for 2.5 years where he worked on nearly a dozen projects that polluted kids minds and emptied parents wallets (nah games are great for kids). Matt left in 2010 to start his own game company and create VGHS. His first iPhone game - an action adventure marble game - is set for release this holiday season. \nWill Campos has been a long-time friend and collaborator. He is a graduate of the USC School of Cinema Screenwriting program, and has the professionalism to make the rest of us feel like children. \nHow is this project funded? What's the funding for?\nMaking a feature-length project can be surprisingly expensive - there are numerous costs involved with doing a project legit, including production insurance, location permits, actor and crew salaries, and legal paperwork. In addition, the scale of the project means we'll have to hire on additional post-production personnel, such as editors and visual effects artists.\nOver the last year and a half of making weekly special effects laden YouTube videos, we've learned to be flexible and resourceful with our budgets. Every cent raised for this project is going into the production, so the more we raise, the bigger we can go with this project.\nAlso to put things in perspective, we're asking for less than 1/1000th of the budget for the upcoming Twilight movie.\nWhy a webseries?\nWe strongly believe the foundations for the future of digitally distributed content will be laid by webseries. We don't see a webseries as a stepping stone to get a feature film project, or a TV deal - a good webseries is an end unto itself. The webseries format is uncharted territory, and we want to explore it.\nWhat's the status of the production?\nVGHS is currently in pre-production. The scripts have all been written. Production is scheduled to start mid-October, with the project finishing early 2012.\nHow can I help?\nBy pledging an amount, you will be eligible to receive rewards exclusive to those pledging through this Kickstarter page. Take a look at the rewards column on the right -  you can think of pledging as placing a pre-order for the product once it's done.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Video Game High School Season 3", "update_content": "Hey!\nBecause you supported VGHS before, we thought you would like to know that we launched our crowdfunding campaign for Video Game High School Season 3!\nIt all ends here: in six episodes, SCHOOL IS OUT.

Turn a fledgling alien race into a vast, powerful empire.  \nEmpires of the Void is an epic, space empire-building game playable in two hours.  The game is for 2 to 4 players and has an intuitive, yet flexible rule system that allows for many different strategies.  Players can win by conquering planets, using diplomacy, researching technology, or focusing on ruling the galactic council.  Feel like ruling every planet you encounter with an iron fist?  Want to outsmart your opponents with sneaky, underhanded maneuvers they don't expect?  Or perhaps you desire superior technology so you can outgun the competition.  It's all possible in the game.\nEmpires of the Void has a heavy emphasis on theme and story.  Each round starts with a random event to enhance the flavor of the setting.  The game comes with seven starting alien races to choose from, each with unique abilities and play styles. There are also fifteen additional neutral aliens to conquer or befriend, each with unique abilities and strengths.  The variable board comes in seven hexagonal pieces, so each game will be a different experience.\nFor further details on the game, please visit these pages:\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98347/empires-of-the-void\nhttp://dicehateme.com/2011/05/space-for-more-an-interview-with-empires-of-the-void-designer-ryan-laukat/\nThe Goal\nAll we need to get this thing launched is your help!  The goal of this project is to pull together enough funding to help cover manufacturing costs.  And to show you how much we appreciate you, we've decided to include an additional starting alien race for all backers, the Pirates of Cidran.  The Pirates are a blast to play- they can use credits to bribe allies to join them, and every time they destroy an enemy ship, they collect credits from scavenging the wreckage.  This starting alien race is limited to this Kickstarter.com campaign and will never be available anywhere else!\nThis is a big game, with lots of components, and we know you won't be disappointed with how much is in the box, or how engaging the game is.\nAt the $50 level, you will receive a copy of the game, free shipping, and the Pirates of Cidran starting alien race.  That is $10 less than suggested retail.  We promise to ship out all backers' rewards before the game will be available in stores, online, or at conventions.  \nThe art is almost completely finished and the game has been tested extensively.  The screws are tightened and the chrome is polished.  Help make our dream a reality!\nNew Race at $25,000!\nWe made it to our goal!  Thank you everyone!  Empires of the Void will be printed.  I'm very excited to announce that a new alien race will be included in EVERY COPY of the game if we reach $25,000.  This race has a completely different feel and play style, and uses additional components.  Tremble at the terrible power of the PARASITES OF SREECH!\nThe Parasites of Sreech not only conquer and befriend neutral aliens, they also INFEST them.  They also have their own ship, the Infestor, a truly terrifying creature to behold.  When the Sreech infest a planet, they have access to that planet's special ability.  They can infest any planet they do not control, including planets controlled by other players, and it is fairly difficult for anyone to remove an infestation.  The ability to infest planets opens up many new strategic possibilities.\nPlease take a look at this video review!  http://boardgamegeek.com/video/11164/empires-of-the-void/dice-tower-reviews-empires-of-the-void\nAll titles approved for Springboard campaigns are vetted by Game Salute.

They have influence over the galactic market, and each round can choose a trade good that gives extra income for the owner (even other aliens).

The Capital City cards are meant to give players a way to mitigate the luck, and add a few interesting decisions to the game.  At the beginning of the game, each player receives one Capital City card and places it next to his player board.  At the end of a player's turn, he may collect one Photon Bomb or one Ambassador and place it on the card (use credit and victory point tokens to represent as indicated).  Photon Bombs may be spent to add one each to combat rolls, after the roll, and Ambassadors may be spent to add to one each to diplomacy rolls, after the roll.

If you've ever written with one, you know what we're talking about.  If you haven't heard of these pens, check out jetpen's blurb.http://bit.ly/hitecc \nPen Type-A is a stainless steel replacement for the Hi-Tec-C's cheap plastic housing. To us, the Hi-Tec-C cartridges deserve a more durable home.\n\nThe design is minimal, the construction is super solid, and indestructible to protect and cherish these coveted ink cartridges.  It has a dime screw on one end to allow for easy ink cartridge replacement.  Its shaft is a solid smooth surface with no branding, no fancy grip or grooves, and just the right thickness and weight so it feels comfortable in your hand.  The entire piece is milled and turned from a block of 304 stainless steel.  The raw steel finish today is how it\u2019ll look 50 years from now.  This thing will last forever. \nThe pen slides slowly into its sleeve, which doubles as a ruler.  The notches on the ruler are in cm and inches.  An internal lip at the bottom of the sleeve protects the tip from getting shoved in any further than it should. The tiny amount of space between the sleeve and the pen creates an effect like a pneumatic cylinder, so the pen slides in slow and smooth.\n\nWe'd love to share our passion for this pen.\n\nWith your support, we'd like to gather enough pre-orders to cover the tooling costs to get this pen into your hands.  It also makes a great gift, so we've opened up higher pledges for those of you who want more than one.\n\nYour support is greatly appreciated!\nLove, CW&T\nPS. The Pen Type-A is selling here for $50 as a limited pre-sale Kickstarter price.  After this campaign, the pen will retail for $99.\nSpecifications:\nPen Type-A includes a 0.3 Black Hi-Tec-C Cartridge\nPen Weight (including ink cartridge): 50 grams (1.75 oz)\nPen Diameter: 9.72mm\nPen Length: 124.75mm\nSleeve Weight: 74 grams (2.6 oz)\nSleeve Length: 120mm\nSleeve Width: 12mm\nCompatible Ink Cartridges:  Pilot Hi-Tec-C and G-Tec-C Cartridges (0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5mm widths in many colors!)\nRetail Price: $99", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Pen Type-C is here.", "update_content": "You were the first to support us when Pen Type-A was born back in 2011.

The smooth barrel and heavy, but gentle weight of the piece balances well and makes for a great writing experience. As I said previously, I've got another metal pen (a couple actually) and this one isn't a whole lot different, but there is an incredible attention to detail here and it's something I appreciate. Do I think this project could have gone much differently? Yes. Does the final product excuse the delays and lack of communication? Not really. I hope that cw&t will take this experience and run with it because I think they've probably learned some important lessons and given us a front row seat to both their misfortunes and their success. I appreciate the level of quality. Would I recommend it to a friend? Yes, but only if I knew that person could appreciate this type of product. It's not versatile or portable. It's almost a novelty. Would I be proud to give this as a gift? Absolutely. I think once cw&t get this project finished up and start producing them in the US and offering them in a retail setting (via their website or boutiques or whatever), this pen will be fairly successful, especially considering the cult-like following of the Hi-Tec-C.

The Pen Type-A is similar so it's not an entirely new experience for me. Am I glad to have it? Yeah. I like it. Would I have backed it if I had known it would take this long to get the item I got? Nah. I appreciate the attention to detail and the level of quality maintained by CW+T, but for a year-long wait, it's really not that amazing. Sure, it's fun to pull it out and hear it 'pop' and it writes well (a testament to the Hi Tec C more so than the Pen Type-A), but I think my frustration from waiting for so long and the lack of communication has sort of jaded my enthusiasm for the final product. Would I recommend it to a friend? At more than $50? No. Would I buy it for a friend that loved pens or that was an engineer or product designer? Yeah, it would be a neat novelty gift.

When something goes wrong with the manufacturing process in China, they can't be there to oversee the corrections or to even oversee the problems. All they get is a defective pen and they have to figure out how to translate the problem and solutions via email/skype/phone. It's ridiculous. They should have found a local or semi-local metal shop with precision machinery to make this product so that they could keep an eye on the process. They wouldn't have to deal with shipping and customs delays and they could make sure that the pens were right before ever leaving the manufacturer and sent to them. Shipping from China alone probably takes 2-4 weeks with customs. If they've had 10 shipments, that's an additional 5-8 months on average added to the timeline just in shipping delays. To me, that's inexcusable. A small start-up should be manufactured as such. They're not making iPhones here. It's an industrial product made by specialized machinery. They could have done this closer to home, even at a slightly higher price point. I got my PHX pen a week or more ago and it's a fantastic product. I gave up on the Pen Type-A a long time ago. By my guess, I'll get it in 2 more shipments, which puts me at August or so. I think that's exactly a year after I backed the project.

They secured the area, clearing out the civilians who had yet to flee. In the five minutes in which this took, DFM agents Florin, York, Yoren and Renault arrived. They assisted in clearing out the area and instigated a case perimeter. \nInitial investigation revealed one suspected fabricant (SUS-F) holding four hostages in the diner. One hostage was already seen to be dead. Upon approach, the SUS-F shouted that he wanted the officer to step back or he would execute the hostages he held. The officers, upon further observation from a greater distance away, believed they had enough evidence that the suspect was in fact a fabricant. His behavior conformed with classic hostage-taking programming\u2026\n-Excerpt from DFM case file 556-447-322 \nThe Game\nThe Department is a tabletop miniature game set in a near future America where Fabricated Human Simulants, also known as fabricants, walk among us. Players take on the role of agents from the U.S. Department of Fabricant Management, a government department charged with policing fabricants and fighting the increasing instances of fabricant-related terrorism. The Department is meant to be the first tabletop police procedural game that requires no Game Master to play. Players will use sleuthing, investigation, interrogation, and combat to hunt down and stop fabricant terrorist cells.\nThe game draws heavily on the noir and police procedural dramas and blends in elements of robotic sci-fi. The Department is not cyberpunk: it\u2019s Blade Runner meets Law and Order meets I-Robot meets American Gangster meets Mad Men meets The Maltese Falcon and more. \nWhere Wargame and RPG Meet\nThe Department uses the popular Goalsystem, written by Scott Pyle. Building on this proven base, The Department features an innovative, cooperative campaign system where players play scenarios in order to gather a diverse array of evidence points. Players then use these evidence points to acquire warrants, follow up on leads, and finally hunt down the leadership of the fabricant terrorist cell. The campaign constantly challenges players to use their limited investigation resources wisely, as their department\u2019s patience will eventually run out and the players will be thrown off of the case.\nWhile it is meant to be played as a tabletop miniature wargame that requires no game master, The Department can be played without miniatures as a map based tabletop RPG. Our goal is to create a rulebook that allows you to explore the streets of 2060s America your way.\nWhat We Will Produce And When We Will Produce It.\nThe Department will be an approximately 150 page full color soft cover A4 sized book chock full of art, fiction, and a complete ruleset ready to play straight away.\nWe will also be producing a full color PDF as well as a kindle, ebook, and a printer-friendly Pdf version. \nCurrently, production is on schedule and we aim to release The Department in Q1 2012.\nAll contributors will be acknowledged in the print and electronic versions of the game.\nYou can find more information on our official website. www.departmentoffabricantmanagement.com   \nThe Money Side of Things\nWe\u2019re raising Kickstarter funding to cover our creative costs and an initial print run.\nWe are a global team working in three countries, but our printing operations will be done in the UK.

And we never actually reveal what the exterior of the robot looks like.\nOur story unfolds through the eyes of a young woman named Erica Pratch. She\u2019s new to the Maintenance Crew, and joined up because she wanted to travel and be part of something exciting. But the reality of working inside a giant robot warrior isn\u2019t anything like she expected. This is a high-stress job done in the most ridiculous situations possible, where people routinely snap under the pressure. On top of that the pilots of the robot don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, and alien monsters run loose in the service tunnels.\nBut someone has to keep that giant robot functioning. No matter how much back-breaking, soul-crushing, life-threatening work it might take.\nGiant Robot Warrior Maintenance Crew is a three-issue mini-series that should appeal to fans of Spaceballs, Aliens, the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and of course giant robot stories. It\u2019s an idea we\u2019ve been itching to get made for several years now, and the time has finally come to make it happen.\nThough while we are working with a small publisher, we still need help to tackle production costs and marketing. Plus, Mervyn will have to turn down some freelance work to make time to finish these pages. A large chunk of the funds will be used to make sure the guy can eat.\nSo with that in mind we\u2019re offering a great series of rewards for any pledges given, including collected sets of all three issues, original artwork, and even appearances in the story. If you live outside the U.S., please include an extra $5.00 to help cover any shipping and handling involved.\nAnd if you like our project then please take a moment to send our link around, and help spread the word on what GRWMC is all about.\nThanks for your consideration, and we look forward to bringing Giant Robot Warrior Maintenance Crew to you soon.\n- Nathan and Mervyn", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #56", "update_userinfo": "Fight of the Cnetury Kickstarter", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\nHope all is well.

Hold on a sec'...I see you looking at those numbers up there in the corner and hovering over your browser's BACK button. You're thinking \"It's all over and they don't need me, now.\"\nWell, you're wrong, Spaceman!\nYes, we made the $5,000 goal to guarantee that Alien Frontiers will be printed. But the dirty little secret is that $5,000 is only about a third of the actual printing costs and I'm draining my savings to make up the additional $10,000\nYIKES!\nYa, that's a chunk-o-change...so every new backer we get between now and June 26th will help a lot to defray those additional costs. If you sign up as a $50 Backer right now you'll get the game when it's printed (we're hoping for August or September) and some spiffy bonuses that won't be available after June 26th. And if you REALLY want some sweet rewards, just look at the higher backer packages.\nOK, that's the pitch and the plea...now, jump in and see what it's all about. An Overview of The Game\nAlien Frontiers is a board game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.\nThe game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system\u2019s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the spaceships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.\nWinning the game requires a mix of strategy and luck as you assign your fleet, integrate alien technology and territory bonuses into your approach, and block your opponents from implementing their own plans. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier? A Few Words from the Game Designer\nMy name is Tory Niemann and I\u2019ve been designing games (with varying levels of success) since I could play them. I came up with the basic framework of Alien Frontiers in early 2009. Even from those first primordial play tests with the wife, I could see I had something good. Unlike many games I\u2019d made, it was fun. It wasn't finished, but it was fun.\nPerhaps the most unusual influence on this project was the game Kingsburg by Luca Iennaco and Andrea Chiarvesio. The influence was not from the game itself (I hadn\u2019t played it at the time), but a brief review of the game I read online. From that synopsis, I developed an idea of how the game was probably played, and I thought it sounded interesting. Later I found that my concept of this game was totally wrong because the description I\u2019d read was misleading, but the game I\u2019d thought it was still intrigued me. Another influence was the dice game To Court the King by Tom Lehmann. I really enjoyed the concept of rolling dice and then changing them in the most creative way to suit your purpose, but I wanted a deeper game than To Court the King provided. I combined these two influences to create a new, unique game.\nOriginally, the game was called Race for Mars, or, as my wife called it, \"that Mars game.\" It was printed on two pieces of cardstock and used cubes of sculpting clay for resource tokens. After several revisions and reworkings, I shifted the theme of the game to colonizing of an extrasolar planet and named it Alien Frontiers.\nNow, after extensive play testing, dozens of changes, adjustments, and tweaks, Alien Frontiers is on the verge of being a REAL game. Most importantly to me, it\u2019s a game that I really enjoy playing and others love too. This is an exciting time for me as the designer and I can't wait to get Alien Frontiers out to the public. A Few Words from the Publisher Hi...I'm David MacKenzie and Clever Mojo Games is my tiny little game design company. As a sole proprietorship, CMG has very limited funds, nevertheless, I am committed to publishing Alien Frontiers this year and I'm already in talks with a couple of manufacturers. This is where you and Kickstarter can help. The funds you pledge will go directly to offset the printing costs for a run of 1,000 copies of Tory's amazing game. Your support will insure than Alien Frontiers is published and that Clever Mojo Games is around to produce more quality games in the future.\nBy supporting the Alien Frontiers project with your pledge of just $50 you are pre-ordering the game (retail value $40.00) plus you'll receive four spiffy rocket tokens for the score track and a Kickstarter-Exclusive \"Space Crane\" Alien Tech Card. When the games are printed and delivered I will ship your copy to you anywhere in the world at no additional charge. You're definitely getting your money's worth at this sponsorship level! (Limit 700 Sponsors)\nAt the $100 level you'll get the game, rockets and card from the $50 level plus your choice of a second copy of Alien Frontiers or a copy of Ogre Castle, a fun family game that my brother, Fred, and I designed and self-published in 2009. Two games...rockets...exclusive Alien Tech card...and shipping included!! (Limit 100 Sponsors)\nAt the $200 level you'll get the game, rockets and card from the $50 level plus a sweet photo book of Alien Frontiers art showing early concept sketches and finished pieces...and it's signed by the artist, Mark Maxwell, and by the game designer, Tory Niemann, too. As always, shipping anywhere in the world is included!!! (Limit 20 Sponsors)\nAt the $300 sponsorship level you'll get the game, rockets and card from the $50 level plus a high quality giclee print of the Alien Artifact floating majestically over the barren alien planet. This 15\"x20\" print is signed by the artist, Mark Maxwell, and is suitable for framing. Worldwide shipping and insurance included!! (Limit 10 Sponsors)\nFinally, at the $500 sponsorship level you'll get the game, rockets and card from the $50 level plus an original piece of art created for the game's Alien Tech Cards. These 8x10 acrylic paintings are one of a kind originals signed by the artist, Mark Maxwell, and ready for you to frame and proudly display in your game room. We're only making five pieces available and they'll be awarded on a first-pledge-first-choice basis. The pieces are: Plasma Cannon, Stasis Beam, Alien Monument, Temporal Warper, and Orbital Teleporter. Yup, worldwide shipping and insurance included!! (Limit 5 Sponsors) Every little bit you pledge helps support the game. If you're not ready or able to pledge for a pre-order, your $10 pledge will earn you a certificate of thanks signed by the game designer, Tory Niemann, and you'll get the rocket scoring tokens, too. And remember, every person who pledges will have access to the \"Backers Only\" updates here on Kickstarter. Spread the word to all your friends and co-workers, on all your social networks, at your gaming groups and church gatherings. Alien Frontiers is coming in 2010 and with your help it will be a big success.

I had them delivered to the artist, Mark Maxwell, and asked him to sign them all and to keep one book for himself. Simple enough, and all I expected was a scrawled signature and maybe a date. What Mark did, however, was, as usual for him, above and beyond. Each of the four copies that he sent back to me has his signatures and date...but it also has an original and unique retro-scifi sketch on the title page!
