More specifically, preserve these memories onto photo-realistic clothing that will last a lifetime!\nMike Krilivsky, creator of RageOn.com, \u201cWorld\u2019s Largest All-Over-Print Online Store\u201d, is giving smartphone users the ability to convert their memories into vibrant, wearable merchandise using a new mobile app, SnapShirt!\nSnapShirt offers a simple elegance to capturing life in its purest and most organic form: from your fingertips, directly into print.\nCherished photographs of your loved ones, wild nights with friends, or even your artwork can now be printed onto TOP QUALITY T-shirts, tank tops, sweatshirts, socks, and more!\nThe process is simple \u2013 view your image directly on our mockup, snap a photo, and your all-over print product will be delivered to your door in days.\nSnapShirt aims to enhance peoples\u2019 lives by giving them the greatest creative tool for making high-quality custom clothing. It will change the way that keepsakes are both made and passed down in our modern age. SnapShirt will serve as a tool for designers looking to start their own clothing companies or help the people who simply want to share their creativity with the world. It has potential to become the go-to platform for artists, entrepreneurs, families, and more.\nThe possibilities are endless, and this is only the beginning.\nBack in 2010, we started a clothing line called Let\u2019s Rage. Despite impressive growth, there were some intense challenges. \nOur main problem was the costly process of producing new designs. This nearly stopped us in our tracks, just as it stops most artists and entrepreneurs from doing what they love, which is creating. \nWe went on a worldwide hunt to find a manufacturer that believed in our idea. However, we were told NO over a 100 times and that our idea was impossible. \nWe were able to overcome this problem by teaming up with some amazing people, solidifying our own printing equipment, and mastering the art of dye-sublimation, also known as all-over printing. \nWe have committed our professional careers to working with some of the most amazing artists, photographers, and celebrities in giving them the ability to turn their dreams and visions into wearable merchandise.  \nNow, it\u2019s your turn.\nOnce an order is placed, SnapShirt will use our sophisticated algorithm to change your photo into a print-ready file. This will be sent to our production line, then manufactured, and lastly, shipped to you! Over the years while printing for RageOn.com, we have perfected our proprietary process of dye sublimation to produce un-matched, photo-realistic quality.\nOur apparel lasts forever or your money back! We work with some of the most skilled cut & sewers and manufacturers in the world. We use a precise combination of heat, pressure, and time to change each individual clothing fiber to make the most high quality, durable, and vibrant garments you will ever see! These incredibly soft garments wick away heat and moisture, for a cool, relaxed feel :)\nLet\u2019s get creative! We will be releasing 5 exclusive shirt designs as we hit milestones! Next, we have some incredible stretch goals for both custom & Rage On designs in even more options, like: zip-up hoodies, pillows, blankets, and more!\nYour support means the world to us. Together, we\u2019ll create a tool that will modernize the way in which custom clothing is made to order in the 21st Century.\nWe understand that nothing is more important than the voice of the user. Let\u2019s build a relationship, ensure simplicity, and challenge the accepted idea of what is possible. Thank you. - The SnapShirt Team \nHere's a massive selection of rewards to choose from! Be the first to create your own custom design or choose from thousands of Rage On products at tremendous discounts! Enjoy!\n*Backers can receive custom designs or choose from thousands of products available from the following RageOn.com brands: Let's Rage, Classics, Kan D Shoppe, High Times, Cereal Killers, Costume Party, Psychedelia, Wild Life, 8bit.\nHere is a more in depth look at SnapShirt and our vision. We created an \u201cextended video\u201d that includes: more modeling scenes, a heartfelt moment of my brother and sister, both of which have since passed and whom I dedicate this app to, a sneak peak at what our party with celebrity guest reward might look like (actual party footage from one of our events), some new music, and more!\nSNAPSHIRT & MY INSPIRATION:\nOne quintessential detail of every large project I take on is that there is a greater purpose with what I\u2019m doing. For some people, it\u2019s money, for others it\u2019s success, for me, it\u2019s always been about something bigger.\nThe most substantial aspect of my motivation for creating SnapShirt is the ability to give something incredible for FREE to each and every person in this world, something that my brother, Jerry, and sister, Sarah who tragically passed would be proud of.\nOne might think that as the founder of Rage On, I would have the ability to make custom apparel. The truth is, I\u2019ve always had this ability\u2014 however, the process of making custom merchandise was extremely inefficient. Despite having hundreds of Rage On fans ask us for this feature every day, we still had to find a way to automate this system.\nI always figured there would come a time when I could make the process to create custom apparel easier for us and fans alike. Unfortunately, this time came too late and the passing of Jerry and Sarah showed me just how fragile life can be. This realization pushed me to finally build something I could give my family and friends so that they might capture the moments they spend together, while also creating a physical memento that will last a lifetime.\nThe tragic events of my personal life, the requests of Rage On fans around the world, and seeing the joy the ability to create something personalized brings to people are what continue to push me to build something revolutionary.\nSnapShirt is an app that is dedicated to everyone\u2014 every kid who dreams of starting a clothing company, every artist who dreams of making their artwork a reality, everyone who dreams of reliving a moment. Most importantly, I am dedicating SnapShirt to my brother and sister.\nMy heart, mind, and soul are committed to changing the future with SnapShirt. Thanks to this app, any funny, artsy, or cherished moment can instantly be made into virtually anything. Once SnapShirt is complete, you and I will never again have to wait to commemorate our visions\u2014 we will only need to pioneer them.\nI have been fortunate enough to work with some of the best people that I\u2019ve met in my entire life and am thankful to have these people help complete this project with me.

We have millions of fans, demand for custom apparel, and a giant demand for all over printing. We\u2019ve secured a patent pending process as well as ownership of the SnapShirt.com domain. The graphic design is done, the manufacturing equipment is there, and the workers are in place. \n\nThe risk and challenge will be to hire the best development team possible in order to build a truly innovative and simple to use app! We want it to be easy for you to make funny, entertaining, and special gifts for your friends and families! We want the artists or entrepreneurs with no start up monies to test their ideas :)\n\nWe've proven we can overcome obstacles in the past with Rage On.

It turns out that the most any one person may pledge is $10,000. This means we cannot double your pledge as we intended. You are free to increase, decrease or cancel your pledge, whatever seems right to you. Thank you all for coming on this amazing journey!\nMust read FIRST!\nNew to Kickstarter? Here's the most important thing about it: It's all or nothing. If we reach our $300,000 goal, The Christ Quake gets funded, you get to help make a great film, and everyone is happy! If we don\u2019t reach our goal, the pledges you see above instantly vanish, none of you is ever charged, you don't get to help, The Christ Quake is not funded, and everyone is sad. \nNutshell: get your DVDs -->NOW<-- or we can't make the film!\nThe Motive\nThe New Testament records unexpected, unlikely physical events forming bookends of the earthly life of Jesus. Many doubt the historicity of the Star of Bethlehem marking his birth, or the quake on the day of the cross marking his death. But if these bookends were actual historical events, would there be some evidence of them? Can we identify such evidence at 2,000 year\u2019s distance? \nThat\u2019s the fundamental question and endeavor behind two film projects. Our first film foray investigated the first event. It resulted in The Star of Bethlehem. A roaring success. Now we're moving to the second event. Instead of looking up to the heavens, we\u2019re looking down at the earth\u2014The Christ Quake is a geophysical investigation. And it, too, is proving hugely exciting! \nThe Goal\nWe hope to amaze you, perhaps blow you away with fresh revelations deep within a story you thought you knew. You, your friends, your family, your coworkers will join a journey of eye-witness discovery. Nature is blindly destroying the evidence at this moment. But, before the traces are erased, we will document a stunning story for the eyes of the world. We\u2019ll examine mysteries sometimes thought sacrosanct, beyond inquiry. If we do our job right, the rocks will \"cry out.\u201d They will give stony witness to the most well-known event in human history. This film, your film, will entertain, but always from a firm foundation of fact. It's a real-life adventure, chasing vanishing clues to a pivotal mystery before it is too late. The clock is ticking!\nThe Money\nYou're looking at this page because we need funding to make the film. So, how does that work? Our Kickstarter goal is $300,000. We\u2019re hoping for a great deal more. The more stout our budget, the more we can share with you on screen.\nYou can see we spent a good chunk of savings to make the trailer for you. I have \u201cskin in the game,\u201d as they say. I\u2019m committed to a full-quality production whatever the budget might finally be. Whatever is required of me financially, I will do. Because, this story must be told. But, good people, we need your generous help to make this film all it can be!\nThe Reward\nThere are many ways to get paid. Money is only one. Likewise, there are many types of Rewards. We've setup great Rewards for your support! But your real Reward is quite different. Here is a chance for you to enable something important. To empower a project that will have a worldwide impact. Wouldn't you like to be part of that?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHE BUDGET\nIf you\u2019re familiar with budgets for Hollywood films, you know that even simple stories normally cost millions of dollars to tell. This project will be completed with high production values, including gorgeous photography and a dramatic original orchestral score. What will be different from a studio production is our budget! We\u2019ll be on a shoestring.\n\nKickstarter projects are allowed to raise far more than their goals, and we certainly hope you dear donors will provide us seven figures to work with. But, however much you do provide, we commit that this film will be exceptionally strong for the money spent. Your support will be applied wisely, artistically, cleverly! The result will be a satisfying movie value.\n\nTECHNIC\nWe hope to break new ground, and this will require use of materials and processes which are not common. We have consulted with experts and academics for guidance in these areas. We are excited to bring to screen fascinating results of fairly esoteric technical analysis. \n\nPOLITICAL STABILITY\nFortunately, most of the Israel location footage is already in the can. But we may need to return for interviews with our intrepid Israeli academics. While this could be problematic if Israel goes to war footing, we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it.\n\nCAN WE DO IT?\nWhat makes us think we can produce this film? Our team and our experience. Our last film, The Star of Bethlehem, has repeatedly been a top-selling indie (non-studio) documentary worldwide. That includes multiple visits to the #1 spot at Amazon.\n\nIn addition to wide success of the physical DVD, Larson has spent hundreds of hours doing television and radio interviews reaching audiences of millions. He and/or the DVD have been featured on ABC, CBS, NBC, EWTN, TBN, FOX News and numerous international and radio networks. Both PBS and the BBC flew film crews to film in the Larson home. When both American and UK public networks get on planes, that's a pretty big deal. We would love to do all of this hard work again! You've just watched the teaser. You know we can do this.
